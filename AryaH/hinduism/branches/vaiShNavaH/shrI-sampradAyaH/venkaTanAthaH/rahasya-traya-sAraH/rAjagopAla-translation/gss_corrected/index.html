<p>(With due devotion) we repeat the expression of adoration to our _guru_s and likewise to their _guru_s; and among these (latter), we pray for the grace of the  Primaeval Couple (Nārāyaṇa  and Lakṣmī ), the twin _śeṣī_s<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> of all the worlds (so that they may be both the end to be attained by us and the means of attaining it).</p>

<p>Having carefully studied the beautiful hymns sung with delight in Tamil by seers, we have come to understand the real meaning of the regions of the Upaniṣads which are otherwise difficult to comprehend - seers known as Poygai Muni, Bhutamuni, Peyalvar, Kurugesan (Nammalvar) who was born on the banks of the cool Tamraparni, <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Viṣṇu chittan, the pure-minded Kulasekhara, our Pananathan, Thondaradippodi, the splendour that appeared in Mazhisai ( Tirumazhisai alvar) and the prince of M_aṅga_i armed with sword and spear for making bright the path of the Vedas throughout the world.</p>
<p>(1) The commentator says that Viṣṇuchittan stands for Viṣṇuchittan and also for his daughter Andal, the authoress of many hymns.</p>

<p>To those who venture to attain release from the bondage of <em>samsāra</em>, the ancient path indicated to us by the spotless Madhurakavi  by his own example is the only safe<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  path, for while there is Śrīkṛṣṇa, the great cowherd, who incarnated solely for the sake of his devotees to confer bliss on them, to be their refuge, to be their final goal, to stand in relation to them as mother, father, brother and so on, to change their desire for the pleasures of this world into a desire for Himself, to remove all their sins, to show them infinite compassion, to reveal the truth, and so also to bring about in them a likeness to Himself - while there is Śrīkṛṣṇa ever ready to do all this,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> he sought only the feet of the sage Satagopa (Nammālvār) who rendered in Tamil the truths contained in the Vedas which are otherwise hard to understand.</p>
<p>safe path: This means_ Bhakti_ and_ Prapatt_i which lead to _mokṣa _. _Acārya bhakt_i is called <em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em> as it leads to them.</p>
<p>Madhurakavi in his decade of Tamil verses, says that, to him, Nammalvar is the only God and that through him, he expects to derive all the benefits that men expect to have from God Himself. The path indicated by him is that of devotion to the <em>ācārya</em> for attaining <em>mukti</em> as well as other things.</p>
<p>THE ĀCĀRYA  ESSENTIAL FOR MOKṢA :</p>
<p>It is said in the _Smṛti_s: &ldquo;Kṣatrabandhu<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> , who was the worst of sinners, and Puṇḍarīka<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> , the virtuous - both of them obtained <em>mokṣa</em>  or release from bondage by virtue of their having _ācārya_s.&rdquo; It is thus declared that in the case of every one, the only means of securing <em>mokṣa</em>  is to have an <em>ācārya</em>. To the man desirous of <em>mokṣa</em> , the line of _ācārya_s is stated in the <em>śruti</em><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> to extend upward even to the Supreme <em>Bhagavān</em> for purposes of meditation.</p>
<p>Kṣatrabandhu led the life of a highwayman in a forest. He was a source of terror to the sages who lived in that forest. Once when the sage Nārada  happened to pass by him, he rushed at him with his stick. Nārada  took pity on him and asked him to find out from his wife and children whether they would share the sin he was committing, as it was done for their sake. They refused and Kṣatrabandhu realised his folly and begged to be instructed by Nārada  in the truths of religion.</p>
<p>Puṇḍarīka was a virtuous Brahmin, who, though he followed the righteous path and went on a pilgrimage to holy places, did not get a vision of God. It was only after being initiated into the <em>Ashtakshara</em> by Nārada  that he realised God.</p>
<p>The _śruti _ referred to here means - “This line of the _ācārya_s extends up to Bhagavān thus: This is his <em>ācārya</em>; his <em>ācārya</em> is so and so and so on up to the Lord&rdquo;.</p>
<p>BHAGAVĀN THE FIRST ĀCĀRYA:</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is the foremost of all _ācārya_s, as may be seen from the following passages - &ldquo;Him[^f8] <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> (Śrīkṛṣṇa) who is possessed of all excellences, who is the <em>ācārya</em><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> , father and <em>guru</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nārāyaṇa <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> who is the <em>guru</em> of all the world is also my <em>guru</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;Thou<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> art my kinsman, and Thou art my <em>guru</em>&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Thou art<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> the <em>guru</em> of all the worlds and likewise their goal&rdquo;. It is He that, at the beginning, vouchsafed the Vedas to <em>Brahma</em> and when they were stolen, brought them back to him and through him spread their knowledge in the world. It is He that blessed <em>Brahma</em>&rsquo;s sons, Sanatkumāra and others, to understand<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> all truths by themselves and to follow the path of renunciation. Through them He revealed the means of attaining sålvation. It is <em>Bhagavān</em> who, later by the agency of such great seers as Nārada , Parāśara, Śuka  and Soubaka, maintained intact the tradition of the Upaniṣads. It has been said &ldquo;Know<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> that Vyāsa who is otherwise called Kṛṣṇa Dvaipayana is the Lord Nārāyaṇa  Himself. Who else is there in the world, O Maitreya, that could compose the Mahābhārata ?&rdquo; It has also been said, “Devoutly<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> uttering the name of that great sage (Vyāsa), Bhīṣma said with folded hands &ldquo;. Into such great men as Vyāsa referred to above the Lord entered and through them published to the world great works like Mahābhārata and Sārīraka Mīmāmsā (<em>Brahma</em> <em>Sūtra_s). Further in such incarnations as Hamsa, Matsya, Hayagrīva, Nara, Nārāyaṇa , and the Gīt_ācārya</em> (Śrīkṛṣṇa), He himself stood out and revealed spiritual truths and also the means of attaining <em>mokṣa</em>  (<em>tattva</em> and <em>hita</em>). He had His invaluable teaching confirmed also through the words of such men of wisdom as Bhīṣma. It has been said<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> Nārāyaṇa  Himself dictated the whole of  the Pāncharātra&rdquo;, When this <em>Śāstra</em> which was originally taught by Him became lost, once again at the end of the Dvāpara Yuga and the beginning of the Kali Yuga, He<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> revealed it again through <em>Saṅkarṣaṇa</em> in accordance with the ordinances of the Sātvatas so that all castes, Brahmins, Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas, and Śūdras, might, after initiation by the <em>ācārya</em> with the prescribed marks (Śaṅkha and Cakra, worship and render service to the lord in the performance of their daily duties with their minds set on the Eternal. As is said in the following verse, “In the yuga of Kali<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> , the Lord Acyuta enters into the respective persons of men already born and carries out His designs&rdquo;, Nārāyaṇa  assumed a new series of ten incarnations in the forms of Parankusa (Nammalvar), Parakala (Tirum_aṅga_i) and others. In these ten avatars, just as clouds take in the water of the ocean and then pour it down in the form of rain so essential to the life of every one, the Lord gathered together those parts of the Vedas which are most significant and revealed them briefly in a language (Tamil) which is accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>Ā_cārya_ here means one who teaches Brahma Vidyā and <em>guru</em> one who teaches the Vedas. This verse was spoken by Sahadeva to those assembled at the Rajasuya sacrifice,</p>
<p>When this path of spiritual life was threatened with obstruction by heretics, open and covert, He incarnated again in the land of Agastya in the forms of many teachers of the true doctrine. Has it not been said, “The god,<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> Nārāyaṇa , Himself, assumes a mortal form out of compassion and lifts up the world submerged (in the darkness of ignorance) with the śāstras as His hand &ldquo;, and so also, &ldquo;Our<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> Lord dressed in his yellow raiment came as the <em>guru</em> out of compassion to impart the teaching of the Veda&rdquo;. In reference to this, the Maharshi, Śuka , says, “In the<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> yuga of Kali, devotees .of Nārāyaṇa  endowed with spiritual greatness, will be born here and there in large numbers in the land of the Dravidas, where flow the rivers, the Tamraparni, the Vaigai, the Palar, the holy Cauveri and the Mahānadī which runs westwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE SUCCESSION OF VAISHNAVITE ĀCĀRYAS.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code> 
</code></pre><p>Among these <em>ācārya_s. Nāthamuni was the son of <em>Iśvara_muni, and he gave us &ldquo;Nyāya Tatvam&quot;and &quot; Yoga Rahasyam.&rdquo; Since Nāthamuni received the sacred tradition from one of the spiritual descendants of Madhurakavi, and was blessed with spiritual wisdom from a study of Tiruvoymozhi and since, in his yogic contemplation, Nammalvar appeared to him and taught him the sacred lore, his <em>ācārya</em> was Nammalvar himself (though they lived at different times). Nāthamuni&rsquo;s son was <em>Iśvara</em> Bhatta. To <em>Iśvara</em> Bhatta was born Alavandar (Yāmunācārya). The works of Alavandar are the following eight :-&quot; Āgama Prāmānyam&quot;, &quot; Purusha Nirnaya&quot;, the three Siddhis, namely, “ Ātma Siddhi&quot;, &ldquo;<em>Iśvara</em> Siddhi&rdquo;, &ldquo;Samvit Siddhi&rdquo;, &ldquo;ŚrīGitārtha Sangraha&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stotram&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Tetrad of ślokas,&rdquo; Sottai Nambi was the son of Alavandar. Sottai Nambi&rsquo;s son was Ennachchan. Ennachchan had four sons, one of whom was Pillayappar. Pillayappar&rsquo;s son was Thozhappar, Thozhappar had two daughters. The chief disciples who sought the feet of Nāthamuni were eight :- Uyyakkoodar, Kurukaikavalappan, Nambi Karunakara Dasar, Erutiruvudaiyar, Thirukkannam_aṅga_i Andan, Vanamadevi Andan, Uruppattur Achan Pillai and Sokattur Alvan. Uyyakondar had five disciples; they are Manakkal Nambi, Tiruvallikkeni Pan Perumal Araiyar, Settalur Sendal_aṅga_rar, ŚrīPuṇḍarīka Dasar and Ulagapperumal N_aṅga_i. The chief disciples of Manakkal Nambi were five; they are Alavandar, Deivattukkarasu Nambi, Gomatam Tiruvinnagar  Appan, Siruppulloor Avudaiya Pillai and Acchi. Alavandar had fifteen disciples: they are - Peria Nambi, Tirukkottiyar Nambi, Tirumalai Andan, Alavandar Alvar, Tirumalai Nambi, Isandan Deivavari Andan, Siriyandan, Tirumohoor Appan, Tirumohoor Ninrar, Deivapperumal, Tirumapgai Aliyar, Pillai Tirumalirunjolai Dasar, Maraner Nambi and Alkondi. Six disciples sought the feet of Perianambi; they were :&ndash; Emperumanar (Śrī_Rāmānuja</em>), Malaikuniya Ninrar, Arya ŚrīSatagopa Dasar, Aniar_aṅga_ttamudanar, Tiruvoykulamudaiyan Pattar and Tirukkacchi Nambi. Śrī_Rāmānuja</em> learnt the meanings of the rahasyas or _mantra_s at the feet of Tirukkottiyar Nambi. He studied Tiruvoymozhi at the feet of Tirumalai Andan. He learnt Tiruvoymozhi at the feet of Alavandar Alvar and learnt also“ Stotram&quot; and the ancient tradition from him. At the feet of Tirumalai Nambi he studied the Rāmāyana. Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s writings are nine in number: Śrī Bhāṣyam, Deepam, Sāram, Vedartha Sangraham, ŚrīGita _Bhāṣya_m, Siriya Gadyam (<em>Śrī_r_aṅga</em> Gadyam), Periya Gadyam (Saranāgati Gadyam), Vaikuṇṭha   Gadyam and _Nitya_m. The names of the chief disciples of <em>Rāmānuja</em> may be learnt from the respective tradition of each reader,</p>
<p><em>BHAKTI</em> TO  ĀCĀRYA ESSENTIAL:</p>
<p>It has been said, &ldquo;The wise<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> man should bring his <em>guru</em> to the light (of renown) and should guard the sacred <em>mantra</em> with great care; from the omission to bring his <em>guru</em> to light and by revealing the <em>mantra</em>, he declines in wealth (of knowledge) and in age (spiritual standing).&rdquo; His bringing the <em>guru</em> to light and his omission to do so, it needs no saying, are due to the excess or deficiency of his devotion to his <em>guru</em>.</p>
<p>From [^f23] Kaṭha <em>śruti</em><sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  and [^f24] Jābala <em>śruti</em><sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  it is well-known that all desired knowledge arises from supreme devotion to the <em>guru</em> resembling that to <em>Bhagavān</em>. This is learnt also from the incident of Sañjaya seeing all things as if they occurred before him, as the result of his supreme devotion to his <em>guru</em> Vyāsa. From the episodes of Raikwa (and others) it is evident that the <em>guru</em> who does not reveal spiritual truths immediately even to those śiṣyas who are of excellent character will not be adversely affected in his spiritual life. If, on the other hand, the <em>guru</em> reveals these spiritual truths to any and every disciple in the belief that the <em>śiṣya</em> who has sought him must be good, he will be adversely affected; for, in such cases, it is said that the sins of the disciple become also the sins of the <em>guru</em> This may be seen from the story of <em>Brahma</em>. Without careful enquiry (into his fitness) he revealed truths to Indra. As a consequence <em>Brahma</em> forgot his divine knowledge and had to be taught again by <em>Bhagavān</em> through the agency of Nārada , <em>Brahma</em>&rsquo;s very disciple. In the <em>śloka</em> referred to above, the meaning that, by not bringing the <em>guru</em> to light and by improper bringing of the <em>mantra</em> to light, the man suffers decline respectively in wealth and in age is primarily intended owing to appropriateness and the support of Jabala and Kaṭha <em>śruti</em> s. There is nothing wrong in interpreting the <em>śloka</em> as meaning also &ldquo;He who omits to bring his <em>guru</em> to light and brings the <em>mantra</em> to light will suffer decline both in wealth (the wealth of spiritual knowledge ) and in age (spiritual standing).&rdquo; It follows from this that a man should bring his <em>guru</em> to light by way of the overflow of his supreme devotion to him under all conditions and that the sacred <em>mantra</em> should not, for the sake of any material advantage, be revealed to the fickle-minded who do not possess all the qualities prescribed for a disciple. If the <em>mantra</em> is revealed to undeserving persons, its great value which is like that of a casket made of rubies containing a precious jewel will suffer and the <em>guru</em>&rsquo;s spiritual greatness will also be adversely affected. The word <em>guru</em> refers, by implication, to the earlier _guru_s also in the line of ascent extending up to <em>Bhagavān</em>. Or it may mean _guru_s in general. Similarly the word <em>mantra</em> refers also to the meanings of the <em>mantra</em> and other secret doctrines connected with it. As a rule or <em>vidhi</em>, it has been laid down that, whenever a man meditates on these secret meanings or mysteries, he should also meditate on the lineal succession of _guru_s. It has also been said: “As an <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> expiation for having conversed with those that are forbidden as unfit (for conversation), we should meditate on the virtuous.&quot; By the words &quot; the virtuous &ldquo;, this <em>śloka</em> refers primarily to the. _ācārya_s.</p>

<p>Though the <em>jīva</em> is ever dear to the Lord (<em>Śaurī</em>) like the gem Kaustubha, he fails to obtain the paramount supremacy of service (to the Lord) owing to his ignorance; but being favoured with His glance at a turn in the tide of fortune, he attains to a knowledge of his real nature ( as one entirely dependent on God and existing only for Him ). This becomes possible by virtue of the teaching imparted to him by his _guru_s and thus he succeeds in saving himself.</p>
<p>THE HERITAGE OF THE JĪVĀTMĀ.</p>
<p>How the <em>Jīvātmā</em> lost this heritage.</p>
<p>The individual soul (<em>Jīvātmā</em>) has been declared in the different _śāstra_s as being dear to the Lord of Lakṣmī  even like the gem Kaustubha; he has been called the prince, the Lord&rsquo;s son, His disciple, His attendant, His dependant existing solely for Him <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> (<em>śeṣa</em> )<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> and His servant. The Lord is his <em>śeṣī</em> for whose purposes (alone) he exists by his very nature. The Lord is the ruler of the eternal Sūris, who are ever free from ignorance. He is possessed of unsurpassed auspicious qualities; He loves us as He does the lotus-born Lakṣmī . He is the Lord of men on earth and of the Sūris in Heaven. As has been said “<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> The Lord of the Universe dwells in the Supreme Region of Vaikuṇṭha   along with Lakṣmī ,&rdquo; &quot; <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> Thou art ever with Lakṣmī  adorned with shining bracelets&rdquo;. He dwells in the pure world of śuddhasattva ( <em>nitya</em> <em>vibhūti</em>) along with His great queen and is seated on a couch, as described in such places as the Koushitaki Brāhmana, in a hall of splendour which is lit up with gems and stands on a thousand pillars, in the eternal and changeless city called by names like Ayodhya; for instance, it is said, &ldquo;It<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> is called Ayodhya and Aparajita and is beyond the world of <em>svarga</em>.&rdquo; The Lord is seated on the bed of the serpent called <em>śeṣa</em> who is like an umbrella to the Lord when He moves about and like a throne whenever he is seated. He has been described &ldquo;as the Lord&rsquo;s abode, His bed, and His seat.&rdquo; <em>Śeṣa</em>, the serpent, is ever bent on serving the Lord in all places, at all times, and in all situations and enjoys rendering service of all kinds in varied embodied forms. As he is thus fulfilling the purposes of the Lord and has no other aims in life, he is, indeed, a real and unconditional <em>Śeṣa</em> and the name <em>Śeṣa</em> fits him in every way. The Lord shines on the bed of <em>Śeṣa</em> as the Supreme and ever-youthful Sovereign of Heaven. It is His gracious desire that all souls should enjoy His blissful state and attain their goal. The <em>Jīva</em>   is thus entitled, by his. essential nature, to the service of His Master as his birthright in as high a degree as the eternal Sūris themselves who have the endless bliss of serving Him. But sunk in the sleep of beginningless Maya, he has fallen into the wilderness of matter (<em>prakṛti</em>), has had repeated births in quick succession, has lost the primary aim of existence, has found no comfort or consolation, has lost the splendour of big real nature owing to evil desires and passions and is without a true knowledge concerning <em>tattva</em> (that which should be known for salvation and <em>hita</em> (the means of attaining it). Well has it been said, &ldquo;<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> Trudging along the many thousand pathways of <em>samsāra</em> consisting of cycles of births and deaths, he has become deluded and exhausted and is covered with the dust of tendencies left by impressions in the mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Sutra or aphorism in Purva Mimamsa says: “ That is called a <em>śeṣa</em> which serves the purpose of another (and that other is called a <em>śeṣī</em> ) (e. g.) In a sacrifice, the grains of rice are <em>śeṣa</em>
to the sacrifice which is <em>śeṣī</em>  because they serve the purpose of the sacrifice.</p>
<p>The parable of the prince brought up by huntsmen.</p>
<p>The condition of the <em>Jīva</em>   in <em>samsāra</em> has been aptly described in the following parable :- A certain king went out a-hunting with the women of the harem and was keenly absorbed in the sport. The little prince lost his way even before he knew who he was and was brought up in a hamlet by tribesmen who found him wandering about (helpless). As he grew older, he identified himself with the people who brought him up and thought that he, too, was a savage tribesman, learnt their language as if it were his own and, like their own sons, ate their food and lived their life. Without knowing anything about the enjoyments, the code of conduct and the traditions of his birth, he found his good and his evil, his joys and sorrows, in extremely gruesome things totally different from enjoyments befitting a prince. Though there were some wise and sage-like men who knew him as a prince, he was not accessible to them and lived like a savage without even the means of being born in a better life after death, owing to life-long savagery due to erroneous notions. The story is told of two parrots born of the same parents. One of them was brought up by holy men and the other by tanners who ate cow&rsquo;s flesh. The former said, &ldquo;I was brought up by sages and he was brought up by tanners. I hear, every day, the speech of the sages and he bears the speech of tanners. You have yourself seen the difference between my speech and the speech of the other bird. Goodness and wickedness are the result of (good and bad) association (respectively)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Such was the condition of the prince who lost his real character and acquired a different nature. Similar is the state of the <em>Jīva</em>   who, by identifying himself with the body, loses his real character and assumes a different nature. In the case of the prince (of the parable) some generous benefactors who were aware of his real birth (in a royal family) made up their minds to save him (from savagery) by some means or other. They removed from his mind his false identification of himself with the tribesmen and by discipline and training, physical and spiritual, enabled him to become gradually fit for princely enjoyments and the means of attaining them. They made him realise, both by precept and by example, what befitted him as a prince in matters connected with character and conduct and thus rendered him capable of hating the mean and gruesome enjoyments of savage life and created in him the power of discrimination by which he could choose and prefer the supremely refined aims and enjoyments of his princely station.</p>
<p>The applicability of the parable to the <em>Jīva</em>.</p>
<p>In the same way, some generous benefactors who are introduced to the <em>Jīva</em>   by parents and the like help him realise that <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> “the soul is neither God nor man nor beast nor tree, and that these differences of body and shape are due to <em>karma</em>.&quot; They enable him to understand that the soul is different from the body and adopt the proper means to make him pursue the goal or aim suited to his essential nature and to follow the path that would lead to it. They create in him qualities and modes of conduct found in men endowed with the splendour of wisdom and not in men who are so absorbed in their bodies as to forget their soul and they bring him to a position in which he is capable of distinguishing between what should be rejected and what is worthy of adoption, Now in the parable, on seeing for themselves the prince&rsquo;s innate fitness, the transformation wrought in him by some worthy men and his intelligence, some teachers being directed by the Supreme Master who is all compassion and being themselves highly compassionate appear before him and reveal his true parentage to him as also what is highly desirable to one in his station and the means of attaining it. It has been said, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s love, good deeds done by chance, the gracious glance of God, freedom from hate, willingness to learn and the conversation of good men - these are six causes that lead to the acquisition of an <em>ācārya</em>.&rdquo; Those good men in the parable would strive in every possible way to bring about a longing for re-union in the mind of the prince and the king. So also with the <em>Jīva</em>  . His _guru_s reveal to the <em>Jīva</em> the intimate relation existing between him and Nārāyaṇa , the Lord of Lakṣmī , who rules with His sceptre the earth surrounded by the <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> turbulent ocean and the world of Vaikuṇṭha   without even the least exception. Do not the _śāstra_s say, &ldquo;The soul is neither God nor men, neither beast nor tree. Its essential nature is knowledge and bliss and it is entirely dependent on the Supreme Being and exists solely for His purposes (<em>Śeṣa</em>)&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;The souls are indeed the servants by nature of the Supreme<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> Being ?&rdquo; These _guru_s try earnestly to help the <em>Jīva</em>   attain the Lord and feel that his attainment of the glory of <em>mokṣa</em>  would give them as much delight as the sovereignty of Vaikuṇṭha   (<em>Nitya</em> <em>vibhūti</em>) and of the whole earth (līlā vibhūti). They have as much love to him as the cow to its calf on the day of its birth when, out of loving kindness, it gives it milk. So with the help of words, neither excessive nor defective, they desire to remove his ignorance, his doubts, and his erroneous notions. As stated in the <em>śloka</em> . &ldquo;He<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  who teaches the truth concerning <em>cit</em> (sentient being) <em>acit</em> (non-sentient matter) and <em>Iśvara</em> and their essential character etc.&rdquo;, they (the _guru_s ) teach him the true nature of the Lord who is the ruler of sentient and non-sentient things that are ruled by Him, of their respective character and of their mutual relations to one another, of enjoyment or experience in <em>samsāra</em> (including <em>svarga</em>) and of release from that bondage and of the respective means for attaining them (one to be rejected and the other to be adopted), of the routes by which the soul travels to its destined abodes and of the obstacles, expressed and unexpressed, that stand in the way of salvation; for these are matters that should be known to every one desirous of release.</p>
<p>All these things that should be known to every <em>mumukṣu</em> are found concisely stated in ‘the three mysteries or secrets&rsquo; (_mantra_s) which are, as it were, the quintessence of all passages treating of the <em>Jīva</em>   and <em>Iśvara</em> and which contain the best part of all the main doctrines.</p>

Sach _Jīva_s are indeed rare and they become the repositories of all forms of wealth (like discrimination and freedom from desires) extending up to the sovereignty enjoyed by the freed souls in <em>mokṣa</em>  (viz, the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> and service to Him).</p>

or tastes and aptitudes and <em>prakṛti sambandha</em> or association with matter.</p>

<p>(2) THE CHAPTER ON THE DETERMINATION OF WHAT IS BEST ? page77</p>
<p>NOTE &ldquo;The Three Mysteries&rdquo; have been occasionally referred to in previous chapters. ŚrīVedānta desika presumes that everyone of his readers knows what they are. It is just possible that some of them are not in the know of these mysteries. So a brief account may be necessary of these _mantra_s.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One of them is called aṣṭākṣara or Tiru_mantra_ It consists of eight syllables in Sanskrit which are in the form of three words. The first word which consists of a single syllable is Om, which is made of three parts a, u and m or akara, ukara and makara. The second word is <em>namo</em> which, when there is no sandhi, is <em>namas</em>. It means &lsquo;Obeisance&rsquo; or adoration! The third word is Nārāyaṇaaya which means &quot; to Nārāyaṇa &ldquo;. Nārāyaṇāya is the dative (the fourth case ) singular form of Nārāyaṇa . The <em>mantra</em>, as a whole, means &ldquo;Adoration to Nārāyaṇa  ! &rsquo;&rsquo; or &ldquo;I offer my adoration to Nārāyaṇa .&rdquo; (This is the meaning appearing at first sight.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another <em>mantra</em> or mystery is the “last&rdquo; <em>śloka</em>  of Śrīkṛṣṇa&rsquo;s teaching in Bhagavadgītā usually called the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> .</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It means: “Having given up rites or activities as means to secure <em>mokṣa</em> , surrender thyself to me alone&rdquo;. (This is the first half of the <em>śloka</em> .)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will free thee from all sins; despair not.&quot;(This is the second half of the <em>śloka</em> .)</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Yet another mystery or <em>mantra</em> is usually called <em>Dvayam</em>. It consists of two parts; the first part means &ldquo;I seek refuge at the feet of Nārāyaṇa  who is ever inseparable from Śrī or Lakṣmī &ldquo;. The second part means: &ldquo;I offer my adoration to Nārāyaṇa  and <em>Śrī</em>&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>These, then, are the &ldquo;three mysteries or _mantra_s&rdquo; which are the best of what should be known and meditated upon. The fuller and more subtle meanings of these _mantra_s are explained in later chapters. )&ndash;Tr.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>श्रुति–पथ–विपरीतं क्ष्वेळ–कल्पं, श्रुतौ च</p>
<p>प्रकृति–पुरुष–भोग–प्रापकांशो न पथ्यः ।</p>
<p>तदिह विबुधगुप्तं मृत्युभीता विचिन्व-</p>
<p>न्त्युपनिषदमृताब्धेरुत्तमं सारमार्याः ॥</p>
<p>What is opposed to the way of the Vedas is like poison; even in the Srutīs or Vedas, those parts which treat of the means of attaining the enjoyment of material goods (<em>Prakṛti</em> bhoga) and of the enjoyment of one&rsquo;s own atma or self (purusha-bhoga) or (Kaivalya) are not salutary. Therefore the wise who are afraid of the cycle of births and deaths ( <em>samsāra</em>) seek the best essence extracted out of the ocean of nectar called the Upaniṣads which has been guarded with great care by sages (i.e.) previous _ācārya_s for our benefit</p>
<p>THE GREAT VALUE OF THE THREE _MANTRA_S:</p>
<p>Among these three mysteries (<em>mantra_s), Tiru_mantra</em> or aṣṭākṣara has<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> been stated to contain everything within itself and, if it is known, the meaning of everything becomes known; the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> , which says (in its first half) “having given up all rites and activities as means of attaining <em>mokṣa</em> , surrender thyself to me&rdquo;, establishes that the adoption of the single means taught in it, viz, self-surrender (or s&rsquo;aranagati) would secure the benefits of all other means prescribed elsewhere; the <em>Dvayam</em>, as has been stated in Kaṭha <em>śruti</em>  and elsewhere, is capable of making a man perfect in the discharge of all his duties even if it is uttered only once. Therefore these three mysteries alone are of value to the seeker after salvation. It has been said, “One should ignore what is of no value, what is only of slight value, and, likewise, what is valuable and even what is more valuable. It is only what is most valuable that one should prefer in the śāstra , like ambrosia in the Ocean,</p>
<p>THE ONLY PRAMĀṆA IN REGARD TO MOKṢA  AND</p>
<p>THE MEANS OF ATTAINING IT IS ŚĀSTRA:</p>
<p>The ultimate goal or aim of life (<em>puruṣārtha</em> ) (namely, <em>mokṣa</em> ) and the means of attaining it are not capable of being understood from sense perception (pratyaksha) or (anumāna) inference. As stated in such passages as &ldquo;It is from the <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> śāstra  that I know <em>Janārdana</em> &ldquo;, &ldquo;Therefore<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> in determining what <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup> ought to be done and what ought not be done, the only authority that  should guide you is śāstra &quot; and &ldquo;He who is well <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup> versed in the Agamas or Vedas will attain <em>Brahman</em>&rdquo;, the only <em>pramāṇa</em> that exists for our guidance is sabda or what is revealed in the śāstra s. In this context it has been said, “What are<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup> to be known are many and endless; the time (at our disposal) is short; the hindrances are many; therefore prefer only what is valuable, like the swan that separates the milk from the water with which it is mixed.&rdquo; The word &lsquo;valuable&rsquo; really means &rsquo; most valuable&rsquo;, because it refers to what is always and unconditionally valuable. The śāstras of those who are outside the pale of the Vedas (like Buddhists ) and likewise of heretics (like Advaitins) are not valuable at all and are therefore to be ignored. In the first part of the Veda, the portion which treats of rites leading to the attainment of worldly goods is only of very slight value and hence not to be resorted to. That part which treats of the attainment of the good things of <em>svarga</em> after death, though it may appear valuable to somé as leading to fruits higher than worldly goods is of no use, as, in the final estimate, they are based on sorrow and have other objectionable features. That part, too, which treats of the realisation of one&rsquo;s own soul and the means thereof, though a little more valuable, is not of value to those who desire the enjoyment of the Supreme Self. To the man of discerning wisdom, the part of the Veda which treats of the Supreme <em>Brahman</em>, the attainment of <em>Brahman</em> and the means thereof is the most valuable, and is therefore to be preferred.</p>
<p>( Alternative meaning): &ldquo;what should be attained and what should be rejected ( see Tatparya
Chandrika: Gita; XVI: 24)</p>
<p>THE THREE MYSTERIES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT.</p>
<p>Even there, the three Mysteries (_mantra_s) which are, as it were, an epitome of the truths that ought to be known and of the means of attaining salvation, which are the distinctive, unique and exclusive doctrines (of our viśiṣṭādvaita  system) are invaluable and therefore to be most preferred. As stated in the <em>śloka</em>  <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup> &quot; From the many and great _śāstra_s, the wise man should choose only that which is most valuable as the bee takes in the honey from the flowers,&rdquo; the <em>jīva</em> who thirsts for <em>mokṣa</em>  should prefer as invaluable these three mysteries (mantrās.)</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>अमैया इवै ऎन्नुमासैयिनाल् अऱुमूण्ड्रुलगिल्</p>
<p>सुमैयान कल्विगळ् सूऴवन्दालुम् तॊगैयिवैयॆण्ड्रु</p>

<p>As if what has been already learnt is not enough, the eighteen subjects of study may confront us like burdens (on the intellect); but they add only to the number (and are of no use). Therefore the _ācārya_s of our system (Visiştādvaitam) have, with wise discrimination, given us what the <em>Nitya</em>-sūris whose wisdom never languishes (literally who never wink&rdquo;) speak of in exalted terms. namely, the &rsquo;eight&rsquo; (aṣṭākṣara) and the two&rsquo; (viz) the <em>Dvayam</em> and the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> ,</p>

<p>The basic <em>mantra</em> (mūlamantra) called aṣṭākṣara shines conspicuously in the Upaniṣads (literally, the end of the various branches of the Veda). If there is any one endowed with discriminating wisdom who has understood from that <em>mantra</em> the truth about his essential nature, and if he spends all his time in uttering the <em>Dvayam</em> which, even at a single utterance, can produce the fruition of the desire for the ultimate goal of life and if he has also absolute faith in the means of salvation taught with compassion in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>  by Śrīkṛṣṇa who, for his sport or liIa, became the charioteer, and, who is the crest jewel, as it were, of the Vedas - if there is any such person (at all) in the world, he will be the leader of all our hosts.</p>

<p>When <em>Bhagavān</em> is seen in the mirror of the &lsquo;vyāpaka<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>  _mantra_s, which disclose His all-pervasiveness, one will see that the universe (which we perceive with our senses) is absolutely dependent on Him for its existence and continuance and likewise for its activity and the fruit or result arising from it; since the universe is supported and controlled by Him and is also solely for the fulfilment of His purposes, one will understand that it is the body of the Primaeval Creator. By realizing this relationship of the universe being the body of the Creator, one is enabled to reach the heart of the śrutis, which were not composed by any one and which have the deepest significance.</p>

<p>WHAT IS MEANT BY PRATITANTRA? THE MEANING</p>
<p>OF ŚARĪRA -ŚARĪRI BHĀVA:</p>
<p>The word Pratitantra means a doctrine or feature which is peculiar and distinctive to a certain (philosophical or religious) system exclusive of all others. Here it may be asked what the doctrine that is most important and unique to our system of Vedānta  is. It is the doctrine which maintains that the relationship between <em>Iśvara</em> and the world of sentient beings and non sentient things is that between the soul and the body. (Another is the doctrine that every word, whatever its ordinary denotation may be, such as &lsquo;cow&rsquo; &ldquo;man&rdquo; and the like, refers ultimately to <em>Iśvara</em> who is within them as their innermost soul).</p>
<p>WHAT IS A SARĪRA AND WHAT IS A SARIRI :</p>
<p><em>Iśvara</em> is called the inner self or soul (Sariri), because as long as they exist, He is, in regard to sentient and non-sentient substances (dravya), their support (<em>ādhāra</em>), their controller or ruler (<em>niyantā</em>) and their Lord or Master (<em>śeṣī</em> ) for whose purposes they exist. Sentient beings and non-sentient things form His body, since, with regard to Him, they stand as substances supported by Him, controlled by Him, and existing solely for the fulfilment of His purposes, throughout their existence. <em>Iśvara</em> is called the Supporter and the Controller or Ruler of all sentient beings and non-sentient things, because from His swarupa or essential nature and His <em>saṅkalpa</em> or will, they derive their existence, continuance and activities as <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> befitting<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup> each of these two (<em>svarūpa</em> and <em>saṅkalpa</em>). It may be asked how this could be. Just as <em>Iśvara</em> is the abode, <em>āśraya</em> or <em>ādhāra</em> (support) of the attributes which define His essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em> viz. Satyam, Jñānan, Anantam and the like) and of the other qualities possessed by Him with His essential nature so defined (qualities like compassion and accessibility), He is also the inseparable and direct support, (āsraya or ādhāra) of all substances (sentient and non-sentient) other than Himself. He is also the support, through these substances ((i.e.) indirectly), of the qualities that pertain to them. There are some who hold that <em>Iśvara</em> is the support, through the _jīva_s, of the bodies supported by the _jīva_s. Some _ācārya_s say (on the other hand) that both directly by His essential Nature and indirectly through the _jīva_s, He is the support of these bodies.</p>
<p>As befitting each of these two - By His <em>svarūpa</em>, He is the cause of their existence and continuance; this is because of being their support; by His Sankalpa or will also, He is the cause of their existence, continuance and activities; this is because of being their controller.</p>
<p><em>IŚVARA</em>&lsquo;S SUPPORT BY HIS <em>SVARŪPA</em> AND</p>
<p>BY HIS WILL.</p>
<p>In relation to <em>Iśvara</em>, all (substances ), sentient and non. sentient, are attributes that are inseparable from Him (Aprithaksiddha vi_śeṣa_ṇas). Therefore their existence and the like depend entirely on the existence of their support (i. e.) Isvara. The existence of all things is also dependent on His will. Those of them that have only a temporary existence take their origin from a temporary will or <em>saṅkalpa</em> of His and those of them that are eternal (like Vaikuṇṭha   and the sūris ) exist for ever by His eternal will. This distinction has been stated by one who is worthy of respect for his learning in the (following) <em>śloka</em>  :-&ldquo;The <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup> existence of all things is only by Thy will. Of these some are eternally dear to Thee and are hence eternal and even these eternal beings or things are entirely dependent on Thee for their essential nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the continuance of a thing is merely the continuity of its existence, everything, (i. e.) existence and continuance, is dependent on His will. There are heavy substances that are stated in the śāstras to be supported by <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s will. For instance, the following <em>śloka</em>  says: &ldquo;The Heavens,<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> the sky with the moon, the sun and the stars, the different quarters, the earth, the great ocean - all these are supported by the might of the Supreme Being, <em>Vāsudeva</em>.” It is stated here that, in regard to keeping these heavy things in their respective places without their falling away from them, the existence, continuance and activity of these things depend on <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s will. The word &lsquo;supported&rsquo; (in the <em>śloka</em> ) means “is dependent on His will&rsquo;. If it be asked how, when every substance is supported by His will, the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of <em>Iśvara</em> can have anything to do with them, the answer is that the will of the Supreme Being ordains that these objects should be supported by His essential Nature (<em>svarūpa</em>). That all tbings are dependent on <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s essential nature and also on <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s will. In the world (of daily life) also, we find that the body is supported by the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of the soul or self and also by the will of the self. Since the body exists from the time of the entry of the soul into it and perishes or disintegrates when the soul leaves it, it is known to be supported by the <em>svarūpa</em> or essential nature of the soul. In the state of dreamless sleep (<em>suṣupti</em>) and the like, when the will of the self is dormant, the body continues to exist without any deterioration; so its existence then is clearly dependent on the <em>svarūpa</em> of the self and not its will (or <em>saṅkalpa</em>). In the waking state, when the body is kept from falling, it is sustained by the will or <em>saṅkalpa</em> of the soul. When the existence of the body is dependent only on the <em>svarūpa</em> of the self or its essential nature, it is said to be supported (adheyatva) by the latter; and when the existence depends on the will or <em>saṅkalpa</em> it is said to be controlled and directed by the latter (niyāmyatva).</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ŚEṢA-ŚEṢI  BHĀVA?</p>
<p><em>Iśvara</em> is said to be the <em>śeṣin</em> of all things, because they exist solely for the fulfilment of His purposes. They are His _śeṣa_s, The following <em>śloka</em>  explains how <em>Iśvara</em> is the <em>śeṣin</em> of all:  The <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup> Utterance of the Upaniṣads is to the effect that the Lord takes in both sentient and non-sentient things for the fulfilment of His own purposes, by being the cause of their existence, their continuance and their control. In regard to (one of the two (i.e.) the sentient being), Thou art both the end to be attained (upēya) and the means of attaining it (<em>upāya</em>). This is Thy essential nature and not an adventitious quality of Thine. Therefore, O Thou that hast Thy repose in _Śrī_r_aṅga_m, I seek refuge in Thee without any selfish interest.”</p>
<p>THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE.</p>
<p>Sentient beings and non-sentient things exist not for their own sake but for the fulfilment of God&rsquo;s purposes. Their nature is ever to exist for somebody else (i.e.) the Lord. In using them for His own purposes, His glory is manifested. This is being <em>śeṣī</em> . &ldquo;But&rdquo; it may be asked, &ldquo;what does this sentient being gain by being supported and controlled by Him and by existing solely for his master ?&rdquo; The answer is as follows: By having the Lord as his <em>ādhāra</em>, the <em>Jīva</em>   becomes an inseparable attribute of the Lord even like His own attributes <em>Jñāna</em> and <em>śakti</em> or power. By being the Lord&rsquo;s <em>śeṣa</em> and by having the Lord as his <em>śeṣī</em> , the <em>jīva</em> acquires a taste for an ultimate goal or end which is appropriate to his essential nature, for every being aims at a goal or end suited to the conception held by it about its nature. By being the <em>śeṣa</em> of the Lord and by having Him as his controller and ruler, he comes to know the specific means or <em>upāya</em> (viz <em>Bhagavān</em>) of attaining the goal or ultimate aim suited to his essential nature. This <em>upāya</em> or means (is the Lord Himself who is the only proper means for the attainment of this end and who) does not require any auxiliary aid for helping Him. From what has been said above, it follows that this sentient being has no other support, exists for nobody else, and has no other protector than <em>Bhagavān</em>.</p>
<p>THE PRESENCE OF THESE IDEAS IN THE THREE</p>
<p>MYSTERIES OR _MANTRA_S.</p>
<p>If it be asked how this idea is contained in the first mystery (i.e.) aṣṭākṣara, the answer is as follows:- The word  ‘Nārāyaṇa’ is a compound word which means either &ldquo;He to whom Nārāh are a resting place (ayana )&rdquo;, in which case it is a possessive adjective compound (bahuvrihi samāsa), or &quot; the resting place of nārāh (i.e.) men&rdquo;, in which case, it is a determinative compound in which the first part Nārāh is in the genitive case (i.e.) nārānām + ayanam ( which is qualified by the genitive.) The compound word Nārāyaṇa  interpreted in these two ways establishes His being the support (of everything) and of His pervading it. From this it would follow that the <em>jīva</em>, in his essential nature, has no other support and is pervaded by no other than Nārāyaṇa  The words Om and Namo which precede Narayanāya imply that the <em>jīva</em> exists for Nārāyaṇa  and is entirely dependent upon Him for protection. It would follow therefrom that the <em>jīva</em> serves no other purpose than that of Nārāyaṇa  and that he has no other refuge or protector-than He.</p>
<p>In <em>Dvayam</em> which is, as it were, a gem of a <em>mantra</em> and which discloses the activity or process of self surrender (<em>prapatti</em>) to the Lord, the first part reveals that the <em>jīva</em> has no other refuge than Nārāyaṇa  and the second that he exists for no purposes other than those of Nārāyaṇa , while, in both parts, the idea of the <em>jīva</em> having no other support (<em>ādhāra</em>) is evident (from the word Nārāyaṇa).</p>
<p>Similarly these ideas may be discerned in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>  also, either directly and explicitly in the words themselves or by implication or purport arising indirectly from the meaning of the words.</p>
<p>The <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>  declares that <em>Bhagavān</em> is Himself the already existing and established means (siddha <em>upāya</em>) for attaining Him, for He is ever ready to help us to attain Him, and that, in order to secure His help, we have yet to accomplish or adopt a means (sādhya <em>upāya</em>), which is self-surrender (s&rsquo;aranāgati) to the lord. This <em>Sādhyopāya</em>, namely, self surrender or <em>śaraṇāgati</em> is performed by uttering the <em>Dvayam</em> and the thoughts that we should bear in mind at that time are concisely disclosed in the Tiru_mantra_ or <em>Aṣṭākṣara</em> as in a little mirror reflecting bigger forms.</p>
<p>The (two) meanings of the first word OM (<em>aum</em>) are illustrated in Arjuna&rsquo;s chariot and in the (famous) <em>śloka</em>  of the Rāmāyana which says:- <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> Rāma went first. Sītā walked in the middle, and Lakṣmaṇa, bow in hand, walked behind, following them. The word OM is constituted of three parts a, u, and m; a, which is seen first, means <em>Bhagavān</em>, the Protector or Saviour, who is seen first in Arjuna&rsquo;s chariot, and m means the <em>jīva</em>, Arjuna, the object of protection who is seen afterwards; a means, only; it may also</p>
<p>mean Lakṣmī . When u refers to Śrī or Lakṣmī , the two <em>śeṣī</em> s, <em>Bhagavān</em> and Śrī appear first and the <em>śeṣa</em> appears afterwards. In the <em>śloka</em>  quoted from the Rāmāyana, first we think of the Saviour, then we think of Lakṣmī  and then of Lakshmane who is their <em>śeṣa</em>. So also is <em>praṇava</em> or <em>aum</em>; a, u and m refer respectively to the Saviour, Lakṣmī  who pleads for the <em>jīva</em> and then the <em>jīva</em> who requires their protection. The second word in Tiru_mantra_, viz, <em>namo</em> or namah means &ldquo;adoration&rdquo; or &ldquo;I adore&rdquo;, This brings out explicitly, by the word itself, the idea of the <em>jīva</em> being entirely dependent on the Lord. Since <em>Bhagavān</em> is pleased with those who serve His devotees (Bhagavatās), it is implicitly stated in the word <em>namas</em> that we depend also on Bhāgavatas and are subject to their direction and control. Illustrations of these may be found respectively in the lives of the devotees, Bharata and Satrughna (the former of whom delighted in obeying and serving Rāma and the latter in obeying and serving Bharata).</p>
<p>The third word in Tiru_mantra_ is Nārāyanāya, which is the dative or fourth case of Nārāyaṇa . (The word Narayan, has two meanings: (1) the resting place or refuge of naras or living beings and (2) He who has naras (living beings) as His abode or resting place. This means that the <em>jīva</em> depends for his very existence on Nārāyaṇa  and that Nārāyaṇa&rsquo;s glory (vibhūti) cannot manifest itself without the <em>jīva</em>. It has therefore been well said: &ldquo;I do <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup> not exist without thee, O Nārāyaṇa, nor dost Thou without me&rdquo;. Nārāyaṇāya, which means for Nārāyaṇa &rsquo; should be construed along with some such word as <em>syām</em> or_ bhaveyam_ and the meaning would then be, “ May I exist for Nārāyaṇa &ldquo;! These meanings of the word Nārāyaṇa  may be seen illustrated in all created beings of Kosala (who could not bear their existence without ŚrīRana and who departed this world along with Him, and in ŚrīRāma, too, who departed with them.</p>
<p>The first word, <em>Praṇava</em> (<em>aum</em>), signifies that m, the <em>jīva</em>, exists only for a (aya) and the second word <em>namo</em> that the <em>jīva</em> depends on <em>Bhagavān</em>. His existence is for <em>Bhagavān</em> and His devotees, to the latter of whom the <em>śeṣa_tva extends as its ultimate limit, and he depends absolutely on <em>Bhagavān</em> and His devotees In the light of this interpretation, the third word Nārāyanāya has, for its purport, the goal of the <em>jīva</em>, vis, <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service to the Lord and His devotees. This service may be seen illustrated in an active form in that of Lakṣmaṇa and in a passive form in the sandals<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>  of Śrī Rāma which were an incarnation of Lakṣmaṇa or Adi_śeṣa</em> and which left Rāma&rsquo;s feet to go along with His devotee, Bharata. (In these instances) the service is such as would be pleasing to the <em>śeṣī</em> (namely, <em>Bhagavān</em>).</p>
<p>Lakṣmaṇa is a partial incarnation of Adisesha and Adisesha serves the Lord as His sandals. His bed, and so on. Therefore the sandals of Rama are, in a sense, the incarnation of Lakṣmaṇa.</p>
<p>All this elucidation and illustration of the meaning of Tiru_mantra_ were vouchsafed by Śrī Appullar. The implicit and explicit meanings contained in <em>Dvayam</em> and the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em>  should be understood on the same lines.</p>
<p>IN REGARD TO BEINGS ENDOWED WITH</p>
<p>INTELLI GENCE, _ŚEṣA_TVA MEANS DĀSATVA:</p>
<p>In these mysteries <em>Iśvara</em> is disclosed as the <em>śeṣī</em> (i.e.) as one for whom everything else exists. He stands in the relation of <em>śeṣī</em> to both sentient beings and non-sentient things in common, In relation to non-sentient things He is <em>śeṣī</em> , because they exist for His purposes. In relation to sentient beings or _jīva_s endowed with intelligence, He is s&rsquo;eshī in the special sense of being Swami (i.e.) Master whom it is their duty to serve, and this is the manner in which we should understand while uttering the mantrās. Our being <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord we share in common with non-sentient things but we are _śeṣa_s in the special sense also of being His servants (dāsāh).</p>
<p>The ordinary relationship of <em>Śeṣa</em> and <em>śeṣin</em> between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>Bhagavān</em> is disclosed in the first syllable of the <em>aṣṭākṣara</em>, viz, <em>aum</em> where the a, the first member, is in the dative case ‘aya’, though the termination has dropped. It means for a or <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;. The specific form of being _śeṣa_s which applies only to _jīva_s (and not to non-sentient things ) and which is really being the servants of the Lord ( dāsas) and of His being the Swami or Master is revealed in the purport or implication. So also in the word &lsquo;Nārāyaṇāya&rsquo; there is the general relationship of the seshin towards all things and the specific relationship of Swami or Master which obtains in the case of jivās. Here the goal of usefulness to the Lord, which is the result of the general attitude of the <em>śeṣa</em>, becomes the goal of service or <em>kaiṅkarya</em> to the Lord, owing to the <em>jīva</em> being His servant or dāsa. Thus by being the <em>śeṣin</em>, <em>Iśvara</em> attains a unique glory and as a consequence of His being the Swami or Master, this glory consists in the enjoyment of service which is His <em>puruṣārtha</em>. <em>Iśvara</em> is responsible for the protection of His servants and has also the power to do so, whereas the <em>jīva</em> or <em>Cetana</em> is not responsible for his own protection nor has he the ability to protect himself. This is due to <em>Iśvara</em> being the unconditional (nirupadhika) <em>śeṣī</em> and the unconditional Director and Ruler. Owing to their being the unconditional _śeṣa_s and their being subject unconditionally to His control, it becomes, indeed, the responsibility of the owner to protect what belongs to Him and of the strong to protect the weak. <em>Iśvara</em>, however, makes up his mind to protect the <em>jīva</em> only after making him adopt some means or <em>upāya</em> for winning His protection, (because the <em>jīva</em> is subject, according to the śāstra  to the law of Karma).</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>निलैदन्द तारगनाय् नियमिक्कुम् इऱैवनुमाय्</p>
<p>इलदॊण्ड्रॆनावगै यॆल्लान् दनदॆनुमॆन्दैयुमाय्त्</p>

<p>विलैयिण्ड्रि नामडियोमॆण्ड्रु वेदियर्मॆय्प्पॊरुळे. (10)</p>
<p>The Lord gave us our existence and is our support (dhāraka) as well; He is also the unconditional Ruler that directs and controls us. There is nothing that does not exist for the fulfilment of his purposes; He is also our Master for whom all things exist; He stands alone with no one to compare with Him. It is the earnest conviction of those who understand the spirit of the Vedas that we are the bodies and the unconditional (or natural) servants of the Lord with the crown of Tulsi leaves (for the Antaryāmi Brāhmana of Brihadaranyaka upanishad states this explicitly.)</p>

<p>In the &lsquo;a&rsquo; in Om and in the word &lsquo;Nārāyaṇa &rsquo; occurring in aṣṭākṣara, the supreme end of life (i.e.) <em>Bhagavān</em>, who is opposed to all that is objectionable or faulty, is indicated; in the m in om and in the part nāra occurring in Nārāyaṇāya, the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of the <em>jīva</em> who is to attain this end is disclosed; the means of attainment already existing as established(siddha <em>upāya</em>) namely, <em>Bhagavān</em>, is indicated in the part ayana occurring in Nārāyaṇa and the means to be accomplished or adopted (sādhya <em>upāya</em> ), which is self-surrender, is in <em>namas</em>; the fruit desired, viz., the enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em> which includes also service to Him is disclosed in the dative or fourth case in Nārāyaṇāya; the hindrance to it, namely, the feeling of &lsquo;mine&rsquo; is in the word mama occurring in namah (na mama ). He who understands the <em>Aṣṭākṣara</em> <em>mantra</em> that reveals all these five and <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup> <em>Dvayam</em> too, which is to the same effect&ndash;he will be considered by all as one who knows everything.</p>
<p><em>Dvayam</em> may mean also the two (i.e.) <em>Dvayam</em> and <em>Caramasloka.</em></p>
<p>THERE IS NO REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE</p>
<p>WHO SPEAK OF FIVE THINGS AND THOSE</p>
<p>WHO SPEAK OF SIX.</p>
<p>In the words Nārāyaṇa and in om, the relationship between <em>Iśvara</em> and the <em>jīva</em> is revealed as that between the soul and the body. Having taken this relationship as the foundation or basis of the Viśiṣṭādvaita system, some investigated the five truths that should be known to everyone who desires <em>mokṣa</em> . Others took this relationship also as one of the things to be known and hence spoke of the six things to be known. If it be asked what the five things are that should be understood by the seeker after <em>mokṣa</em>  along with the relationship itself, the answer is as follows: &ldquo;The nature<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup> of &ldquo;the end to be attained ” vis. <em>Brahman</em>, the nature of the individual self who is the seeker of the attainment, the means of attainment (<em>upāya</em>), the fruit resulting from it and so also the hindrances to the attainment of <em>Brahman</em> - all the Vedas with their (elucidatory) itihāsās and purānās speak of these five,&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>BRAHMAN</em>, THE END TO BE ATTAINED:</p>
<p>ITS SVARUPA:</p>
<p>Among these, the essential nature of <em>Brahman</em>, which is the object of attainment, is revealed in the first letter a in om and in the word &lsquo;Nārāyaṇa &rsquo; in Tiru_mantra_ and in the words Nārāyaṇa with the adjectives &lsquo;<em>Śrīman</em>&rsquo; occurring in <em>Dvayam</em> and in the words &lsquo;me&rsquo; and &lsquo;I&rsquo; occurring in the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em> . It is in this way that they should be considered. While doing so, one should think of His essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) as infinite <em>jñāna</em> and infinite bliss ever inseparable from His consort, Lakṣmī , who, in every form and in all situations, participates in all His actions. For there are many authoritative passages in support of this prescribed contemplation -</p>
<p>“The Lord of the <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup> Universe is ever with Lakṣmī  in Vaikuṇṭha, the world beyond” (Here the reference is to the Supreme Lord (<em>Para</em>) in Vaikuṇṭha.)</p>
<p>“This <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup> Nārāyaṇa  is always with Śrī&ndash; Nārāyaṇa  whose abode is the ocean of milk. He has now come to the city of Madhura leaving His bed (Adi_śeṣa_)&rdquo; (The reference is here to the Vyūha) “Thou<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup> art the God Nārāyaṇa , the spouse of Śrī and hast the Chakra is Thy weapon and Thou art omnipresent&rdquo;. (The reference is to the <em>Vibhava</em> or <em>avatāra</em>.)</p>
<p>“ <em>Bhagavān</em> has the <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup> mole, ŚrīVatsa, on His chest and Śrī is with Him eternally.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lakṣmī  is <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup> ever inseparable from Viṣṇu .&rdquo; &ldquo;He (Lakṣmaṇa) <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup> said as follows to Rāma in the presence of Sītā&rdquo;. (Here Śrī is indicated as purushakāra). &ldquo;The renowned <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup> Lakṣmaṇa spoke thus to Sītā and to Rāma who had the great vow (of protecting His suppliants)&rdquo;. (Here Śrī is indicated in the state of Her being the <em>upāya</em>). “This Sītā<sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup> is capable of protecting this host of Rākṣasis from (the anger of) Raghava.&rdquo; (Here and in the next passage, Śrī is indicated as the <em>upāya</em>) &ldquo;I will be <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup> your protector&rdquo; ( Sītā&rsquo;s words to the Rākṣasis ). &ldquo;You will <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup> enjoy yourself on the slopes of the hills with Sītā and, whether you are asleep or awake, I will render service to you&rdquo; (says Lakṣmaṇa): (Here is the prayer for the fruit, namely, <em>kaiṅkarya</em> ). &ldquo;He is <sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup> seated on the serpent Ananta ( <em>Śeṣa</em>), along with her (<em>Lakṣmī</em>)”; “When <sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup> shall I become their eternal</p>
<p>servant and thus find delight?&rdquo; (This is also prayer for service ). &ldquo;Thy <sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup> spouse is <em>Puruṣottama</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Lord, <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup> who is along with <em>Śrī</em>, is pleased by the service rendered to Him by the eternal Sūris who delight in that service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I worship <sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup> Viṣṇu  with the inseparable <em>Śrī</em>; He is the sea of purity and bliss&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup> beloved of <em>Śrī</em>, who is infinite and whose form is the unique abode of all auspicious qualities &quot;</p>
<p>.&ldquo;In <sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup> <em>Brahman</em>, the abode of Śrī(_Śrī_nivasa), may my mind be ever centred &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord of <sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup> <em>Śrī</em>, whose essential nature is opposed to all that is objectionable and faulty and who is possessed of auspicious qualities and is (at the same time) infinite jmāna and infinite bliss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou<sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup> , the protector of the cowherds from the torrent of rain caused by Indra, and the Goddess Lakṣmī .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot; Thou art <sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup> ever with Lakṣmī  adorned with shining brace</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I <sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">83</a></sup> still to remain in <em>samsāra</em> without enjoying you in the company of Lakṣmī  ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot; Thy <sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup> grace and the grace of the lotus-bora Goddess - with these I will sweep the floor of Thy temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“ Thou <sup id="fnref:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">85</a></sup> and thy lotus-born Spouse should be pleased to accept the service of the three worlds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will <sup id="fnref:86"><a href="#fn:86" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">86</a></sup> not be parted (from Thee) even for a moment”, says Śrī and abides on Thy chest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“ Thou <sup id="fnref:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">87</a></sup> art all <em>jñāna</em> and bliss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“ Thou <sup id="fnref:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">88</a></sup> art the light that never goes out and art beyond all</p>
<p>limitations.”</p>
<p>BHAGAVĀN POSSESSES ALL AUSPICIOUS QUALITIES :</p>
<p><em>Bhagavān</em> is to be thought of as being opposed to all that is faulty or objectionable ; for it has been said, “That <sup id="fnref:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">89</a></sup> Supreme Goal, which is called Viṣṇu , is free from all imperfections.&quot; and &ldquo;He is <sup id="fnref:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">90</a></sup> greater than the great; in the Lord of the great and the low, there are no such things as pain.&rdquo; He is to be considered also as possessing all those qualities which are necessary for one who is the object of attainment and who is, likewise, the means of attainment. Many are the passages that speak of <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s qualities :</p>
<p>Hear <sup id="fnref:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">91</a></sup> now of a man (Śrī Rāma) possessed of these qualities&quot;.</p>
<p>“Him who <sup id="fnref:92"><a href="#fn:92" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">92</a></sup> is possessed of these qualities.&quot;</p>
<p>“ Him who is <sup id="fnref:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">93</a></sup> the eldest (son) and who is possessed of all Noble qualities.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him who is <sup id="fnref:94"><a href="#fn:94" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">94</a></sup> thus possessed of noble qualities&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot; Rāma <sup id="fnref:95"><a href="#fn:95" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">95</a></sup> shone with (all these) qualities.&quot;</p>
<p>“Him who <sup id="fnref:96"><a href="#fn:96" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">96</a></sup> was possessed of such qualities and of irresistible valour.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; There are <sup id="fnref:97"><a href="#fn:97" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">97</a></sup> many noble qualities, O King, in your son.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; <sup id="fnref:98"><a href="#fn:98" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">98</a></sup> Benevolence, compassion, learning, integrity of character. control of the senses, control of the mind- these six qualities adorn Rāma, the best of men.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; He is <sup id="fnref:99"><a href="#fn:99" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">99</a></sup> known to be earnest in the matter of <em>dharma</em>; He is affectionate to those that seek His protection.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art <sup id="fnref:100"><a href="#fn:100" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">100</a></sup> capable of affording protection and art also the refuge of all. This is declared by the divine sages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“ Thou art <sup id="fnref:101"><a href="#fn:101" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">101</a></sup> the tree in which the good find their resting place; and Thou art the supreme refuge of all those who are in distress.”</p>
<p>&quot; He is <sup id="fnref:102"><a href="#fn:102" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">102</a></sup> the store-house of such qualities as splendour, strength, lordship, great wisdom, supreme valour and might.&quot;</p>
<p>Is <sup id="fnref:103"><a href="#fn:103" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">103</a></sup> there anyone that can comprehend the qualities of Viṣṇu , who is the inner self of all beings?&quot; &ldquo;My <sup id="fnref:104"><a href="#fn:104" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">104</a></sup> boy, just as the gems in the ocean are countless, the qualities of the Lord armed with Chakra are innumerable ; &quot;</p>
<p>&quot; His <sup id="fnref:105"><a href="#fn:105" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">105</a></sup> qualities cannot be enumerated even in tens of thou. sands of years by even all the gods assembled together. If there be any man of pure mind anywhere, gifted with the period of life appointed for <em>Brahma</em> and if he be further endowed with a thousand mouths, he may be able, O best of gods, to enumerate one ten-thousandth fraction of Thy qualities or may not be able.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Though Thy <sup id="fnref:106"><a href="#fn:106" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">106</a></sup> qualities are infinite, yet six of them are foremost among them; even as the universe is borne within thy body, the other qualities too, are contained within them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; It is <sup id="fnref:107"><a href="#fn:107" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">107</a></sup> owing to the deficiency of arrows that the man who wishes to cover the sky desists and not owing to any deficiency in the space of the sky. (So also ) we fall back from the praise of Govinda, owing to our deficiency of intelligence and not owing to any deficiency in His qualities.&quot;</p>
<p>“Thon hast <sup id="fnref:108"><a href="#fn:108" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">108</a></sup> qualities which, being remembered, afflict me during Thy separation - me the great sinner.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has <sup id="fnref:109"><a href="#fn:109" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">109</a></sup> noble qualities like bliss, which are limitless in extent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BHAGAVĀN HAS A DIVINE AND AUSPICIOUS FORM:</p>
<p><em>Bhagavān</em> should be thought of, also, as having a transcendent, super sensuous (aprākrita), divine and auspicious form, which is the resting place (āsraya ) of the universe, for there are many passages which refer to this form of His.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Him <sup id="fnref:110"><a href="#fn:110" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">110</a></sup> whose form ever remains the same &ndash; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who <sup id="fnref:111"><a href="#fn:111" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">111</a></sup> has faith in His form that is eternal and in His being the Supreme Deity - him <em>Bhagavān</em> approaches soon, O Poushkara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Hari has <sup id="fnref:112"><a href="#fn:112" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">112</a></sup> another form entirely different from all forms seen in the universe, in which all these saktīs abide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <sup id="fnref:113"><a href="#fn:113" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">113</a></sup> assumes by His will a form that is immense and that is pleasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“The body <sup id="fnref:114"><a href="#fn:114" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">114</a></sup> of the Supreme Being is not constituted of the (five) elements.&quot;</p>
<p>“His form <sup id="fnref:115"><a href="#fn:115" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">115</a></sup> is not constituted of <em>prakṛti</em> or matter nor formed of flesh, lymph or bone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; This form <sup id="fnref:116"><a href="#fn:116" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">116</a></sup> has four arms, is supremely excellent, and is in Vaikuṇṭha  .&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a <sup id="fnref:117"><a href="#fn:117" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">117</a></sup> form resplendent like gold and capable of being seen by the mind as in a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Thy <sup id="fnref:118"><a href="#fn:118" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">118</a></sup> form, O Lord, I see the gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has <sup id="fnref:119"><a href="#fn:119" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">119</a></sup> a body on which rest weapons and ornaments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this <sup id="fnref:120"><a href="#fn:120" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">120</a></sup> universe is in His form as weapons and ornaments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“The <sup id="fnref:121"><a href="#fn:121" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">121</a></sup> Supreme Being Armed with the conch, the chakra and the club is in the region beyond the universe of matter (tamas)&quot;</p>
<p>From the <em>Pāñcarātra</em> śāstra  (Bhagavat śāstra), it is learnt that this form of the Lord is of five kinds (1) The Supreme (<em>Para</em> <em>Vāsudeva</em> ), (2) <em>Vyūha</em> (<em>Vāsudeva</em>, <em>Saṅkarṣaṇa</em>, Aniruddha and Pradyumna), (3) <em>Vibhava</em> (avatārs like Rāma and Kṛṣṇa), (4) <sup id="fnref:122"><a href="#fn:122" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">122</a></sup> Hārda<sup id="fnref:123"><a href="#fn:123" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">123</a></sup> and (5) <em>arcā</em> (images worshipped in temples).</p>
<p>Harda is an aprakrita form of the Lord present in the human heart, like the <em>arcā</em> in temples</p>
<p>Details concerning them may be learnt from the <em>Pāñcarātra</em> śāstra  and from tradition. <em>Bhagavān</em> should also be considered as having endless glories or possessions (<em>Vibhūti</em>). For there are passages like the following which describe His _vibhūti_s</p>
<p>THE _VIBHŪTI_S OF BHAGAVĀN: LILÃ AND BHOGA:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These <sup id="fnref:124"><a href="#fn:124" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">124</a></sup> are the vibhūtis (glories) of Viṣṇu  (i. e.) <em>Brahma</em>, Manu and others, time and all beings. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has, for <sup id="fnref:125"><a href="#fn:125" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">125</a></sup> His abode, the region of eternal glory called Mahā <em>vibhūti</em>.</p>
<p>&quot; There is <sup id="fnref:126"><a href="#fn:126" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">126</a></sup> no end, O mighty warrior, to my divine glories&rdquo; (vibhūtis). These ideas are concisely expressed in the <em>śloka</em>  :</p>
<p>“The <sup id="fnref:127"><a href="#fn:127" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">127</a></sup> anda of the Universe and whatever else is found within that anda are His _vibhūti_s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These vibhūtis (possessions or glories) of God are of two kinds, sentient and non-sentient, and these again are of two kinds, some existing for His <em>Līlā</em> or sport and others for His enjoyment (bhoga). This division into things for play (<em>līlā</em>) and things for enjoyment (bhoga) is based on the difference in the rasa or delectation, though all  of them have agreeableness (or ānukulyam) in common. <em>Bhagavān</em> should be considered as being engaged in the work of the Universe merely for His play or sport (<em>līlā</em>), for it has been said as follows:</p>
<p>&quot; From <sup id="fnref:128"><a href="#fn:128" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">128</a></sup> whom is the origin etc. of this world&quot;</p>

<p>Thus <em>Brahman</em>, the object of attainment, is ever with Lakṣmī : He is infinite <em>jñāna</em> and infinite bliss, and is opposed to all that is imperfect and objectionable. He is possessed of countless auspicious qualities like wisdom and power. He has a celestial and transcendent form of auspicious nature. He has two vibhūtis (<em>līlā</em> and <em>nitya</em> ) which are His body; He has, for His play or sport (<em>līlā</em>), the work of creating the world, of maintaining and controlling it and the like.</p>
<p>This summarises Prapya (i.c.) the object of attainment, viz. Brahman</p>
<p>THE NATURE OF THE INDIVIDUAL SELF:</p>
<p>Now for the individual self (Pratyak ātmā) which is to attain <em>Brahman</em> :</p>
<p>We should know that the individual self is in three categories : Baddha or those who are in the bondage of <em>samsāra</em>, Mukta, or those who have attained release from <em>samsāra</em> and <em>Nitya</em> or those who are eternally free from bondage. The seeker after salvation should also know the peculiar features which distinguish him as a seeker of the means of <em>mukti</em>, from other baddhas.</p>
<p>The baddhas (or the bound) are those caught up in the cycle of births and deaths owing to the stream of beginningless <em>karma</em>. They range from <em>Brahma</em> to the blade of grass and are called kshetrajnāh. (<em>Brahma</em>, gods, men, beasts, trees, grass and so on ).</p>
<p>The muktās (or released souls) are those who, by adopting the means (<em>upāya</em> ) prescribed in the śāstras, have obtained the Lord&rsquo;s grace, permanently transcended the cycle of births and deaths, and have obtained unsurpassed bliss as a result of the unrestricted enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em>.</p>
<p>The nityās (the eternally free) are those whose knowledge has never undergone contraction and who are, in this respect, like <em>Iśvara</em> Himself. &ldquo;They <sup id="fnref:136"><a href="#fn:136" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">136</a></sup> are&rdquo;, it has been said, &quot; of the same age as the Lord, eternal and free from all trace of imperfections,&quot; They have never been in <em>samsāra</em> and are engaged in eternal service to the Lord e.g. Ananta (i.e.) Adi_śeṣa_, Garuḍa and Viṣvaksena.</p>
<p>has never undergone contraction</p>
<p>The characteristic attributes common to all the three of them are being atomic (in size) (aṇ u) and being of the nature of knowledge (<em>jñāna</em>), bliss (ānanda), purity (amalatvam) and the like. They are all _śeṣa_s to <em>Bhagavān</em> and are entirely subject to His will. One should also understand what is distinctive and peculiar to one as a <em>mumukṣu</em> or seeker after salvation. This has been (already) mentioned in the Introductory Chapter and will be described later on also.</p>
<p>The essential nature of the <em>jīva</em> who seeks attainment should be thought of, while considering the letter m in om and in <em>namas</em> or <em>namo</em> in Tiru_mantra_, and in the part nāra of the word Nārāyaṇa, wherever it occurs in the aṣṭākṣara and the <em>Dvayam</em>, in the first person singular form &quot; I seek refuge&quot; prapadye in <em>Dvayam</em>, in the second person singular of the word &quot; thyself&quot; in &ldquo;surrender thyself&rdquo; (vraja) and in the word thee (tva) and in the sentence &quot; despair not&quot; in the caramaśloka .</p>
<p>THE MEANS OF ATTAINMENT.</p>
<p>We will describe at length the means of attainment (<em>upāya</em>) and its auxiliaries and also the nature of the fruit to be attained in their proper context later.</p>
<p>Among these two, the <em>upāya</em> or means of attainment is to be considered as indicated in Tiru_mantra_ in the word <em>namas</em> or <em>namo</em> and in the part ayana (resting place). in Nārāyanāya ; in <em>Dvayam</em> in the first part and in the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em> in the first half.</p>
<p>THE FIVE THINGS TO BE KNOWN</p>
<p>THE GOAL OF ATTAINMENT.</p>
<p>The Nature of the fruit to be attained or enjoyed is mentioned in the dative or fourth case (i.e) in Nārāyaṇāya in the Tiru_mantra_, in the word namah in the <em>Dvaya</em>, and in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> in the words &ldquo;I will free thee from all sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE HINDRANCE TO ATTAINMENT,</p>
<p>The hindrances to the attainment are the multitude of obstacles that stand in the way of our attaining <em>mokṣa</em> , such as ignorance (<em>avidyā</em>), <em>karma</em> and vāsana or impression left in the mind by <em>karma</em> in previous births,</p>
<p>The foremost of these hindrances is the punishment inflicted by <em>Bhagavān</em> for disobedience of His orders continually from time immemorial. This chastisement causes association with <em>prakṛti</em> or matter with its three qualities (sattva, rajas and tamas) and thereby contraction of knowledge. It brings about a connection between the soul on the one hand, and the body, the senses and the like which are specific modifications of matter (or <em>prakṛti</em>) on the other. Further it makes the <em>jīva</em> subject to the sway of the body and the senses. To quote the words of the Alwar, “With the strong ropes of my sins, Thou hast bound me tightly with the body, covered the sores within the body (like flesh, fat and blood) with the skin and let me walk away from Thee.&quot; &ldquo;With <sup id="fnref:137"><a href="#fn:137" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">137</a></sup> the body given by Thee at the time of creation, I have been wandering about to the satisfaction of the body.&rdquo; This chastisement often consists in placing the <em>jīva</em> in the body of animals which can have no knowledge of the _Śāstra_s and cannot act in accordance with them. Even in births like those of men, it confounds the mind with the views of infidels and heretics and, even in the case of those who escape this, causes, through the concealing agency of the peacock feather of primal matter (moola-<em>prakṛti</em>) and its modifications, the bodies and the senses, (1) ignorance</p>
<p>of the truth and (2) erroneous knowledge and so also (3) subjection to sense-pleasures. As Śrī_Rāmānuja_ says, &ldquo;This <sup id="fnref:138"><a href="#fn:138" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">138</a></sup> (association with matter) causes obscuration of a knowledge of the essential nature of <em>Bhagavān</em> and also false knowledge. Besides it makes the <em>jīva</em> think that this association is delightful.&rdquo; As a consequence of this, it induces the <em>jīva</em> to disobey His orders and do forbidden things for the sake of petty pleasures. To quote again the words of the Alwar: &ldquo;Is it <sup id="fnref:139"><a href="#fn:139" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">139</a></sup> right on Thy part to  confound my soul and excite my five senses by showing me, who am a sinner, all sorts of petty pleasures?&rdquo; One act of disobedience leads to further acts of sin. Well has it been said, &ldquo;Sin &ldquo;committed again and again destroys wisdom and the man without wisdom begins further acts of a sinful nature.&rdquo; In consequence the Lord makes the <em>jīva</em> wander again and again through the cycle of life in the womb, birth, old age, death, and hell, as stated by Himself, &ldquo;I throw them always into asuric births&rdquo; By means of the scriptures of those who are actuated by rajas and tamas, which show the way to secure petty pleasures, the <em>jīva</em> is made to fall at the feet of petty deities who are themselves souls ( kshetrajna) fettered with similar chains. “Those who are actuated by rajas&rdquo; it has been declared, “worship Yakshas and Rākṣasas ; and those who are actuated by tamas worship the spirits of the dead and elemental spirits ( Bhūtagana)&quot;. The <em>jīva</em> is deluded into considering himself as greatly benefited by the mean and gruesome enjoyments afforded by these deities in the same way as worms find pleasure in dirt and filth.</p>
<p>Even those who practise <em>yoga</em> are made to practise it in connection with petty deities or in the meditations of such inanimate things as <sup id="fnref:140"><a href="#fn:140" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">140</a></sup> nāma<sup id="fnref:141"><a href="#fn:141" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">141</a></sup> being <em>Brahman</em> and are made to fall therefrom in the acquisition of minor results. Even those who are devoted to the soul or ātmā are made to meditate on their ātmā either in contact with matter or as separated from matter either as if it were <em>Brahman</em> or as the atma in its own essential nature. As the result of these four kinds of meditation, the <em>jīva</em> obtains petty enjoyments after which he falls back into <em>samsāra</em>. Even in the case of those who practise true meditation on <em>Brahman</em>, and who meditate primarily on their own selves as having <em>Brahman</em> for their inner self or who think primarily of <em>Brahman</em> who has for His body their own selves - even they may be detained by the state of kaivalya or the enjoyment of their own selves, by the attainment of the <sup id="fnref:142"><a href="#fn:142" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">142</a></sup> eight kinds<sup id="fnref:143"><a href="#fn:143" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">143</a></sup> of siddhi, by the attainment of the status of the vasus, or by the entrance into the body of <em>Brahma</em> and the like. Their (temporary) lapse from the highest aim or goal of life (namely, the enjoyment of the bliss of <em>Brahman</em>) is like that of a prince, whose coronation day has been already fixed, casting eyes on the servant maids who attended on hini while in prison. They are made to linger fondly over the body and the senses which are the result of past <em>karma</em> and those that are related to the body (like relatives) and the enjoyments connected with them. In this way they become subject to other pleasures than the final goal. Thus there are many forms of hindrance in the way of the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em>. When a well thirty-two steps wide has to be leaped over, it makes no difference whether the man falls at the very first step or at the thirty-second step. In the same way wherever or at whatever stage the hindrance occurs, the <em>jīva</em> has not transcended <em>samsāra</em>.</p>
<p><sup>] </sup> In the Chandogya upanishad VII chapter, it is stated as follows:- He who worships nama or names like rig veda, sama veda, <em>Itihāsa</em> and purāṇa as if they were Brahman will realise only very limited fruits such
as can be reached with these names&quot;.</p>
<p>The eight kinds of siddhi: Aṇimā (contraction of one&rsquo;s body to the size of an atom, mahima (assuming a huge form) Laghimā (making one&rsquo;s body light) Garimā (making the body heavy), vaśitvam (mastery over self), aiśvaryam (lordship) prāpti the power of obtaining whatever one wants and prākāmyam (perfect freedom of the will.)</p>
<p>It is true the Gītā says that for those who practise karmayoga, the effort will never perish or be in vain. What has been built up will, of course, remain built up, as it were, of stone, But we cannot say when the fruit will be attained, whether at the end of a kalpa or of a manvantara or of a yuga. Even sages like Vasiṣṭa, who ever acted in such a manner as to please God, had to wait long. Those who acted against the will of God like Vritra and Kshatrabandhu attained <em>mokṣa</em>  without any such delay. So it is difficult to say which individuals have done meritorious deeds that would lead to <em>mokṣa</em>  without delay. Similarly it is difficult to state who have done bad deeds leading to divine chastisement causing delay.</p>
<p>SARAŅĀGATI THE ONLY MEANS OF GETTING RID OF</p>
<p>THESE HINDRANCES:</p>
<p>How can this chief hindrance which is of the nature of divine punishment resulting from disobedience of the Lord&rsquo;s commands and which is the root cause of this chain of suffering-how can this be removed? The author of Śrī Bhāṣya (Śrī Rāmānuja) has declared that the only remedy for this hindrance is to obtain the favour of the Lord and that this can be done only by <em>Śaraṇāgati</em> or self-surrender to the <sup id="fnref:144"><a href="#fn:144" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">144</a></sup> Lord. This declaration is made by him, while commenting on the order in which the senses, the mind and the like have to be controlled as stated in Kaṭha upanishad<sup id="fnref:145"><a href="#fn:145" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">145</a></sup> .</p>
<p>All these hindrances to <em>mokṣa</em>  are to be understood in whatever is contrary to what is ordained in the three mysteries (_mantra_s) (e. g. the feeling that the <em>jīva</em> is independent and acts for his own purposes which is opposed to the truths shown in the aṣṭākṣara), in the egoism, or sense of &lsquo;my&rsquo; or &lsquo;mine&rsquo; in the genitive mama in namah (na + mama) and also in the words ‘all thy sins&rsquo; in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> . These have to be thought of, so that one may feel the suffering which lies in walking on the hot sands of <em>samsāra</em> and desire to hasten towards the path leading to bliss.</p>

<p>Those who know these five have declared them in order that I may not despair in mind and in order that the darkness of ignorance may not confound me- the five namely - the Lord of the lotus-born Lakṣmī , who stands as the one thing to be attained, the <em>jīva</em> who loves the lord and craves for His grace by seeking His feet, the means (or <em>upāya</em>) to be adopted by the <em>jīva</em> for the attainment, and the fruit resulting therefrom, as also the strong fetters of sin due to delusion or ignorance (which are hindrances).</p>

<p>(5) THE CHAPTER ON THE THREE &lsquo;REALS&rsquo;  (OR TATVAS) page107</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>प्रकृत्यात्मभ्रान्तिर्गलति चिदचिल्लक्षणधिया</p>
<p>तथा जीवेशैक्यप्रभृतिकलहस्तद्विभजनात् ।</p>
<p>अतो भोक्ता भोग्यं तदुभयनियन्तेति निगमै</p>
<p>र्विभक्तं नस्तत्वत्रयमुपदिशन्त्यक्षतधियः ॥ १४ ॥</p>
<p>The delusion that the soul is nothing but the body and the senses (<em>prakṛti</em>) disappears when one has a knowledge of the distinctive features of sentient beings and non-sentient things. So also the disputes on such questions as the unity of the <em>jīva</em> and God will no longer continue, when the characteristic features of each of them are marked out. Our <em>ācārya</em> s, whose wisdom never failed, teach us about the existence of three realities (_Tattva_s) classified in the s&rsquo;āstrās as the experiencing subjects (bhoktā), the objects of experience and enjoyment (bhogyam) and He who rules over both of them (<em>Iśvara</em>).</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION OF TATVAS OR REALS AND ITS USE:</p>
<p>It may be asked why the ācāryas should state that the three tatvās or &lsquo;reals&rsquo; should be specially prescribed for the study of those who seek <em>mokṣa</em> , when they form only a part of the six things that should be known, namely, the five truths arthapanchaka and the relationship of soul and body (which exists between God and the world). The answer is as follows: It is necessary to root out the delusion that the body is the atma and that the <em>jīva</em> is independent (of the Lord), as well as the view that there is no God, which is the cause of that delusion, for these are great obstacles to <em>mokṣa</em>.</p>
<p>The sāstrās, therefore, divide Reality into three classes ; the experiencing subject, the object of experience or enjoyment, and the Ruler who controls and directs them. Among them, non-sentient things which are the objects of experience are of three kinds (1) <em>Prakṛti</em> or matter which has the three qualities of sattvam, rajas and tamas (2) Kala or time and (3) Śuddha Satvam, the substance of which the transcendental region beyond matter called Vaikuṇṭha   is made. The nature of (1) <em>Prakṛti</em> has been thus described :-&ldquo;It is <sup id="fnref:146"><a href="#fn:146" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">146</a></sup> non-sentient (achetana). It exists (always) for others and it is eternal, but subject always to change or modification. It has three qualities sattvam, rajas and tamas and is the field of action (<em>karma</em>) for the <em>jīva</em>&rdquo;. The nature of (2) Kala or time is described thus :- &quot; <em>Bhagavān</em> <sup id="fnref:147"><a href="#fn:147" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">147</a></sup> Kala (i.e.) Time, which is the body of <em>Bhagavān</em>, has no beginning nor end.&quot; &ldquo;It takes <sup id="fnref:148"><a href="#fn:148" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">148</a></sup> the forms of such divisions as kalaa and muhoortha which are respectively 1-3/8 minutes and 1/30th part of a day (and is the cause of the modifications of matter). But it causes no change or modification in the transcendental world (Aprākritaloka) beyond matter&rdquo;. The nature of the transcendental world beyond matter is such that it is made of s&rsquo;uddha sattvam. The world <sup id="fnref:149"><a href="#fn:149" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">149</a></sup> made of it is of the nature of <em>jñāna</em> and bliss. God controls time there ; time is not the <sup id="fnref:150"><a href="#fn:150" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">150</a></sup> cause of any change or modification in the world of Śuddha-sattvam (as it is in the world of matter). Thus the nature of <em>Prakṛti</em>, Kāla and Śuddha sattva which belong to three classes of non-sentient things (achetana), has been described.</p>
<p>NOW FOR THE EXPERIENCING SUBJECT OR <em>JĪVA</em>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jivātma is <sup id="fnref:151"><a href="#fn:151" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">151</a></sup> neither a god nor a man&rdquo;; &ldquo;He is  <sup id="fnref:152"><a href="#fn:152" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">152</a></sup> neither a god nor a man”. (That is: These distinctions are based only on the respective bodies, whereas the soul within has no such distinctions.) The <em>jīva</em> is of three kinds :- Baddha or the soul in bondage is called in the Gita &quot; Kshara&rdquo; (because he is in contact with matter which is subject to change) All beings<sup id="fnref:153"><a href="#fn:153" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">153</a></sup> (from <em>Brahma</em> to the blade of grass) are &lsquo;Ksharas&rsquo; or Baddhas. The <em>mukta</em> or the soul which has obtained release from contact with matter is no longer subject to change and is called akshara or Kootastha (because it is imputable). The third class of _jīva_s are the Sūris<sup id="fnref:154"><a href="#fn:154" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">154</a></sup> who are described as seeing eternally the transcendental world beyond matter. The third class of &ldquo;Real&rsquo; is <em>Iśvara</em> who has been thus described :- He is all ;<sup id="fnref:155"><a href="#fn:155" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">155</a></sup> He knows all; He sees all; He possesses all strength, all knowledge, all power, all wealth : He is without fatigue, without lassitude, without fear, without anger, without desire and other such (blemishes). Thus has the nature of <em>Iśvara</em> been taught,</p>
<p>Thus the three realities consist of the Ruler and the Ruled (the latter including <em>prakṛti</em> and the sentient beings) and our <em>ācārya</em> s (Śrī Yāmunācārya and Śrī Rāmānuj_ācārya_) have stated this concisely in the words &ldquo;(<em>Iśvara</em>)<sup id="fnref:156"><a href="#fn:156" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">156</a></sup> on whom depend the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>), the continuance (sthiti) and the activity (<em>pravṛtti</em>) of the three kinds of sentient beings and of non-sentient things with all their differences&rdquo;. The three kinds of sentient beings are those that are in bondage (<em>baddha</em>), those that have obtained release (<em>mukta</em>) and those that are eternally free (<em>nitya</em>). The three kinds of non-sentient things are <em>Prakṛti</em> with its three qualities (sattvam, rajas and tamas). Time, and Śuddhasattvam. The essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) means the substance or thing which is defined by attributes peculiar and unique to it. Continuance (sthiti, means continuance of the thing or object in time. This is eternal for eternal things. In the case of non-eternal things, this continuance is subject to expansion and contraction in accordance with the will of <em>Iśvara</em>. Activity or <em>pravṛtti</em> includes action and abstention from action. All these three : the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>), the continuance in time (sthithi) and the activity (<em>pravṛtti</em>) are seen (by perception and other pramaņas) to be different in the case of each thing or object,</p>
<p>Alavandar: Atmasiddhi and Rāmānuja’s Vaikuṇṭha gadyam.</p>
<p>When the _pramāṇa_s or sources of knowledge (like perception and inference) reveal an object or thing, they disclose the essential Nature or <em>svarūpa</em> of the object, the attributes that define it, the (other) qualities of the object so defined and also its activities. The essential nature is always revealed as endowed with the attributes that define it. It is not possible to speak of the essential nature of a thing (<em>svarūpa</em>) except in terms of the respective attributes. To speak of an object minus its attributes would be as meaningless as to speak of a hare&rsquo;s horns.</p>
<p>THE NATURE OF THE <em>JĪVA</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of the <em>jīva</em> may be described as <em>jñāna</em> (knowledge), bliss (ānanda), (amala) being pure, and being atomic (anu) in terms of its defining attributes (i. e.) being of the nature of knowledge, being of the nature of bliss, being pure and being atomic. This reality, viz. the <em>jīva</em> is always <em>śeṣa</em> to <em>Iśvara</em> (i.e.) it exists only for <em>Iśvara</em> and it is unconditional <em>śeṣa</em> only to Him. Thus its existing (always) for the Lord is affirmed (ayogavyavaccheda) and also its existing for no other than the Lord (anya yogavyavaccheda). This quality of being <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord, which is disclosed in the first word of Tiru_mantra_, namely om (<em>aum</em>), is of the nature of a  relationship ( sambandha) and requires, therefore, a thing having that relationship and cannot be understood without it. So this <em>śeṣatva</em> may be called an additional quality of a thing, namely, the <em>jīva</em>, which has already been defined by its defining attributes. Here the definition of the <em>jīva</em> is that it is a thing which is sentient while being also atomic. Similarly the <em>jīva</em> may also be defined as a thing which is sentient while being also, by its nature, <em>śeṣa</em>. So this quality of being <em>śeṣa</em> may also be called an attribute which defines the thing, viz, the <em>jīva</em>. Similarly <em>Iśvara</em> may be defined as having sentience along with omnipresence (vibhu). He may also be defined as one that is absolutely independent of everything else, while being the unconditional seshin (i.e.) one for whom all other things exist (unconditionally). The class of atmas which includes _jīva_s and <em>Iśvara</em> may be defined as those that are sentient and pratyak (i.e.) which are subjective and have inwardness. To be sentient is to be the possessor of knowledge. To be subjective or inward (or pratyak) is to possess luminosity to oneself. The atmā or soul is self-luminous and shines as I&rsquo; without the help of the attributive knowledge <sup id="fnref:157"><a href="#fn:157" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">157</a></sup> (_dharmabhūta _ <em>jñāna</em>)<sup id="fnref:158"><a href="#fn:158" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">158</a></sup> . Since sentience and inwardness (pratyaktva) are common to both _jīva_s and <em>Iśvara</em>, the <em>jīva</em> has to be defined as having, in addition, dependance by its very nature (on <em>Iśvara</em>). In the aṣṭākṣara, in the dative of the first syllable (āya) a in <em>aum</em> (om), the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s existence for the fulfilment of <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s purposes is stated without any condition; therefore the <em>jīva</em> is unconditionally and absolutely dependent upon the Lord of Śrī (Lakṣmī ), who is the universal Saviour. This statement of the absolute relationship between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>Iśvara</em> throughout the existence (of the former ) is called ayogavyavaccheda or denial of the non-existence of the relationship. The second syllable u in <em>aum</em> (om) in <em>aṣṭākṣara</em> means &lsquo;only&rsquo; and brings out the idea that the <em>jīva</em> exists for the purposes of only <em>Iśvara</em> and denies his dependence or existence for the sake of any others. This denial is called anya-yogavyavaccheda or denial of (the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s ) relationship with others. We will show later that this _śeṣa_tva extends from the Lord to His devotees as well. The activity of sentient beings consists in their being the doers and the enjoyers subject to <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s will and purpose. Since this activity and this capacity for enjoyment are given to them by Him, they are for His purposes and not their own.</p>
<p>The soul is of the nature of jñāna or knowledge (i.c.) its <em>svarūpa</em> is knowledge. At the same time the soul has knowledge as an attribute and this jñāna or knowledge is called Dharma bhūta
jñāna or attributive knowledge.</p>
<p>BADDHAS :</p>
<p>The difference between sentient beings that are in bondage and others consists in the former having <em>avidyā</em> (ignorance), <em>karma</em>, the impressions left by past <em>karma</em> (vāsana) the inclinations due to them (ruchi or taste for worldly enjoyment) and association with <em>prakṛti</em> or matter. The differences existing mutually among _jīva_s in respect of knowledge, pleasures and the like may be seen in the groups of _jīva_s r_aṅgī_ng from <em>Brahma</em> to a blade of grass.</p>
<p>These bound souls support bodies given to them by <em>Iśvara</em> in accordance with their respective <em>karma</em>, both by their essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) as <em>jñāna</em> and by their attributive knowledge (dharına bhūta <em>jñāna</em>). The support given to the body by the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) serves to make it exist. The support given to it by the attributive knowledge or <em>dharma_bhūtā_jñāna</em>, while in such states as waking, serves to enable the body to be useful for securing the ends or goal of life and for adopting the means to secure these ends. In the case of the supreme devotee who has already adopted the means of attaining <em>mukti</em>, the support given by attributive knowledge makes the body useful for the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> and for rendering service to Him. In the case of sinners, this support given to the body is productive of adverse experiences. When the <em>jīva</em> leaves the body, the latter undergoes disintegration, The constituent substances of the body into which it disintegrates (such as the five elements) remain the body of <em>Iśvara</em>. As regards continuance in time (sthiti), the specific character of souls in bondage, as distinguished from others, is continuous association with the body until <em>mukti</em>. As regards activities, these _jīva_s in bondage have three kinds: puṇya, papa and that which is neither of these two.</p>
<p>MUKTAS:</p>
<p>The difference between released souls and others is that the former have attained their essential nature in a manifest condition by the removal of obstacles. As regards their continuance in time (sthiti), their distinctive feature consists in this their essential Nature (<em>svarūpa</em>), which has become manifest, will continue to be so without any end. Among souls that have attained <em>mukti</em> or release, the mutual difference is their having attained the manifestation of their essential nature earlier or later. The difference in their activities consists in specific kinds of service to the Lord chosen by each and prompted by love, which has resulted from the perfect enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> gained after the loss of it from time immemorial.</p>
<p>_NITYA_S:</p>
<p>The specific and distinctive feature of the _nitya_s (the eternally free) is that the manifestation of their essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) is without any beginning and also their absolute dependence (on the Lord): The specific feature of their continued existence in time is that their enjoyment of the <sup id="fnref:159"><a href="#fn:159" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">159</a></sup> <em>śeṣī</em><sup id="fnref:160"><a href="#fn:160" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">160</a></sup>  is beginningless. Since this is common to all _nitya_s, there is no mutual difference between their respective states of continuous existence in time. The difference in their activities consists in the continu ous performance of specific kinds of service to the Lord from beginningless time which, though different, yet form a continuous stream of service. It has been said that such _nitya_s as Ananta (<em>Śeṣa</em> ) and Garuḍa hold certain specific offices and perform specific kinds of service in due relation to them. If so, it may be asked, how it would be possible to reconcile this with the statement (made by Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em> in the <em>Gadya</em>) that _nitya_s (the eternally free) and muktas (who have attained <em>mokṣa</em> ) have all access to all kinds of service. The answer is that they are not barred from any form of service which is pleasing to them and is in accordance with the will of the Lord and that no one of them ever desires to render the forms of service which have been specially marked off for others. Besides, the service rendered by any one of them is as pleasing to the Lord as that done by others; therefore the service rendered by any one of them gives the same pleasure of service to all of them. There is no difference in the delight which results from the service as its fruit. Hence there is nothing unreasonable in stating that all of them have access to every form of service.</p>

<p>_DHARMABHŪTA _JÑĀNA<sup id="fnref:161"><a href="#fn:161" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">161</a></sup></p>
<p>(Attributive knowledge).</p>
<p>According to Viśiṣṭādvaitins, the self or atma is,in its essential nature or <em>svarūpa</em>, knowledge. It also possesses jñāna or knowledge as its dharma or attribute.&rdquo; This knowledge is called dharma bhuta jñāna or attributive knowledge. (See foot-note before the previous foot-note)</p>
<p>To all these ātmās or souls, in the same way as their essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) is that of a substance, their attributive knowledge (_dharma_bhūtājñāna) is also a substance. Its essential nature has not been separately referred to in the <sup id="fnref:162"><a href="#fn:162" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">162</a></sup> passage<sup id="fnref:163"><a href="#fn:163" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">163</a></sup> because of its having been included as an attribute to the soul.</p>
<p>the passage which refers to the three kinds of achetana in Alavandar’s Ātmasiddhi and Rāmānuja’s Vaikuṇṭhagadyam.</p>
<p>This attributive knowledge is luminous by itself to the soul which possesses it, while revealing objects. That is, when the attributive knowledge reveals, for example, a pot to the soul which possesses that attributive knowledge, it reveals its own existence as well). To <em>Iśvara</em> and the _nitya_s (the eternally free), this attributive knowledge is eternally all-pervasive. For others in the state of <em>samsāra</em> or bondage, it is subject to varying degrees of contraction and expansion owing to <em>karma</em>. In the state of <em>mukti</em>, it is all pervasive for all released souls, owing to perfect expansion and remains so throughout. The functions (<em>pravṛtti</em>) of attributive knowledge are as follows :- It discloses objects (external or internal); while willing or making an effort, it directs the body (and the senses etc.); in the state of bondage, it undergoes contraction and expansion; it undergoes experiences (bhoga) which reveal objects as agreeable or disagreeable. Experience or Bhoga is the process of feeling a thing as agreeable or disagreeable. All objects, which are among the glories of <em>Iśvara</em>, are, by their very nature, Agreeable and are enjoyed as being Agreeable by <em>Iśvara</em>, the _nitya_s and the souls that have attained <em>mokṣa</em> . To those in <em>samsāra</em>, however, these objects appear at different times, and in different places and in relation to different _jīva_s as slightly agreeable, or disagreeable, or indifferent, but these variations do not belong to them by nature. Their slight agreeableness, disagreeableness, or being neither of the two is the fruit of the past actions of the _jīva_s awarded to them by <em>Iśvara</em>, whose will is irresistible. The _jīva_s that are in bondage are subject to the experience of the fruits of their <em>karma</em>, both by nature and by auxiliary causes. By nature they are subject to it, because they are sentient beings entirely under the control of another (<em>Iśvara</em>). The auxiliary causes are their having committed offences against the Lord. In the case of muktas and _nitya_s, although, by their nature as being subject to the control of <em>Iśvara</em>, the experience of the fruit of action might be possible, yet since they never perform any action displeasing to Him, there are no auxiliary causes for such experiences. <em>Iśvara</em>, by His essential nature, is not subject to such experience or enjoyment of the fruits of action, since He stands as the Ruler over all and with no one else to command Him. Nor are there any auxiliary causes in His case, as there is no one whose commands He may be said to have disobeyed.</p>
<p>The essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of all ātmās, jīvās as well as <em>Iśvara</em>, is being selfluminous to oneself. This luminosity of the self to itself suffers, even in the case of those in bondage, no contraction or expansion at any time. The attributive knowledge (<em>dharma_bhūtajñāna) of all ātmās is luminous to its supporting self, while disclosing objects (like pots). A common characteristic of <em>svarūpa</em> <em>jñāna</em> or the self and attributive knowledge or dharniabhūtajrāna is their both being of the nature of knowledge and being self-luminous (i.e.) being luminous without requiring anything else to light them up. Attributive knowledge has the additional characteristic of revealing or disclosing objects (vishayitva). The additional characteristic possessed by svarüpa_jñāna</em> (or the self) is subjectiveness or inwardness (pratyaktva). <em>Jñāna</em> or knowledge, (which is the character of both of them), may be defined as that which makes a thing laminous; that is, it makes either itself or something else fit for being spoken out and acted upon (vyavahāra). Self-luminosity is the capability of being luminous without the need of any other known ledge to illumine it. Attributive knowledge has vishayitva, because it discloses objects other than itself (like pots, cloths etc.) The subjectiveness or inwardness of souls or ātmās (pratyaktva) consists in their being luminous to themselves ; that is, the benefit of their luminosity is enjoyed by themselves The atma or self is the recipient of the benefit of every object being disclosed or revealed. Pratyaktva is only a special instance of this general statement, for in it, the self receives the benefit of its own disclosure or revelation. A thing which does not possess this pratyaktva or subjectiveness does not also possess the common benefit of objects being disclosed. It cannot, therefore, be called sentient. Though subjective knowledge or the &lsquo;I&rsquo; and attributive knowledge, which is its attribute, are both luminous by themselves, yet they are also capable of being apprehended by other forms of knowledge (like that from _śāstra_s), as being endowed with attributes like being eternal. When one&rsquo;s attributive knowledge happens to be known or apprehended by one with the help of another piece of knowledge, the latter is called another piece of knowledge, merely because of the direction to which the attributive knowledge is turned. When we perceive an object, say a pot, _dharma_bhūtajñāna contacts the object and reveals it to the soul or self; but when the <em>dharmabhūta jñāna</em> itself becomes the object of knowledge, it is revealed to the self  by a part of it.</p>
<p>THE THREE KINDS OF NON-SENTIENT BEINGS :</p>
<p>The three classes of non-sentient things are capable of being apprehended only by others, (and not by themselves). Non sentience means being without the possession of knowledge. To be capable of being apprehended only by others means that their apprehension is not to themselves or for their own benefit. These two (viz. being without the possession of knowledge and the apprehension not being for their own benefit) are true also of attributive knowledge (_dharmabhūta _jñāna), which is thus a non-sentient thing.</p>
<p>Of the three classes of non-sentient things, matter (<em>Prakṛti</em>) and time (Kala) are jaḍa (i.e.) not luminous by themselves. There are some who hold that Śuddha-sattvam is also jaḍa. To be jaḍa is to be without self-luminosity. Those who have studied such treatises as Pancharātra or the Lord&rsquo;s <em>Śāstra</em> would say that Śuddhasattvam is luminous by itself, as it is declared to be so in that <em>śāstra</em>. It may be asked why, if it is luminous by itself, it is not directly perceived by beings in the state of <em>samsāra</em>, without having to be known through <em>śāstra</em> only. The answer is as follows:- The soul whose essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) is knowledge and its attributive knowledge are both laminous by themselves and yet the former is luminous to itself and not to other souls, who have to know it with the help of their own attributive knowledge. Attributive knowledge, though luminous to its substrate, namely the soul, is not luminous to others. In the same way, the Śuddha sattvam may be luminous by itself only to <em>Iśvara</em>, the muktas and the _nitya_s and not to others. There is nothing unreasonable in this view.</p>
<p>It has been said in the following <em>śloka</em>  :</p>
<p>“We <sup id="fnref:164"><a href="#fn:164" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">164</a></sup> bow to Hari and proceed to expound the s&rsquo;astra called Nyāya-<em>Tattva</em> :- to Hari who sees, directly by perception and of His own accord, all things simultaneously.&rdquo; It may be asked how, to <em>Iśvara</em> who sees all things with His attributive knowledge, Śuddha-sattvam could be<sup id="fnref:165"><a href="#fn:165" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">165</a></sup> luminous by itself, when it is illuminated by the attributive knowledge of <em>Iśvara</em>. The answer is as follows - <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s attributive knowledge apprehends all things including His own divine <em>svarūpa</em> and yet do we not hold that His divine form is luminous by itself? So also it is possible that Śuddhasattvam is self-luminous, though it is apprehended also by the attributive knowledge of <em>Iśvara</em>. This is true also of _nitya_s. When lighting up an object (like a pot), attributive knowledge, it has already been said, is luminous by itself only to its sub-strate, namely, the self or soul. In the same way Śuddha-sattvam may be luminous by itself to those that have attained release in their new state. There is nothing inconceivable in this. The luminosity of attributive knowledge is obstructed at the time when it is not light ing up external objects (like pots ), by past <em>karma</em> of certain kinds. So also the luminosity of Śuddhasattva may meet with obstruction in the state of bondage and may not, therefore, be apprehended by those in <em>samsāra</em>.</p>
<p>A pot is not luminous, because it becomes visible or is seen only when lighted up by the flame of a lamp. The flame of a lamp is luminous, because it does not require anything else to become visible.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>,</p>
<p>‘‘धियः स्वयंप्रकाशत्वं मुक्तौ स्वाभाविकं यथा ।</p>
<p>बद्धे कदाचित्संरुद्धं तथाऽत्राऽपि नियम्यते ॥’’१४-अ॥</p>
<p>The luminosity of (attributive) knowledge is natural to it (svabhavika), after release from <em>samsāra</em>, but is obstructed some times during bondage. So also in this case, (there may be obstruction during <em>samsāra</em> and luminousness after release)&quot;.</p>
<p>Substances which are subject to modification (vikarī) are sometimes agreeable and sometimes disagreeable to the same individual and to different individuals. (Similarly Śuddha-sattvam may be luminous to God, the eternally free souls and those souls that have attained release from bondage, while being non-luminous to those in bondage.) There is no contradiction in this. In matters ascertained by the authority of the Scriptures, it is no use pointing out inconsistency based on analogy. If, without accepting this principle, we were to say that Śuddhasattvam is said to be luminous not in reality, but by courtesy, as it were, or figuratively (upacāra), it might become possible to argue that knowledge, bliss etc. are also true of the self or soul only figuratively and not in truth. It may be asked :-&quot; How could there be, in a luminous object (viz. s&rsquo;uddhasattvam), qualities like form and taste and classifications like earth and water and also modifications. Self luminous things like the soul and attributive knowledge do not, in general, have shape, taste, smell and the like)&quot;? The answer is as follows:- (All self-luminous objects are not alike but have differences peculiar to each); for example, knowledge or self which is the substrate (1.e. the soul) and attributive knowledge, though both are luminous, are different from each other in other respects. Knowledge, which is the substrate, has subjectivity, while attributive knowledge is objective, and apprehends objects. So this objection can be given a counter-check (pratibandhi) and cannot hold good in a matter where the authority of the śāstra  must be accepted. Śuddhasattvam, which is luminous, is included among the three classes of non-sentient things, because it has not the quality of sentience or being the knower. The activities (<em>pravṛtti</em>) of these three kinds of non-sentient things are of the nature of varied modifications (pariņāma) in accordance with the will of <em>Iśvara</em>.</p>
<p><em>PRAKṚTI</em>.</p>
<p>Among these, <em>prakṛti</em> or matter is, in its essential nature, possessed of three qualities or attributes. <em>Prakṛti</em> or matter is constantly subject to modification. When its three qualities sattvam, rajas and tamas are evenly balanced, there is dissolution or termination of the world (mahapralayam) and when these qualities are uneven in proportions, <em>prakṛti</em> undergoes modifications into mahat and the like. The region of matter which is not modified and the region which has become modified have been classified by the _Śāstra_s into twenty-four tatvās or reals - <em>prakṛti</em>, mahut, ahankāra, tanınātras (five), the elements (bhūtas) (five) and the senses (eleven) - the senses of knowledge (five), the senses of action (five) and the mind (manas).</p>
<p>Sometimes they are spoken of as more than twenty-four or less than twenty-four in accordance with the terms or basis of classification. The subdivisions of each of these classes of _tattva_s or reals, and the deities (abhimāni devatās ) presiding over or representing each of them should be understood by those who are qualified for their respective meditation. What we are primarily concerned with here is their being different from the atmā or self. These may all be understood as weapons and ornaments of the Supreme Being, in the following way</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>पुरुडन् मणिवरमागप् पॊण्ड्रामूलप्</p>
<p>पिरगिरुदि मऱुवाग मान् ऱण्डागत्</p>
<p>तॆरुण्मरुळ् वाण्मऱैवाग वाङ्गारङ्गळ्</p>
<p>शार्ङ्गञ् जङ्गाग मनन् दिगिरियाग</p>
<p>इरुडीगङ्गळीरैन्दुञ् शरङ्गळाग</p>
<p>विरुबूदमालै वनमालैयाग</p>
<p>करुडनुरुवा मऱैयिन् पॊरुळाङ् गण्णन्</p>
<p>करिगिरिमेनिण्ड्रनैत्तुङ् गाक्किण्ड्राने. (12)</p>
<p>The self or soul is the invaluable gem, (koustubha); <em>prakṛti</em> or matter is the mole on the Lord&rsquo;s body (<em>Śrī_vatsa); the <em>tattva</em> or real called mahat is His club; knowledge and ignorance (<em>jñāna</em> and a_jñāna</em>) are His sword and its sheath; the ahankāras are His bow and conch (tamasa ahankāra is the bow (sārnga ) and sātvika ahankāra the conch); the mind is His discus (chakra); the ten senses are arrows; the tanmātras and the bhūtas (the elements) form His vanamālā (vaijayanti) or garland of wild flowers; Garuḍa is the Veda and Śrī kṛṣṇa (Kannan) the object of description in the Veda, is endowed with these and protects all from the top of Hastigiri&quot;.</p>
<p>The distinctive features of each of these twenty-four reals&rsquo; may be seen in their respective definitions. Of these the twenty three reals which are effects and modifications of <em>prakṛti</em> and also their effects and modifications differ from one another in their nature and these differences may be understood from a study of the purānas.</p>
<p>ESSENTIAL NATURE, ACTIVITY ETC. OF <em>PRAKṚTI</em>:</p>
<p>Śuddhasattvam<sup id="fnref:166"><a href="#fn:166" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">166</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;Satvam or Śuddhasattvam illumines its own existence; it is different from the quality called sattvam&rdquo; &ldquo;The creator<sup id="fnref:167"><a href="#fn:167" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">167</a></sup> is beyond tamas;&rsquo; &ldquo;It is different from<sup id="fnref:168"><a href="#fn:168" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">168</a></sup> <em>prakṛti</em> and is revered by the gods&rdquo;. These and other passages declare the existence of a region (of s&rsquo;uddha sattvam) beyond tamas. Therefore the passages which say<sup id="fnref:169"><a href="#fn:169" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">169</a></sup> &ldquo;It (<em>Prakṛti</em>) is eternal and has no limits and is beyond all measure. It is endless and incapable of being measured” should be understood as stating that moola <em>prakṛti</em> or matter is endless or infinite except for the region covered by the <em>nitya</em> vibhūti (the region of eternal glory).</p>
<p>The activity or <em>pravṛtti</em> of matter (or <em>prakṛti</em>) is to become modified with its three qualities duly balanced ( during pralaya), and with them as a given after creation (_śrī_shti), for the sake of the experience of souls bound in samsarā, and for their release from bondage and so also for the delectation or <em>līlā</em> of <em>Iśvara</em>. It also acts in various ways, having assumed the forms of the body and the senses. Owing to the qualities of rajas and tamas in it, it conceals the truths concerning the reals&rsquo; (_tattva_s) and gives rise to false or erroneous knowledge. While existing for the experiences of the <em>baddha</em> during <em>samsāra</em>, it may also reveal the _tattva_s or &lsquo;reals. just as they are, when the quality of sattvam in it is developed and may help in the striving for <em>mokṣa</em>. All these contribute to the delectation or <em>līlā</em> of <em>Iśvara</em>.</p>
<p>Śuddhasattvam is, in its essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>), the seat or abode of that sattvam which is unmixed with rajas and tamas. Its specific state in time or sthiti is eternal in the (permanent) halls and towers (of Vaikuṇṭha  ) and in the specific and permanent forms of <em>Iśvara</em> and the eternally free. It is not eternal but temporary in such things as the forms that come into existence out of a temporary desire of <em>Iśvara</em>, of the _nitya_s and of the muktas. Its specific activity is to undergo modifications to suit their desires so as to serve as accessories for the enjoyment (Bhoga) of <em>Iśvara</em>, the <em>śeṣī</em>, and as instruments for the service to be rendered by the _śeṣa_s.</p>
<p>TIME: Kāla.</p>
<p>Time or Kāla is, in its essential nature, non-sentient or non luminous and all-pervasive (vibhu). It is eternal because its continued existence ( sthiti) is not limited by time. Its activity consists in its being accessory to creation and the like by such divisions as kală (1/30 of muhūrta ), kāṣṭha (1/30 of <em>kāla</em>) and the like.</p>
<p>All these substances (dravya ) are, in their essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>), eternal. Some of them are said to be temporary or transient, owing to their assuming a new state or condition (avastha), which justifies their being called by a new name. As new states similar to those which have perished follow each other in continuous succession, they are said to be eternal in the sense of a stream or current of water (retaining the same form, though the water at any time may be different ).</p>
<p>The essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>), the existence in time (sthiti), and the activity (<em>pravṛtti</em>) of all these substances are dependent upon <em>Iśvara</em>, because they have no existence etc, apart from His existence and without His will or desire. Therefore it is due to <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s will that all substances are, by their very nature, agreeable. From this it follows that to <em>Iśvara</em>, to the eternally free and to the released souls, they are all agreeable. To those bound in <em>samsāra</em>, however, they appear as disagreeable or as only slightly agreeable at different times and to different persons in accordance with the <em>karma</em> of those persons. Even to bound souls, the essential Nature of their own self or soul is always to be agreeable, as such is the will of <em>Iśvara</em>. It is indeed, because of this false identification with the self which is agreeable and also <em>karma</em>, that the body which is disagreeable appears agreeable to those who are ignorant. Since <em>prakṛti</em> and its modifications are harmful owing to <em>karma</em>, the man who desires release from bondage should abandon the attachment to them. To those that have attained <em>mokṣa</em> , however, these very things are agreeable and not to be rejected. All those things that are taken for one&rsquo;s own with the notion of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mine&rsquo; are harmful. They become agreeable, when a man has come to understand his real nature and to realise that these things exist for the purposes of the Lord. We will explain this matter at length when we come to speak of the perfect and complete enjoyment of (the bliss of ) <em>Brahman</em>.</p>
<p><em>IŚVARA</em> :</p>
<p>The essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em> ) of <em>Iśvara</em> on whom depends the existence of all things is truth (satyam), knowledge (<em>jñāna</em>),infiniteness ( ananta ), bliss (<em>ānanda</em> ) and purity (amalatvam ) because of attributes like being truth, being knowledge, being infinite, being blissful and being pure. These attributes define His <em>svarūpa</em> or essential nature. This truth is brought out by the Alwars in the following passages: &ldquo;Thou <sup id="fnref:170"><a href="#fn:170" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">170</a></sup> art light that never becomes extinct and is not capable of being measured&rdquo; (where His essential nature as Truth and knowledge is revealed as also His infiniteness ) &quot; Thou that <sup id="fnref:171"><a href="#fn:171" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">171</a></sup> art perfect knowledge and bliss&rdquo; and “Thou <sup id="fnref:172"><a href="#fn:172" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">172</a></sup> that envelopest all and art a Light greater than all other lights, being both knowledge and bliss&rdquo; &ldquo;He is the <sup id="fnref:173"><a href="#fn:173" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">173</a></sup> Pure&rdquo;. In these and other ways the Alwars meditated on Him. His other qualities, along with His divine and auspicious form and such other things, are attributes of His essential nature ( <em>svarūpa</em>) already defined by those attributes. Among these qualities knowledge, strength, lordship, valour, energy, splendour-these six are associated with His nature as the Supreme Being. Goodness, spontaneous love, and the like are qualities that make him easily accessible to all. These qualities are, at all times, connected with His essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em> ). The statement that some of these qualities are associated with the Supreme Person (<em>Para</em>), some with <em>vyūha</em> and so forth is only to show what qualities the Lord of all reveals to those who are devoted to any of these manifestations of His. (It does not mean that the other qualities are absent in any of these forms). Just as in the respective _vidyā_s of the Upaniṣads, we are to meditate on certain specified attributes of <em>Brahman</em>, so also certain specified attributes are to be meditated upon in connection with particular forms of the Lord as revealed in Pūncharātra or the Scripture of the Lord. In the <em>Para</em> or Supreme <em>Vāsudeva</em>, all the six <sup id="fnref:174"><a href="#fn:174" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">174</a></sup> qualities<sup id="fnref:175"><a href="#fn:175" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">175</a></sup> beginning with knowledge are to be thought of. The _śāstra_s sometimes say that the vyuhas (or emanations ) are four  and in some places that they are three. where it is said that there are four vyūhas and that <em>Vāsudeva</em> is one of them, since there is no difference in the qualities to be meditated on between the Supreme <em>Vāsudeva</em> and the <em>Vyūha</em> <em>Vāsudeva</em>, it is tantamount to saying that there are three vyuhas. Those who hold that the vyūhas are three state their view briefly in the following <em>śloka</em>  :- &ldquo;O Lord, Thy original form shone with these six attributes; then came three forms of Thine which had, each of them, a couple of these attributes.&rdquo; Their respective qualities and activities are epitomised in the following <em>śloka</em>  :&ndash; &ldquo;O, Sovereign of <sup id="fnref:176"><a href="#fn:176" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">176</a></sup> <em>Śrī_r_aṅga</em>! As the Supreme <em>Vāsudeva</em> (<em>Para</em>) endowed with all the six qualities, you are the object of blissful enjoyment for those that have attained <em>mokṣa</em> ; as <em>Saṅkarṣaṇa</em> being endowed with strength and knowledge, you destroy the Universe and also promulgate the _śāstra_s; as Pradyumna being endowed with lordship and virility, you create the Universe and make <em>Dharma</em> prevail; as Aniruddha being endowed with splendour and the power to overcome others, you protect the world and teach the Truth. In this way you divide yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six Qualities or Gunas: 1. _Jñāna _( Knowledge) . 2. Aiśvarya Lord ship; unimpeded activity; activity based on independence 3. <em>Śakti</em> (ability) potency to become the material cause of the world; also the power of bringing about what appears impossible of being brought about; 4. bala strength; absence of fatigue; sustaining power; 5. Vīrya virility; changelessness in spite of being the material cause of the world; 6.tejas splendour, might, the power to overcome others.</p>
<p>The differences arising from planes like the waking state have been thus summarised :-&ldquo;O Lord, <sup id="fnref:177"><a href="#fn:177" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">177</a></sup> of <sup id="fnref:178"><a href="#fn:178" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">178</a></sup> those that meditate on Thee, some are like those in the waking state, some like those that dream in sleep, others like those that sleep without dreams, and others still are like those that have fallen into a swoon. (In the first group, the senses function, in the second the senses do not function, only the wind is active; in the third group even the wind does not function; they only breathe; in the fourth group even the breath is suspended). In the same way, O Lord, Thou art in four forms and dividest Thyself into four forms and art meditated upon with attributes and weapons suited to each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sloka cannot be understood without the account given in the Appendix.</p>
<p>The twelve forms that begin with Keśava are other forms derived from the vyūhas. (<em>Bhagavān</em> also manifests Himself as vibhavas.) These vibhavas are thirty odd forms like Padmanabha. Among them Avatars like Matsya and Kurma are specified in relation to some specific purpose. In these vibhavas or avatārs, <em>Iśvara</em> conceals those attributes of His which He wants to conceal and reveals those attributes which He wants to reveal to suit the special mission which He has undertaken in them. Among them, there are varied manifestations which are countless. So has it been said, &ldquo;The <sup id="fnref:179"><a href="#fn:179" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">179</a></sup> forms of Kṛṣṇa are innumerable&rdquo;, Other forms similarly derived from the vibhavas can also be seen in the _śāstra_s. Sometimes the Lord enters into some _jīva_s with His own specific form and into others with His energy (<em>śakti</em>) and accomplishes wonderful things. These belong to another class of vibhavas. The forms of the Supreme <em>Vāsudeva</em> (<em>Para</em>), the Vyuhas and the Vibhavas assume the <sup id="fnref:180"><a href="#fn:180" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">180</a></sup> forms<sup id="fnref:181"><a href="#fn:181" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">181</a></sup> of the images and enter into the shapes of images (installed in temples), for the sake of devotees as desired by them. This is arcāvatara: The Lord is (also) present in a subtle form in the hearts of all <em>jīva_s. This form is called Antaryāmi <em>Avatāra</em>, as meditation on this form has been prescribed as the means which enables those who wish to enter into the meditation of the Antaryāmin or the divine all-pervading <em>svarūpa</em> of the Lord. It has been said of this meditation: &ldquo;Those <sup id="fnref:182"><a href="#fn:182" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">182</a></sup> who have attained success in Asht_aṅga</em> <em>yoga</em> and who are desirous of worshipping the one who dwells in the heart are fit to meditate on the one (i.e.) the form in which He dwells in the hearts of all.&rdquo; Therefore this One (Hārda) is spoken as Antaryāmi.</p>
<p>Sātvatasamhita: 6-22 This is stated in the following passage: &ldquo;He assumes a form similar to that of the image, enters into it, and remains there”.</p>
<p>All these forms of incarnation are constituted of the substance called s&rsquo;uddhasattvam and have no connection with <em>karma</em> or its fruits. They are therefore called pure creation (s&rsquo;uddha _śrī_shti). These avatārs (vibhava, <em>arcā</em> and Hārda ) are all real; in them there is no contraction or abridgement of <em>jñāna</em> and the other attributes of <em>Iśvara</em>; the bodies of these avatārs are made of Śuddha-sattvam; the reason for these avatars is only the Lord&rsquo;s will; their time of manifestation is the time when <em>dharma</em> has to be safe-guarded; their purpose is the protection of the good and the like; those who meditate on these avatars with clear knowledge may attain <em>mokṣa</em>  at the end of this very life without any future birth, by their successful adoption of the right means suited to their competency and capacity. All these truths have. been explained by the Gitācharya in five <em>śloka</em> s beginning with:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bahuni me <sup id="fnref:183"><a href="#fn:183" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">183</a></sup> vyatītāni etc.&rdquo; Many are the births that I have gone through, just like you.”</p>
<p>This meditation on the vibhavas (or avatārs) creates supreme faith or confidence (mahāvisvāsa) in the mind of the seeker after salvation who seeks <em>prapatti</em> as an independent means or <em>upāya</em>, by affording him a knowledge of the great qualities of the Lord who is sought as the refuge and this at the moment when he adopts <em>prapatti</em> as the means. So also the worship of Archāvatāra (the image) will lead easily to <em>mokṣa</em>. <em>Bhagavān</em> Śaunaka has said :-<sup id="fnref:184"><a href="#fn:184" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">184</a></sup> &quot; Having shaped a beautiful image of Viṣṇu  with a lovely face and lovely eyes, out of gold, silver and the like in a manner that would be pleasing, one should adore it, bow to it, sacrifice to it and meditate on it. By doing so, one would enter into that form which is none other than <em>Brahman</em> and will have all one&rsquo;s sins dispelled.&rdquo; The Alwars, too, very largely dwelt on this secret doctrine about the Lord&rsquo;s avatārs and the distinctive excellence of the avatars in the form of <em>arcā</em> or consecrated images and considered the Supreme Self (in Vaikuṇṭha  ) as their original cause.</p>
<p><em>Iśvara</em>, who is in these varied forms, creates, maintains and destroys all, is also the giver of <em>mokṣa</em>  and has such other activities. These activities of His are due to the overflow of His bliss or ānanda.</p>
<p>Lakṣmī</p>
<p><em>Iśvara</em> is with His consort in all situations as stated in passages like : &ldquo;Lakṣmī , the <sup id="fnref:185"><a href="#fn:185" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">185</a></sup> mother of the world, is eternal and inseparable from Viṣṇu .&rdquo; This may also be clearly understood from the writings of Parāśara and Parankusa (Nammalwar), who, for the help which they have rendered, have been spoken of by Alavandar with great regard in these terms: &ldquo;I bow to the generous sage, Parāśara, who composed that gem of a purāņa (_Viṣṇu_purāna), wherein he discloses, as they are in reality, the truths concerning <em>cit</em>, <em>acit</em> apd <em>Iśvara</em>, their distinctive nature, swarga, <em>mokṣa</em>  and the means of attaining them&rdquo; and &ldquo;I bow my head at the two feet of Nammalwar fragrant with vakula flowers, for they are, to all those who are connected with me, mother, father, wives, 8008 and all forms of wealth and lordship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this context, we have to understand a difference in their activities or division of labour, as it were ; for the Lord is concerned with the punishment (of the evildoer) and Lakṣmī  with pleading to Him for mercy on behalf of the sinner; the Mimāmsakas have declared that the object which is stated by analogy to have attributes similar to those of another object actually described must be different by that very circumstance<sup id="fnref:186"><a href="#fn:186" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">186</a></sup> from that other object. So in this case, as it has been stated by analogy or atides&rsquo;a &ldquo;Just<sup id="fnref:187"><a href="#fn:187" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">187</a></sup> as Viṣṇu  is everywhere, so also is Lakṣmī , O, best of Brahmins&rdquo;, there should be a difference between <em>Bhagavān</em> and Lakṣmī . This difference should be understood as referring (here) only to the difference in their functions or activities. This is the conclusion arrived at in the following <em>śloka</em>  in _Śrī_gunaratnakosa; &ldquo;Youth and other attributes are common to both of you; however the Lord has manly qualities, like independence, conquest of foes, firmness and the like; you have such feminine qualities as existing solely for the husband, compassion and forgiveness. Thus you two have taken diverse qualities.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is impossible to understand the real nature of God&rdquo;, says Nammalvar in (1-3-6). So in a matter like this, vain assertion or insistence is not proper,</p>
<p>Without requiring any other authority to prove it. The different activities shared by Lakṣmī  and Her Lord are determined by their own will and not by difference in the nature of the two.</p>
<p>As has been said: &ldquo;Some make <sup id="fnref:188"><a href="#fn:188" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">188</a></sup> weak cases appear strong.&rdquo; Although it is possible to prove whatever we please with the help of our proficiency in logical disputation, we submit to the Authority of the _śāstra_s. Therefore we should understand clearly the truth concerning the Real or <em>Tattva</em> that rules and the reals or _tattva_s that are ruled, only in accordance with the _pramāṇa_s. We need not try to know all things but should try to know what is exceedingly useful. In matters which are only of limited use, we need not be so curious to obtain knowledge. The pilot tries to know just as much about the (vast) ocean as  would enable him to steer the ship along the right path. Similarly we have to understand, necessarily, as much as has been said here. In order to obtain unshakable conviction (about these truths), more elaborate treatises may be studied.</p>
<p>OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE TATVAS</p>
<p>OR ‘REALS&rsquo;:</p>
<p>Here we have classified the _Tattva_s into three. So also some consider <em>Iśvara</em> 48 the only real or <em>Tattva</em>, because all other reals are His attributes. Some have classified the _tattva_s into two as follows: The ruler and the ruled; the self and the non-self; the means and the end (<em>upāya</em> and <em>upeya</em> ). Some classify what should be known into four : the Saviour and that which is to be saved; that which should be rejected and that which should be accepted. Others classify what should be known ander five heads as pointed out before and others into six. In the Rahasya_śāstra_s, what should be known is stated to be seven. To all those who think in those varied ways, there are respective advantages accruing to the strengthening of their knowledge and their daily observances.</p>
<p>What is said in the following <em>śloka</em> , is of course true: &ldquo;A knowledge<sup id="fnref:189"><a href="#fn:189" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">189</a></sup> of the śāstras can be obtained only with the greatest difficulty. Further it may unsettle the mind. Therefore having obtained a knowledge of Hari from the teaching of the <em>guru</em>, a man should cease from all such activities.&rdquo; This does not mean that one should make no attempt to learn the _śāstra_s. It only means that one should learn what is most important as quickly as possible and proceed at once to adopt the means learnt therefrom for attaining <em>mokṣa</em> , without spending too much time over elaborate treatises, which might cause delay in the adoption of the means. The man who has enough to eat without tilling the soil would never think of tilling it. So also without wasting time over what is unimportant, we should, as soon as possible, adopt the means prescribed for <em>mokṣa</em> ,</p>

<p>Our ancient _ācārya_s who gave as the essence of the Veda have, out of compassion (for us), taught us clearly all about the three wonderful and varied _tattva_s, <em>cit</em>, <em>acit</em> and <em>Iśvara</em> in order to remove,&rsquo; from our minds, the cruel delusion in regard to the body arising from <em>karma</em> and the notion that we are independent (of the Lord).</p>

<p>By the addition of a point here and the omission of a point there, there are countless systems of thought, each appearing beautiful with fallacious arguments owing to the endless differences due to &lsquo;is&rsquo; and &lsquo;is not&rsquo;. These are indeed as numerous as the poems composed by the imagination of poets (some omitting an incident and others inventing an incident and so forth). Notwithstanding this, the unparalleled vision of the truth (about the _tattva_s) will make them all vanish at once into thin air. When the man is seen in reality, the delusion that he is an animal or a log of wood, sthāņu vanishes at once. So also when, with the help of the _pramāṇa_s, <em>Puruṣottama</em> is ascertained as the Supreme Deity, the delusion that Rudra (<em>Sthāṇu</em>) or any other is the Supreme Deity is at once dispelled.</p>

<li>THE CHAPTER ON THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE SUPREME DEITY. page131</li>

<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>आत्मैक्यं देवतैक्यं त्रिकसमधिगतातुल्यतैक्यं त्रयाणा</p>
<p>मन्यत्रैश्वर्यमित्याद्यनिपुणफणितीराद्रियन्ते न सन्तः ।</p>

<p>Those who are not proficient in the śāstra s say that there is only a single self, that all deities (like Indra, Agni and so on) are only one, that the three deities (<em>Brahma</em>, Viṣṇu  and Siva), when properly understood, are alike and of equal rank, that these three deities are only one deity (in three forms) and that the Supreme Deity is other than these three and hold other such (erroneous) views, but those who havediscrimination entertain no regard for these (divergent views). The Upaniṣads, with one voice, and so also Manu, Vyāsa and others, following the Upaniṣads, proclaim that <em>Śrīman</em> Nārāyaṇa  is our Lord who has all (things and beings) for His body, that He (alone) can give <em>mukti</em> and that He is the object of blissful enjoyment for those who have attained <em>mokṣa</em> ,</p>
<p>WHY SHOULD WE DETERMINE WHO THE</p>
<p>SUPREME DEITY IS:</p>
<p>All &lsquo;reals&rsquo; have been classified into matter ( <em>Prakṛti</em>), the individual self and the Supreme Self or <em>Iśvara</em> on the basis of the differences among them pointed out before. (From a knowledge of this classification alone), it is not possible to attain supreme devotion to a single deity to the exclusion of all others, unless the truth as to who is the Supreme Deity has been ascertained as in the words of the Alwar: &ldquo;She will not worship any god other than <em>Bhagavān</em> nor dream of any such god&rdquo;. Further, to no one but the exclusive devotee of the Supreme Deity, is <em>mokṣa</em>  possible of attainment without delay. So it is necessary to decide who is the Supreme Deity.</p>
<p>CRITICISM OF ERRONEOUS VIEWS:</p>
<p>In this context, the view that all (things and beings) are the substance of <em>Brahman</em> cannot be accepted, since sentient and non-sentient things are known by the pramāņas.to be entirely different from one another. In the same way, the essential differences between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>Iśvara</em> cannot be ignored (and they disprove the view that they are one). Similarly the mutual differences among the gods are based on the pramaņas, because of their association with varied pleasures and pains. Therefore, though the indwelling Supreme Self, Antaryāmin is one, the view that <em>Brahma</em>, Rudra, and the other gods are not different from <em>Iśvara</em> and from one another cannot be justified.</p>
<p>BRAHMĀ, RUDRA AND OTHERS ARE</p>
<p>CREATED BEINGS:</p>
<p>Those who are considered as the chief among these gods, namely, <em>Brahma</em>, Rudra, Indra and others are created beings subject to the law of <em>karma</em>, as can be proved by pramāņas. It has been said, &ldquo;When <sup id="fnref:190"><a href="#fn:190" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">190</a></sup> &lsquo;all individual beings and even the aggregate <em>jīva</em> (Samashti) have gone into dissolution and when mahat has become merged into <em>prakṛti</em> (from which it evolved), there is one remaining as the soul of the universe and He is the Lord Nārāyaṇa .&rdquo; Again it is said, “The <sup id="fnref:191"><a href="#fn:191" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">191</a></sup> god Nārāyaṇa  is at the beginning; from Him arises <em>Brahma</em>&quot;, &ldquo;<sup id="fnref:192"><a href="#fn:192" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">192</a></sup> Nārāyaṇa  is the Supreme Deity; From Him was born <em>Brahma</em>, the four-faced, and from <em>Brahma</em> arose Rudra, O goddess &ldquo;, and further, it is stated, &ldquo;Then you, &ldquo;<sup id="fnref:193"><a href="#fn:193" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">193</a></sup> the irresistible, assumed the form of <em>Viṣṇu</em> from that eternal existence (viz. Nārāyaṇa ) for the protection of all beings.&rdquo; From this it is clear that, by his own will, He incarnated as the middle one (i.e. Viṣṇu ) of the Trinity. He who is expressed by the names, <em>Viṣṇu</em> and Nārāyaṇa , iş stated to have been the ultimate cause of the world in His previous and original state. It is also said elsewhere, &quot; There is no &ldquo;<sup id="fnref:194"><a href="#fn:194" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">194</a></sup> being in the world that is eternal, either among those that move or among those that do not move, except that one Primaeval Purusha called <em>Vāsudeva</em>.&rdquo; This declares that He alone is eternal. Therefore, other views such as the following: &ldquo;The gods of the trinity (<em>Brahma</em>, Viṣṇu , and Siva), are of equal greatness&rdquo;; &ldquo;The three gods of the Trinity are only one&rdquo;, &ldquo;<em>Iśvara</em> is above and beyond the Trinity&rdquo; &ldquo;Either <em>Brahma</em> or Rudra among the Trinity is the Supreme Lord &ldquo;-these views stating equality, identity, the existence of an entity superior to all the three of the Trinity and the supremacy of a different member of the Trinity, are against the pramāņas. That <em>Brahma</em>, Rudra, and the like are created beings subject to <em>karma</em> may be seen in the following passages :-&rdquo; The <sup id="fnref:195"><a href="#fn:195" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">195</a></sup> purusha or person created by Him (Nārāyaṇa ) is called <em>Brahma</em> in the world&rdquo;. &ldquo;Having <sup id="fnref:196"><a href="#fn:196" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">196</a></sup> caused the dissolution of the worlds before, you lay on the waters of the great ocean and created me at first by your Māya (will)&rdquo;, &quot; <em>Brahma</em>&rsquo;s name <sup id="fnref:197"><a href="#fn:197" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">197</a></sup> is Ka and I, Isa rule over all embodied beings. We two were born from your limbs. Therefore you are called Keśava (Ka and Isa)&rdquo;. Further <em>Brahma</em> says, &ldquo;I was <sup id="fnref:198"><a href="#fn:198" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">198</a></sup> born from His graciousness for some reason and you, from His wrath, for some other reason, in one of the earlier creations.&rdquo; The very words of these rival gods, which are, so to say, a deed of release written with their own hands, declare this truth. That <em>Brahma</em> and Rudra are subject to <em>karma</em> and attained their high status, because of having worshipped the Lord of all with special rites, may be seen from the following passages : &ndash; &ldquo;All the <sup id="fnref:199"><a href="#fn:199" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">199</a></sup> gods sacrifice to <em>Vāsudeva</em> and all the gods bow to <em>Vāsudeva</em>.&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Brahma</em>, <sup id="fnref:200"><a href="#fn:200" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">200</a></sup> Rudra and Indra, together with all other gods and the great rishis worship the divine Nārāyaṇa  or Hari, the greatest of Gods &ldquo;, &quot; Meditating <sup id="fnref:201"><a href="#fn:201" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">201</a></sup> constantly on the</p>
<p>Lord, <em>Brahma</em>, Isana (Rudra) and others have not yet attained to a realisation of His nature. It is He whose protection I seek.&rdquo; And <em>Brahma</em> says :- &quot; Having <sup id="fnref:202"><a href="#fn:202" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">202</a></sup> created me in the divine lotus in your navel shining like the sun, you have assigned to me all the duties of creation (of Prajāpati) and with this burden imposed on me, I worship you, the Lord of the Universe.&rdquo; And in another place, we find the following :- &ldquo;<em>Brahma</em>, <sup id="fnref:203"><a href="#fn:203" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">203</a></sup> born of the lotus, having worshipped <em>Viṣṇu</em> for thousands of crores of yugas, obtained again the position of the creator of the three worlds. This is what we have heard.&rdquo; So also it is said :-&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:204"><a href="#fn:204" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">204</a></sup> Mahadeva (Rudra), who is called Viswarupa, sacrificed all things in a great yajna called Sarvamedha and then sacrificed himself also mentally&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mahadeva sacrificed himself in the Sarvamedha and became the god of gods. The <sup id="fnref:205"><a href="#fn:205" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">205</a></sup> resplendent Rudra, clad in the skin of the elephant, reaches all the worlds with his knowledge and shines with his fame&rdquo;. &ldquo;Since in this <sup id="fnref:206"><a href="#fn:206" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">206</a></sup> great sacrifice, he gave me my share of the offering, he has been authorised by me, in the Vedas and the _Sūtra_s, as fit to receive his share of the offerings.&rdquo; These gods, <em>Brahma</em>, Rudra and others are dependent upon the Maya of <em>Bhagavān</em> ((i.e.) <em>Prakṛti</em>) and are subject to the influence of the gunas (sattvam, rajas and tamas). Their knowledge is also subject to contraction and expansion. All this may be understood from the incidents of the loss of the Vedas and others and also from the following <em>śloka</em>  :-&ldquo;All the <sup id="fnref:207"><a href="#fn:207" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">207</a></sup> gods beginning with <em>Brahma</em>, all men, and all animals are enveloped by the dense darkness of delusion arising from the whirlwind of Viṣṇu &rsquo;s Maya (<em>Prakṛti</em>),&rdquo; &ldquo;The wise say that <sup id="fnref:208"><a href="#fn:208" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">208</a></sup> these (positions) are the rewards of those who follow the good path of Satva, namely, <em>Brahma</em> and the other creators, and the deities presiding over <em>karma</em>, mahat and avyaktam&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE OTHER GODS ARE THE SERVANTS</p>
<p>OF BHAGAVĀN.</p>
<p>That these (<em>Brahma</em> and Rudra) render service to the Lord, who is their inner self, with the help of the knowledge given to them by Him may be seen from the following <em>śloka</em>  : &ldquo;These two<sup id="fnref:209"><a href="#fn:209" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">209</a></sup> , who are the greatest among the gods, are considered to have been born (respectively) out of His (<em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s) graciousness and wrath; and they perform the duties of creation and destruction in accordance with the lines laid down by Him.&rdquo; They are not pure and are not objects for spiritual meditation (subhasraya), for it has been said: &ldquo;<em>Bhagavān</em> <sup id="fnref:210"><a href="#fn:210" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">210</a></sup> Hiranyagarbha (<em>Brahma</em>), Vasava (Indra) and Prajāpati &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; all these gods and others are impure, their births being due to past <em>karma</em>&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;From <em>Brahma</em><sup id="fnref:211"><a href="#fn:211" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">211</a></sup> to the blade of grass, all beings that have their existence in the world have had their births as the result of <em>karma</em> and are subject to the cycle of births and deaths ( <em>samsāra</em>)&rdquo; and further, “The <sup id="fnref:212"><a href="#fn:212" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">212</a></sup> man who has no attachment (to the things of this world) should know that every being including <em>Brahma</em> is impure as being tainted by the ripening of <em>karma</em> &ndash; to Him, <em>Vāsudeva</em> alone is the Supreme Goal or refuge.&quot; These statements have been made by Parāśara, Śaunaka, Śuka  and others. <em>Brahma</em>, Rudra and others have to seek <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s protection and <em>Bhagavān</em> has to seek nobody else&rsquo;s protection. This is clear from His own words :&ldquo;The gods<sup id="fnref:213"><a href="#fn:213" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">213</a></sup> are under the protection of Rudra, O King, and Rudra is under the protection of <em>Brahma</em>. <em>Brahma</em> is under my protection and I do not seek the protection of any one. There is no one that I need for my protection, for I am the refuge of all.&rdquo; These gods are among the great possessions (<em>vibhūti</em>) of <em>Bhagavān</em>, who is the Lord of both lilā_vibhūti_ and <em>nitya</em>-vibhūti,) &mdash; for it is said, “<em>Brahma</em><sup id="fnref:214"><a href="#fn:214" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">214</a></sup> Daksha and others, Kala, Rudra and the destroyer of Kala - all these are among the _vibhūti_s of <em>Bhagavān</em>,&quot; where <em>Brahma</em> and Rudra are spoken of as being on the same footing as Daksha and others.</p>
<p>THE OTHER GODS ARE THE PRAKĀRAS OR</p>
<p>MODES OF BHAGAVĀN.</p>
<p>These gods (<em>Brahma</em>, Rudra etc.) are, like others, the modes or prakāras of the Lord of all who has all things as His body. This is clear from the grammatical apposition or co-ordination (sāmānādhikaranya) in which they are used, just like other substances, in connection with such words as Nārāyaṇa . (For example it is said that Rudra is Nārāyaṇa , <em>Brahma</em> is Nārāyaṇa , the earth is Nārāyaṇa  and so on.)</p>
<p>That these are His bodies and that He is their inner self or goal is evident from these words of <em>Brahma</em> to Rudra :- &ldquo;He is <sup id="fnref:215"><a href="#fn:215" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">215</a></sup> the inner self of you, of me and of all those who are called embodied beings. He sees all but cannot be apprehended by any one, anywhere.&rdquo; These are _śeṣa_s who exist solely for the fulfilment of His purposes and He is their <em>śeṣī</em>. This truth was expressed by the all-knowing Rudra himself in _Mantra_rājapadastotra, where he says, &ldquo;All beings are, by their nature, the servants of the Supreme Self. Therefore I am also Thy servant and, with this knowledge, I bow to Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BHAGAVĀN HAS NEITHER EQUALS NOR SUPERIORS :</p>
<p>Thus Nārāyaṇa  is destitute, in every way, of equals and superiors. This may be seen from the following <em>śloka</em> s :- &ldquo;O best <sup id="fnref:216"><a href="#fn:216" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">216</a></sup> of men, there is no one superior to (Nārāyaṇa)   the god of the lotus-like eyes;&rdquo; &ldquo;There was<sup id="fnref:217"><a href="#fn:217" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">217</a></sup> no one superior to Him in the past nor will there be any one superior to Him in the future : “There is no<sup id="fnref:218"><a href="#fn:218" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">218</a></sup> god superior to Viṣṇu , O best of kings; &quot; &ldquo;There is nothing<sup id="fnref:219"><a href="#fn:219" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">219</a></sup> more auspicious than <em>Vāsudeva</em>, there is nothing more purifying than <em>Vāsudeva</em>. There is no greater divinity than <em>Vāsudeva</em>. No one who adores <em>Vāsudeva</em> ever perishes.&rdquo; &ldquo;In all <sup id="fnref:220"><a href="#fn:220" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">220</a></sup> the three worlds, there was no one like Him ever born and there will be no one like Him born in the future.&rdquo; &quot; There<sup id="fnref:221"><a href="#fn:221" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">221</a></sup> is no divinity higher than Keśava.&rdquo; &ldquo;He is the <sup id="fnref:222"><a href="#fn:222" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">222</a></sup> King of all kings, Viṣṇu , the great <em>Brahman</em>. We know Him to be <em>Iśvara</em>. He is the Father, the Creator.&rdquo; Those who are lucky, even while in their mother&rsquo;s womb and have received, while in the state of being born, the glance of Madhusūdana will become desirous of <em>mokṣa</em> ; for His glance dispels rajas and tamas. Those who are looked at by <em>Brahma</em> and Rudra just before birth will become subject to the influence of rajas and tamas. This difference is brought out in the following passages - &ldquo;He who<sup id="fnref:223"><a href="#fn:223" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">223</a></sup> is looked at by Madhusūdana just as he is being born should be considered to be a pure soul (sātvika) and he will ever think of the goal of <em>mokṣa</em> . Jf, on the other hand, a person is looked at immediately at birth by <em>Brahma</em> or Rudra, his mind will be overcome by rajas and tamas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE ASPIRANT FOR MUKTI SHOULD WORSHIP</p>
<p>ONLY BHAGAVĀN.</p>
<p>That these gods are not to be worshipped by those who desire <em>mokṣa</em>  (and that Nārāyaṇa , the Lord of all, who is the cause of these gods, is alone the deity to be worshipped by all those who desire <em>mokṣa</em> , including these gods) may be seen from the following <em>śloka</em> s :- &ldquo;To those<sup id="fnref:224"><a href="#fn:224" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">224</a></sup> who are sunk in the sea of <em>samsāra</em> and whose minds are overpowered by the objects of sense pleasures, there is no other refuge than the ship of Viṣṇu ,&rdquo; &ldquo;Those who <sup id="fnref:225"><a href="#fn:225" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">225</a></sup> have a discriminating intelligence never worship <em>Brahma</em>, or Rudra or any of the other gods, for the fruit of their worship is very limited,” “Hari alone<sup id="fnref:226"><a href="#fn:226" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">226</a></sup> is fit to be meditated upon, O Brabmins, by you who are noted for your sattvam. He is always to be adored and I am the means for enabling you to remember Hari.” If, in some places, these gods are spoken of as assisting in the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em> , it should be understood to mean that they, like <em>ācārya</em> s, assist by imparting knowledge and in such other ways. This is also the purport of the following passage ; &quot; The man<sup id="fnref:227"><a href="#fn:227" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">227</a></sup> who is a devotee of the god of the sun (Surya) will, after seven more births, become a devotee of Rudra by the Sun&rsquo;s grace. He who is a devotee of Sankara will, after seven more births, become a devotee of Viṣṇu  by the grace of Sankara.&rdquo; And again :&mdash; &ldquo;He who is a devotee of <em>Vāsudeva</em> will, after those seven births, become one with <em>Vāsudeva</em> by His grace.&rdquo; In this context it has to be stated that devotion to Surya and others leads gradually to devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em>, only in the case of those who are not subject to mental delusions about the Supreme Self and the Self&rsquo;s that are below it - such delusions as holding that they are all one or that the lower self is the Supreme Self or that all these divinities are of equal power, and provided they are not filled with the hatred natural to the asuric or demoniac Nature. This is evident from the <em>śloka</em>  : &ldquo;Those who<sup id="fnref:228"><a href="#fn:228" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">228</a></sup> hold Parushottama as being similar to the other deities are to be considered heretics unfit for any kind of <em>karma</em> or rite.&rdquo; People who have such delusions in their knowledge (and worship) will meet with defeat due to the punishment inflicted by <em>Bhagavān</em>, although they have devotion to other deities. From the following <em>śloka</em>  : &ldquo;O mighty Rudra<sup id="fnref:229"><a href="#fn:229" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">229</a></sup> , get _Śāstra_s of deluding import composed and by prompting men to slight effort, show the fruit of these actions as soon as possible&rdquo;-from this <em>śloka</em> , we may infer that, if there is success in achieving t_aṅgī_ble fruits by following these false śāstra s, it is only for making men fall into delusion and thence into hell.</p>
<p>If <em>Bhagavān</em>, whose will is irresistible, decides that some one deserves His punishment, then that person will find no other god capable of protecting him. It is said in the Rāmāyana &quot; If a man has <sup id="fnref:230"><a href="#fn:230" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">230</a></sup> deserved death at the hands of Rama, neither the four-faced <em>Brahma</em>, who was born of no mortal, nor the three-eyed Rudra who destroyed Tripura, nor the great Indra, who is the leader of the gods, will be able to shield him in battle.&quot; If, on the other hand, a man seeks refuge under <em>Bhagavān</em>, even if all the gods and intimate friends of His, like Sugrīva, the great king, propose to injure him, <em>Iśvara</em> will protect him by overcoming wicked men like Ravana who should be overcome, and helping, by persuasion, such good people as the leaders of the monkeys who bad spoken against Vibhishana, as they deserve that course. For has he not said :-&ldquo;To him who<sup id="fnref:231"><a href="#fn:231" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">231</a></sup> has sought my protection even once and begged of me saying, &ldquo;I am thine&rdquo; &ndash; to him I afford protection from all beings. This is my vow&rdquo; and is He not one who ever keeps his word and sees that His vows do not fail ?</p>
<p>THE BOONS GRANTED BY OTHER DEITIES ARE</p>
<p>DEPENDENT ON THE GRACE OF BHAGAVĀN.</p>
<p>If men seek the favour of other gods, they will soon obtain minor rewards which are like poison mixed with honey, for it is said, “Those <sup id="fnref:232"><a href="#fn:232" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">232</a></sup> who desire the fruits of <em>karma</em> or rites perform sacrifices to the gods and obtain the rewards of their actions in the world of men very soon.&quot; And again :- &quot; From them<sup id="fnref:233"><a href="#fn:233" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">233</a></sup> they obtain the objects of their desire as ordained by myself&quot;. The Lord said to the gods :&ndash; &ldquo;This <em>Brahma</em><sup id="fnref:234"><a href="#fn:234" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">234</a></sup> is your father and mother and grandfather, and will, under instructions from me, grant boons to all beings, and Rudra, his younger brother, who had his origin in my forehead, will, under instructions from <em>Brahma</em>, grant boons to all beings&rdquo; As stated in these passages, these are dependent upon <em>Bhagavān</em>. It is said :&ndash; &ldquo;The rewards<sup id="fnref:235"><a href="#fn:235" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">235</a></sup> (obtained from these deities) are of a very limited nature; &quot; &quot; In kalpas<sup id="fnref:236"><a href="#fn:236" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">236</a></sup> or ages when sattva is predominant, Hari&rsquo;s glory becomes great and, only in them, those who have successfully practised <em>yoga</em> in accordance with the <em>śāstra_s will attain the supreme goal.&rdquo; Therefore, from these other deities, <em>mokṣa</em>  cannot be attained even after a length of time. From the Lord of all, on the other hand, a man obtains unsurpassed wealth and the like, even as <sup id="fnref:237"><a href="#fn:237" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">237</a></sup> <em>Brahma</em> attained his high position after worshipping Viṣṇu  for crores of thousands of yugas; and afterwards, like the man who bathes in the G_aṅga</em> for physical refreshment and thereby obtains purification also from all his sins, he gets incidentally freedom from sins; his rajas and tamas decline and his sattvam becomes dominant and, in course of time, he will attain <em>mokṣa</em>  like Janaka, Ambarisha, Kekaya and others. But there is delay in such cases as may be seen in the following passages : &ldquo;At the <sup id="fnref:238"><a href="#fn:238" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">238</a></sup> end of many virtuous lives, the man attains spiritual wisdom and seeks my protection” and again, &quot; Those <sup id="fnref:239"><a href="#fn:239" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">239</a></sup> who have attained success in crores of births will at length become well established here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Those who<sup id="fnref:240"><a href="#fn:240" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">240</a></sup> have, in many thousands of lives, become purified of their sins by penance, meditation and <em>yoga</em> (samadhi) will acquire devotion to Kṛṣṇa,&rdquo; When the desire for <em>mokṣa</em>  has become ardent and when the man practises  <em>upāya</em> which is within his power, there will be no delay in the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em> , for He has declared:<sup id="fnref:241"><a href="#fn:241" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">241</a></sup> &ldquo;To those who have fixed their minds on me - to them I become the redeemer and save them quickly out of the sea of <em>samsāra</em>&rdquo;. To him who adopts <em>prapatti</em> as the independent means, there is neither delay nor absence of delay, except in accordance with his own desire These distinctions will be accepted by all who have regard for the _pramāṇa_s and they have their effect by the will of <em>Iśvara</em> which cannot be questioned, for has it not been said, &quot; The <sup id="fnref:242"><a href="#fn:242" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">242</a></sup> lordship of <em>Iśvara</em> is absolutely independent and brooks no questioning ?&quot; To those who do not clearly understand these principles in this way, the worship of other deities is prescribed in such passages as the following: &ldquo;They may <sup id="fnref:243"><a href="#fn:243" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">243</a></sup> be worshipped by men other than those who have discriminating intelligence,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who worship these other deities without knowing that they are the bodies of <em>Bhagavān</em> are like a follower of Charvaka (a materialist who believes that there is nothing other than the body called the soul) who anoints the body of the king, his master, without knowing that his master has a soul. It is true that the soul of the king is pleased with the service done to his body. In the same way, as a matter of fact, the devotion to these other deities is really the worship of <em>Bhagavān</em>, as they are only His bodies. Notwithstanding this, the fruit of this devotion to the lower deities would be only partial and incomplete. (We may remember in this connection the <em>śloka</em>  in the Gita) which says:- &quot; Those <sup id="fnref:244"><a href="#fn:244" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">244</a></sup> who sacrifice with faith and earnestness to other deities &ndash; they, too, sacrifice only to me, but not in the manner and according to the rules prescribed for it.&quot; Since the rite is performed in an irregular manner without the observance of all the rules, the fruit will be partial and incomplete, If, on the other hand, a man, knowing that these other gods are only the bodies of <em>Bhagavān</em>, offers worship to them owing to a special desire for obtaining quickly the smaller goods of life, the fruit will be fully and completely realised in perfect measure.</p>
<p>The Gita thus speaks of those who approach <em>Bhagavān</em> for minor fruits :-&quot; The man<sup id="fnref:245"><a href="#fn:245" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">245</a></sup> who has lost his wealth but seeks to recover it, the man who wants to enjoy his own soul, and the man who wants to acquire prosperity” All these will have their reward in even greater measure.&quot; Of those who adore <em>Bhagavān</em> without any such desire for minor fruits and only for the sake of <em>mokṣa</em> , it is said, &ldquo;Hari<sup id="fnref:246"><a href="#fn:246" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">246</a></sup> , who confers <em>mokṣa</em> , gives to His worshippers who meditate on Him, health of body, wealth, and enjoyment, in addition to what they desire viz., <em>mokṣa</em> &ldquo;. These are, so to say, adventitious or incidental rewards (ānush_aṅgī_ka ) not sought by them. Śrī Kulasekhara Perumal, to whom such adventitious prosperity was vouchsafed, says in this connection:-&ldquo;The man<sup id="fnref:247"><a href="#fn:247" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">247</a></sup> who desires only Thee and does not seek great prosperity -  prosperity comes and seeks him.&rdquo; Isandan also has stated this in his stotra thus &ldquo;Those enjoyments which were formerly desired but could not be obtained come to us, of their own accord, without any effort or exertion on our part, like rivers flowing into the ocean, (although we do not desire them now).&rdquo; (It may be asked why all those who desire only <em>mokṣa</em>  are not blessed with the good things of this life ). (The answer is):- This is due to the special form of meditation or <em>vidyā</em> practised by the devotee and the special desires of his earlier life. (Some vidyās secure worldly prosperity in addition to <em>mokṣa</em>  after death, while others secure only <em>mokṣa</em> .)</p>
<p>The Alwars, too, have spoken of these differences between the Lord of all on one side and <em>Brahma</em>, Rudra and the other gods on the other side, in passages such as the following: “The gods<sup id="fnref:248"><a href="#fn:248" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">248</a></sup> are only the food eaten by <em>Bhagavān</em> and vomited afterwards, (eaten during pralaya and vomited after creation); are there any (gods) who are not of the nature of this vomit?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nārāyaṇa<sup id="fnref:249"><a href="#fn:249" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">249</a></sup> created the god with four faces, and the god with four faces created Sankara.&rdquo; &ldquo;O Thou<sup id="fnref:250"><a href="#fn:250" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">250</a></sup> that art the original bulb of the lotus of the navel, from which arose <em>Brahma</em>, Siva, Indra and the others who worship you with reverence.” “ Arjuna<sup id="fnref:251"><a href="#fn:251" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">251</a></sup> saw on Siva&rsquo;s head, the flowers of the garland that he had placed at the feet of the holy <em>Bhagavān</em> which had measured the whole world, and understood clearly that Śrīkṛṣṇa was the Supreme Deity wearing garland of green tulasi.&rdquo; &ldquo;Indra<sup id="fnref:252"><a href="#fn:252" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">252</a></sup> who rules over the gods, <em>Brahma</em> the god with four faces, and the great Siva with his matted locks of hair - (all these) meditate with earnestness and</p>
<p>sincerity on His lotus-like feet and go about praising Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;He alone<sup id="fnref:253"><a href="#fn:253" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">253</a></sup> is the Lord of Siva who is spoken of in high terms, of <em>Brahma</em> and of all others.&rdquo; &ldquo;O Lord<sup id="fnref:254"><a href="#fn:254" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">254</a></sup> whose glory cannot be adequately understood even by him who rides on the unique bull and by <em>Brahma</em>,&rdquo; And again, &ldquo;<sup id="fnref:255"><a href="#fn:255" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">255</a></sup> Neither the god who has the ball for his banner, viz. Siva nor <em>Brahma</em>, nor Indra nor any other knows the remedy for the disease called &lsquo;&lsquo;birth&rdquo; (i.e.) <em>samsāra</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This truth about <em>Bhagavān</em> being the Supreme Deity should be considered as present in the first letter a of <em>aum</em> inTirumantraand in the word Nārāyaṇa therein and in the word Nārāyaṇa  occurring in <em>Dvayam</em> along with its attribute <em>Śrīman</em> (along with Śrī or Lakṣmī ) and likewise in the words &lsquo;me&rsquo; and &lsquo;I&rsquo; occurring in the <em>Carama</em> <em>Śloka</em>.</p>
<p>For men other than those who have this conviction about the Supreme Deity, it is not possible to be in the state of having <em>Bhagavān</em> alone exclusively as their protector, a state such as is described in the following and other words of the Alwars: &ldquo;<sup id="fnref:256"><a href="#fn:256" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">256</a></sup> There is no refuge other than Kṛṣṇa&rdquo;. &ldquo;Whether you<sup id="fnref:257"><a href="#fn:257" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">257</a></sup>  weed out my suffering or whether you do not weed it out, I have no other means of getting it removed.&rdquo; &ldquo;I know<sup id="fnref:258"><a href="#fn:258" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">258</a></sup> of no other staff of support for my soul&rdquo;. (We may see also) the ten stanzas beginning with: “If you do not <sup id="fnref:259"><a href="#fn:259" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">259</a></sup> withhold the suffering due to my <em>karma</em>&quot;, The Alwar<sup id="fnref:260"><a href="#fn:260" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">260</a></sup> who learnt all spiritual truths directly from the Lord of all discerned the truth about the Supreme Deity in Tiru_mantra_, gave up all devotion to other deities and became well established in exclusive devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em>, which extends to His devotees and also in rendering exclusive service to the Lord and His devotees. He gives expression to this in the following verse. &ldquo;I cannot <sup id="fnref:261"><a href="#fn:261" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">261</a></sup> live in agreement with those who hold that there is any other deity (than the Lord); I have also obtained the privilege of rendering service to Thy devotees.&rdquo; In the verse beginning with &ldquo;The earth, water, fire, air, ether&ndash;having created these,&rdquo; the Alwar places (before himself) the three gods concerned in this controversy and, after a consideration of _pramāṇa_s, ignores two of them and decides on the remaining deity who is Supreme Light<sup id="fnref:262"><a href="#fn:262" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">262</a></sup> &ldquo;as His god having a complexion resembling that of a cloud.&rdquo; Perialwar also declares in the following verse that the deity who is of this form and complexion is the Supreme Reality (<em>Tattva</em>) described in all the Vedas ; &ldquo;If &ldquo;you <sup id="fnref:263"><a href="#fn:263" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">263</a></sup> meditate on the god who is of the colour of the ocean by uttering the origin of all Veda, namely, the syllable <em>aum</em> with three mātras (metrical units) etc. etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having in mind the passage in Taittiriya which describes the Supreme Deity as being the Lord of Lakṣmī , the Alwar understands that this description excludes other gods and exclaims:-&ldquo;I have <sup id="fnref:264"><a href="#fn:264" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">264</a></sup> seen Lakṣmī  and the form of the Lord shining like gold on which she rests.&rdquo; Beginning with this verse he concludes with the statement that &quot; for wise men it is only <em>Bhagavān</em> who ever acts in conjunction with Lakṣmī  that is both refuge and goal.&rdquo; This he declares in the following verse :- &ldquo;Our refuge<sup id="fnref:265"><a href="#fn:265" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">265</a></sup> is the goddess residing in the beautiful lotus covered with honey, who has long eyes and shines with a splendour which throws into the shade the lightning seated in the black cloud and who fascinates (with her beauty) the God armed with the discus and wearing the garland of tulasi on his broad chest.&rdquo; The conclusion has been arrived at that this couple (<em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Śrī</em>) are our goal of attainment and our refuge.</p>
<p>This truth regarding the Supreme Deity was taught at great length by the great sage, Parāśara, to his worthy disciple who was fit to receive the great spiritual secrets, in the following <em>śloka</em>  -</p>
<p>“Io all beings,<sup id="fnref:266"><a href="#fn:266" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">266</a></sup> gods, men and animals, all that is masculine is <em>Bhagavān</em>, Hari, and all that is feminine is <em>Lakṣmī</em>, O Maitreya, and there is no one other than they,&quot; This sage, Parāśara, obtained the knowledge concerning the Supreme Deity by the grace of Pulastya and Vasiṣṭa who gave him this boon :-&ldquo;You will<sup id="fnref:267"><a href="#fn:267" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">267</a></sup> understand the truth about the Supreme Deity.&rdquo; &ldquo;What Was<sup id="fnref:268"><a href="#fn:268" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">268</a></sup> said to you by Pulastya will certainly become true.&rdquo; Our great <em>ācārya</em> , ŚrīYamunamuni, also speaks of Parāśara with the greatest regard in &lsquo;I bow to Parāśara<sup id="fnref:269"><a href="#fn:269" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">269</a></sup> the best of sages.&quot; And Nammalwar, who received the gift of knowledge free from all delusion and <em>bhakti</em> from <em>Bhagavān</em> and who occupies the highest place in the line of those who have performed <em>prapatti</em>, has stated the same truth (namely, that Lakṣmī  should also be considered along with <em>Bhagavān</em> as our refuge and our goal): &ldquo;You have<sup id="fnref:270"><a href="#fn:270" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">270</a></sup> enabled me to have a vision of Thyself and Thy consort (Lakṣmī ) with the shining bracelets, standing together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have already stated all that should be said in this connection in our commentary on The Four <em>śloka</em> s (of Yāmunācārya) with a refutation of the views of opponents and refer the reader to the same.</p>

<p>Our <em>ācārya</em> s have proclaimed, in so uncertain terms, that our eternal Lord with His Consort seated on the lotus is the Supreme Deity, so that disputants, proud of their knowledge of reasoning and argumentation, may not, each according to his own will, declare that the ultimate cause is this or that (<em>Brahma</em>, Rudra or Indra) thus causing dread to the Vedas<sup id="fnref:271"><a href="#fn:271" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">271</a></sup> * and trepidation to all devotees.</p>

<p>(7) THE CHAPTER ON THE ASPIRATION FOR MUKTI. page147</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>कालावर्तान् प्रकृतिविकृतीः कामभोगेषु दोषान्</p>
<p>ज्वालागर्तप्रतिमदुरितोदर्कदुःखानुभूतिम् ।</p>

<p>Who, indeed, is there that will bear the bondage of <em>samsāra</em> &ndash; who that has understood the revolutions of time, the nature of matter (<em>prakṛti</em>) and its evolutes or modifications which cause contraction of knowledge, the evils attendant on the enjoyment of the pleasures of this world and of <em>svarga</em>, the experience of sufferings resulting from sin which resemble a pit of fire, the true relationship that exists necessarily between himself and the Supreme Being, the region of divine bliss and also the nature of the body which is like a prison-house ?</p>
<p>Thus, from the _Śāstra_s which treat of the soul, a man should understand the principles and truths explained so far. He should know clearly that the soul or self is self-luminous or luminous by itself, is a knower, doer and enjoyer having a body and that the goal is atomic, eternal, without parts or limbs, incapable of being cut, burnt, injured, dried up or otherwise affected and that its essential nature is such as not to admit of increase or diminution and that, in all these respects, it is different from the body, the senses and the like which are attributes of the self. With the conviction that the soul or self is capable of passing on into another world and taking up another body, the man learns, in a general way, that it is possible for him to have higher aims or goals than those found in this world. He is full of dread at the thought of falling into hell and the like or experiencing the sufferings of another life and abstains from those actions which are the causes thereof. He is also convinced that he is different from <em>Iśvara</em> in that while he is supported and controlled by <em>Iśvara</em> and exists solely for the fulfilment of His purposes and is besides weak, atomic and subject to ignorance, doubts, errors, sufferings and the like, being the abode of impurities, <em>Iśvara</em>, of whom his self is an attribute, is, in every one of these respects, absolutely the opposite. From this knowledge he becomes fit to desire the glory due to his essential nature (of rendering service to <em>Bhagavān</em>). He then realises the most important truths from the Tirumantra which is a concise summary of all that is needed. By an understanding of the significance of the third letter in its first word <em>aum</em>, namely, m, he realises that the self is essentially <em>Jñāna</em> or knowledge in its nature (and has knowledge also as an attribute.) By this realisation he gives up the notion of &lsquo;I&rsquo; in regard to the body ((i.e.) mistaking the body for &lsquo;I&rsquo;) and of &lsquo;mine&rsquo; in regard to those things that are connected with the body. Similarly from the dative or the fourth case of the first syllable a where the dative termination has been dropped ((i.e.) from aya), we should learn that the <em>Jīva</em>   exists for <em>Iśvara</em> and thereby, completely and without any trace, give up the erroneous notion implicit and explicit in the words &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;mine&rsquo; in regard to the following the action of &lsquo;I&rsquo; in regard (even) to the soul as distinct from the body, that it is <em>śeṣa</em> to oneself and the notion of &lsquo;mine&rsquo; in regard to the attributes of the soul (such as this <em>jñāna</em> is mine). In this connection we should remember (Bhattar&rsquo;s) <em>śloka</em>  (written in the form of an imaginary dialogue between <em>Iśvara</em> and the <em>Jīva</em>   which reads as follows:-)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Bhagavān</em>: You are mine.</p>
<p>The <em>Jīva</em>   : I exist (only) for myself.</p>
<p><em>Bhagavān</em>: Where is it stated ?</p>
<p>The <em>Jīva</em>: Where is the opposite stated ?</p>
<p><em>Bhagavān</em>: In the original <em>pramāṇa</em> : the Veda.</p>
<p>The <em>Jīva</em>  : The opposite view is based on the strength of my own enjoyment of myself from beginning less time.</p>
<p><em>Bhagavān</em>: But protests have been recorded then and there.</p>
<p>The <em>Jīva</em>   : Where is it objected to ? and by whom?&rsquo;</p>
<p><em>Bhagavān</em>: The protest or objection was made in such works as the Gita and it was made by me.</p>
<p>The <em>Jīva</em>  : Is there any witness ?</p>
<p><em>Bhagavān</em>: The wise man.</p>
<p>The <em>Jīva</em>   : But he is an interested witness.</p>
<p>Thus in this dispute between <em>Bhagavān</em> and the <em>Jīva</em>  , the need arises for an arbitrator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a knowledge of the meaning of u in <em>aum</em>, which means &lsquo;only&rsquo;, we should root out the notion of &lsquo;I&rsquo; in thinking &ldquo;I am the <em>śeṣa</em> of others (those other than <em>Bhagavān</em>) and the notion of ‘mine&rsquo; in thinking, &ldquo;Another (and not <em>Bhagavān</em> ) is my <em>śeṣī</em>.&rdquo; By an understanding of the negation contained in the middle word (viz. <em>namo</em>, na mama ) which declares that there is no such thing as independence for the <em>Jīva</em>  , we should rid ourselves of the notion of &lsquo;I&rsquo; in thinking that in respect of the means of securing one&rsquo;s own protection, one is wholly independent&rsquo; and the notion of &lsquo;mine&rsquo; in thinking that this act or activity for securing protection is unconditionally &lsquo;one&rsquo;s.&rsquo; By the force of this very negation (na mama ), we should give up erroneous notions that may exist in regard to the fruit (of the <em>upāya</em>), which consists in future enjoyment (in Vaikuṇṭha  ) extending up to the service of the Lord, which is the meaning of the dative in the third word (Nārāyanāya) - erroneous notions of &lsquo;I&rsquo; in thinking on the analogy of other fruits enjoyed here (in this world), &ldquo;I will be the independent doer” and “I will be the enjoyer subject to no one else &quot; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo; in thinking &ldquo;I do this for myself&rdquo; and &ldquo;I enjoy this for myself&rdquo;. (These notions of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;mine&rsquo; in varied situations should be completely rooted out by considering the meanings, implicit and explicit, in the several words of the Tiru_mantra_.) Thus one should become well established in right knowledge and should say to oneself in the words of the Alwars, &quot; Having enjoyed the pleasures of sense and found them petty, I have now given them up and found relief.&rdquo; &ldquo;The pleasures of the five senses in seeing, hearing, touching, smelling and tasting and, so also, the unlimited but inferior enjoyment of one&rsquo;s own self (ātmānubhava), which is not capable of being realised by the senses, have been given up by me.” “When He is gracious, what is there difficult of attainment? I have had enough of <em>dharma</em>, artha and kama. They are petty.&rdquo; &ldquo;The fruits obtained by these weak-minded men are temporary and end after a short time.&rsquo; &ldquo;Having come into this world which is not eternal and is full of misery, seek me as your refuge.&rdquo; &ldquo;Having heard of those who were mighty and valiant and of those who had immense treasures of wealth and who, after the lapse of some time, have left nothing behind them but tales of their lives, the wise man never considers as &lsquo;his&rsquo;, sons, wives, houses, land and the like, nor Wealth&rdquo;. &ldquo;The world is all misery”. “Even in Svarga, since there is fear of a fall after the expiry of the ordained period, there is no happiness&rdquo;. &ldquo;It is only fools who hanker after kingdoms, thinking that they are theirs. Men like me never long for them, because they are not intoxicated by the strong liquor of egotism the sense of &lsquo;I&rsquo;).&rdquo; &ldquo;From the mansion of <em>Brahma</em> downwards, O sage, these evils exist; therefore the wise never desire the attainment of Svarga.&rdquo; &ldquo;Above the mansion of <em>Brahma</em>, there lies the supreme world of <em>Viṣṇu</em>, which is pure, eternal, full of supreme splendour and is called the Supreme <em>Brahman</em>. Fools, deluded by the pleasures of the senses and tormented by vanity, covetousness, arrogance, anger, perfidy and delusion never go to that world. Only good men without possessiveness and egotism, who remain indifferent to the pairs of opposites (like pleasure and pain, heat and cold and the like), who have full control over their senses, and who are devoted to Yogic meditation go there.&rdquo; &ldquo;In that world are beautiful vimanas (airships) which can travel as they please, Assembly halls, gardens of varied kinds, O king, and, likewise lotus tanks, full of pellucid water.” “ Compared with that world of the Supreme Being, these lower worlds (of <em>Brahma</em> and Indra) are like hell.&rdquo; From these and other sayings, the <em>Jīva</em>   should realise the seven kinds of evil inherent in the enjoyment of non-sentient things, viz. their littleness, their instability, their origin in pain, their being mingled with pain, their resulting ultimately in pain, their origin being due to a perverse egotism and their being opposed to the bliss which is his nature. He should also realise such of these evils as are inherent in the enjoyment of one&rsquo;s self, ātmānubhava. He should then realise, with clear vision, the unique character of the enjoyment of the bliss of <em>Bhagavān</em>, which, in every one of these respects, is opposed to them. He would then attain the condition of &ldquo;one who longs eagerly for the Supreme Being and who, consequently, is averse from things that are other than the Supreme Being. He would then abstain from activity whose characteristics <em>Brahma</em> is said to have described (as leading to fruits other than <em>mokṣa</em> ) and embrace renunciation whose characteristics are said to have been described by the sage Nārāyaṇa  (as leading to <em>mokṣa</em> ). It is only men of this type that can be described as competent aspirants for <em>mukti</em>. Even if a man knows clearly what is high and what is low among the _tattva_s and what is high and what is low among the aims and objects desired as the goal of life as explained above, if he does not adopt the <em>upāya</em> which can become the supreme goal of life, after acquiring a distaste for other pleasures (vairāgya), he will be an object of ridicule like the dog whose tail does not hide its private parts nor drives flies and mosquitoes. His learning will be of no use to him. So has it been said : &ldquo;Learning is &ldquo;fruitful when it leads to purity of character and of conduct:&rdquo; &ldquo;The śāstra s have been enjoined by wise men for securing serenity of mind. Therefore only he who has attained serenity of mind should be considered as having a knowledge of all the _śāstra_s&rdquo;. Therefore, &ldquo;men &ldquo;should conduct themselves in a manner which will be in keeping with their age, with the duties which they undertake, with their goal in life, with their learning, and with their birth, so that their appearance, speech and action are all alike&rdquo; - it is only these that will secure the glory described in passages like the following: when a man performs his duties, he is lauded by others. &ldquo;The gods consider him as a Brahmin who is clad in whatever rags he can obtain, eats whatever food comes to him and has his bed wherever he can find it;&rdquo; &quot; The gods bow to him (who is free from the pairs of opposites, who has no attachment to anything in life and who ever delights in doing good to all beings&rdquo;).</p>

<p>(8) THE CHAPTER ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF QUALIFIED PERSONS.page153</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>मुमुक्षुत्वे तुल्ये सति च मधुविद्यादिषु यथा</p>
<p>व्यवस्था संसिद्ध्यत्यधिकृतिविशेषेण विदुषाम् ।</p>
<p>विकल्प्येत न्यासे स्थितिरितरविद्यासु च तथा</p>
<p>नियत्या वैयात्यं नियमयितुमेवं प्रभवति ॥ २० ॥</p>
<p>Even though the desire for <em>mokṣa</em>  is the same, a distinction arises among those who practise the vidyās or forms of meditation prescribed in the śrutis, as a result of their respective qualifications<sup id="fnref:272"><a href="#fn:272" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">272</a></sup> or competence in regard to such vidyās as Madhuvidyā, Sad_vidyā_ and so on. In the same way, a distinction arises between the adoption of <em>prapatti</em> and other vidyās (which are of the nature of <em>bhakti</em> or devout meditation), as a result of an unseen power or destiny depending on past <em>karma</em> which brooks no questioning.</p>
<p>Some aspirants for <em>mokṣa</em>  are qualified for madhu <em>vidyā</em> and others for sad_vidyā_ as a result of their respective competence or special forms of aspiration. So also some are qualified for <em>prapatti</em>, while others are for <em>bhakti</em>.</p>
<p>TWO KINDS OF ADHIKARĪS:</p>
<p>Among those who thus resort to the practice of the _dharma_s of renunciation as a means for the attainment of the supreme goal of life (namely <em>mokṣa</em> ), there are two classes of qualified persons : those who adopt <em>prapatti</em> as the sole and direct means and those to whom <em>prapatti</em> is auxiliary to the chief means, viz., <em>bhakti</em>. Both these are prapannas, one adopting <em>prapatti</em> as an independent means and the other adopting it as <em>aṅga</em> to <em>bhakti</em>. Both of them are also called bhaktas, because <em>bhakti</em> is the phala<sup id="fnref:273"><a href="#fn:273" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">273</a></sup> or fruit for one and sādhana or means for the other,</p>
<p>phala <em>bhakti</em> means <em>bhakti</em> which arises as the fruit of <em>prapatti</em>, whereas sadhana <em>bhakti</em> is <em>bhakti</em> which leads to <em>mokṣa</em> .</p>
<p>Just as, according to the passage, &quot; Ablation is prescribed in seven forms&rdquo;, (1) the utterance of a <em>mantra</em> ; (2) the mental process; (3) celestial ablution ; (4) ablution by air and so on, are held as different and equally effective kinds of ablution in regard to those who are qualified for those respective forms, the forms known as Ukti_niṣṭhā_ (by one&rsquo;s utterance) and <em>ācārya</em> <em>niṣṭhā</em> :(that done by the <em>ācārya</em>  on one&rsquo;s behalf) and varieties of <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>UKTINIṢṬHĀ:</p>
<p>Of these, that done by one&rsquo;s utterance (ukti_niṣṭhā_) is as follows: Those who have no clear knowledge of auxiliaries (<em>aṅga</em>), such as the determination to do what is agreeable (to the Lord), but who possess the qualification of knowing that, without, the Lord, they have no other means (a kinchanya) and who have. also the faith (viswāsa) that He will grant salvation if prayed to - they pronounce, before the Saviour, the sentence taught to them by their <em>ācārya</em> s, which will be considered by the Lord as equivalent to perfect <em>prapatti</em>; they say: &ldquo;May my salvation be Thy burden or responsibility !?&rdquo; They are like the ignorant children of feudatory princes who seek the protection of the emperor by repeating the words taught to them by their nurses. If a little boy who does not understand the meaning of words and sentences says, once, &quot; Madam, give me food as alms&rdquo;, it meets: with immediate and favourable response in the houses of good men who are well.to do. In the same way, it has been said, The Lord, whose wealth never suffers any diminution, however much He may give, will also grant whatever is prayed for&rdquo;. Since He is supremely rich and generous, even this utterance or <em>ukti</em> will never be fruitless. In the case of those who are ignorant and who depend entirely on this utterance, the compassion of the Lord, who is the refuge of all, cannot ignore even this mere utterance (as it cannot digest it); for it has been said, “Whatever may be the manner or form, you have uttered the <em>Dvaya</em> <em>Mantra</em>. Therefore your redemption is my responsibility.&rdquo; This truth has been stated by those who are well versed (in the śāstra s) in such <em>śloka</em> s as the following: &ldquo;Though I am a sinner, it will not become Thee, who art the Lord of all, to neglect me when I utter the words stating that I seek Thy refuge.&rdquo; &ldquo;This speech of mine expressing the thought that I seek refuge under Thee is not uttered with all my mind and with all my heart. I can be saved only if even this mere utterance will secure Thy compassion.&rdquo; &ldquo;I long to see Thee by merely uttering the words of <em>prapatti</em> - Thee who canst not be attained by <em>bhakti</em>.&rdquo; The state of one who performs <em>prapatti</em> by utterance (<em>ukti</em>), and that of one who depends solely on the <em>ācārya</em>  have both been described in the same <em>śloka</em>  as follows:- &ldquo;I have been made Thy responsibility by my <em>ācārya</em> s who follow the way of <em>dharma</em>. I have also (myself) uttered the word seeking refuge. Taking this into consideration, O, Lord of _Śrī_r_aṅga_m, make me Thy burden or responsibility&rdquo; The word api (also) in the <em>śloka</em>  indicates that any one of the two will suffice.</p>
<p>ĀCĀRYANISHȚHĀ ;</p>
<p>Of the two, the one who depends solely on the <em>ācārya</em>  is included in the <em>ācārya</em> &rsquo;s own <em>prapatti</em> as part of it, for it has been laid down in Śāṇḍilya <em>Smṛti</em> and other treatises as follows: “He should also state thus: “This is my son, my servant, my disciple (who is to be saved)&quot;. It has been said: “There may be doubts concerning (the redemption of) those that serve Acyuta, but there is absolutely no doubt about the (redemption) of those who delight in the service of His devotees&quot;. So, in the case of those who depend solely on the <em>ācārya</em> , there is no doubt at all concerning the fruition of <em>prapatti</em>, by the principle of &ldquo;How much more, then&rdquo; (kaimutika nyāya).</p>
<p>Mudali Andan said: &ldquo;When a lion leaps from one hill to another, the little creatures (like bugs and lice) on his body are also taken over from that hill to the other. So also when the author of Śrī Bhāṣya performed <em>prapatti</em> (the surrender of his responsibility or bhara), we &ldquo;too have been saved (by that act)<sup id="fnref:274"><a href="#fn:274" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">274</a></sup> owing to our intimate connection with him.&rdquo; We, too, have expressed this idea in <em>Nyāsa</em> Tilaka as follows:- &quot; The blind man walks on being led by one who is not blind; the lame man is taken (across the stream) by the boatman, being placed within the boat; the children of the king&rsquo;s servants enjoy the pleasures (of the palace), although they do not know the king. So also my <em>ācārya</em> , who is compassionate, is capable of making me attain Thee, O Lord of _Śrī_r_aṅga_m&rdquo;. It comes to this that the Lord of all will not be gracious enough to grant us the supreme goal of existence, unless <em>prapatti</em> is performed in some manner or other and by some one or other.</p>
<p>This is interpreted in two different ways by the southern school of Viśiṣṭādvaitins and the northern school. The former hold that since Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em> has already performed <em>prapatti</em>, even his followers of a later day who acknowledge him as their <em>ācārya</em>  will benefit by it and they need not perform <em>prapatti</em>; the latter hold, on the other hand, that only those who were his śiṣyas then would benefit by it</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The favour of Bhāgavatas, residence in holy places and the like are not direct and independent means for attaining <em>mokṣa</em> . (It is true that we find such passages as the following in the śāstra s):-&ldquo;Whether it be a beast or a man or a bird - those who are held by Bhāgavatas as their own will go to the supreme abode of Viṣṇu  for that very reason&rdquo;. “We, who live in your territories, should be protected by you, for you are our king, O ruler of men, whether you are in the town or in the forests&rsquo;&rsquo;. &ldquo;All the beings in Ayodhya which contained (many) good regions - whether they were beings that moved or beings that could not move - he enabled them (all) to acquire nobility of nature&rdquo;. The nobility was that of feeling delight in the company of ŚrīRāma and grief in separation from him. &ldquo;The strength that lies in living in places where Thou hast temples is the strength that enables a man to attain <em>mokṣa</em> &ldquo;. (From these passages, it might appear, at first sight, that the favour of Bhāgavatas or God&rsquo;s devotees and the fact of living in places belonging to the Lord would lead of themselves to the supreme goal.) But even here there is always some connection with either <em>prapatti</em> by one&rsquo;s owa utterance or <em>prapatti</em> through the <em>ācārya</em>  or <em>bhakti</em> or <em>prapatti</em> which existed before or <em>bhakti</em> or <em>prapatti</em> which followed. It may be asked how this could be. (The answer is as follows:-) They will lead to <em>bhakti</em> or <em>prapatti</em>. In the case of one who has already adopted <em>bhakti</em> or <em>upāsanā</em>, they will promote the further development of the <em>upāya</em> or means. In the case of one who has performed <em>prapatti</em> as an independent means, they will promote the eagerness for service while in this world. It is in this way they render help.</p>
<p>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN <em>BHAKTI</em> AND <em>PRAPATTI</em></p>
<p>IN SECURING THE GOAL: Among these, he who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as the means to <em>bhakti</em> is capable, like Vyāsa and others, of other means or _upāya_s than <em>prapatti</em> and is therefore not absolutely helpless (<em>akiñcana</em> ). Since he can bear delay (in attaining <em>mokṣa</em> ), he is not averse to other interests (in life). He will attain <em>mokṣa</em>  only at the expiry of the <em>karma</em> which has already begun to yield fruit (prārabdha), when he will have the intense thought of the last moment before death. Since the primary <em>upāya</em> or means (<em>aṅgī</em>) which he has chosen is upăsana or <em>bhakti</em>, he attains the fruit thereof, namely, <em>mokṣa</em> , when it is performed fully and in accordance with the rules and injunctions prescribed for it. On the other hand, <em>prapatti</em> adopted as the primary or direct means (<em>aṅgī</em>) is open to all adhikārīs, is capable of averting all hindrances (to <em>mokṣa</em>), can further the attainment of all that is desired, is easy of performance, has to be performed only once, can bring about the fulfilment (of what is aimed at ) quickly and will not countenance any opposition or obstacle. Like the missile, <em>Brahmāstra</em>, it will not tolerate the adoption of any other means or <em>upāya</em> for attaining the fruit. The man who has resorted to <em>prapatti</em> as the direct and independent means will have no hindrances at all in the way of his attaining the perfect enjoyment (of the bliss of <em>Bhagavān</em>). Therefore from the moment of the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, there is nothing in the way of his attaining <em>mokṣa</em>  but his own desire to live till the death</p>
<p>of this body so that he may enjoy such things as the rendering of service with this body to the images of the Lord (<em>arcā</em>) to which he has an attachment. So his <em>mokṣa</em>  has to await only the death of this body and will consist in the rendering, in Vaikuṇṭha  , of perfect and full service which has begun even here in the performance of service limited by the conditions of place, time and the nature of bodily life (<em>svarūpa</em> ). The state of the <em>prapanna</em> who is prepared to continue in this world till the dissolution of the body is referred to in passages like the following: &ldquo;What is there&rdquo; wrong in us who go about here having already won the grace of being permitted to serve Thee &quot; &ldquo;Leaving this bliss of uttering Thy names, I do not want even the bliss of going to Paramapada and ruling over it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can I indeed give up the hare and go in pursuit of the crow !&rdquo; (That is&mdash; it would be foolish to give up hare&rsquo;s flesh which is excellent as food and go after crow&rsquo;s flesh. So also the service of the image here in temples is superior even to the bliss of serving the Lord in Paramapada). “My deep love to Thee, &ldquo;O King, is always staunch. So also my devotion to Thee, O valiant Sire, is always firnı. Nowhere else can my mind turn&rdquo;. (In these words Hanuman expresses his love and devotion to ŚrīRāma and states that this love and devotion are greater towards Rama than even to the Lord of Paramapada).</p>
<p>Since the Supreme Ruler is the giver of all things, and since <em>prapatti</em> at His feet is capable of yielding all kinds of fruit, it becomes the means of securing whatever fruit is desired respectively by these two (<em>bhakta</em> and <em>prapanna</em> <sup id="fnref:275"><a href="#fn:275" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">275</a></sup> ). The _Śāstra_s say, &ldquo;Ask any boon that you want, when I am in the range of one&rsquo;s vision, all (good) things will follow.&rdquo; &ldquo;O Thou that hast created all the worlds! Is there anything that is difficult to obtain, when Thou art pleased ? &quot;   &quot; When He is graciously disposed, is there anything here that cannot be obtained ? &quot;   &quot; What is there in this world or in the world above, O Dalbhya, that cannot be accomplished by those men whose minds are directed towards Viṣṇu  ?&rdquo; &ldquo;The fruit is from Him. It stands to reason &ldquo;. (<em>Brahma</em> _Sūtra_s 3 - 2 - 37). <em>Bhakti</em> or <em>upāsana</em> is the means of securing the four kinds of objects that may be desired in accordance with one&rsquo;s aim as stated in the Bhagavad Gitā (7 - 16). &ldquo;Four types of men who have performed meritorious deeds worship me. He who has lost his wealth and is anxious to recover it, he who wants to have a vision of his own self (ātmā) and to enjoy it (ātmānubhava ), he who wants to acquire wealth anew, and he who is a Jnāni, who desires to be for ever with the Lord and practises <em>bhakti</em> for attaining Him.&rdquo; Similarly have not the great rishis declared that <em>prapatti</em> is also the means of attaining the four kinds of objects or aims as is stated in the <em>śloka</em>  : &ldquo;Only so long as one does not perform <em>prapatti</em> to Thee that canst destroy all sins, will there be the anxiety to recover lost wealth, only so long will there be the desire to acquire new wealth, only so long will there be the absence of the enjoyment of one&rsquo;s self as something different from the body; only so long will there be the sorrow of <em>samsāra</em>&rdquo;. From the words &quot; that destroyest all sins” and the repetition of &ldquo;only so long&rdquo; repeated in every case with great consideration, it is made clear that the fruit which is desired by the man will all become his, in accordance with his desire and at the very time when he desires to have it. It is in consideration of this superior efficacy of <em>prapatti</em> that it is stated (in Lakṣmī  Tantra 17 - 62) as follows:-&rdquo; Those who practise <em>Jñāna</em> Yoga and <em>Bhakti</em> Yoga with a pure mind and those who perform <em>karma</em> which would discipline the soul in renunciation are not worth even one ten-millionth part of the man who has performed <em>prapatti</em>. The difference in the kinds of service done here (in this life) by the <em>prapanna</em> is due to the difference in the desire of the <em>prapanna</em> and that difference in the desire is due to the difference in the meritorious deeds of the past which have begun to operate in this life (Prārabdha <em>karma</em> ). There will be no difference at all in the bliss that will be attained after casting off the last body.</p>
<p>The sentence means that the direct&rsquo; <em>prapanna</em> gets <em>mokṣa</em>  which he desires and the <em>prapanna</em> who performs <em>prapatti</em> for the sake of <em>bhakti</em> gets <em>bhakti</em> which he desires, for <em>prapatti</em> can secure whatever is desired.]</p>
<p>THE BLISS IN MOKṣA  IS THE SAME FOR BOTH.</p>
<p>Entire dependence on the Lord is uniformly the same for all. For it is stated in Viṣṇu  Tantram :-&ldquo;Having understood his absolute dependence on the Supreme Person, he gets rid of the bondage due to past <em>karma</em>, attains peerless independence and enjoys bliss with him.&rdquo; It has been declared (by the _Bhāṣya_kāra in the chapter on the Goal (Chapter IV of the <em>Brahma</em> _Sūtra_s) that this independence which is said to be acquired in the final stage of attainment (i.e.) <em>mokṣa</em>  is  fitness to render every kind of service to the Lord without being subject to past <em>karma</em>.</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>वेण्डुम् पॆरुम्बयन् वीडॆण्ड्रऱिन्दु विदिवगैयाल्</p>

<p>Those who desire to attain the bliss of <em>Bhagavān</em> realise that the supreme aim of life is <em>mokṣa</em>  and that there are two _upāya_s or means attaining it, one prolonged and the other quick which depend on their luck. They adopt one of these two _upāya_s and find that, for getting rid of the hindrances caused by past <em>karma</em>, there is no other way than seeking the feet of Mukunda for refuge,</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>प्रपन्नादन्येषां न दिशति मुकुन्दो निजपदं</p>

<p>Mukunda does not vouchsafe His abode to any one other than the <em>prapanna</em>. The <em>prapanna</em> is of two kinds, namely, he who adopts <em>prapatti</em> as the sole and independent means and he who adopts <em>prapatti</em> as the auxiliary means to <em>bhakti</em> or <em>upāsana</em> and this difference is due to difference in the fruition of their good deeds. He who adopts <em>prapatti</em> as an auxiliary to <em>bhakti</em> will attain <em>mokṣa</em>  after much delay caused by the need to expiate past <em>karma</em> (in one or several bodies), but will have the happiness of devout worship in this world for a long time. He to whom <em>prapatti</em> is the sole and independent means will attain <em>mokṣa</em>  quickly (i.e.) at the end of this life itself, but his happiness of serving the Lord in this world will be limited and of short duration.</p>

<p><em>Bhagavān</em> is declared in the Upaniṣads to be Himself the means (<em>upāya</em>) of attaining Him. The ways of <em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em> are indicated for winning His grace. The adoption of these <sup id="fnref:276"><a href="#fn:276" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">276</a></sup> *ways is the result of the great ripening of meritorious deeds (done in the past ) and, even for this, <em>Bhagavān</em>, who has the ability to create everything, is Himself the cause.</p>
<p>These ways: The commentary Sārāsvādinī says that the Sanskrit   word Gati does not mean here ways or _upāya_s but forms of knowledge.</p>
<p><em>UPĀYA</em> AND UPEYA:</p>
<p>The means or <em>upāya</em> to be adopted by them (i.e.) the seekers after <em>mukti</em>) is a special kind of expansion of knowledge. The <em>upeya</em> or object of attainment which can be realised by this means is another special kind of expansion of knowledge. Of these, the special kind of expansion of knowledge which is the means requires the help of instruments of knowledge (karana ) and has been prescribed in the _Śāstra_s. It has for its object <em>Brahman</em> who is always endowed with the five attributes like satyam, (satyam, _jñāna_m, anantan,anandam, amalatvam ) which define His essential nature or substance ( <em>svarūpa</em>), along with the qualities Associated invariably with the respective <em>vidyā</em> or form of meditation. The object of attainment (<em>upeya</em>) which is a special kind of expansion of knowledge does not require any instruments of knowledge. It is the natural heritage of the <em>jīvātmā</em> and has for its object <em>Brahman</em> perfect with all qualities and glorious possessions (vibhūtis).</p>
<p><em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>उपासितगुणादेर्या प्राप्तावप्यबहिष्क्रिया ।</p>
<p>सा तत्क्रतुनयग्राह्या नाकारान्तरवर्जनम् ॥</p>
<p>The principle of tatkratu<sup id="fnref:277"><a href="#fn:277" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">277</a></sup> states only that  the qualities (and forms) meditated upon would not be excluded in the attainment; it does not exclude other qualities (and forms ). Service to the Lord is also the object of attainment (<em>upeya</em> ) as it is the overflow of the experience (of <em>Bhagavān</em> ) which is attained.</p>
<p>The principle of tatkratu or tatkratu nyaya is to the effect that in whatever form or manner and with whatever qualities one meditates on God - in that very form and with those very qualities will one attain Him. Though service to the Lord is not specifically prescribed in a <em>vidyā</em>, it will be attained after <em>mukti</em>.</p>
<p>BHAGAVÃN IS BOTH <em>UPĀYA</em> AND UPEYA:</p>
<p><em>Iśvara</em> is the object of the knowledge which is the means, <em>upāya</em>, and is also the object of the knowledge which is attainment : He is the means or <em>Upāya</em> as being the giver of the (desired) fruit and, likewise. He is Upeya because He is Himself the object that is to be enjoyed. In the case of the <em>mumukṣu</em> who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as the sole and independent means, <em>Iśvara</em> takes the place of other _upāya_s. In the case of others also (i, e.) those who adopt <em>bhakti</em>, <em>Iśvara</em> whose favour has been won by <em>prapatti</em> (adopted as an auxiliary means to <em>bhakti</em>) intervenes and, standing in the place of rites and duties which are too hard for them in those situations which lie between the beginning of <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em> and the completion of the (prescribed) meditation, brings about the removal of sins and the manifestation of sattvam which can result from their performance. He sees to it that the meditation or worship which has been adopted as an <em>upāya</em> is so complete as to bear fruit.</p>
<p>KARMA YOGA:</p>
<p>Karma Yoga means the performance of certain kinds of <em>karma</em> or rites and duties as the result of knowledge acquired from the _śāstra_s in regard to the true nature of the <em>Jīvātmā</em> and the Paramātmā. The rites and duties consist of the following: (1) <em>nitya</em> karna or regular duties to be performed compulsorily (like the daily sandhya vandana) (2) <em>naimittika</em> <em>karma</em> or rites to be compulsorily performed on specific occasions (like the eclipse of the sun or the moon) and (3) such kārya karmās or rites as are optional and as have been chosen to be within one&rsquo;s ability. Though these kāıya rites are ordained for obtaining certain specified fruits like <em>svarga</em>, they have to be performed without any desire for those fruits. All these rites and duties, 1, 2 and 3, have to be performed regularly and in accordance with the prescribed rules by the Karma-yogin.</p>
<p>This <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em> has several subdivisions described in the <em>śloka</em> s beginning with &ldquo;Some perform the rites or sacrifices (Yajna) which are of the nature of the worship of the Gods&rdquo; (Bhagavadgītā IV 25.) They include such (items) as the adoration of the gods, the performance of austerities (tapas), pilgrimage to sacred places, giving in charity, and sacrifices.</p>
<p>In the same way as, in accordance with the differences of competence, <em>prapatti</em> becomes the means of attaining <em>mukti</em>, either through <em>bhakti</em> or directly by itself and without the intervention of <em>bhakti</em>, so also <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em>, either through <em>Jñāna</em> Yoga or without it, becomes the means of having a vision of one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or ātmā with the help of yogic auxiliaries like yama (self-rest raint), <em>niyama</em> (observance of rites) and <em>prāṇāyāma</em> (the control of the breath).</p>
<p>JÑĀNA YOGA:</p>
<p><em>Jñāna</em> Yoga is the constant and uninterrupted contemplation, by one who has conquered his mind by karna-<em>yoga</em>, of his <em>svarūpa</em> or essential nature or the self as being distinct from matter, (the body, the senses and the like) - his <em>svarūpa</em> which is the mode or prakāra of <em>Iśvara</em> in virtue of its relation to Him as His body or śarīra. The self is the body of <em>Iśvara</em> ( as has been already pointed out) because it is supported and controlled by Him and serves His purposes.</p>
<p>If a person has succeeded in attaining to a vision of his self ( ātmāvalokana) by the practice of <em>yoga</em> preceded by <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em> and <em>Jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em> and if he escapes the spare of being (permanently) attracted by the pleasure of enjoying this vision which is so great as to create a distaste for all sense-pleasures - then he begins the practice of <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> which is (the direct) means for the attainment of the supreme goal of enjoying <em>Bhagavān</em>. While practising _bhakti_yoga, the aspirant contemplates on <em>Bhagavān</em> as the Inner Self, or antaryāmin of his own self which is His body. The vision that he has (already ) acquired of his own pure self is then useful, for it is only through it that he reaches its Inner Self, just as the cloth within which a gem is tied up is first to be seen before the gem itself can be seen. In this way the vision of one&rsquo;s self serves as a qualification for the practice of <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>.</p>
<p><em>BHAKTI</em> YOGA:</p>
<p><em>Bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> is the special form of meditation which is of the nature of unsurpassed love and which has, for its object, the essential nature and the like (form, qualities, etc.) of <em>Bhagavān</em> who is not dependent on any one else, who is not subject to the authority of any one else and who does not exist for the fulfilment of the purposes of any one else. <em>Bhakti</em> is of the form of a continuous stream of knowledge which is of the nature of uninterrupted memory like oil streaming down continuously; it has clearness similar to that of visual perception; it grows from strength to strength by being practised every day until the day of journey to Paramapada and terminates in the remembrance of the last moment. The performance of the rites and duties of one&rsquo;s <em>varṇa</em> and <em>āśrama</em> is auxiliary to it (<em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> ), as it dispels sins that cause rajas and tamas, which, like weeds, impede the growth of sattvam so necessary for the expansion of knowledge. This <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> is also a means or sadhana in accordance with the specific desire of the sādhaka, for acquiring lordship (in this world or in <em>svarga</em>) and other fruits (like kaivalya). This is. calculated to strengthen the faith of the weak-minded as stated in the <em>śloka</em>  ; &ldquo;Worldly&rsquo; benefits have also been mentioned as arising from <em>bhakti</em>-<em>yoga</em>. They produce confidence in the attainment of <em>mukti</em> (by verifying what is stated in the śāstra  from the example of these worldly benefits). This idea is expressed in the <em>śloka</em>  in the Gita (7-16) which says: &ldquo;Four kinds of persons worship me etc.” The superiority of the Jnāni which is stated there in the words, &quot; Among them, the Jñāni is the best because he desires to be always with <em>Bhagavān</em> and is devoted solely and exclusively to Him&rdquo; is thus described by <em>Bhagavān</em> Himself com &quot; Four *kinds of people are my men. They are all devotees (bhaktas). Of them they who worship me alone exclusively are the best, for they do not approach other deities. They perform the prescribed rites and duties without caring for their fruits and desire to attain me alone. The other three kinds of devotees desire ( worldly) fruits which have an end and they are subject to lapses. The wise man who worships me with sole and exclusive devotion attains <em>mokṣa</em> .&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> which has thus been prescribed as the means of obtaining <em>mokṣa</em>  has been called <em>parābhakti</em>. Love of the Lord which results from intimacy with sāttvikas (and the scriptures ) and which produces <em>parābhakti</em> is also called <em>bhakti</em>, because it generates an eager desire to know <em>Iśvara</em> with perfect clearness. It has been said: &ldquo;Owing to smy devotion to the Lord and to my _guru_s, I have attained spiritual purity and come to know <em>Janārdana</em> with the help of the _Śāstra_s.&rdquo; (So <em>parābhakti</em> is born successively of a knowledge of the truth obtained from the _śāstra_s which leads to <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em> and the like). It (<em>parābhakti</em>) produces in its turn an eager desire and determination to see the Lord and makes the man cry out as follows- &ldquo;O Lord, &lsquo;who art the abode of attributes like <em>jñāna</em>, be pleased to show Thy whole self 1&rdquo; “Vouchsafe Thy grace so that I may see Thee&rdquo;: &ldquo;May I see Thee some day!&rdquo; By this keen desire alone, he wins the grace of <em>Bhagavān</em> who rewards him with a perfect visual perception of himself for the time being. This visual perception is called parajñāna. From this perfect vision of the <em>svarūpa</em> of the Lord is born an excessive and unsurpassed love for the Lord similar to the yearning feltt by a man suffering from great thirst at the sight of a tank. This (excessive and unsurpassed love for the Lord) is called parama <em>bhakti</em>, Parama <em>bhakti</em> produces an eager desire and determination to enjoy the Lord without any limitations, as the <em>bhakta</em> feels that it is impossible to live any longer without this experience of the Lord as described in the Tiruvoymozhi 10.10-1 (where the Alwar cries out that he will not hereafter allow the Lord to leave him) and that he must become one with the Lord and declares all this with an oath that cannot be ignored by the Lord. It causes (likewise) an excessive eagerness in the Lord to give him <em>mokṣa</em>  immediately and makes him attain <em>mokṣa</em>  after quenching his great thirst for union.</p>
<p><em>BHAKTI</em> AND <em>PRAPATTI</em>:</p>
<p>(<em>Prapatti</em> stands in the place of <em>parābhakti</em> to the man who adopts it as the direct and independent means). Siace <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> is not suitable for those who do not belong to the three higher castes and (likewise) also for those in these three castes who are wanting in <em>jñāna</em> or ability or both and since it will not suit those who cannot endure any delay in the attainment of its fruit (namely, <em>mokṣa</em>) and are therefore extremely impatient, <em>prapatti</em> is prescribed as the sole and independent means of <em>mokṣa</em>  for them. Since it will be the means of securing all desired objects, it has been prescribed in the place of <em>parābhakti</em> for those who know their limitations. Just as in the case of the man who practises the vidyās, <em>parābhakti</em> is followed by (certain) stages of attainment (like para <em>jñāna</em> ), this <em>prapatti</em> will be followed by certain favourable results or states in accordance with the desire of the man who adopts it as the independent <em>upāya</em>. These states are to be considered as part of the fruits of <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION OF _UPĀYA_S</p>
<p>Thus <em>prapatti</em> and <em>bhakti</em> are said to be optional in relation to those who are qualified for them as they secure the same final goal or fruit.</p>
<p><em>BHAKTI</em> IS DIFFERENT FROM <em>PRAPATTI</em>:</p>
<p>That the two are different from each other is evident from the adhikarana or section. &ldquo;The <em>Brahma</em> _Vidyā_s are different as their *<sup id="fnref:278"><a href="#fn:278" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">278</a></sup> names and the like are different &ldquo;. <em>Brahma</em> sūtras (III-3.56). That there is option (to choose any of them) is also evident from the section : &quot; There is option (to adopt any of them ) because the result or (final) fruit is the same&rdquo;. Brahnia sītras (III - 3. 57).</p>
<p><em>Bhakti</em> leads through <em>yoga</em> to para-<em>bhakti</em> which leads to para-<em>Jñāna</em>, which, in its turn, leads to parama-<em>bhakti</em>.</p>
<p>It may be seen that, as in _upāsanā_s there are differences in _mantra_s and the like (_aṅga_s), there are, in <em>Nyāsa</em> <em>Vidyā</em> also, differences stated in the different branches of the vedas (Shakhas) and in the different samhitas of the agamas. Just as obeisance (namaskāra) is divided into three forms, verbal, mental and bodily, so <em>prapatti</em>, too, is said to be of different kinds owing to the excess of one or other of these differences. It has been stated by some that, just as obeisance becomes complete when all the three, verbal, mental and bodily are combined, <em>prapatti</em>, too, becomes complete when verbal and bodily actions are combined with mental states or <em>jñāna</em>. This statement of theirs should be understood as meaning that mental <em>prapatti</em> is full and complete and that verbal and bodily activities are, as it were, the overflow of the mental <em>prapatti</em> (<em>jñāna</em>). (It should not be taken to mean that <em>prapatti</em> is incomplete when verbal and bodily actions are absent). We have already stated that all these are productive of the desired result or fruit in accordance with the competency of those who adopt them,</p>

<p>They are Brahmins who know the following :&ndash; (1) Karma Yoga is suited to one&rsquo;s state (viz. <em>varṇa</em>, <em>āśrama</em> and the like); (2) <em>Jñāna</em> Yoga adopted with keen intelligence on account of its beneficial results: (3) <em>Bhakti</em> Yoga adopted by those with an inner vision which is delightful and (4) <em>Prapatti</em> which yields immediate fruit by the grace of God to those who are destitute of the qualifications (for the other three ) and who cannot endure delay in attaining <em>mokṣa</em> .</p>

<p>Karma, <em>Jñāna</em>, <em>Upāsana</em> (<em>bhakti</em> ) and likewise <em>śaraṇāgati</em> are the good ways prescribed in the Vedas for securing <em>mokṣa</em><sup id="fnref:279"><a href="#fn:279" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">279</a></sup> ; of these some are indirect and auxiliary means (namely, <em>karma</em> and <em>jñāna</em> ) while the others, <em>bhakti</em> and <em>śaraṇāgati</em> are direct and independent _upāya_s for <em>mukti</em>. Of these, some (i.e. <em>karma</em> and <em>jñāna</em>), have only one form (that of being in. direct and auxiliary means ); <em>bhakti</em> has only one form (that of being the direct and independent means for <em>mukti</em>, while <em>śaraṇāgati</em> or <em>prapatti</em> has two forms, that of being an indirect and auxiliary means as leading to <em>bhakti</em> and also that of being the direct and independent means or <em>upāya</em> for obtaining <em>mukti</em>. The wise (who know the s&rsquo;ăstras), having understood well the difference among these _upāya_s due to their having this single or twofold nature, delight in the last words (caramaśloka  ) of the charioteer who is the Saviour of all, (i.e.) they prefer śaraṇāgati),</p>
<p>Commentators of <em>Brahma</em> _sūtra_s like Sudarśana Bhatta point out that this difference in names applies especially to <em>nyāsa</em>, since it is a different word from &lsquo;contemplate&rsquo;, ‘meditate&rsquo;, and &lsquo;adore&rsquo; which are used in connection with the other _vidyā_s and which mean thc same thing, whereas <em>nyāsa</em> has a different meaning (altogether).</p>

<p>Fitness (for <em>Bhakti</em> or <em>Prapatti</em>) consists in a combination of desire (for the fruits of a course of action and of ability which is threefold<sup id="fnref:280"><a href="#fn:280" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">280</a></sup> . This fitness of man is differentiated as consisting in conditions prescribed for the <em>yoga</em> of eight _aṅga_s or auxiliaries (<em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>) and for the <em>yoga</em> of six _aṅga_s or auxiliaries (<em>prapatti</em>). That <em>Bhagavān</em> is the refuge or Saviour of all has been declared in the <em>śruti</em>  and confirmed in the _smṛti_s। In adopting this righteous path viz., <em>prapatti</em>, there is competence for all as in the matter of speaking the truth and such other injunctions as are ordained in the Vedas (for all men , without any difference of caste or <em>āśrama</em>).</p>
<p>1: Ability which is threefold - The ability to understand the meaning of śāstra s: the ability to perform what is ordained in them and the competence as laid down in the śāstra s according to caste, qualities and the like.</p>
<p>(Those who are not of the three higher castes are prohibited from the performance of certain rites and duties ordained in the <em>śruti</em> s, but this prohibition does not apply to such injunctions as &ldquo;speak the truth &ldquo;, and &quot; look upon your mother as divine&rdquo; etc. which are also ordained in the Vedas. So also <em>prapatti</em>, though prescribed in the Vedas, is open to all castes ).</p>
<p>010 2:- <em>Bhakti</em> Yoga: <em>Bhakti</em> Yoga is called the aṣṭāṅga <em>yoga</em>, because its eight _aṅga_s are yama, <em>niyama</em>, etc. <em>Prapatti</em> is called ṣaḍaṅga <em>yoga</em>, because its six _aṅga_s are such as anukulya <em>saṅkalpa</em>, prathikulya varjanam, mahāviśvāsam, _ākiñcanya_m, etc., to be described later,</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF COMPETENCY OR ADHIKĀRA:</p>
<p>It is necessary that one should know the special qualifications and the like required in a person who intends to adopt <em>nyāsa</em> <em>vidyā</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) without any desire for the other _upāya_s in the quest for the goal that is desired. Competency (<em>adhikāra</em> ) consists in</p>
<p>the attribute of desiring the end on the part of the person who adopts an <em>upāya</em> for the sake of a certain desired result and also ability to adopt it. Ability means the capacity to understand the meaning of the _śāstra_s and the capacity to perform what is ordained therein and, likewise, fitness or competency in accordance with what is prescribed in the _śāstra_s, such as, caste, quality and the like (āchāra - samskāra). This competency exists already (before the adoption of the <em>upāya</em>). To the man who has this competency, what is stated to be the object to be obtained by the means, is the desired result or fruit. <em>Upāya</em> is the means prescribed or ordained for securing that fruit or result. The person who has become desirous of <em>mukti</em> (<em>mumukṣu</em>) and who adopts the special <em>upāya</em> for <em>mokṣa</em>  called direct and independent <em>prapatti</em> should have, in common with the upāsaka ( who has adopted <em>bhakti</em>), a knowledge obtained from the _Śāstra_s of such things as the relationship (between <em>Jīvātmā</em> and Paramatma as that between the body and the soul) and he should have in addition, the special qualifications of <em>ākiñcanya</em> and <em>ananyagatitva</em> ; <em>ākiñcanya</em> means the absence (in a person) of the ability for other _upāya_s. Ananyagatitvam means an aversion to all other interests (than <em>mokṣa</em>) and a turning away from all other refuge than <em>Bhagavān</em>. The latter is implicit in the former, namely, aversion to all other interests. This may be seen from such passages as the following :-&ldquo;Wise men never worship <em>Brahma</em>, Rudra and others who are called gods, for the boons that they could grant are limited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If, without an eager and impatient desire for immediate <em>mokṣa</em>, a person who wants such things as the continuance of the body (or the continuance of the worship of <em>arcāvatāra</em>) adopts <em>prapatti</em> for the sake of <em>mokṣa</em> , his <em>mukti</em> will be delayed in proportion to these other interests,</p>
<p>ĀKINCHANYA AND ANANYAGATITVA:</p>
<p><em>Ākiñcanya</em> and <em>ananyagatitva</em> are conditioned by the ignorance of and inability to adopt other _upāya_s on the part of the person adopting this means, as also his inability to endure delay in attaining <em>mukti</em>. His turning away from other saviours than <em>Bhagavān</em> is conditioned by his conviction of the absolute dependence on <em>Bhagavān</em> alone, which is common to himself and to others (including other deities than the Lord), as is stated in the <em>śloka</em> : “ Just as, O &lsquo;Bharata, tips of grass are entirely subject to (the force of) the wind, even so are all beings subject to the sway of the Lord &ldquo;, and it is conditioned also by his aversion to other interests than <em>mukti</em>,</p>
<p>THE _PRAMĀṆA_S IN SUPPORT :</p>
<p>The nature of the specific competency for <em>prapatti</em> is evident from the following authoritative passages and from spiritual tradition : &ldquo;Having been abandoned by his own father (Indra), the gods and the great sages, he, (i.e.) Kakasura, wandered about the three worlds and finally took refuge under Rāma alone&rdquo;, &ldquo;I am the abode of all transgressions; I have no means or <em>upāya</em> to save myself and I have nothing else to attain besides Thee&rdquo;; &ldquo;I seek&rdquo; the refuge of Thy feet, O <em>Śaraṇya</em> (Saviour): I have no other <em>upāya</em> and nothing else to attain than Thee&rdquo;: &ldquo;*Finding that there is no <em>upāya</em> for leaping over <em>samsāra</em> even in all the endless future, etc.&rdquo; : &ldquo;I, who am aware that there is no <em>upāya</em> for me in all the thousands of crores of kalpas other than performing <em>prapatti</em> at Thy two lotus-like feet&rdquo;, and, “I who have no other refuge and no other saviour etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>PRAPATTI</em> IS OPEN TO ALL:</p>
<p>If such qualifications exist, <em>prapatti</em> is certainly open to all as an <em>upāya</em>, since there are no restrictions to it such as caste.</p>

<p><em>Prapatti</em> to Bhagavān which is of the nature of <em>bharanyāsa</em> (the surrender to the Lord of the responsibility of one&rsquo;s protection) is ordained in such _śāstra_s as the Vedas as having certain distinctive accessories or _aṅga_s, which are of a certain specific nature and of a certain specific extent and it is to be necessarily performed and only once to <em>Bhagavān</em>, who is the celestial ocean of mercy who controls the whole universe from within it and who is already bent on the destruction of <em>samsāra</em>.</p>
<p>THE _AÑGA_S OR ACCESSORIES OF <em>PRAPATTI</em> :</p>
<p>The accessories or _aṅga_s of this <em>vidyā</em> (nyāsavidyā or <em>prapatti</em>) are the following: the intention or will to do (thereafter) whatever is agreeable ( to the Lord), the avoidance of whatever is displeasing (to Him, helplessness (<em>kārpaṇya</em>), supreme faith, and supplication or seeking His protection.</p>
<p>It has (sometimes) been said that <em>śaraṇāgati</em> is of six kinds : intention to do whatever is pleasing ( to the Lord) (ānukūlyasaṅkalpa), the avoidance of whatever is displeasing to Him (prātikūlyavarjanam), the faith that He will afford protection (mahāviśvāsa), begging His protection (goptṛtvavaraṇa), the surrender of the self (ātmanikṣepa) and the feeling of helplessness (<em>kārpaṇya</em>). It is stated to be six-fold in this and other passages by the inclusion of the aṅgī, namely <em>prapatti</em> or self surrender among its <em>aṅga_s or accessories as in the word aṣṭā_ṅga</em><sup id="fnref:282"><a href="#fn:282" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">282</a></sup> <em>yoga</em>.</p>
<p>Aṣṭā_ṅga_ Yoga is really dhyānayoga. It is said to consist of yama, <em>niyama</em>, <em>āsana</em>, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, dhyāna, dhāraṇa and samādhi, Samādhi which is the <em>aṅgī</em> is included among its _aṅga_s or accessories  .</p>
<p>That one of these is angī and that the others are _aṅga_s are evident from the following <em>śloka</em>  and (this does not require any argument) :  “<em>Nyāsa</em> or &lsquo;self-surrender which has the word <em>nikṣepa</em> for a synonym has five _aṅga_s and is called also sannyāsa, tyāga and <em>śaraṇāgati</em>.” In the Ahirbudhnya Samhita, it is stated as follows:&mdash; &ldquo;The <em>prapatti</em> that I perform to the Lord is itself eternal fruition to me: I desire no other fruit than this. This absence of the desire for any other fruit (than <em>prapatti</em>) is itself considered as the chief <em>aṅga</em>. The desire for the fruit is opposed to this.&rdquo; This other <em>aṅga</em> (described in the Ahi. Samhita), namely, the absence of any desire for ulterior results or fruit is essential in the surrender of the self for the sake of <em>mokṣa</em> , (and not in every form of <em>prapatti</em>). The giving up of all attachment to the fruit or consequence and also of the thought of one&rsquo;s doer- ship is common to all forms of renunciation such as <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em>, This thought or reflection should therefore be entertained by the person desirous of <em>mokṣa</em> , at the time of his surrender of His self to the Lord with all the _aṅga_s.</p>
<p>1  2. ANUKÜLYA SANKALPA AND PRĀTIKūLYA VARJANAM:</p>
<p>Among these _aṅga_s, the essential condition for the will to do what is pleasing (to the Lord) (ānukülya <em>saṅkalpa</em>) and the avoidance of what would be displeasing to Him, (prātikulya. varjanam) is the knowledge that the person exists solely for the Lord of <em>Lakṣmī</em> for whom all things and all beings exist and should therefore do whatever would please Him by performance and by abstention from performance. From this it follows: that by the determination to do whatever is pleasing and the other (the avoidance of whatever is displeasing) one would avoid transgressing the command of the Lord.</p>
<p>(3) KĀRPANYAM:</p>
<p>Karpanyam , or helplessness is meditation on one&rsquo;s <em>ākiñcanya</em> and other attributes (like ananyagatitvam) described in the previous chapter, or the freedom from pride to which it gives rise. These generate a feeling of wretchedness or helplessness. In any one of these ways, it would serve to heighten the compassion of the Saviour (<em>śaraṇya</em> ) and would be useful later on for the promotion of the knowledge that there is no other <em>upāya</em>. For it is said :- &ldquo;Kārpanya is abstention from seeking any other <em>upāya</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>(4) MAHAVISVASA:</p>
<p>Supreme faith or mahāviśvāsa is necessary for the performance of <em>prapatti</em> free from all doubts and it leads later on to freedom from all care or anxiety. For it is said. &ldquo;From the faith that He will protect arises the performance of the desired <em>upāya</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(5) GOPTṚTVA VARAṆAM :</p>
<p>Though <em>mokṣa</em>  is the appropriate goal of our essential nature, (<em>svarūpa</em>), yet when it is sought as the desired end (<em>puruṣārtha</em>), it has to be asked for, just like other desired objects not so appropriate. Supplication for protection is necessary since the thing (viz. <em>mokṣa</em> ) would be given only to one who asks for it. No good thing is ever given without its being asked for. Therefore <em>mokṣa</em>  will not be <em>puruṣārtha</em>, unless it is asked for by the purusha. That is why it has been stated as follows :-&ldquo;No protection would be given when it is not sought&rdquo;, and &quot; Suppliancy or seeking the Lord as Saviour is to make our mind known (to Him).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since these five are of use at the time of the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, they are essential for the surrender of one&rsquo;s self, atma <em>nikṣepa</em>.</p>
<p>ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRESENCE OF THESE _AÑGA_S IN SARANĀGATI:</p>
<p>These _aṅga_s that are essential for <em>prapatti</em> may be seen in the words of the good Trijata to the Rākṣasis advising them to seek refuge under Sītādevi. &ldquo;Enough of your cruel words.&rdquo; This states the avoidance of what is displeasing. &quot; Use only conciliatory language&rdquo;. This states implicitly the intention or will to do what is pleasing, since the utterance of speech is impossible without being preceded by mental resolution. “Terrible dread has, indeed, befallen the Rākṣasās from Rama.&rdquo; By describing the state of helplessness in which they stand, this shows their <em>ākiñcanya</em> which is a qualification (for <em>prapatti</em>) and it reveals their <em>kārpaṇya</em> also, for, by reflecting on their helplessness they would give up their arrogance and the like, which leads to <em>kārpaṇya</em>, one of the _aṅga_s.&quot; She is capable of protecting us, O Rākṣasis, from this great danger&quot;, which is elaborated by Hanuman into &quot; She is  capable of protecting these Rākṣasis from Rama&quot;. This shows the great faith or mahavisvāsa that she will protect, for even when the Lord is intent on punishing one (for his or her mis-deeds ) she can turn his mind from anger. &ldquo;Let us beg Sītā (to protect us). This is what I consider proper. Though you threatened her before, beg of her now; O Rākṣasis, do not ask whether she will protect. Sach talk is vain.&rdquo; This is supplication for protection. The surrender of the self, ātma <em>nikṣepa</em>, which is the <em>aṅgī</em> and which has these five as ita _aṅga_s is intended in the word pranipāta (obeisance ) which states the cause that produces the graciousness, in the <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;Sītā, the daughter of Janaka, is surely bent on showing her graciousness to those who do her obeisance&rdquo;. Therefore the statement in the sāstrās that <em>Nyāsa</em> has five _aṅga_s&rsquo; &rsquo; is seen in its completeness here (in the <em>prapatti</em> of the Rākṣasis ). The Rākṣasis did not reject this advice and even this (mere) acquiescence (namely, non-rejection ) made Sītā become their refuge owing to her extreme love and graciously say:- &ldquo;I will be your refuge.&rdquo; That these words were from the very heart and ultimately bore fruit has been declared by the great Parāśara Bhattar renowned for his learning and wisdom in the <em>śloka</em> : “O Mother Maithili, by the protection which you gave to the offending Rākṣasis from Hanuman, you reduced Rama and His council (Sugrīva and others) to a lower position, (for Rama protected Vibhishana (who had committed no offence) and Kakasura (who had offended) when they were able to ask for protection whereas you protected the Rākṣasis while they were in the very act of offending, and even when they did not themselves beg of you to do so, (at the intercession of Trijata),&quot; In this surrender, by Trijata, of the responsibility (for protection) of herself and of others connected with her, the Raksh asis who were related to Trijata by birth and who had won her affection, were included. So also the four Rākṣasas who came along with Vibhishana were included in the <em>upāya</em> adopted by him. In that context also where protection was granted (by Rama ), it is possible to fit in the <em>aṅgī</em> and the _aṅga_s. And it is in this way - Since (Vibhishana) tells Ravana who is determined to continue in his evil career, “Let &ldquo;Sītā be given back to Rama&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Let us give Sītā Devi to Rama and live here, O King, free from all anxiety,&rdquo; Vibhishana&rsquo;s intention to do whatever is pleasing (anukulya <em>saṅkalpa</em> ) is disclosed. This wholesome speech caused anger in Ravana&rsquo;s mind in the same way as milk tastes bitter to the person suffering from (excess of) bile. The intention to avoid what is displeasing (prātikulya varjanam) is revealed in his coming (to ŚrīRama) having given up all attachment to Lanka in accordance with his words, &ldquo;I seek refuge under Rama having given up (my) sons and wives&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Lanka, friends, and all kinds of wealth have been abandoned by me,&rdquo; (These words were uttered by him) after Ravana cursed him saying: &ldquo;Shame on thee, O thou that bringest disgrace to our race.&rdquo; He then came to the conclusion that there was no use of giving him advice any more, that he should not enjoy any further the glories of being with him and that he should not even stay in the place where he was. Vibhishana&rsquo;s karpanya or feeling of helplessness is stated in his words beginning with, “The wicked Ravana&quot; and in his saying that he has no other course left open owing to his enmity with the all-conquering Ravana and in his declaring a short while after: &ldquo;I am the younger brother of Ravana and have been put to disgrace by him; I have sought Thy protection, O Thou Saviour of all.&rdquo; His supreme faith (mahāvisvāsa) which made him approach without fear and say: &ldquo;I have sought, as my refuge or <em>upāya</em>, Raghava who is the protector of the whole world &quot; is indicated in the words “ Vibhishana who was great in wisdom&rdquo; as being the cause (of this faith). The world &ldquo;great &quot; which qualifies &quot; wisdom&rdquo; is intended also to show his supreme faith; his supplication for protection (Goptritva <em>varaṇam</em>) is conveyed in the words, “I have sought Raghava &ldquo;, for it is included within them. Besides the indirect suggestion of the supplication for protection, his speech, &ldquo;Offer me ( Vibhishana) to him at once &quot; shows the surrender of his self (atmanikshepa) done with the help of those who could promote this surrender (ghatake). The word Nivedayata, which here means &ldquo;offer to Him&rdquo; would be of no use, if it were interpreted as &lsquo;inform&rsquo;.</p>
<p>These ideas can be found either briefly or at length in all other contexts of <em>prapatti</em> and in all deposits of property on trust with others in ordinary life. When depositing, with a capable person, property or wealth which one is oneself unable to keep safe, has it not been seen that one intends to do what is pleasing and to give up the intention to displease that person ? One believes that the person ( so trusted ) can keep it safe and will do so if required, tells him of one&rsquo;s inability to take care of it and begs him to be its custodian. Then one leaves it with him and sleeps care-free, with.&rsquo; out any fear and with one&rsquo;s arms on one&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>THE PRESENCE OF THESE _AṅGA_S AND</p>
<p>THE <em>AṅGĪ</em> IN DVAYA:</p>
<p>It may be asked how these _aṅga_s are to be understood in the <em>mantra</em> called <em>Dvaya</em> which reveals the meaning of the action (<em>prapatti</em>) to be performed. The answer is as follows:&ndash;Doubts might arise whether the Lord of all (1) who is omniscient and omnipotent, (2) who rewards in proportion to the <em>karma</em> (performed by one), (3) who does not require any help or assistance, (4) who does not take action immediately like minor deities and (5) who is destitute of equals and superiors&ndash; (1) whether the Lord who is of such a nature could ( at all) be accessible to those who have committed unlimited transgressions (2) whether He would grant fruits beyond all measure to those who have committed unlimited transgressions which are hindrances to their attainment, (3) whether He would give (these blessings ) in return for insignificant actions (on the part of the persons concerned), (4) whether - he would grant them without delay and (5) whether He would be absolutely indifferent to the status of the suppliant. To remove these doubts one should know that the Lord has certain features like (1) helpful recommendation (purushakāra) from <em>Lakṣmī</em>, (2) the relationship of the Master to his servants, (3) attributes and qualities like love (to His creatures ). (4) the will or determination (to redeem them) and (5) His own satisfaction in saving them. These features of the <em>śeṣī</em>  (<em>Bhagavān</em> ) which are needed, respectively, for the <em>upāya</em> or means and for the attainment. lie imbedded, as it were, in the words _Śrī_mat (with Śrī or Lakṣmī ) and Nārāyaṇa  (the refuge of all men ) and these features will not, in reason, be available for salvation if there is no determination on the part of the <em>Jīva</em>   to do what is pleasing: (anukulya <em>saṅkalpa</em>) and the avoidance of what is displeasing · (prātikulya varjana). This should be considered as referred to in those two words in <em>Dvaya</em>. These words which show that the master has these features reveal by their appropriateness (the need for) the determination to perform what would please Him and the avoidance of what would cause displeasure.</p>
<p>These five, namely (helpful recommendation from <em>Śrī</em>, the relationship of the Master to His servants, His attributes and qualities, His activity in redeeming and the satisfaction (prayojana) He receives have, respectively, the following specific properties: (1) inability to refuse, (2) impossibility of dissociating (Himself from His servants), (3) the unconditioned Nature of His grace, (4) the absence of the need for accessory help and (5) His feeling that the gain of those who are below Him is His own gain. If it is asked how the doubts (about salvation by <em>prapatti</em>) stated before are removed by these specific properties, the answer is as follows:- (1) Though He is omniscient and omnipotent, He can not ignore recommendations of certain kinds and will pardon all faults which stand in the way of His accessibility in the same way as a king will pardon the faults of servants of the zenaną (on the recommendation of the royal ladies). He will appear as if he is unaware of these faults and be easily accessible. (2) Though He rewards in accordance with one&rsquo;s <em>karma</em>, he will become gracious owing to the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, which is something like an apology for greater things, a <em>vyāja</em> or gesture, and grant even that fruit which is beyond all measure and which is one&rsquo;s natural right like an inheritance, on account of its being due to the relationship of master and servant. (3) Although He has all objects of desire and does not require any help or assistance, He looks upon the little action (<em>prapatti</em>) performed by one as if it were an act of supreme help to Him because of His supreme and unconditioned compassion; for He is like a generous emperor who is easily won over by even little tokens of homage. Thus he becomes grateful and acts</p>
<p>( accordingly). (4) Though He does not (in general) act quickly like inferior deities and rewards those who adopt other means laid down in the _Śāstra_s only after (some) delay, yet when a man who has no other protector or refuge has performed <em>prapatti</em>, He grants whatever is desired at the very time when it is wanted, as He did in the case of Kakasura and Vibhishana, by His mere will which is accompanied with generosity and which does not require any other help or aid. (5) Though He is destitute of equals and superiors, He has such attributes as independence and does what is desired by His dependants for His own satisfaction; so He grants (their request ) without any consideration of their status or rank as ( ŚrīRama did) in the case of all creatures in Kosala and in the same way as a man feeds his parrot and his child alike with milk. Thus the doubts (regarding the efficacy of <em>prapatti</em> ) arising from analogy with everyday life are removed also by the same analogy. Therefore there is nothing to hinder <em>prapatti</em> from being the <em>upāya</em> for the desired object, as ordained in the _śāstra_s. Supreme faith or Mahāvisvāsa is not possible for one who has not understood, from the special grace of a good ācharya, these five, namely, helpful recommendation and the like, qualified by such attributes as have been mentioned before. This is how it happens: The man finds that he is unfit to adopt such _upāya_s as <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em> and the like on account of his great sins resulting from <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s being unfavourably disposed towards him. His condition is such as is described in the following <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;Shame on me that have neither purity, nor modesty, neither compassion nor shame; for, O Supreme Person, I desire to aspire to Thy service which even such great yogis, as <em>Brahma</em>, Rudra and Sanaka find far beyond the reach of their meditation.&rdquo; Thus he has a hankering for attaining an object that is hard to attain; but for securing it, he adopts an <em>upāya</em> which does not involve physical strain, expenditure of money or length of time and which is easy of performance, since it involves only a single mental act or even a single utterance with only a general understanding of the meaning of the words as a whole. With this easy <em>upāya</em> he desires to attain that supremely great object (namely, <em>mokṣa</em>  ) and that, too, when he wants it. He knows that, by birth, conduct and the like, be is unfit to enjoy that fruit, like a dog which is unfit to eat the offering made to the gods, and yet he longs to attain this glory not only for himself but also for those who are connected with him. Embar has, therefore, illustrated the difficulty of having such faith by saying that to expect this man who dreads _bhakti_yoga to have this supreme faith (regarding the efficacy of <em>prapatti</em>) is “to ask a man who pleads inability to pay a bundle of sesamum stalks which would yield a kalam of seeds to pay instead a kalam of oil&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In this connection Appullar stated that the man who, like the gopis, has little discrimination but knows that the Lord is easily accessible and who seeks Him as having this quality has greater faith than the man who thinks only of the Lord&rsquo;s supreme greatness and remoteness and avoids Him; for the latter is called in the Gita the worst of men (narādhama) as the birth of his knowledge has only led to his ruin. The greatness of this supreme faith born of a knowledge of such things as helpful recommendation (purushakāra) from Lakṣmī , the essential nature of this faith and the feeling of helplessness are to be seen respectively in the preposition pra in prapadye (in <em>Dvaya</em> ), the root pad in prapadye occurring with the word s&rsquo;aranam and in the first person singular in prapadye.</p>
<p>In Sarasāgati <em>Gadya</em>, Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em> explains the implication contained in the first person singular (prapadye) as meaning &ldquo;I  have no other refuge&rdquo;. In <em>Dvaya</em> the words Saranam prapadye express supreme faith in the Lord&rsquo;s protection. Therefore the supplication (or prayer for protection ) is implicit in the words which express supreme faith in the <em>upāya</em> (though not actually stated in so many words ). It has been said &quot; I am the abode of transgressions; I am without any other means of protecting myself, I have nothing else to attain than Thee.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be pleased to be my <em>upāya</em>. This thought of prayer is called <em>śaraṇāgati</em>. Let it be performed to the Lord.” Further &quot; this word s&rsquo;aranam is employed to mean any one of the following : <em>upāya</em>, house and protector; here it means only <em>upāya</em>.&rdquo; The Lord of all, besides being the protector in the general sense, as stated in all _śāstra_s should, in the case of the <em>prapanna</em>, be thought of steadfastly as being an <em>upāya</em>, since he has accepted the responsibility of protecting him and stands therefore in the place of other _upāya_s. Besides, the Lord should be thought of as an <em>upāya</em> in order that this adhikārī (namely, the <em>prapanna</em>) who has surrendered the responsibility for his protection to the Lord may remain steadfast without seeking other _upāya_s.</p>
<p>The word <em>upāya</em> stands for &ldquo;the means to secure an end&rdquo; and this means may be either sentient or non-sentient. It has been said:-&ldquo;Among the _aṅga_s to <em>prapatti</em> are the faith that He will protect and the supplication or prayer for protection &quot; &quot; The Lord who controls everything, though He is omniscient and always compassionate expects a prayer for protection, since He has to look after the process of <em>samsāra</em>&rdquo;. Since the <em>upāya</em> or means in this case is a sentient being (namely, the Lord), and the prayer for protection (or <em>goptṛtva</em> varaṇam) which is applicable only to sentient beings is necessary here, the word saranam in <em>Dvaya</em>, which means <em>upāya</em>, implies also the prayer for protection. Since the word saranam cannot have two meanings when it is used only once, (we should understand that) in the <em>Dvaya</em>, the steadfast thought of the Lord being an <em>upāya</em> which is peculiar to the adhikārī called <em>prapanna</em> is brought out by the word saranam itself and that the prayer for protection which is common to all adhikārīs is understood by implication from the meaning.</p>

<p>Our kind <em>ācārya</em> s have taught us the way of seeking, as an <em>upāya</em>, the Supreme Being who is (ever) ready to help us in our state of helplessness, when we are without such _upāya_s as <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> which give rise to doubts (concerning our ability to adopt them with success). They have taught it to us so well that we shall never commit the mistake of begging, for deliverance from the sorrows of <em>samsāra</em>, the (other) gods who are bound by <em>karma</em> and are therefore like ourselves and who are not related in any way to us.</p>

<p>In the Scriptures (vouchsafed to us ) by <em>Bhagavān</em> himself (e. in the Pancharātra Āgamas), this <em>yoga</em> called <em>prapatti</em> is proclaimed as having five or six _aṅga_s and as requiring to be performed only once. In this <em>yoga</em>, abstention from transgressions results from two of the _aṅga_s, namely, ânukulya <em>saṅkalpa</em> and prātikulya varjana. It may be understood (also ) that from one <em>aṅga</em>, namely, karpanya, one feels that there is no other <em>upāya</em>. From supreme faith, another <em>aṅga</em> arises: firmness of mind. By another <em>aṅga</em>, namely, <em>goptṛtva</em> <em>varaṇam</em>, is generated the Lord&rsquo;s will to save. In this <em>yoga</em>, namely, <em>prapatti</em>, and also in its _aṅga_s, the thought that all these are dependent upon the Lord should arise from a knowledge of the truth (<em>tattva</em>) (that the <em>jīva</em> is <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord and that all he does is really done by the Lord and that for His own purposes. sāttvika parityāga). This last thought is common to <em>prapatti</em> and all other _upāya_s for securing <em>mokṣa</em> , (When <em>śaraṇāgati</em> is performed for the sake of worldly goods, this last thought, sāttvika parityāga is absent.)</p>

<p>(12) THE CHAPTER ON THE PERFORMANCE OF <em>PRAPATTI</em> WITH IT’S A_ṄGA_S. page186</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>अभीष्टे दुस्साधे स्वत इतरतो वा क्वचन तत्</p>
<p>भरन्यासं याच्नान्वितमभिवदन्ति प्रपदनम् ।</p>
<p>इतः पश्चादस्मद्यतन निरपेक्षेण भवता</p>
<p>समर्थ्योऽसावर्थस्त्विति मतिविशेषं तदविदुः ॥ २८ ॥</p>
<p>When a desired object is incapable of attainment by oneself and by other _upāya_s, <em>prapatti</em> is the placing of the responsibility or burden of securing it in somebody who is capable of doing so with a request or supplication. It is declared to be the specific thought such as (the following): &ldquo;This object should be accomplished (for me) by you without my making any effort of my own hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE NATURE OF THE <em>AṅGĪ</em>:</p>
<p>In this <em>upāya</em> ( consisting of angł and _aṅga_s ) to be adopted by the seeker after <em>mokṣa</em> , the angī is the surrender of one&rsquo;s self or ātmā with a clear understanding, neither in the <em>prapatti</em> nor in the fruit thereof, one has any independence; it should be in the same way as one would surrender a jewel belonging to another to that person himself to be kept safe by him and to be worn by him.</p>
<p>That is ;&mdash; one should realise that, in relation to the Lord of all who appears in the base and the suffix of the first letter in the <em>praṇava</em> (i.e.) a which means <em>Iśvara</em> and the suffix of the dative or fourth case which has been dropped (i.e.) aya (for the Lord of all) as the protector of all and the <em>śeṣī</em>  of all, one has no interest or connection at all in the activity of protecting one-self or those related to one-self and also in what results from the protection of oneself and those related to oneself, either as depending upon one self or as bringing about some results for oneself. It is the specific form of thought that one is <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord and is entirely dependent upon the Lord - in this, the most important feature is surrendering the responsibility of protection (bhara_nyāsa_) to the Lord.</p>
<p>THE MANNER IN WHICH BHARANYĀSA</p>
<p>SHOULD BE PERFORMED:</p>
<p>The manner in which this form of mental realisation contained in the injunction &ldquo;One should surrender one&rsquo;s self to me&rdquo; should be effected is as follows:- The person should realise this within himself: viz., &ldquo;I am absolutely dependent (upon the Lord); I am His <em>śeṣa</em> and exist only for Him. My _śeṣa_tva does not belong to anybody else and has no dependence on anybody else. Therefore <em>Iśvara</em> who is the <em>śeṣī</em>  and who is independent should protect me for the fulfilment of His own purposes. As is said in the <em>śloka</em>  : &ldquo;Even myself or ātmā does not belong to me; (if a man should consider what does not belong to him as his, he could consider the whole earth as his )&rsquo;; my soul does not belong to me, it does not belong to anyone else (than <em>Bhagavān</em>), I do not belong to myself, nor can I say that any thing belongs to me unconditionally. As stated in the <em>śloka</em>  -&rdquo; The embodied being who is like a lump of clay and is entirely dependent on the Lord) is not able to protect himself; how can he protect others ?&rsquo;, I am incapable of protecting myself and those who are said to be mine, independently (of the Lord) or for the sake of myself as the main person interested in it.&rdquo; Just as the wise Uparicharvasu always felt that his soul, his kingdom, his wealth, his wife, and his vehicles were all for <em>Bhagavān</em>, we should also say, &ldquo;I and what is mine are His. The responsibility of protecting these is also that of the Lord who is the universal Protector&rdquo; for it is said : &quot; the surrender of the responsibility for one&rsquo;s self and of what is one&rsquo;s is called atmanikshepa.&quot; &quot; There is no one other than <em>Bhagavān</em> who is capable of affording protection &ldquo;. The fruit of this protection should also be considered primarily His, for it has been said, &ldquo;Ātmanikshep consists (also) in giving up all relationship to the fruit resulting from His protection and surrendering it (viz the fruit) to Keśava &ldquo;who is the chief beneficiary&rdquo;.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em> :</p>
<p>मुमुक्षुमात्रसामान्यं स्वरूपादिसमर्पणं । अकिञ्चने भरन्यासस्त्वधिकोऽङ्गितया स्थितः ॥ २८-अ॥ अत्र रक्षाभरन्यासस्समस्सर्वफलार्थिनाम् । स्वरूपफलनिक्षेपस्त्वधिको मोक्षकाङ्क्षिणाम् ॥ २८-आ॥</p>
<p>To all seekers of <em>mokṣa</em>  (whether bhaktas or prapannas), the surrender of one&rsquo;s <em>svarūpa</em> or self and the rest (i.e) the fruit in common. To one who has no other <em>upāya</em> ((i.e.) prapannā) and is therefore akinchand, the surrender of the responsibility of protection (bharanyása ) is an additional <em>aṅgī</em>. To all prapannas, whatever may be the object desired by them, the surrender of the responsibility is cominon. To those prapannas who are desirous of (only) <em>mokṣa</em> , the surrender of one&rsquo;s self or <em>svarūpa</em> and also of the fruit arising therefrom is an additional (requirement).</p>
<p><em>IŚVARA</em> IS THE PRINCIPAL BENEFICIARY :</p>
<p>If it is asked how, when the <em>Jīva</em>   who performs <em>prapatti</em> as the <em>upāya</em> for the sake of some gain or fruit is the person interested in the fruit, <em>Iśvara</em> becomes the chief beneficiary, the answer is as follows:-<em>Iśvara</em> becomes the chief beneficiary, because, just like the modifications of <em>acit</em> or matter, the benefits (purushārthas) granted by Him to <em>cit</em> (<em>jīva</em>) are pleasing to Him. Being the <em>śeṣī</em>  of all, He is the chief beneficiary. To a man of cultivated tastes, who is not in need of anything, the delight in melting dolls made of metals and shaping them into ornaments and wearing them in admiration of their beauty is not different (in kind) from the delight enjoyed by him in keeping a sentient being like a parrot in a cage and feeding it with milk and seeing it fly according to His pleasure.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em></p>
<p>स्वनिर्भरत्वपर्यन्तरक्षकैकार्थ्यभावनम् ।</p>
<p>त्यक्तरक्षाफलस्वाम्यं रक्ष्यस्यात्मसमर्पणम् ॥ २८-इ॥</p>
<p>Therefore, ātmasamarpanam (the surrendering of the self to the Lord for protection) means here the realisation of the self as existing solely for the purpose of the Saviour and that to such an extent that the self feels no further responsibility, whatever, for its own protection and this should be accompanied by the knowledge that the fruits of such surrender are not one&rsquo;s own. The purport of the <em>śloka</em>  in Alavandar&rsquo;s Stotra (52)</p>
<p>‘‘वपुरादिषु योऽपि कोऽपि वा गुणतोऽसानि यथा तथाविधः । तदयं तव पादपद्मयोरहमद्यैव मया समर्पितः’’(आळवन्दार् स्तोत्रम् 52.)</p>
<p>which says &ldquo;Whatever I may be in the body, the senses and the like, and whatever may be the qualities of my Nature, I who know that I am Thy <em>śeṣa</em> hereby surrender myself at this very moment at thy two lotus-like feet&rdquo; &ndash; the purport of this <em>śloka</em>  is as follows:</p>
<p>If a man has (somehow) come into possession of a cloth bag with the king&rsquo;s seal on it, he would return the bag (to the king), even though he does not know for certain the nature and character of the gem contained within it, in the hope that the king would take it back. So also even those who have not the intelligence to know, with perfect clearness, the nature, character and state of the soul as distinguished from the body may surrender their self or soul with the little knowledge that they possess. If they do so, even for that much, <em>Bhagavān</em> will be prepared to remit the punishment for the theft consisting in making away with one&rsquo;s self (i. e. claiming it as one&rsquo;s own) from beginningless time. This idea contained in the _śāstra_s is what (Alavandar) has in mind. In the next *<em>śloka</em>  (53)<sup id="fnref:283"><a href="#fn:283" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">283</a></sup> it might appear as if he revoked the surrender (made before); but its meaning is only this : Even when a person is bent on surrendering his self without a knowledge of such things as the nature of his self, if he surrenders it with the notion that it is his own, like the presentation to a king of something belonging to oneself, it would not completely put an end to the crime of having stolen one&rsquo;s self. It does not mean that Alavandar considered his self surrender made in <em>śloka</em>  52 in accordance with the injunctions contained in the _śāstra_s, as having been made in ignorance.</p>
<p>“मम नाथ यदस्ति योऽस्म्यहं सकलं तद्धि तवैव माधव । नियतस्वमिति प्रबुद्धधीरथवा किन्नु समर्पयामि ते॥ आळवन्दार् स्तोत्रम्-५३
However O lord, what can I surrender to Thee, O Madhava, when I know that I and whatever belongs to me are always thine. As I have nothing of my own, I have nothing to surrender, I am only giving Thee what belongs to Thee&rdquo;,</p>
<p>So from these two <em>śloka</em> s, it is clear that the essence of the _śāstra_s which primarily prescribe <em>bharasamarpaṇam</em> as in the words of Alavandar (60) &ldquo;The responsibility of protecting me is also Thine&rdquo;, consists in saying &ldquo;na mama “It is not mine&rdquo; and getting rid of the feeling of one&rsquo;s connection (with everything), though one may not have a true and discriminatory knowledge about such things as the essential nature of the self.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE <em>AÑGĪ</em> IN <em>DVAYAM</em> :</p>
<p>Thus in the first part of the <em>Dvaya</em> which deals with the <em>upāya</em> or means, the surrender to the Lord of the responsibility (for one&rsquo;s protection) accompanied by the thought that one is <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord and exists only for Him is to be understood in connection with the verb (prapadye) joined with the word s&rsquo;aranam which treats of the <em>upāya</em> preceded by supreme faith ( mahavisvāsa ) and which contains within it, in an implicit form, the supplication for protection.</p>
<p>Thus (from what has been said in this chapter and in the foregoing chapters), although these six (the five _aṅga_s and the angī) may be understood separately, while considering, in detail, the meaning of each part of the sentence, yet they constitute only a single mental act while understanding the whole sentence, just like the understanding of other sentences having several parts. Therefore, in accordance with the s&rsquo;astras, this principal action with its _aṅga_s is performed only once.</p>
<p><em>PRAPATTI</em> IS A MOMENTARY ACTION.</p>
<p>An archer&rsquo;s action in discharging an arrow for hitting a target may be constituted of several separate acts (like observing the object, taking the aim and discharging the arrow) and yet it is all accomplished in a single moment. Similar is the act of surrendering (to the Lord) the responsibility of (one&rsquo;s) protection. This is evident from the <em>śruti</em>  itself. (The <em>śruti</em>  says, &ldquo;* <em>Praṇava</em> (<em>aum</em>) is the bow: the soul or self is the arrow; it must be discharged at <em>Brahman</em>, which is the target, with great care and with keen concentration &ldquo;).</p>
<p>That this surrender of the responsibility of protection (bharasamarpana) should be chiefly thought of while uttering the _mantra_s of <em>prapatti</em> is clearly stated as follows in Satyaki tantra by the Saviour Himself, who undertakes the responsibility: &ldquo;With this <em>mantra</em> one should surrender one&rsquo;s self to me. The one who has surrendered to me the responsibility of doing what should be done will become one who has done one&rsquo;s duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A BRIEF STATEMENT OF WHAT BHARASAMARPAṆA IS:</p>
<p>In (the performance of) this (angī), the conclusion regarding the adoption of this <em>upāya</em> with its _aṅga_s is as follows:- it consists in the act of surrendering the responsibility for the protection of one&rsquo;s self preceded by the following:&ndash;the giving up of the thought that one is the doer (for it is the Lord that does everything), the giving up of the thought of &lsquo;mine&rsquo; (that there is anything belonging to oneself), the giving up of the fruit of the action, the giving ap of the thought that he himself adopts the means for obtaining that fruit; these must be accompanied by anukūlya <em>saṅkalpa</em>, pratikulyavarjana and the rest and, likewise, reverent bowing down to the succession of _guru_s and with the utterance of <em>Dvaya</em>. The surrender of the responsibility for the protection of one&rsquo;s self carries with it implicitly the surrender of one&rsquo;s <em>Svarūpa</em> or self and the fruit or gain arising from it. The giving up of the thought that one is the doer will result from the realisation of one&rsquo;s entire dependance on the Lord throughout the existence of the soul. This will make one know that this doership has been vouchsafed to one by the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>The giving up of the thought of &ldquo;MINE&rsquo; (mama) and of the fruit (of <em>prapatti</em>) will arise from the knowledge that one, as well as what belongs to one, exists, by one&rsquo;s very nature, solely for the fulfilment of the purposes of <em>Bhagavān</em> alone.</p>
<p>The giving up of the <em>upāya</em> for attaining the fruit (<em>mokṣa</em> ) will result from a knowledge that the <em>prapatti</em> performed by a man for winning the grace of the Saviour cannot directly and immediately be the cause of the main fruit, namely, <em>mokṣa</em> , that</p>
<p><em>prapatti</em> is non-sentient and, therefore, incapable of possessing the will to grant the fruit and that only <em>Iśvara</em> is the <em>upāya</em> for this fruit (<em>mokṣa</em> ). Since <em>Bhagavān</em> who, out of the love natural to Him, has been the primaeval cause of everything from the time of giving the man the body and the senses to the time of his uttering the <em>Dvaya</em>-since <em>Bhagavān</em> is possessed of the will accompanied by the desire to show His grace and is the immediate and direct cause (of the final fruit, viz. <em>mokṣa</em> ) and since he also stands Himself in the place of the prescribed <em>upāya</em> in the case of the man who is incapable of (adopting) other _upāya_s, He alone is the <em>upāya</em> for the fruit. The authority for this conclusion is the nature of the object, (namely, <em>Bhagavān</em>) as understood from the śāstra which reveals the Person who has that nature and this authority cannot be challenged by reason.</p>
<p>NADATHUR AMMĀL&rsquo;S SUMMARY OF THE MEANING OF</p>
<p><em>PRAPATTI</em> :</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the performance of <em>prapatti</em> with its _aṅga_s as given by Śrī Nadathur Ammal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been wandering in <em>samsāra</em> by doing, from beginning less time, what is displeasing to Thee. From this day onwards, I will do what is pleasing (to Thee). I will not do what will displease (Thee). I have no capital with which to attain Thee, I have made up my mind to seek only Thee as the <em>upāya</em>. Be Thou my <em>upāya</em>! Hereafter, either in the removal of what is evil or in the attainment of what is good, I have no further responsibility from now onwards&rdquo;. In this the determination to do what is pleasing and abstinence from what is displeasing have to be stated only once as accessories or _aṅga_s to the <em>upāya</em>. His acting later in accordance with this determination to do what is pleasing etc. will be the result or fruit of the <em>upāya</em> and will last as long as his self lasts. If, in accordance with the words of Śrī Ammal, we take the avoidance of what is displeasing as meaning only the determination to avoid what is displeasing, it is evident that it has to be made only once (i.c at the time of <em>prapatti</em>). It is true that it has been said :-&ldquo;I have dissociated myself from sins which cast one into <em>samsāra</em>.&rdquo; (But it may be explained in this way :-) The avoidance of what is displeasing may meen either having no connection (at all) with it (i.e.) giving it up or the determination to avoid it. In either case, this is, at the first instant, an <em>aṅga</em> and the actual avoidance is the result or fruit of <em>prapatti</em> which follows afterwards. This holds good also in regard to visvāsa or faith.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>प्रवृत्तिरनुकूलेषु निवृत्तिश्चान्यतः फलम् । प्रारब्धसुकृताच्च स्यात् सङ्कल्पे च प्रपत्तितः ॥ २८-अ ॥</p>
<p>Doing what is pleasing (to the Lord) and avoiding what is displeasing (in one&rsquo;s life after <em>prapatti</em>) are the result of meritorious deeds done in the past, and also the determination made at the time of performing <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore wise are they who perform <em>prapatti</em> in order to render faultless service during their life-time and to attain <em>mokṣa</em>  after casting off the body resulting from prārabdha <em>karma</em>,</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>

<p>Our princely <em>ācārya</em> s, who wear the crown of proficiency in the Vedas, have placed us for protection under the feet of the Lord, who, from beginningless time, has resolved, in His great compassion, to save us; they have done so in order that there may be no further responsibility in ourselves (for our protection), by saying to us, &ldquo;Do not forget the truth that the Lord, who is the soul of the world, will protect you who are related to Him as <em>śeṣa</em> (existing solely for His purposes),&rdquo;</p>

In connection with these activities, all the three are of the nature of being the material) causes; two, <em>cit</em> and <em>Iśvara</em>, are of the nature of doers, and one (1.) <em>Iśvara</em> is alone independent (of all others). Therefore the <em>jīva</em>, the responsibility for whose protection has been undertaken by <em>Iśvara</em> who is the Master, is carefree and has no further responsibility of his own in the matter of his protection.</p>

<p>(13) THE CHAPTER ON THE MAN WHO HAS DONE WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE (I.E.) <em>PRAPATTI</em>. page195</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>.</p>
<p>समर्थे सर्वज्ञे सहजसुहृदि स्वीकृतभरे</p>
<p>यदर्थं कर्तव्यं न पुनरिह यत्किञ्चिदपि नः ।</p>
<p>नियच्छन्तस्तस्मिन्निरुपधिमहानन्दजलधौ</p>

<p>When <em>Bhagavān</em>, who is omnipotent, who knows all things and who is, by His nature, full of love for us, has accepted the responsibility (of protecting us ), there is nothing more remaining to be done by us here for it; let us therefore fix our souls in that bundle of supreme bliss and feel the satisfaction (of having attained our object) by becoming rich in rendering service to Him, poor though we may have been before.</p>
<p>THE <em>PRAPANNA</em> HAS DONE WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO</p>
<p>AND HAS ATTAINED HIS GOAL:</p>
<p>(1) The man who has adopted this <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) has, from the time when he adopted it, nothing else to do for attaining the fruit thereof. (2) What he had to do has been done by performing <em>prapatti</em> once; (3) (<em>Bhagavān</em>) who is independent (of all others), whose will is irresistible and who is the one that rewards us with the fruit (of our actions) says, &ldquo;Do not grieve ,&rdquo;[<em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em>] . Owing to these (three) reasons, the <em>prapanna</em> would become care-free at the thought of having surrendered his bhara. The Lord of all who has been accepted as the <em>upāya</em>*, which is ever present [<em>Siddhopāya</em> - the <em>upāya</em> which is ever present is <em>Bhagavān</em>, for He is always eager to save the <em>jīva</em>.] as stated in, &ldquo;Seek refuge under me alone&rdquo;, has said &ldquo;I will release Thee from all sins&rdquo;, and since the Lord can (always) be trusted and since He is capable (of acting according to His word), he would have no doubts or fears in regard to the realisation of his object. So he (the <em>prapanna</em>) would rejoice at having given up even the slightest trace of other aims or objects and also with having given up other _upāya_s along with _upāya_s which are subsidiary to them. Like a poor man who has received a great treasure with little effort, he would rejoice at the prospect of the supreme goal (of life ) which he is to attain. It has been said: &ldquo;He who has sought, in every possible manner, the refuge of Nārāyaṇa  who is the Saviour and the <em>guru</em> of the world is not the servant of the gods, of the rishis, of animals, of men and of the pitṛs. He is in no way their debtor&rdquo;. In regard to such _jīva_s (kshetrajnas) as have taken the names of Prajāpati (the Lord of creatures ) and Pasupati (the Lord of beasts, viz. bound souls), he is able, like one whose promissory note registered in the unwritten Vedas under certain conditions (upādhi relating to caste etc.) and requiring service as interest for the principal ( borrowed by him from them) has been fully discharged (torn off).</p>
<p>Therefore when he has to pronounce their names in the performance of *such compulsory and regularly recurrent and occasional rites as the five great yajnas (Panchamaha yajnas), he would realise that these names refer really to <em>Iśvara</em> (<em>Bhagavān</em>) etymologically: as has been stated by the sages in passages like :-&rdquo; Those who worship the pitṛs (the spirits of their fore-fathers), the gods, the Brahmins and Agni - they (in reality) worship only Viṣṇu , who is the Inner Self of all beings.&rdquo; When the king&rsquo;s servants place a garland and a jewel on the coat worn by the king, their object is not to please the coat but to gain the favour of the king.</p>
<p>The same idea has been expressed in such places as the chapter called Yajnagrahara in the Mahābhārata   (Ch. 349 Śānti Parva:&ldquo;The Great Padmanabha receives the quintessences of all the offerings made in sacrifices&rdquo; and when the gods asked <em>Brahma</em> who was performing a sacrifice to <em>Bhagavān</em> he replied: &ldquo;Neither by me nor by any one else who wants to cross the sea of <em>samsāra</em> are you adored with sacrifices. It is only <em>Bhagavān</em> who receives our offerings”)[The idea is that Prajāpati, Pasupati. Agni and others are only like the coat of a king and that, within them, there is the Inner Ruler, Immortal, who alone is Parameśvara or the Supreme Ruler.] and in Hastigiri Māhātmya. In the <em>Brahma</em> _Sūtra_s also (1-2-29), it is said : &ldquo;Since words like Agni refer directly also to <em>Brahman</em>, Jaimini is of the opinion that there is nothing unreasonable in it&rdquo;. Such words as gods and pitṛs have no connection with the coats called gods and pitṛs and by the full significance contained in their parts (i.e.) etymology or derivation, they stand for <em>Iśvara</em> (<em>Bhagavān</em>), in the same way as words like Nārāyaṇa  do. In pronouncing such words (Prajāpati, Pasupati, Agni), the <em>prapanna</em> would realise that there is no violation of his sole and exclusive devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em>, in the same way as, when the pure Sacrificers (s&rsquo;uddhayaji) who live in Swetadvipa pronounce the word Nārāyaṇa  (Nārānam ayanam), they do not go against their exclusive devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em> by using the word Nāra. <em>Bhagavān</em> has willed to accept him as His servant to render service in accordance with his <em>varṇa</em>, <em>āśrama</em>, occasions (like the birth of a child) and qualities (like being a Vaiṣṇava). Therefore by service to Him who is the Ruler and the <em>śeṣī</em>-service which consists in obedient performance of His commands and permissions as understood from the _Śāstra_s, the <em>prapanna</em> would do his little bit of service like the freed souls who understand the mind of the Lord by direct perception and be like the muktas; he would be extolled, according to the śāstra s and those who stand by them, as one who, by the completion of the <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>), has done his duty and who, by the completion of his aim in life, has attained satisfaction.</p>
<p>Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em> has conclusively described the <em>prapanna</em>&rsquo;s reflection on his satisfactory fulfilment of his duty thus in his <em>Śaraṇāgati</em> <em>Gadya</em> :-&ldquo;Therefore rest happy in the assurance free from all doubt that you will know me, see me, and attain me As I truly am&rdquo;. This is what it means:-&ldquo;We were wandering in <em>samsāra</em> owing to <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s punishment inflicted on us for transgressing His commands from beginningless time. By the compassion of <em>Bhagavān</em> ever waiting for an opportunity (to save us), we came into the reach of the kind glances of our good <em>ācārya</em> s and by repeating after them their utterance of <em>Dvaya</em>, we have completed our <em>prapatti</em>. There is no further means needed for obtaining the Saviour. Therefore He will pardon (all the sins) which were the cause of the punishment. The Lord of Śrī(Lakṣmī ) who is the <em>śeṣī</em>  of all and who is capable of purifying His devotees and obtaining their service, will, for His own glory, protect us. With this faith, the <em>prapanna</em> would be free from all care or anxiety or responsibility.&rdquo; (This is the purport of Śrī_Rāmānuja_&rsquo;s words in the <em>Gadya</em>). This idea is the conclusive meaning which is surely contained also in the Saviour&rsquo;s words &ldquo;Do not grieve&rdquo; (in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>).</p>
<p>THE MARKS OF ONE WHO HAS PERFORMED</p>
<p><em>PRAPATTI</em> :</p>
<p>Since one of the qualifications for the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, is sorrow or grief before <em>prapatti</em>, if he had no grief before, he would not have the necessary qualification for performing <em>prapatti</em>. So by the principle &ldquo;when there is no cause, there is no effect,&rdquo; his <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) will not be effective. If, after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, he grieves owing to want of faith in the words of the Saviour, it would follow by the principle &ldquo;When the effect is absent, there must have been absence of all the required materials (or causes)&rdquo; that his <em>upāya</em> is incomplete (owing to want of full faith) and that the benefit or fruit will be delayed inasmuch as it will require the completion of the <em>upāya</em>. The man who was formerly full of grief and who is now free from sorrow in accordance with the words&rdquo; Do not grieve&rdquo; may be considered to have done what should be done (i.e.) <em>prapatti</em> in the proper manner,</p>

<p>Our spiritual leaders whom the Lord of Śrī that dwells on Hastigiri has taken into His protection after endeavouring for a long time to find out what boon He should confer on those who loved Him. They are like kings and gods (to us), for they have, ever in their minds, the abode of the Lord of the eternal suris and they are like Paramahamsas, because they have completed all rites that have to be performed, (or like swans in their purity or in their capacity to separate the essential from the non-essential).</p>

<p>Bharanyāsa (or the surrender of the responsibility of protection) has been made (at the feet of) <em>Bhagavān</em> (Hari) for reaching beyond <em>samsāra</em>. So also actions that can produce only limited pleasures have been given up just like forbidden actions. The sustenance of the body will continue in accordance with past <em>karma</em> (which has begun to operate). So nothing needs to be done for it. Thereafter (i.e) after <em>prapatti</em> the bounds<sup id="fnref:284"><a href="#fn:284" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">284</a></sup> * imposed by the Lord&rsquo;s command are scrupulously observed by wise men, (merely because it is the Lord&rsquo;s command.)</p>
<p>This means that the <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> karmas which are ordained by the Lord in the śāstra s have still to be performed after <em>prapatti</em>, as, otherwise, there would be transgression of His command.</p>

<p>To a man whose understanding is firmly and properly fixed on (a knowledge of) his essential nature, on the <em>upāya</em> adopted by him, viz. <em>prapatti</em> and on the ultimate aim of life (<em>puruṣārtha</em>), a recognition that he is steadily fixed in this state gives more delight (even) than his approaching <em>mokṣa</em> . For by the might of this knowledge, he is able, with a disciplined mind, to close up the chasms lying before him (as obstacles) which are deep and hard to fill and which are as immense as the sky,</p>
<p>I. Signs or marks regarding <em>niṣṭhā</em> in <em>Svarūpa</em></p>
<p>How can a man know that he has firm faith or <em>niṣṭhā</em> (in regard to the knowledge of <em>svarūpa</em>?) The answer is as follows: (1) when he is treated with such things as contumely by others, he would be free from sorrow or depression owing to the knowledge that these faults pertaining to the body and the like (ugliness, low birth etc) have no connection (at all) with his essential nature, (2) It has been said:-&ldquo;When one man&rsquo; reviles another, the sin of the reviled person passes on to the reviler&rdquo;. So towards these fools that are to receive his sin by their derisive talk, he (the <em>prapanna</em>) should feel overwhelming compassion as stated in such <em>śloka</em> s as the following - &ldquo;If other created beings harbour enmity and show hatred, the wise man pities them saying, &ldquo;How wrapped up they are in great delusion!&rdquo; and &ldquo;One should very much pity the fool who does evil to himself by violating the _śāstra_s and straying from the right path and who is, therefore, like firewood destined for the flames of hell.” The <em>prapanna</em></p>
<p>would feel grateful to these revilers as being benefactors who remind him, by their censure, of faults which have been described in Alavandar&rsquo;s *<em>śloka</em> [  &ldquo;How can I ever cross the sea of Sorrow and render service at Thy feet - I who have transgressed all the regulations of the śāstra s who am mean, fickle-minded, cavious, ungrateful, arrogant, lustful, deceitful, wicked and sinful?&rdquo; ] and in such verses as those of Tirum_aṅga_i Alvar [&ldquo;Born into this life, I fell into deep anguish of mind. I mingled with young women thinking it was greatly to be desired, until at last I realised that salvation consists only in the utterance of the name &lsquo;Nārāyaṇa”.] as fit to be reflected on in connection with oneself. (4) The <em>prapanna</em> (who has the <em>niṣṭhā</em> in <em>svarūpa</em>) would understand that all souls are dependent on <em>Bhagavān</em> owing to their essential nature, that all _jīva_s (kshetrajnas) are under the sway of past <em>karma</em> and that these revilers of his (therefore) revile him by the prompting of <em>Iśvara</em>, who is independent and is the <em>śeṣī</em>  of all and who enjoys the līlā which follows from past <em>karma</em> in the relations between him and his revilers. He would therefore feel no aversion to them: (5) He would rejoice that his past sins which have begun to operate in this life are now being worked out in part. If he has these marks or characteristics as clarified in the explanation of the meaning of the first word (<em>praṇava</em>) and the middle word na mama (<em>namo</em>) in the <em>Mūlamantra</em>, the <em>prapanna</em> may consider that he has realised his difference from <em>acit</em> or matter, that he possesses knowledge which will enable him to act beneficially towards all beings, that he feels his being destitute of _upāya_s of any kind, that he knows his existing solely for the fulfilment of the purposes of <em>Bhagavān</em> and is entirely dependent on him and should therefore do what is pleasing to the Lord, who, by His very nature, is impartial, who rewards (or punishes), each according to his <em>karma</em>, and who is the independent <em>śeṣī</em> for whom all else exist and that he understands that his good can arise only from the will of another (i.e.) the Lord, as has been pointed out in the s&rsquo;loka; “Where am I who am so full of evil thoughts? Where is the possibility of my seeking what is good to me? Therefore, O Thou, that controllest the gods! Direct me to do whatever is good for me, O Madhava!&rdquo;</p>
<p>II THE NISHTĀ CONCERNING <em>UPĀYA</em> :</p>
<p>If, in him, these features that follow are found, the man who has performed <em>prapatti</em> may infer that he is in the proper state in relation to the knowledge concerning the <em>upāya</em> (1) He under. stands that, for him, there is no protection from himself or from others and that <em>Iśvara</em> is his only Protector : (2) Though he is confronted with causes of fear even to the extent of death, he does not bewail his state and feels satisfied as at the approach of what is desirable, for it has been said: &ldquo;People are &lsquo;generally afraid of Death because they have not done what they should have done ; those who have done what they should do expect Death as if he were a welcome guest&rdquo; (3) He has the perfect confidence of having found a Saviour. Sītā Devi taught this by her example. &ldquo;The beautiful Sītā, resting on the arm of ŚrīRama, was not afraid at the sight of the elephant, the lion or the tiger (when she was with him in the forest)&rdquo; She said to Ravana:-O Thou &lsquo;(Rākṣasa) with ten heads that deservest to be reduced to ashes! because I have not obtained ŚrīRama&rsquo;s permission and because I have to cherish my tapas as a pativrată (a wife devoted to her husband), I do not burn thee to ashes by the flame (of my chastity) and likewise, &ldquo;if Rama who can destroy the forces of his enemies fills Lanka with his arrows and take me away from here, it will be in keeping with his character.&rdquo; In respect of the object for which he has made bhara_nyāsa_, the <em>prapanna</em> is without any (further) effort of his own (to save himself). In that matter, he realises that the removal of what is evil and the attainment of what is good are in the Lord&rsquo;s hands alone. If he has these features, it may be inferred that he is steadfastly fixed in the <em>upāya</em> which he has sought and which is the means of obtaining all the benefits desired by him, which is prescribed as an <em>upāya</em> in the first half of the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em> , which is to be thought of in the first part of <em>Dvaya</em> and which is implicit also in the middle word of Tirumantra (<em>namo</em>).</p>
<p>III THE NISHTĀ CONCERNING PURUSHĀRTHA:</p>
<p>It has been said:&ndash; &ldquo;Of the three, your birth, continuance and perishing, why should you be anxious only about your continuance? In the same way as birth and death come of themselves (without any choice being left to you), your continuance in life also will not depend on anything done by you&rdquo; and again: &ldquo;The goddess of <em>Lakṣmī</em> comes, of her own accord, to one who does not exert himself in any way. Another man who makes efforts does not obtain even the food (he wants). This is in accordance with past <em>karma</em>&rdquo;. The <em>prapanna</em> whose understanding is firmly fixed in the purushūrtha would not feel anxious in relation to such things as the maintenance of the body.which are directed by <em>Iśvara</em> in accordance with particular acts of past <em>karma</em> that have begun to operate in this life. He would reflect that, even if he grieved or felt anxious about these things, nothing would happen except according to the will of God, as stated in the following passages:- &ldquo;Though he flies in the air, or enters the lower world, called Rasatala, or wanders about the whole earth, a man will not obtain what is not ordained for him&rdquo; and again, “Whatever work is done in the world is work done by me. So others propose but I dispose.&rdquo; When things not forbidden in the _śāstra_s come to him without any seeking of his and by the will of God, the <em>prapanna</em> realises that the debt which has resulted from past <em>karma</em> that has begun to operate is now being discharged. Therefore he enjoys them without trying to avoid them. For it has been said in Parāsaragita and elsewhere - &ldquo;House-bolders should receive whatever comes to them without any exertion on their part. As regards their _dharma_s, on the other hand, it is my opinion that they should, in all possible ways, exert themselves</p>
<p>and fulfil them”, and so also, “The wise man should not be anxious about his food. He should think only of his <em>dharma</em>. Man&rsquo;s food comes to him along with his birtb.&rdquo; Like-wise it has been stated in Ajagaropakhyāna :-&ldquo;I do not avoid enjoyments which come to me of themselves and which are also in keeping with (my) <em>dharma</em> nor do I seek any enjoyment which can be had only with painful effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <em>prapanna</em> who has attained <em>niṣṭhā</em> in <em>puruṣārtha</em> has neither pleasure nor pain, when he meets with or fails to get objects usually desired other than <em>mokṣa</em> , as taught in the following <em>śloka</em> s :-&ldquo;When one of these two, pleasure and pain, arrives, one should not feel delighted on seeing pleasure nor feel sorrow when one sees pain&rdquo;, and &ldquo;The man who meditates on the feet of the Lord is not elated at the possession of wealth, nor does he feel dispirited when what he possesses is lost.&rdquo; He has, on the other hand, a great longing for service to the Lord which is suited to his essential nature and which is the supreme aim of his life. This urgent longing for the object to be gained will make him cry out as in Alavandar&rsquo;s Stotram und in Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s <em>Gadya</em>, &ldquo;When, when shall I see, face to face, <em>Bhagavān</em> Nārāyaṇa ? When shall I press his two lotus-like feet on my head?&rdquo; When such conduct and feeling are seen in the <em>prapanna</em>, it may be inferred that his mind is firmly fixed in regard to the supreme and infinite goal of existence which is indicated, as (an infinitesimal part of) the sea is by the finger, in the dative Nārāyanāya in Tiru_mantra_, in the dative Nārāyanāya and in the word <em>namas</em> in <em>Dvaya</em> and in the sentence &ldquo;I shall release thee from all sins&rdquo; in <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em> ,</p>
<p>Thus by observing these signs in himself, the man may realise that he is well established in the state of a true <em>prapanna</em> in regard to his essential Nature (<em>svarūpa</em>), his <em>upāya</em> and his supreme aim (<em>puruṣārtha</em>) as stated in the <em>śloka</em> I am a self, not a body; I am the <em>śeṣa</em> who exists only for Lord; I have no possessions of my own; I have sought His protection with the desire to render service to Him&rdquo; and as understood also from Tirumantra and the like. To the <em>prapanna</em> who has seen in himself these signs, there will be no causes of fear confronting him other than offence to those who know <em>Brahman</em>, which might occur (as a possibility) on account of his living in the midst of enemies (the body and the senses), nor sources of delight other than the service which suits his essential nature. This may be seen in the case of Sītā devi of whom it is said, &ldquo;Sītā does not look at these Rākṣasis; she does not look at these trees full of flowers and fruits. Her heart is fixed on one alone and she sees only ŚrīRama&rdquo;. If by chance, these (other causes of fear and sources of delight) come before him, he will have neither fear nor delight.</p>

<p>Those who have become well-established in their knowledge of the three things shown in the Tirumantra (namely, <em>svarūpa</em>, <em>upāya</em>, and <em>puruṣārtha</em>) will never agree to do what is improper and will do only what is proper. They are really wise men who find, in themselves, these attitudes and actions and they may be called eternal sūris living on the earth.</p>

<p>THE CHAPTER ON THE MANNER IN WHICH ONE SHOULD CONDUCT ONESELF AFTER <em>PRAPATTI</em>. page206</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>सन्तोषार्थं विमृशति मुहुस्सद्भिरद्ध्यात्मविद्यां</p>

<p>दृष्टादृष्टस्वभरविगमे दत्तदृष्टिः प्रपन्नः ॥ ३४ ॥</p>
<p>The <em>prapanna</em>, with his eyes fixed on the absence of his own responsibility (bhara) in regard to both what is seen in this life and what is to come hereafter, follows, until the fall of his body, a course of action which is faultless and agreeable ( observing the code of conduct prescribed for his <em>varṇa</em> and his <em>āśrama</em>) and for the sake of delight (in the enjoyment of the auspicious qualities of <em>Bhagavān</em> ) frequently studies Vedānta  with good men, teaches the sweet and noble utterances (of such as Alvars ), always and also listens to them.</p>
<p>THE CODE OF CONDUCT SUITED FOR A <em>PRAPANNA</em>:</p>
<p>The man who has thus done what he should do and infers his proper attainment of <em>niṣṭhā</em> (in <em>svarūpa</em>, <em>upāya</em> and <em>puruṣārtha</em>) should follow the line of conduct described hereunder as long as he lives, like a farmer who, out of a big field fit for use in the adoration of the Lord, gives up a large part and reserves only a small fraction of it as enough for his needs. This adhikārī, namely, the <em>prapanna</em>, who has given up his connection with many things and is still connected with certain things (like the body) should follow a line of conduct which would be most delightful like the successive services rendered by released souls (in heaven). This line of conduct is an end in itself; it has been prescribed for him in the _śāstra_s as required to be done (in certain specific divisions of time); it is a form of service connected by links to the service which is to follow immediately after and is the means of winning the favour of the Master and is also its effect. The following passages indicate this line of conduct; -</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read the books which describe the attributes and qualities of <em>Bhagavān</em>; I listened to other people reading them, I bowed to Him, I worshipped Him always and performed service to Him and thus saw to it that my time was not spent in vain&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men should get rid of their sorrow which is as deep as the sea on account of past <em>karma</em> surrounding the soul, by meditating on those passages which reveal the Lord&rsquo;s qualities. If they should not do so, by what other thought can they get rid of their sorrow while in <em>samsāra</em> ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should, without intermission render service to the Lord in all places and in all circumstances and at all times&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Lord is so gracious as to enable me to spend my time always with the passages which describe His qualities in my mouth, with His form alluring the eye and other senses in my mind, and with flowers fit enough for His form in my hands - if I find this grace, what is there unpleasant for me while living here?”</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was born to seek flowers that are hard to obtain in order that they may be placed at the Lord&rsquo;s feet&rdquo;</p>
<p>“May I, the sinner that I am, press the tender feet of the Lord which are gently pressed by the incomparably beautiful Lakṣmī  and the other, viz, the goddess of the Earth!”</p>
<p>“This is the only object that I desire – that the Lord should take me into His service for His own satisfaction&rdquo;. &ldquo;We will render service, O Lord, only to Thee&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Lord &lsquo;will be so gracious as to let us gently press His feet in the place where He sleeps&rsquo;&rsquo;, My fingers will keep count when I utter the names of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The days of my starvation are not those on which I do not eat - (they are) the days, if ever they occur, on which I do not constantly meditate saying &ldquo;nāmo Nārāyaṇa&rsquo;&rsquo; and the days on which I do not approach Thy feet with the three Vedas which are (as it were) freshly bloomed flowers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My tongue will not praise any one but Thee; I wonder whether Thou wilt suffer any loss of glory by my praise; but I cannot stop praising Thee, for my tongue is not under my control&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mouth does not praise any one but Him&rdquo;,</p>
<p>&ldquo;My shoulders do not bow to anyone but Him&rdquo;,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not look upon my soul which belongs to the Lord as my own, nor will I remain in the company of those mean persons who think so,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May Thou be so gracious as to make me ever meditate on Thee &ldquo;,</p>
<p>&quot; When will these two eyes of mine delight in looking at the forehead of the Lord where the two gems that shed light shine dispelling darkness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not long for birth accompanied with wealth that (only) makes the flesh grow but pray to be born as a bird in the Venkata Hills&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eyes of those who have not seen that Golden Hill which rides on the bird and which, long ago, planted the hill wound with the serpent in the sea and churned it for the sake of nectar &ndash; their eyes are not eyes at all&rdquo; [&ldquo;The eyes of those who have not seen <em>Bhagavān</em> who is a mountain of Gold and who rides on a bird and who, long ago, placed the mountain girdled with the serpent in the sea and churned it for the sake of nectar &ndash; their eyes are not eyes at all&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Likewise also these Sanskrit _śloka_s :&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not long for the wealth of <em>Brahma</em> or for that of Rudra. I long to be either a kadamba tree or a kunda tree on the backs of the Yamuna (which Śrīkṛṣṇa purified with His holy feet).&rdquo; &ldquo;Take me as Thy servant. There is nothing improper in this. I will attain thereby the satisfaction of serving Thee for whom alone I exist. Thou wilt also obtain the satisfaction of having protected one who has sought Thee as his refuge.&rdquo; &quot; Whether you are awake or asleep, I will render all the service that is required.&rdquo; &ldquo;Live as you may for a hundred years, I will be under you. Order me yourself to do whatever you want in places which you consider beautiful”. “I long only for being the servant of <em>Bhagavān</em> in all my births.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will spend my days thus, rendering the appointed service in each of the five parts of the day and in worshipping <em>Bhagavān</em> with good chandana. flowers and the like - such as I can obtain with my own effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are the ways of service after <em>prapatti</em> which are in keeping with one&rsquo;s essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) in spending the time.</p>
<p>THE <em>PRAPANNA</em> SHOULD SEEK SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE:</p>
<p>Further the <em>prapanna</em> should not remain complacently ignorant of what should be known to one in that state, in the presumption that he has already done what should be done. In the state of perfect enjoyment of the Lord, knowledge and love are (both ) essential. Therefore in accordance with the <em>śloka</em> , &ldquo;One *should never beg of the Lord anything but knowledge and love for His holy feet. The man who begs (for other things ) will surely perish &ldquo;, there is nothing improper in desiring knowledge and love of the Lord. It has been said :- &ldquo;The Lord of the yellow raiment has incarnated as the <em>guru</em> to teach the Veda.&rdquo; So the <em>prapanna</em> should learn from such _guru_s possessed of exclusive devotion to the Lord and having a clear knowledge of (the truth ). He should obtain clear knowledge from them by following the injunction contained in the <em>śloka</em>  - &ldquo;Bow to your <em>guru</em>, place your doubts before him and render service to him, (then) learn from him the true nature of the self. (Your) _ācārya_s will teach you the truth concerning the self.&rdquo; He should have his knowledge rendered clear and pure, for (the poet) says, &ldquo;Even a man that is dull becomes intelligent by seeking the company of the wise. Muddy water becomes clear and pure by being mixed with the lather from soapnut.&rdquo; It has been said, &ldquo;He whose knowledge of the truth (concerning <em>Bhagavān</em> ) extends up to the enjoyment of the Lord all those who fall within the range of his eyes will be purified of all their sins.&rdquo; So the <em>prapanna</em> should live in close contact with such, as are well established in this knowledge. As stated (in the Gita):- &ldquo;In a tank which is intended for all and for various purposes, one should take only as much (of the water) as is required for one&rsquo;s purposes&rdquo;, the <em>prapanna</em> should determine what he should choose, from among their ways of life and conduct, what is in accordance with his <em>varṇa</em>, his <em>āśrama</em>, his gotra, his character and the like and conduct himself in keeping with that determination and should walk warily lest he should fall into the pitfall of thinking of his own superiority and the inferiority of others, which might arise from his conceit while observing this code of conduct.</p>
<p>Even if, as it occurred to such as Nammalvar and Nāthamunigal, he is blessed with the special grace of the Saviour so as to enjoy the rise of such benefits as the vision (of the Lord), he should feel sure (that it is not due to any merit of his own) as said in, &ldquo;I do not* know what is good and what is bad”, and &ldquo;Even if I know what is good and what is evil, I cannot obtain what is good and avoid what is evil&rdquo; He should see to it that his being destitute of all _upāya_s (<em>Ākiñcanya</em>) which is due to his <em>svarūpa</em>, his maintenance (sthiti) and his activities (<em>pravṛtti</em>) being entirely dependent (on the Lord) does not suffer any change or loss. He should remember his utter helplessness (<em>kārpaṇya</em> ) as described in the <em>śloka</em>  “I am the abode of all transgressions, I have no means of protecting myself and I have nothing else to attain than Thee&rdquo;, and in such verses as &ldquo;I have not been observing the code of the disciplined life, nor have I keen intelligence&rdquo;, &ldquo;What*can I do? &ldquo;May my * misery be put an end to by Thee ! If thou dost not do so, there is no one else to protect me&rdquo;, &ldquo;I have no other <em>upāya</em> and no other protector,&rdquo; &ldquo;I do not know of any one whom I can hold as the Saviour of my soul!&rdquo; &ldquo;We are such &rsquo;&rsquo; ignorant women belonging to the race of cowherds as eat in forests while grazing the cows there&rdquo;, &ldquo;I have given up the rites pertaining to Brahmins of worshipping the three fires after ablutions&rsquo;&rsquo;, &ldquo;I was not born into any of the four castes wherein one is fit to follow <em>dharma</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;I am ignorant and of low birth&rdquo;, &ldquo;I have no one to seek for support&rdquo;. &ldquo;Even if Thou dost not remove from me the sufferings due to <em>karma</em>, I have no other refuge than thee,&rdquo; &ldquo;I have not  practised <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em>; I have not understood the real nature of the disembodied self (i.e) I have not performed Jñānayoga, nor have I <em>bhakti</em> towards Thy holy feet.” (In these Tamil verses and Sanskrit <em>śloka</em> s, the feeling of helplessness is well depicted and the <em>prapanna</em> should realise his owo helplessness by remembering such verses).</p>
<p>Owing to the knowledge of his own unfitness from time immemorial and the loss of the Lord&rsquo;s service which resulted from it, which may cause excessive disgust, the <em>prapanna</em> should not fall into despair which makes one lament in the words of the Alvar saying, “The nature of the man in <em>samsāra</em> is such that he identifies himself with the perishing body and calls it &ldquo;I&rdquo;; from it arises alao evil conduct and from it arises again the body that is foul&rdquo;. (Without falling into despair ), he should hearten himself with the succeeding words there :- &ldquo;O&rdquo; Lord of the immortals, Thou wast born into all castes and even from the wombs of animals in Thy eagerness to protect the _Jīva_s!&rdquo; He should comfort himself with the words of the Saviour who appears in front to save him - the words which are wholesome and sweet like mother&rsquo;s milk (such as “ For the protection of the good and the destruction of the wicked and so also for the establishment of <em>dharma</em>, I am born again and again in every yuga.&rdquo; He should bathe, as it were, in the words (of <em>Bhagavān</em>) which reveal the secret of the avatārs and take courage (from passages like the following) :- &ldquo;Whatever a man may have been in the past, it he lives a righteous life in his old age, it will do him good; his evil deeds in the past will do him no harm&rdquo; and &ldquo;A man may have been wicked in his past life; he may have fed on anything (however impure ); he may have been ungrateful; he may have been a sceptic; in spite of all that, if he earnestly seeks the protection of the Lord, who is the cause of the world, know that that man is faultless owing to the Lord&rsquo;s greatness &ldquo;, &quot; In one half of an instant, a <em>jīva</em> commits a sin which cannot be expiated even in the course of ten thousand kalpas of <em>Brahma</em>. But Thou pardonest him if only he gives up the thought of sinning (again), even though he has transgressed. How wonderful this is !&rdquo; &ldquo;The past is past, what can we do concerning it? The wise man should think of erecting the dam even when the water is flowing,&rdquo; &quot; It is good to die after performing <em>prapatti</em> to the Lord at least in the dying moments&rdquo;</p>
<p>In accordance with this principle, the <em>prapanna</em> should not lament for what is past and without running away at the thought of his past unfitness, he should make himself fit for the future by reflecting on the present fitness which has resulted from the infinite greatness of the Saviour which brooks no questioning, like those who construct a dam for the water that will come up in the future; he should not stray from the path of performing the commands and permissions of the Lord which are in keeping with his present state as a <em>prapanna</em>. As described (by the Alvar), the senses which have become tired with expectations of enjoying the Lord should be rendered fit (to enjoy Him) by means of pure food and service and directed towards such (spiritual) experiences as are available and turned away from the desire for unwholesome objects, like cows that are turned away from stealthily eating the crops.</p>
<p>When people are waiting for the boat in order (to cross the stream) to go to a place of their desire, some of them may avoid playing chess or other game with stakes, as it could not be stopped whenever desired but may be engaged in playing the game without any stakes so that they might be in a position to give up the game (when the boat has come). Though they play merely for the enjoyment (and not for money), they move the pawns (on the board) in strict accordance with the rules of the game. In the same way (though the <em>prapanna</em> does not expect any profit out of it) he performs gladly the rites commanded and permitted by the Supreme Ruler, which are really services to the Lord, in accordance with the specific time and place at which they are ordained for performance. (In performing them), he should resemble not those who drink milk for relief from excess of bile, but like those who have got well easily and quickly with the help of a medicine and who drink milk with pleasure (not as a cure for disease ).</p>
<p>SERVICE TO ARCĀ:</p>
<p>While rendering this service, the <em>prapanna</em> should do such acts of service as are in keeping with the respective relationships between him and the Lord and with the Lord&rsquo;s supreme majesty and easy accessibility; he should do these acts towards the images (<em>arcā</em>) into which the Lord has incarnated for the sake of some devotees with exclusive devotion to Him; for it has been said : &ldquo;He who believes in the eternal form and supreme majesty of the Lord -him, O Pouṣkara, the Lord approaches,&rdquo; &ldquo;In the same way as the water of the ocean taken up by the clouds and let fall (as rain ) becomes fit to be enjoyed by all, <em>Bhagavān</em> whose image has been installed by devotees becomes fit to be served and enjoyed by others&rdquo;. &ldquo;The six qualities like <em>Jñāna</em> are found in transcendent measure in the _mantra_s and in the images (<em>arcā</em> ). They are described in the _mantra_s, and the qualities are found in <em>Bhagavān</em>, since He has, out of His compassion, chosen to abide in these images&rdquo;. This shows the fullness of perfection, &ldquo;He who looks upon the Lord residing in the image as <em>Puruṣottama</em> and beholds Him (again and again) from the pedestal of the foot to the crown on the head his five deadly sins (Mahāpātaka) are destroyed quickly: Is it necessary to state that minor offences, too, perish ? This shows how supremely purificatory the <em>arcā</em> is. And again it is said ;- &ldquo;If men of clouded intellects happen to see <em>Bhagavān</em> abiding in the <em>arcā</em> even by mere chance, all the evil tendencies in them, such as the following, perish :- the thought that the body is the self; the false notion arising from it that he sees the soul by perception; false conclusions arrived at by fallacious reasoning, false inferences resulting from wrong premises, false interpretations of scriptural texts and want of faith in the _Śāstra_s.&rdquo; Thus the worship of the image (<em>arcā</em> ) is a panacea for all mental diseases arising from a false understanding of cause and effect.</p>
<p>The <em>prapanna</em> should meditate on the Lord&rsquo;s placing Himself at the disposal of those who seek His protection in a manner which cannot be understood by the mind or described in words, for it has been said, &ldquo;Whoever wants to see me and in whatever form - to him I reveal myself in that very form.&rdquo; The same thing is stated also (in the Tamil verse) &ldquo;He assumes the form desired by His devotees.” He should also meditate on the alluring beauty of the Lord of which (the Alvar) says &ldquo;The eyes that have seen the Lord will refuse to see other things.&rdquo; Having done so, the <em>prapanna</em> should render service suited to the respective relationships between him and the Lord (such as master and servant, father and son) and to His supreme majesty and easy accessibility, in accordance with the following verses :-&ldquo;One should render service to the Lord like a chaste matron to her beloved husband, like a mother to her suckling, like a disciple to his <em>ācārya</em>  and like a friend to his friend. The Lord of Lakṣmī  should always be looked upon as a master, as a friend, as an ācharya, as a father and as a mother&rdquo;, &ldquo;One should serve the Lord with as much fear as one would approach a king who is youthful, and an elephant in rut. In the same way as one would entertain a welcome guest who has come to one&rsquo;s house, one should worship the Lord with devotion, remembering His easy accessibility.” “One should treat the Lord with as much affection as one would a beloved child&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Like Bharatalvan who conducted himself like a servant of a king before (ŚrīRāma&rsquo;s ) sandals and of whom it is said, &ldquo;While the sandals were ruling, Bharata placed, before them first, whatever business had to be transacted and whatever valuable tributes were brought and then accomplished whatever had to be done in the manner in which it should be done&rdquo;, — like him the <em>prapanna</em> should render service as to a king, with materials earned righteously. He should look upon this service as a wedded wife would look upon the careful custody of her sacred wedding - thread and the like. He should have the conviction that he has attained this ultimate aim of life, which begins from service to <em>Bhagavān</em> and extends up to the service to His devotees, by his relationship with his good <em>ācārya</em>  : for it has been said: &ldquo;Kshatrabandhu, the great sinner, and Puṇḍarīka the virtuous, both attained <em>mokṣa</em>  by having _ācārya_s&rdquo; So also has it been said (in Tamil) :- &ldquo;Our ācharyas are like bees which place us at the (flower-like holy feet of the Lord, who is our Master and who renders help to the eternal sūris and &ldquo;If ** Viṣṇu chittar ( Perialvar) who was born in the city of Villipattur and who was perfect in the qualities of the spirit, by some means in his power, make the Lord appear before us, we can see&rdquo; (That is to say - without the grace of _Viṣṇu_citta, the ācharya, they cannot do anything themselves). The <em>prapanna</em> should feel grateful at the thought of the expansion of knowledge which the ācāryas have wrought in him and of such things as the service (of the Lord and His devotees) which have resulted from it. He should behave towards them as towards the servants (of the palace) who light the lamps and keep them burning on the night before the coronation of the prince (as a token of their rejoicing). He should feel grateful also to the Lord at the thought of His innate compassion which is the common and primary cause of all these and which, in the state of <em>mukti</em>, removes the dreaded possibility of a break in the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> whose independent will cannot be questioned. For it has been said:&ndash; &ldquo;The Lord ** makes us climb up to Vaikuṇṭha   through the centre of the sphere of the sun whose rays dispel darkness and He removes the ladder that helped to climb, so that there may be no coming back&rdquo;, and again, &ldquo;If one goes to Vaikuṇṭha   after performing <em>prapatti</em> by uttering the words &lsquo;Namo Narana&rsquo;, He will not let one come back to the world of <em>samsāra</em>, even if one should furnish security for going back to Vaikuṇṭha  &ldquo;. (Nammalvar) says: &ldquo;The firm feet of Nārāyaṇa whose praise is unsurpassed&rdquo; (the feet being firm, those who have caught hold of them can never slip down); and again &ldquo;<em>Bhagavān</em>&rdquo; is our Father who takes away from His devotees their future births, leads them to Vaikuṇṭha, helps the manifestation of their <em>svarūpa</em> or essential nature and sees to their ever remaining under His feet even like the lines on the soles (of His feet)&rdquo;, and further, &ldquo;The Lord looks after (our) welfare by taking us to His feet and by preventing our fall therefrom&rdquo;. The <em>prapanna</em> should feel grateful to the Lord of Lakṣmī , the <em>śeṣī</em>, whose will is ever absolute and who, even after <em>mokṣa</em> , shows the same compassion as during <em>samsāra</em>. (The Alvar describes this compassion in the following words);- &ldquo;By Thy grace and the grace of Thy Spouse who lives in the lotus, I served at Thy temple of old&rdquo;</p>
<p>WHAT THE <em>PRAPANNA</em> SHOULD DO WITH HIS MIND,</p>
<p>HIS SPEECH AND HIS BODY:</p>
<p>About this code of conduct (of the <em>prapanna</em>) we will now state what is considered as the essence in regard to what should be avoided by the three senses viz the mind, the speech and the body and also in regard to what should be observed or followed by them: &ldquo;Between poison (Visha) and the objects of sense (Vishaya) there is a great gulf of difference, for poison kills only the man who eats it, whereas objects of sense kill even at their mere thought.&rdquo; It has been said also, &ldquo;Is it fair on Thy part to delude my soul by showing before sinful me the various pleasures by which the senses allure me to my suffering ?&rdquo; Therefore in order that the desire for the ultimate object of life may not languish, the most important among those that should be forgotten is the enjoyment of sense pleasures. In order that one may not become ungrateful, the chief thing that should be thought of is the assistance given to us by the <em>ācārya</em>  from the time his glance first fell on us. In order that we may not lose the sense of helplessness, the chief thing that should be avoided in speech is the expression of our excellence. In order that one may not forget one&rsquo;s conviction in the <em>upāya</em>, the chief among the things that should be uttered is <em>Dvaya</em>; (the _Bhāṣya_kāra says) “one should ever utter the <em>Dvaya</em> with an understanding of its meaning &ldquo;. In order that <em>Bhagavān</em> who is entitled to receive our service with pleasure may not become displeased at heart, the most important among those that should be avoided by all the three senses is offence to those that know <em>Brahman</em>; as Andal says, “ We will never do what ought not to be done&rdquo;. In order that the sea of our supreme aim in life may not dry up or become shallow, the most important among those things that should be done is service to the <em>ācārya</em>  and other devotees of <em>Bhagavān</em> as ordained in the śāstras and forming the outer limit of the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>This code of conduct which should be followed after <em>prapatti</em> and which is an end in itself should be considered in those parts of the three mysteries (_mantra_s ) which indicate the benefit or fruit that results.</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>विण्णवर् वेण्डि विलक्किण्ड्रि मेवुमडिमैयॆल्लाम्</p>
<p>मण्णुलगत्तिन् मगिऴ्न्दडैगिण्ड्रनर् वण्डुवरैक्</p>

<p>पण्णमरुन्दमिऴ्वेदमऱिन्द पगवर्गळे. ( 22)</p>
<p>Our holy men who know the songs of the Tamil Veda with their meaning and who have discharged all their debts (to the gods, the pitṛs etc.) by the performance of <em>prapatti</em> accepted by Śrīkṛṣṇa of the beautiful Dwaraka, enjoy, with delight, even in this world, that service which the muktas and the suris perform without intermission and with eagerness in the world yonder.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>

<p>Like a beloved wife who, in a big jewelled mirror, well-polished, sees her loving husband by the side of her own image - her loving husband who has come behind her and stands beside her, and is at once transported into the ecstasy of love and enjoys his presence with the scattering of flowers that spread their fragrance all round - (like that beloved wife ) good men, whose wealth consists in their <em>prapatti</em>, see the Supreme lord in the great <em>mantra</em> (Tiru <em>mantra</em>) which has frequently been meditated upon and enjoy Him with loving service similar to fragrant flowers.</p>

<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>स्वतन्त्रस्वामित्वात् स्वबहुमतिपात्रेषु नियतं</p>
<p>श्रियः कान्तो देवस्स खलु विनियुङ्क्ते चिदचितौ ।</p>

<p>ततो नः कैङ्कर्यं तदभिमतपर्यन्तमभवत् ॥ ३६ ॥</p>
<p>In the world of everyday life (a king sometimes uses his dependents and ornaments to serve the purposes of those who are dear to him like his sons, wives etc.) and in the Vedas, it is declared that all the gods make their offerings to the devotee. Even so, the Lord of Lakṣmī  uses sentient beings and non-sentient things to serve for ever the purposes of those who have won His regard, because He is independent and is their Master. So, for us whose minds have been disciplined by the teaching of such as the prince of sannayasins (viz. Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em>), the service of the Lord extends as far as the service of those who are dear to Him (Bhāgavatas).</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>REASONS FOR RENDERING SERVICE</p>
<p>TO BHĀGAVATĀS :</p>
<p>If it is asked here how it can be stated that the service of <em>Bhagavān</em> extends up to the service of His devotees (the Bhāgavatas), the answer is as follows:- It has been said in the Vedartha Sangraha: &ldquo;He is the <em>śeṣa</em> whose <em>svarūpa</em> or essential nature is such as is chosen on account of the desire to promote the glory of another and that another is the <em>śeṣī</em>.&rdquo; So in regard to the Supreme Ruler of all, the <em>Jīva</em>   who is the <em>śeṣa</em> is bound to promote His glory. That glory will depend on the nature of the <em>śeṣa</em>, whether it be sentient or non-sentient. It may be asked, &ldquo;What is the glory that the <em>jīva</em> is capable of conferring on the Supreme Being? With his body and the like, he can confer only such glory as non-sentient things do. So this service is common to him and <em>acit</em>. The special glory that he can be the cause of promoting must be by means of his intelligence or chaitanya.<sup id="fnref:285"><a href="#fn:285" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">285</a></sup> When the <em>jīva</em> acts against the spirit of the _śāstra_s, <em>Iśvara</em>, who is the Ruler and the Dispenser of punishment, enjoys only the delight or delectation of <em>līlā</em> and thus attains atisaya glory. It has been said: &quot; <em>Bhagavān</em>, &lsquo;who has all beings as His body, rejoices when a <em>jīva</em> does what is good and does not rejoice when the action is evil.&rdquo; When a man acts in accordance with the stāstras, he gives thereby delight to the Lord and thus does not let his generosity and other qualities run to waste, but promotes the glory of the Lord so that He extols him as in the words :-&ldquo;All these are, indeed, generous&rdquo;. In the same way as the muktas (released souls) and the _nitya_s (the sūris ) promote the glory of the Lord by direct perception of the Lord&rsquo;s will and by acting in such a way as to give Him bhoga or enjoyment, the prapannas, too, can give rise to a special kind of bhoga or enjoyment to the Lord and thus promote His glory as stated in the following <em>śloka</em> :-&ldquo;When shall I*always be Thy servant, look upon Thee as my Master and in this way give Thee delight?&rdquo;. The <em>prapanna</em> learns the Lord&rsquo;s will from the _śāstra_s (though not directly ) and renders service to the Lord.</p>
<p>In the sentences that follow, the author points out the different ways in which different kinds of people (including those who violate his commands ) promote His glory as His _śeṣa_s.</p>
<p>THE LORD IS PLEASED AT THE SERVICE RENDERED</p>
<p>TO HIS DEVOTEES :</p>
<p>When a man gives rise to <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s <em>līlā</em> rasa by actions opposed to the _śāstra_s, it will end in his ruin. If, in the state of bondage, he acts according to the Lord&rsquo;s will as revealed in the _śāstra_s and, in the state of <em>mokṣa</em> , by direct perception of the Lord&rsquo;s will, he will not only promote the Lord&rsquo;s <em>līlā</em> rasa and bhoga but incidentally attain his own desired objects. When the <em>Jīva</em>   acts on any occasion consciously, since his desired fruit, incidental though it be, has to come from the will of the lord, the latter has to be ascertained from the s&rsquo;astras which disclose that the service rendered to His devotees is most delightful to him.</p>
<p>The following authoritative texts may be studied in this connection: &ldquo;Of all forms of homage, the homage paid to Viṣṇu  is the best, but superior even to this, is the excellent homage or adoration offered to Viṣṇu&rsquo;s devotees&rdquo;, &ldquo;I have great affection to those who are devoted to my devotees. Therefore should one render devout service to them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Devotion to me is of eight forms: (1) love to my devotees without any thought of their faults; (2) rejoicing at the adoration offered to me by another; (3) delight in listening to stories concerning me; (4) a change in the voice, in the eyes and in the body, while listening to such stories; (5) trying to offer adoration to me; (6) freedom from hypocrisy in one&rsquo;s relations with me; (7) meditation of me at all times; (8) and not considering me as one from whom worldly benefits can be bad - if <em>bhakti</em> (which is of these eight forms) is found in a mleccha, he should be respected as the best of Brahmins endowed with <em>jñāna</em> and <em>bhakti</em>; he is a real sannyāsi, he is a wise man and he may be taught (the scriptures) and from him one may learn the truth. He is fit to be adored even like myself.&rdquo;, &ldquo;They are my bhaktas or devotees who do not show devotion to any other deity, who love those that are devoted to me and that have sought me as their <em>upāya</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;I offer adoration also to those who offer adoration to that yajna varāha, who is of boundless splendour&rdquo;, &ldquo;By *seeking the protection of those who seek the Lord as their refuge and by rendering service to him who is devoted to the devotee, that is (in turn) devoted to the devotee of the Lord - by doing so, men are released from all their sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we study these passages, (it becomes clear) that, of all forms of service which a <em>śeṣa</em> of the Lord may render, that rendered to the Bhāgavatas is the most important and is the most pleasing to the Lord, in the same way as the fondling of the prince is most pleasing to the king.</p>
<p>In this matter, if we examine the path of the _pramāṇa_s, <em>Iśvara</em>, who has the Bhāgavata as His body, is the object of worship as is declared in the <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;Those who worship the pitṛs, the gods, the Brahmins and Agni &ndash; they worship only the Lord who is the inner self of all creatures&rdquo;. If, on the other hand, we consider the thought of the Prakari who says &ldquo;He is dear to me also&rdquo; and who is ever at the disposal of the man that is exclusively devoted to Him on account of His love for him, as has been said in the <em>śloka</em>  : &ldquo;Among them the jnānī is my very self&rdquo; the Lord would be pleased at the service rendered to the Bhāgavata, as if it were service rendered (directly) to His own inner self and not as that done to His body.</p>
<p>In addition to its causing pleasure to the <em>śeṣī</em>, the relationship of the <em>jīva</em> to <em>Iśvara</em> as His <em>śeṣa</em> is also mediately through the Bhāgavata. Therefore his service to the Lord may also be mediate through the Bhāgavata. This may be explained as follows:</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>नित्यं श्रिया समेतस्य भक्तैरात्मवतस्सदा ।</p>
<p>सह सद्वारकञ्च स्याच्छेषित्वं परमात्मनः ॥ ३६-अ  ॥</p>
<p>To the Supreme Being who is always with Lakṣmī  and who looks upon His devotees as His very self, the attribute of being a seshī may be both by being a seshi along with Lakṣmī  and by being a <em>śeṣī</em>  mediately through the devotees&rdquo;. (That is, those who look upon themselves as _śeṣa_s to His devotees are, mediately through these devotees, _śeṣa_s to the Lord Himself). A king who is independent and who takes a pleasure in acting as he pleases places the ornaments and garlands worn by himself round the necks of his servants and of his elephants and horses. (Tiruppapalvar says):&ndash; &ldquo;The Lord who is spotless and who has made me the servant of His servants&rdquo;. (So does Nārada  say): &ldquo;I, Nārada , have come here with an eager longing to see you. To men like me, O Brahmin, those who are bhaktas of the Lord are masters&rdquo; and again (Tirum_aṅga_i Alvar says ); - &ldquo;I will not remain in the company of those who think there is any other deity deserving of adoration than Thee; also what I have accepted with delight is the duty of serving Thy devotees&rdquo;. According to these passages, since the <em>jīva</em> is absolutely subject to the will of the Lord and since the service of the <em>śeṣa</em> is due also to those who are favourites of the Lord, our being a <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord extends even to the Bhāgavatas and should last as long as the self lasts. Our being _śeṣa_s to Bhāgavatas arises from their being devotees to the Lord and pertains to our essential nature. It arises also from their qualities and knowledge, which cause a desire in us to serve them. (As Lakṣmaṇa says) &ldquo;I am his younger brother (by birth); I have become his servant by his qualities&rdquo;. (That this relationship of being a <em>śeṣa</em> is due both to our essential nature and to (our admiration for) their wisdom and character) is also indicated (respectively in the two phrases(1) &ldquo;bhaktas of the lord and to &ldquo;men like me&rdquo; (in the speech of Nārada  quoted above). Perialvar, the (great) commentator of Kalpa <em>sūtra_s stated (in this connection):- &ldquo;These who are the servants of Bhāgavatas and who utter the names of <em>Bhagavān</em> are entitled even to sell us&rdquo;. This is the purport of the middle world in Tiru_mantra</em>, namely, <em>namo</em>: na mama (not for me). If we reflect on this purport, our being <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord is both mediate (through the Bhāgavatas) and immediate (direct to Him). Accordingly, the service that should be rendered by the <em>śeṣa</em> is also (both ) mediate and direct. Therefore it is the farthest limit of the service of the <em>prapanna</em> to perform, as much as it lies in his power, service to the Bhāgavata, since it is part of the duty of one who is <em>śeṣa</em> to <em>Bhagavān</em>. So this outermost region of service to Bhāgavatas should be kept properly cultivated so that it may not become fallow land full of weeds.</p>
<p>. As stated in the following ślokas in Poushkara samhita, &ldquo;It is not wrong for a wedded wife to honour her husband and to honour his servants, whether in his presence or in his absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>and &ldquo;Among the Lord&rsquo;s retinue are two classes: those that are dear to him and worthy of His trust and those who are not. To the former class belong the _nitya_s, the muktas and the Bhagavatās.</p>
<p>To the latter class belong <em>Brahma</em> and the other gods who are subject to the sway of past <em>karma</em>. The seeker after <em>mukti</em> should not adore the latter;&rdquo; the devotee who is exclusively attached to the Lord and whose <em>dharma</em> resembles that of a chaste wife would therefore do well to act according to the will of his Lord. Since the relationship of <em>śeṣa</em> to Bhāgavatas arises from no other cause than the knowledge of our being <em>śeṣa</em> only to the Lord and to no other, this service to Bhāgavatas is not improper, (because it does not arise from other causes like the desire for wealth or power ).</p>
<p>BHAGAVATĀS ARE _ŚEṢA_S TO ONE ANOTHER:</p>
<p>If it is asked whether this relationship of being <em>śeṣa</em> to Bhagavatās is due to one&rsquo;s nature or whether it is adventitious (due to upādhi), the answer is, that it is both natural and adventitious. In as much as it lasts as long as the self lasts and will continue also in the state of <em>mokṣa</em>, it may be called natural.</p>
<p>Does not Koorattalvan say) :-&ldquo;When shall I join the eternal suris who are always eager to be _śeṣa_s to one another &quot; (This relationship of a <em>śeṣa</em> will continue even after release from bondage). It may be said to be adventitious also (due to upādhi or conditions), as it arises from a knowledge of one&rsquo;s relationship to <em>Bhagavān</em>.</p>
<p>If so, it may be asked, &ldquo;If both are Bhāgavatas, would it not be inconsistent that they should be both <em>śeṣa</em> and s&rsquo;eshī to each other?&rdquo; The answer is as follows:- There is nothing inconsistent in this, as it is possible for the same person to render help to another and also to receive help from him. (In the performance of a sacrifice), the sacrificer who performs it for the sake of some gain or benefit (phala) is the <em>śeṣī</em> but when he is considered as the doer of the sacrifice, he is <em>śeṣa</em> in relation to the sacrifice.</p>
<p>So also when each of the two Bhāgavatas is bent on promoting the glory (atisaya) of the other, without either of them expecting that glory, they become _śeṣa_s by their being the cause of the promotion of the glory of the other; they are also <em>śeṣī</em> s inasmuch as they are the recipients of the glory (atisaya), though they themselves may not desire it. Since they have been directed by <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s will to promote each other&rsquo;s glory, the relationship of being <em>śeṣa</em> to Bhāgavatas is, in the case of both, based on _śāstra_ic authority.</p>
<p>The relationship of being a servant (dása) to <em>Bhagavān</em> and Bhāgavatas owing to an appreciation of their qualities or character adds to one&rsquo;s delight or enjoyment and promotes one&rsquo;s own exaltation. In this, <em>Iśvara</em>, by His omnipotence and His will which accompanies it, enables all Bhāgavatas to become <em>śeṣī</em> s. Taking their desire also along with His own will, <em>Iśvara</em> makes them _śeṣa_s to Bhāgavatas. Since both the Bhāgavatas stand in the relation of <em>śeṣī</em> s to each other as having been fit to be directed by the Master to do His will, both of them attain their true and essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>). They attain the ultimate limit of their <em>puruṣārtha</em> or goal of life, since they attain the relationship of being _śeṣa_s, which they are eager to have and also the privilege of rendering service to the Bhāgavata which follows from it. Since <em>Iśvara</em> delights in having directed them to become _śeṣa_s and s&rsquo;eshīs to each other, <em>Iśvara</em> attains the state of being an <em>Iśvara</em> or ruler and of being an enjoyer. Since they realise clearly that this relationship of being _śeṣa_s and _śeṣī_s to each other contributes to the enjoyment (bhoga) of <em>Iśvara</em>, they attain the faultless and ultimate limit of <em>puruṣārtha</em> By those who have done what should be done (prapannas), who understand this subtle truth and are convinced of it, the grace of devotees who are exclusively and supremely attached to the Lord will be desired as an end in itself - devotees who are free from the following stains : the desire for transgressing the Lord&rsquo;s commands, excess of doubt, connection with other deities, enjoyment depending on one&rsquo;s own effort and enjoyment for one&rsquo;s own self.</p>

<p>Having laid, on Mukunda, the responsibility for his protection and become free from sin like those released from <em>samsāra</em>, the <em>prapanna</em> walks along the path laid down in the _śāstra_s until his release from bondage, since (unlike the <em>mukta</em>) he cannot read the mind of the lord directly and since the path has been ordained for us by the command of the Omnipotent Lord and since, by straying from that path, he will immediately bring, on himself and on others, ills of various kinds.</p>
<p>THE <em>PRAPANNA</em> SHOULD HAVE THE ŚĀSTRA</p>
<p>FOR HIS GUIDE:</p>
<p>(It has been stated so far that) owing to his relationship as a <em>śeṣa</em>, the <em>prapanna</em> has to render service to <em>Bhagavān</em> and to Bhāgavatas. Now it may be asked whether this service arises from his desire and in accordance with the _śāstra_s or from his mere desire without any reference at all to the _śāstra_s. The answer is as follows; To the man who is in this world full of the darkness of ignorance, the <em>śāstra</em> is required as a lamp (to show the path that he should take). So the service that he is to render should be according to the śāstra; in matters where the śāstra gives an option or alternatives, he may follow his own discretion. &ldquo;How is this&rdquo;, it may be asked. When Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em> was about to leave this world, he observed his foremost disciples grieving exceedingly, He called them to his side and commanded them on pain of offence to Alavandar not to think of taking their own lives owing to their sorrow at his death. &ldquo;They will (if they do so) have no connection with me”, he said. On hearing this, they were filled with sorrow and begged that they might be told what they should do thereafter. This was Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a man has become a <em>prapanna</em>, the salvation of his soul or self is the responsibility of <em>Bhagavān</em>, and he himself has nothing to do with it. If he thinks that he has anything to do with it, his surrender of responsibility (<em>prapatti</em> or ātma samarpaṇam) must have been false or insincere. The maintenance of the body depends upon his past <em>karma</em>, and he should not feel anxious about it. If he feels anxious about it, he is a sceptic or nāstika. Therefore neither in regard to his spiritual welfare nor in regard to his bodily welfare, has he anything more to do. If so, it may be asked whether the man might go about doing whatever he liked with his three kinds of organs, mind, speech and body. The answer is that doing so is not in keeping with his <em>svarūpa</em> or essential nature. It is true that he has nothing (more) to do with regard to the <em>upāya</em> or means, but he should direct these viz., mind, speech and body to the rendering of service which is the goal of his existence. There are five kinds of service which he can render for the rest of his life: (1) to study the <em>Bhāṣya</em> and to spread the knowledge obtained therefrom; (2) if the man is not qualified for it, to study the writings of the Alvars and spread their knowledge; (3) if the man is not competent to do it (i.e.) No. (2), to serve in holy temples sanctified (by the Alvars), by cooking food, by making chandanam, by lighting lamps and by weaving garlands (for use in the temples ); (4) if not competent to do (3), to meditate on the meaning of <em>Dvaya</em>; (5) if not competent to do (4), to seek the good will of some Śrī Vaiṣṇava who is well disposed to him and would look upon him as his follower and spend his life with him,</p>
<p>PITFALLS IN THE PATH OF THE <em>PRAPANNA</em>:</p>
<p>The man who is qualified to live in this way has to avoid pitfalls in front of him by behaving carefully in three matters. &ldquo;They concern - (1) those who are suitable or favourable (anukula) (2) those who are unsuitable or unfavourable (pratikūla) and (3) those who are neither the one nor the other. The suitable are Śrī Vaiṣṇavas, the unsuitable are those that are the enemies of <em>Bhagavān</em>; those who are neither the one nor the other are those in <em>samsāra</em>. The <em>prapanna</em> will rejoice at the sight of the suitable (anukula) as at chandana, flowers and the like and as at moonlight and the southern breeze and (other) beloved objects. At the sight of the unsuitable (pratiküla), he will be full of dread as at the sight of the serpent and the fire. At the sight of those who are neither of these two, he will behave as at the sight of wood or stone and treat them (with indifference), as if they were straw. If they are agreeable, he should impart the knowledge of truth to them ; otherwise, he should pity their sad fate. It is the inclination for wealth and sensual pleasure that stands in the way of such behaviour. If, owing to the desire for wealth and sense pleasures, a man should treat a Śrī Vaiṣṇava with disregard or contempt, he would provoke the wrath of <em>Bhagavān</em> in the same way as a man who treats the prince with disrespect in the presence of the king would provoke the king&rsquo;s anger. If, owing to the desire for wealth and sense pleasures, a man should remain subservient to those who are unsuitable, he would provoke disgust in the mind of <em>Bhagavān</em> in the same way as a queen who, while her lord is an emperor, begs alms of the mean and unworthy would provoke disgust in the king&rsquo;s mind. If a man should treat with respect those who are neither the one nor the other, the Lord would have no regard for him, as his knowledge serves no useful purpose like that of one who cannot distinguish between a gem and a piece of stone&rdquo;,</p>
<p>ŚRĪ <em>RĀMĀNUJA</em>&lsquo;S ADVICE EXPLAINED:</p>
<p>Io connection with this code of conduct prescribed by Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em> for the <em>prapanna</em>, we have to remember that the pursuit of wealth and sense pleasures which are against <em>dharma</em> have already been prohibited altogether (for all including non prapannas) as in the following <em>śloka</em> s:- &ldquo;One should not, in any circumstances and even in critical times, accept any gifts, not even a cowrie, from an unchaste woman, a eunuch, an outcast (patita) or an enemy.&rdquo; &ldquo;They are dear to me. they who are born blind to the imperfections of others, who are eunuchs in regard to the wives of other men and who are dumb in the matter of censuring others.&rdquo; So the injunction contained in the _Bhāṣya_kāra&rsquo;s words (really) means that even in regard to the acquisition of wealth and sense-pleasures which are not opposed to <em>dharma</em>, the <em>prapanna</em> should not deviate from his proper state in regard to these three classes of persons, the suitable, the unsuitable and those who are neither of these two. That those who are suitable should not be treated with disregard is declared in Śāṇḍilya <em>smṛti</em> (4-86). “A householder does not like one who treats his son with disregard; so also <em>Bhagavān</em> does not like those who do not treat his bhaktas with due respect.&rdquo; That those who are unsuitable should not be associated with, is declared in the Mahābhārata   : “Those who hate Keśava, the Supreme Being, and cannot, meditate on Him - to them and to those who associate with them with respect, there will be no benefit at all from bathing in the holy waters&rdquo;. So also it is said: &ldquo;One should not associate with fools, with those who are addicted to sin, with those who are cruel by nature, and with those who criticise adversely the _śāstra_s of <em>Bhagavān</em> (<em>Pāñcarātra</em>). Association with them will put an end to <em>bhakti</em>&rdquo;. That those who are neither the one nor the other should be treated like straw is well known from ślokas like the following:- &ldquo;O men of the world, from this day onwards, you are what you are and we are what we are. You are in quest of wealth and sense pleasures; we are in quest of Nārāyaṇa.  (So) there cannot be any companionship between you and us. We are the servants of the Lord; you are the slaves of the senses&rdquo;. The words that the <em>prapanna</em> should walk warily (lest he should fall into pitfalls) indicate that the (five) services ordained as essential by the _Bhāṣya_kāra (in his words quoted above) stand in the same category as services like Sandhyāvandana which can be learnt only from the _śāstra_s and that, for that reason, these five, too, should be done in accordance with the injunctions prescribed in the _śāstra_s, in order that they may become real and proper services. It may be asked: (&ldquo;How can his (Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s) words be interpreted to include also those rites and duties that are prescribed in the _śāstra_s and that these five services which he has specifically mentioned should also be done according to the _śāstra_s?&rdquo;) The answer is that it is clear from the _Bhāṣya_kara&rsquo;s words &ldquo;If he should go about doing as he likes, it would be against his <em>svarūpa</em> or essential nature.&rdquo; As Alavandar puts it, &ldquo;Whatever agrees not with the _śāstra_s is Āsuric in nature; those sections that are opposed to the _śāstra_s are inconsistent with his Nature which is godly&rdquo;. Further it has been said by the Lord who is entitled to our service - &ldquo;The <em>śruti</em> and the _smṛti_s are indeed my commands. He who transgresses them violates my commands. He does injury to me. Though he may be devoted to me he should not be called a Vaiṣṇava&rdquo;. Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s meaning is that, since the Master has also made this declaration, the <em>prapanna</em> should serve in accordance with the _śāstra_s as long as he lives in the body. In his Gītārtha Sangraha Alavandar says : - &ldquo;From the karmas pertaining to one&rsquo;s <em>varṇa</em> and <em>āśrama</em> to <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>, one should perform everything, directed by love alone (of the Lord). One should give up the notion that these are _upāya_s or means (for attaining one&rsquo;s ends). One should place the <em>upāya</em> without fear on God; (i.e) one should realise that <em>Bhagavān</em> is alone the <em>upāya</em>)&rdquo;. It is obvious that &lsquo;by love alone&rsquo; excludes the notion that it is an <em>upāya</em> owing to the word &lsquo;alone&rsquo; and this idea is elaborated in &ldquo;having given up the notion that these are _upāya_s or means&rdquo;. It is true that the love (of the Lord) is indicated as having a wonderful power of inspiring one to service prescribed in the <em>śāstra</em>. But in the words &ldquo;from the karmas pertaining to one&rsquo;s <em>varṇa</em> and <em>āśrama</em>&rdquo;, it is shown that the nature of these karmas has to be ascertained only from the _śāstra_s.</p>
<p>This ordinance imposed by the _śāstra_s is well known from the following ślokas in the chapter on <em>prapatti</em> : &quot; In order that there may be no violation of <em>dharma</em>, for the protection of the family, for keeping ignorant men in the right path by setting them an example, for the preservation of the moral law as defined in the _śāstra_s, for my (Lakṣmī &rsquo;s ) satisfaction and for the satisfaction of the Lord armed with Sarnga who is the God of all gods, the <em>prapanna</em> who is wise should aot even think of transgressing the ordinances of the Veda&rdquo;. The evil that would result from the transgression is described immediately afterwards as follows : “Even a king&rsquo;s favourite, who, because it serves no purpose of his own, destroys the bund of a river dug by the king&rsquo;s orders, which is of great use to the world, is beautiful in itself and causes abundance of crops, - even he will be impaled for having done so ; So also though he may be dear, the man who violates the ordinances of the Vedas is no favourite of mine inasmuch as he violates my commands.” If, having offended the Lord, the <em>prapanna</em> does not seek pardon, it will produce, before he attains <em>mukti</em>, some evil or other in accordance with his specific qualification.</p>
<p>That apart, there is no greater hell (for the <em>prapanna</em>) than the displeasure caused to <em>Bhagavān</em>. This displeasure of <em>Bhagavān</em> will disappear if he obtains pardon. (As the Gita says) <em>Iśvara</em>, by His very nature, is full of love to all. So till His displeasure disappears, it will give the <em>prapanna</em> excruciating pain. If the man has no such pain, his devotion to the Master and his desire for rendering service after <em>mokṣa</em>  have to be doubted.</p>
<p>Since this violation of the Lord&rsquo;s command is opposed to the Lord&rsquo;s pleasure which is our final goal as stated in the <em>śloka</em>  : &ldquo;When shall I, Thy servant, look upon Thee alone as my Master and give Thee delight by rendering service ?&rdquo; the observance of the ordinances of the _śāstra_s has to be understood in those places in the three mysteries (_mantra_s) where the removal of obstacles is referred to. In the case of those who have not completed their adoption of <em>prapatti</em> the <em>upāya</em>, the observance of these ordinances will remove the hindrances or obstacles to the completion of <em>prapatti</em> and win for them the grace of the Lord. In the case of those whose adoption of the <em>upāya</em> is complete, it will win the favour of the Lord by removing the causes that might bring about His displeasure (in future).</p>

<p>The paths indicated in the _śāstra_s deal with acts or rites of two kinds: obligatory and permissive. The former have to be done for avoiding the Lord&rsquo;s punishment and the latter for obtaining the respective benefits.</p>
<p>Even when a permissible act is performed, if there is violation of the prescribed method, it becomes an offence or violation of the command. Therefore transgression of the rule prescribed in the s&rsquo;astra is nowhere countenanced.</p>
<p>When the same rite is prescribed both for avoiding a transgression and for obtaining a benefit - in that rite, there is a mingling  of competency (<em>adhikāra</em>) according to scholars. When the same <em>karma</em> or rite is prescribed as <em>nitya</em> (obligatory) and also kamya (for the sake of a benefit), the act or rite performed for the specific benefit will serve (also) as the performance of the <em>nitya</em> (by that single performance).</p>
<p>In rites (karmas or services) prescribed for the attainment of certain benefits, the benefit will not be obtained, when the service is not performed, but there is no transgression. Such is the opinion of competent scholars.</p>

To us who live in the dark night (of <em>samsāra</em>), there is no other light than that of this moon (viz. the _śāstra_s) to dispel the darkness that grows denser and denser at every step.</p>

<p>FOR OFFENCES. page235</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em> :</p>
<p>स्वच्छस्वादुसदावदात सुभगां दैवादयं देहभृन्-</p>
<p>मालिन्यप्रशमाय माधवदयामन्दाकिनीं विन्दति ।</p>
<p>यद्यप्येवमसावसारविषयस्त्रोतःप्रसूतैः पुनः</p>
<p>पङ्कैरेव कळङ्कयन्निजतनुं प्राज्ञैर्न संश्लिष्यते ॥ ४० ॥</p>
<p>This embodied being (the <em>Jīva</em>  ) obtains the grace of Madhava by the result of past <em>karma</em> (luck), for the removal of his sins &ndash; the grace of Madhava which, by its purity, delightfulness, holiness and efficacy is like the (holy) Mandakini whose waters are clear, sweet, always pure (white) and efficacious. (That is, he becomes a <em>prapanna</em> ). If, in spite of this, he still makes his body unclean by wallowing in the mire of the stream of wretched sense pleasures, his company is avoided by the wise (but this would not stand in the way of his attainment of <em>mokṣa</em> after death).</p>
<p>THE <em>PRAPANNA</em> IS NOT LIKELY TO OFFEND;</p>
<p>IF HE OFFENDS, HE SHOULD PERFORM</p>
<p>PRĀYASCHITTA.</p>
<p>Since the <em>prapanna</em> has, by nature, the sole character of a <em>śeṣa</em> to <em>Bhagavān</em> and since he delights only in rendering service to Him in accordance with the ordinances of the śāstras, it is not at all likely that, in other situations than those that are dangerous, he will offend against the Lord, as it would be opposed to his adopted state of being the exclusive servant of the Lord. If as a result of past <em>karma</em> which has begun to operate (prārabdha) and under adverse conditions of place, time and circumstance, slight offences (against the Lord) take place through inattention in the waking state or (without his knowledge) in dreamless sleep (<em>suṣupti</em>) and other such states, these offences will disappear without causing any stain. If, at the time of <em>prapatti</em>, he did not beg, with dread of them, for the removal of such sins as lead to further sins, since he is still in close association with <em>prakṛti</em> like one who lives under the same roof with a serpent, it is just possible , owing to his deficiency in spiritual qualities, certain lapses</p>
<p>which are inconsistent with his state as a <em>prapanna</em> might, as in the case of weak-hearted Rishis, even occur with his knowledge. If sach lapses do occur, the Lord of Lakṣmī , who, by His very nature, is his well-wisher, stands ever ready to save him. Therefore these lapses in his actions will only be momentary like lightning; he will quickly reflect on these lapses from his state as a <em>prapanna</em>, feel ashamed at them, repent of them, and perform the proper atonement (<em>prāyaścitta</em>) that is suited to his competence. The following ślokas explain the point-&ldquo;If there is offence, the atonement that is to be done is only the performance of <em>prapatti</em> again. If, after performing <em>prapatti</em> for the sake of <em>mokṣa</em> , a man should perform <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em> and the like with the thought that these are _upāya_s (to <em>mokṣa</em>), it would also constitute an offence. In order that this offence might disappear, <em>prapatti</em> alone should be performed again&rdquo;. &ldquo;Whether a man commits an offence knowing that it is an offence or does it without knowing it to be one, the only atonement (<em>prāyaścitta</em>) that has to be performed is to beg in these words :-&ldquo;Pardon the offence&rdquo;. So also Sītā says: “It is well known that ŚrīRāma knows what <em>Dharma</em> is and is fond of those who seek refuge under him. Seek his friendship if you desire to live. Propitiate ŚrīRāma who loves those that surrender themselves to him and, with a pure heart, see that I am returned to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE <em>PRAPANNA</em> WILL NEVER GO TO THE WORLD</p>
<p>OF YAMA EVEN IF HE OFFENDS:</p>
<p>When, owing to hard-heartedness due to past <em>karma</em> operating now (prārabdha), the <em>prapanna</em> does not obtain pardon by atonement, he will not go to the world of Yama (but receive punishment in this very life). For it has been said :- &ldquo;Seeing his attendants with the noose (of death ) in their hands, Yama whispers in their ears :&ndash; &ldquo;Do not approach those who have performed <em>prapatti</em> at (the feet of) Madhusūdana. I have sway only over others and not over the devotees of Viṣṇu &ldquo;. And Again : - &ldquo;O Thou with lotus-like eyes, O <em>Vāsudeva</em>, O Viṣṇu, O Thou that bearest the earth, O Thou that art armed with the conch and the discus, be Thou my refuge&rdquo; - those that utter these words - leave them at a distance for they are not sinners&rdquo;, and further, &ldquo;Those that perform <em>prapatti</em> to Viṣṇu, the God who is armed with sārnga, never go to the world of Yama, for naraka is not their dwelling place.&rdquo; As stated above in such treatises as Viṣṇu purāna and Vamanapurāna and the passages in the strutis on which they are based, they do not go to the land of Yama, but they are punished with the blindness of an eye, or the lameness of a leg, or some such thing and thus relieved of their burden (of sin). (They will be punished in this life itself here) on the analogy of one (who is dear) being punished with the prick of a thorn instead of being stabbed with a spear. The Supreme Lord, being possessed of forgiveness, kindness, compassion and over-flowing love, relents in His anger and protects the <em>prapanna</em> after a light punishment in this very life for his offence. An emperor, who is to be duly served, punishes his attendants (like those who carry the umbrellas ), the servants of the harem like the hunchbacks and the dwarfs and so also the princes, in proportion to their offences and (also) to such things as their closeness to Him. (He punishes them) for having committed offences, in spite of his affection to them due to their relationship and His goodness. (He punishes them) so that they may obtain pardon for their offences and know that, in future, they may not offend (in the same manner). The punishments are such as the following: averting his face from them, whipping, getting them driven out, keeping them outside the gates and suspension for a short time. Similarly <em>Iśvara</em> punishes the <em>prapanna</em>, as ŚrīRāma did in the case of Kakasura by making him lose an eye and thus protects him.</p>
<p>Directing those that are gentle to obtain pardon (by atonement) and punishing those that are tough by nature for the sake of correction are of the nature of the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness, which is a consequence of their <em>prapatti</em> that preceded it. One should therefore feel grateful to the Lord for this correction. To emphasise this point, some said that the Lord would pardon even those sins that are committed deliberately. (They did not mean to say that deliberate offences would be pardoned without any punishment).</p>
<p><em>PRAPATTI</em> WILL NEVER BE IN VAIN :</p>
<p>It should not be thought that, because sins committed deliberately after <em>prapatti</em> and not atoned for would be followed by their consequences like that part of prārabdha <em>karma</em> which is of the nature of sin, the <em>prapatti</em> performed before would not yield</p>
<p><em>mokṣa</em>. When asafoetida is applied to the root of a tree for making it wither, the tree is sure to wither sooner or later, according to the nature of the soil and other conditions; (but there is no doubt that it will wither; it will do so, perhaps after a little more time). So also in the case of these prapannas who have committed sins deliberately, there will be difference only with regard to the delay in the complete release from <em>samsāra</em>. If they desire to have <em>mokṣa</em> at the end of this life and cannot brook delay and if the period of their life-time is not previously fixed, there will be delay in <em>mokṣa</em>  by the life-time being extended. To those whose period of life-time is already fixed, <em>prapatti</em> will certainly bear fruit within that time.</p>
<p>DISCUSSION OF THE VIEW THAT EVEN DELIBERATE OFFENCES COMMITTED BY A <em>PRAPANNA</em> WILL NOT AFFECT HIM ADVERSELY.</p>
<p>It may be asked “Even after Sītā Devi promised protection to the Rākṣasis by saying &ldquo;I will protect you,&rdquo; when these Rākṣasis offended her again deliberately, were their sins not forgiven when Sītā Devi said, &quot; I forgive their offences as I cannot bear their sufferings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Whether they deserve punishment for their sins or whether they have not committed any sins (deserving of punishment), you should pardon them because of your generous Nature &ndash; There is no one that is above fault&rdquo;? The answer is as follows:- Even here, the Rākṣasis were afraid that Hanuman was about to punish them severely and were afterwards saved from it. So there was, as in the raising of the sword (to strike a person), a slight punishment (fear) and (then ) forgiveness. Therefore, when it is sometimes stated that even sins committed deliberately by a <em>prapanna</em>, would not cling to him, the statement has no authority in support of it. It is also sometimes stated that the <em>prapanna</em> need not atone for his sins even when he has committed them deliberately, and that, even if he has not atoned for them, there will be no punishment by way of teaching him a lesson. It is sometimes maintained also that when such offences have been committed, there will be no delay in the attainment of the supreme goal even for those who are impatient of delay and that there will be no intermission or diminution in the services which have come to a man as the result of meritorious <em>karma</em> in the past bearing fruit in this life. These propositions maintained by some (should not be taken as literally true); they are made just to glorify the attributes and qualities of the Saviour and the power of <em>prapatti</em>. Otherwise there would be no meaning in the continued tradition of the observance, by previous prapannas, of the code of conduct prescribed for the <em>prapanna</em>, in the _śāstra_s which prescribe methods of atonement for sins in the case of prapannas, and in the texts which say that there will be delay in the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em>  for those who did not perform <em>prapatti</em> indicating the time when they wanted to have it and are also impatient of delay while sinning deliberately. Though it is said as a general</p>
<p>statement, &ldquo;I will release you from all sins&rdquo;, since it is qualified by a passage standing as a special case: &ldquo;This atonement consists in the performance of <em>prapatti</em> once again&rdquo;, it is evident that the atonement for sins committed deliberately after <em>prapatti</em> is the performance of another <em>prapatti</em>. It cannot be argued that this passage prescribiog another <em>prapatti</em> is only for those who did not perform <em>prapatti</em> to cover also those subsequent sins that might be committed deliberately. This argument would carry weight, only if there were an explicit statement that <em>prapatti</em> might be performed to cover also future sins of a deliberate nature. (There is none such). If a man knows that the original <em>prapatti</em> may be made in such a way as to cover also future sins of a deliberate nature, there will be no one who will care to give up this easier method and thus the text prescribing a further <em>prapatti</em> will find none to adopt it. A general statement cannot contradict a statement made for a special or specific case (for the general statement covers only all cases except those specified in the special statement). If we hold that a general statement can sublate or contradict a special statement for specific cases, it would follow that, even in the case of one who adopts the <em>upāya</em> or <em>bhakti</em> or <em>upāsana</em>, subsequent sins committed deliberately would cause no stain.</p>
<p>It is evident from the authority of the following <em>śloka</em>  that those who are exclusively devoted to <em>Bhagavān</em> (whether they be bhaktas or prapannas ) will not fall under the sway of Yama : &ldquo;Whatever may be the family into which they are born, wherever they may live, those who love <em>Bhagavān</em> will never go to the world of Yama.&rdquo; There is general agreement also that the same sin will meet with either heavy or light punishment as its consequence, according to the differences of caste, character and the like. This is also consistent with what obtains in the world in cases like the offences committed by princes.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>“न प्राग्वद्बुद्धिपूर्वाघे न चात्यन्तमनुग्रहः । लघुर्दण्डः प्रपन्नस्य राजपुत्रापराधवत् ॥ ४०-अ ॥</p>
<p>In cases of deliberate offence, the punishment is not as severe as before (<em>prapatti</em>) nor is there a high degree of grace. To the <em>prapanna</em> the punishment is light as in the case of the sons of kings.</p>
<p>Therefore to avoid even this light punishment which would follow as the consequence, a further <em>prapatti</em> ia ordained. In the case of those who are looked upon as learned and righteous, and who are also capable of atonement, atonement in public, in accordance with their ability, is proper when the offences have been committed in public. This is for the sake of setting an example to the rest of the world. If it were not done, it would be a transgression of (the Lord&rsquo;s) command stated before. The violation of the command is injurious in two ways. When the waiting woman [woman attendant] is suspended from service, she loses what she obtains (from the service ) such as scents and has to experience also dread (of punishment).</p>
<p>It may (now) be asked :-&ldquo;What if the original or first <em>prapatti</em> is made on one&rsquo;s own initiative (without the sanction of the sāstrās ) so as to cover also deliberate sins of the future ?&rdquo; This is (easily ) answered by a counter-check :-&ldquo;What if <em>bhakti</em> or <em>upāsana</em> is performed so as to cover also future acts of deliberate offence? What if <em>prapatti</em> as an <em>aṅga</em> is performed so as to cover such acts ?&rdquo; If it is stated that in these two cases (of counter-check) also, it may be held that future sins will not cling, it will be heresy opposed to what is stated in Śrī Bhāṣya and elsewhere. It is also opposed to the code of conduct observed by such (holy men ) as Ushasti [Ushasti ate a morsel of cooked gram given by a mahout but refused to drink the water which was afterwards offered by him. He justified his action by saying that he ate the gram to avoid death by starvation, but refused the water because there was then no fear of death.] who were steadfast in the contemplation of <em>Brahman</em> (_Brahman_ishta). There is no special ordinance to contradict the general statement that when a sin is committed and the man feels remorse, the atonement or the <em>prāyaścitta</em> is to meditate on <em>Bhagavān</em>. Therefore the rule that, unless the occasion has arisen, there can be no application of a remedy (to cover a future possibility) holds good and stands uncontradicted in the case of offences committed deliberately after <em>prapatti</em>. Since the prayaschitta or atonement is prescribed only for a sin that has already been committed, if a man dreads the possibility of future sins committed deliberately, he should perform atonement in the form of a <em>prapatti</em> for the sins of the past life which have now begun to operate and which are the cause of these (possible) future sins. For has it not been said, &ldquo;<em>Bhakti</em> adopted as an <em>upāya</em> can destroy all sins except those sins of the past that have begun to operate in this life. On the other hand, <em>prapatti</em> (or sadhya <em>bhakti</em>). is superior to <em>bhakti</em> and can destroy even those sins of the past that have begun to produce their consequences in this life?&rdquo; It has also been said :- &ldquo;The sins committed in previous births afflict a man (in the present life) as diseases. They can be got rid of by medicines, charitable gifts, japa, offerings to the fire (homa) and adoration of <em>Bhagavān</em>&rdquo;. (It is indeed stated here) that, even by japa and homa, the sins of the past which have begun to bear fruit in the present life can be destroyed. (Such being the case, there is no reason to doubt that <em>prapatti</em> can destroy such sins). Therefore if a man performs <em>prapatti</em> in dread of the possibilities of future sins which might be caused by the sins of the past, these can be got rid of and no such future sin will be deliberately committed.</p>
<p>From such episodes as that of Sandili in which even Garuḍa who has been described in Alavandar&rsquo;s Stotra as <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s servant, friend, vehicle, seat and device on the banner, committed an offence against the righteous Sandili and had to undergo the evil consequences of it until he obtained pardon from her &ndash; from such episodes, it is evident that even for those who are in immediate contact with <em>Bhagavān</em>, even slight offences against the righteous are productive of evil consequences. (It may be asked whether <em>nitya</em> sūris like Garuḍa could commit offences at all). The answer is that, if the eternal sūris incarnate like <em>Bhagavān</em>, they have to act the part of those who are subject to the sway of <em>karma</em> and perform atonement for offences in order to promote the good of the world (by setting a proper example).</p>
<p>So, in order that one may not lose the grace of God and thereby incur the need for further <em>prapatti</em> or light punishment, a way must be found to root out the possibility of future offences. In general, the root cause of all offences is want of discrimination (aviveka). Of this want of discrimination, the most important is that which causes the delusion that the self is identical with matter (the body ) which is non-sentient and ever subject to modification and has such other qualities and, likewise, the delusion that the individual self has the attributes and qualities which are peculiar to <em>Iśvara</em>, such as existing in itself, independence, and not existing for any one but itself. The sharp-edged saw that cuts off this want of discrimination is a clear knowledge of the nature of one&rsquo;s self which is neither redundant nor inadequate.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>अविवेकप्रभुत्वादेर्निदानस्य निवर्तनात् । अर्थकामापचाराणामयत्नोन्मूलनं भवेत् ॥ ४०-आ ॥</p>
<p>When the cause, namely, the delusion that the self is the body and that the self is independent (of the Lord) and other such delusions disappear, the offences which arise from the desire for wealth and for sense pleasures are (completely) rooted out without any special effort.</p>
<p>The prime cause of all these, namely, the possibility of future offences and the delusions which cause them is sin committed in past births which has now begun to yield its consequences. Therefore it will be atoned for by the performance of <em>prapatti</em> at the beginning so as to cover that sin also or the performance of a further <em>prapatti</em> for the purpose. Of these sins which have to be atoned for, the _Bhāṣya_kāra (Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em>) has pointed out that offences done to Bhāgavatas stand in the front rank like those done to the wives of a king -vide his commentary on the <em>Sūtra</em> : &ldquo;The fruits of <em>mukti</em> too, cannot be said to be attained at any fixed time; for they can be attained only if there are no obstacles&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s commentary is as follows: Though the fruit of <em>upāsana</em> or <em>bhakti</em> is <em>mukti</em>, still the time of its attainment is uncertain, because of the presence or absence of obstacles. It may be asked whether there could be any such obstacle in the case of one whose <em>karma</em> or upāsanā which gets him <em>mukti</em> is far stronger than all other karmas. The answer is:- Even in his case there may be obstacles of the nature of offences done in the past to those who meditate on <em>Brahman</em>).</p>
<p>Such being the case, although there may be resemblance between oneself and such persons as Parāśara, Vyāsa, Śuka , Śaunaka, Nathamuni and others, who were distinguished by their caste, character, conduct and the like in such matters as devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em> and the attainment of the supreme goal of life, they should not be treated with disregard. There are differences due to the will of <em>Bhagavān</em> as seen in the condition of each object among things which are the property of <em>Bhagavān</em> such as cows and cowherds, tulasī and champaka, cow dung and musk. Such points of excellence and inferiority, which are likely to cause envy, should not make one think of treating superior persons with disregard, As stated in Rahasyāmnāya in the section treating of the origin of envy. It is true that particular actions and abstention from such actions have been prescribed in the case of Bhagavatās as due to conditions of caste and the like as stated in the <em>Brahma</em> <em>Sūtra</em> (2-3. 47) &quot; That there is permission and prohibition (in respect of castes ) is due to their relationship with their bodies as in such things as fire&rdquo; (Fire from the house of a Vedic scholar is fit for use, that from the cremation ground is unfit for use. So also, though the soul is pure, a man becomes fit or unfit for certain specific matters owing to his soul&rsquo;s contact with the</p>
<p>body). In spite of these ordinances, we should also consider such passages as the following :</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even a man of bad conduct should be considered a good man if he worships me without expecting any other benefit. He should be treated with respect.&rdquo; &ldquo;The caṇḍāla&rdquo; who has devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em> - to think even by more chance, of this chanḍāla, to talk to him and to treat him with respect - these purify the man who does so, O, Brahmin &quot; &quot; Whether the devotee of <em>Bhagavān</em> be a südra, a huntsman, or a man who eats dog&rsquo;s flesh, the man who looks upon him as identical with other men of those respective castes will go to hell.&rdquo; &ldquo;Therefore one should do what one can to please the devotees of <em>Bhagavān</em>. By this, <em>Bhagavān</em> becomes favourably disposed to bless one. There is no doubt about this.&rdquo; So also has it been said (by the Alwar) that those who are the devoted servants of the Lord are his masters in all his future births and that the moment he made up his mind to render service to the Lord&rsquo;s devotees, his past <em>karma</em> was destroyed and that he would never think of giving up this service. In the same way it is our duty not to fail in reverence towards the Lord&rsquo;s servants. Even if there is only this mental reverence, it would amount to the <em>śeṣa</em>&rsquo;s service to the Lord who is perfect and self-sufficient. The thought that &quot; This man is of the Lord” is itself capable of doing good. If there is any deviation from this path, one should tremble in fear as if one has entered into the jaws of Death, as it has been said: Whatever is crooked (in conduct) leads to death ( <em>samsāra</em>): whatever is straight leads to the attainment of <em>Brahman</em>&rdquo;. (When there has been such deviation from right conduct) one should at once beg pardon of these devoted servants of the Lord as exemplified in the following: &quot; Since  you have offended, I see no other atonement for you than to be Lakṣmaṇa&rsquo;s pardon, with folded hands&rdquo;, and again &ldquo;If I have offended you in any way, either on account of overconfidence or love, this fault of your servant should be pardoned by you: There is no one who is above committing an offence&rdquo;, and further, &ldquo;The harsh words that I uttered to you after hearing the speech of Rama who is overwhelmed with grief - these words should be forgiven by you&rdquo;. We should reflect on the manner in which Sugrīva, the great king, and Lakṣmaṇa apologise to each other in these <em>śloka</em> s and we should get reconciled to the devotees of the Lord (whom we have offended), as if the split that occurred has been glued up without any trace of its being seen.</p>
<p>Even if one who knows the <em>tattva</em> has deliberately entered on a course of conduct unfavourable (to the Lord), the Supreme Ruler will pardon him, if he performs <em>prapatti</em> subsequently. This may be seen from the following episode :- When <em>Brahma</em> saw Rudra in Badarik_āśrama_ aiming his arrow at <em>Bhagavān</em> who had incarnated as the son of <em>Dharma</em>, he explained matters to Rudra and stopped him from the fight. Rudra  then apologised to Nārāyaṇa  who was his Lord to win His favour. He also performed <em>prapatti</em> to Hari, the Creator of the World, The Supreme Ruler, the giver of boons, became gracious, controlled His anger, became pleased and associated there with Rudra&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Whether a man has offended Bhāgavatas (in this life) or whether some Bhāgavatas hate him owing to his wicked deeds in past lives though he has committed no offence in this life, he should obtain the pardon of <em>Bhagavān</em> by obtaining the pardon of such Bhāgavatas by some means or other : This is evident in the passage which describes the characteristics of a ŚrīVaiṣṇava : &ldquo;He is a devotee of <em>Viṣṇu</em> who, on hearing harsh words uttered by a Bhāgavata, prostrates before him and begs his pardon.&rdquo; If a man does not do so, he will pass beyond the reach of the grace of the Lord and will lose also what is essential to his nature as a Viṣṇu <em>bhakta</em>, namely, his being a <em>śeṣa</em> to Bhāgavatas and, likewise, his qualities of self-restraint and patience; for it has been said :-“Those who are Brahmins (Bhāgavatas absorbed in the contemplations of <em>Brahman</em>) they are myself. There is no doubt about this O, King; when they are adored, I am adored; when they are pleased, I am also pleased. He who hates them hates me also.&rdquo; &ldquo;Though the _Brahman_a strikes him, curses him and utters cruel words to him, he who does not bow to him as I did (to Bhrigu) - he is a sinner. He will be consumed by the wild fire of the Brahmin&rsquo;s anger. He deserves to be killed and punished. He is not mine.&rdquo; To lose these (his being a <em>śeṣa</em> to Bhāgavatas and his self-restraint and patience) is itself, in his case, being killed and punished. Thondaradippodi Alwar [ That is why he calls himself Tondaradippodi, The Dust at the Feet of the Devotecs&rsquo;.] , who realised and enjoyed his relationship of being a <em>śeṣa</em> to Bhāgavatas, which he considered as his distinctive feature, has described how miserable it is to be outside the pale of the Lord&rsquo;s grace as follows:- &ldquo;My Lord has not said: “ This is a lad deserving of my affection&rdquo;. How wicked are my sins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word Brahmin occurring in these ślokas has a special significance, as has been said in the <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;He who knows, aright, the truth concerning <em>Bhagavān</em>, who is called Viṣṇu  that measured the world ( with His feet) and is also called <em>Vāsudeva</em> he becomes a Brahmin&rdquo;. Even if it is used in its general sense, since the offence to the Brahmin is condemned, much more worthy of condemnation would be the offence to a Bhāgavata or devotee of <em>Bhagavān</em>.</p>

<p>All sins are destroyed, in four equal parts, by repentance, by abstention, by the endeavour to perform atonement and by the completion of the process of atonement. To those who feel remorse and repentance, whether the <em>prapatti</em> is performed in a previous kalpa or in a later kalpa, there is no difference in the <em>prapatti</em> to be performed although (there is a difference in the nature of sins committed). Similarly whether the sins be serious or venial, the performance of a single <em>prapatti</em> done at a time will completely destroy at once (all sins).</p>

<p>Those who dread, at heart, the formidable sins that bear fruit at present and seek refuge at the two lotus-like feet of the Lord who measured the worlds, will be freed from all <em>karma</em> which flourishes like weeds. In order to prevent the occurrence of future offences, the honey-like grace of our Lord prevails over the want of discrimination (aviveka) which gives rise to them.</p>

In the case of the <em>prapanna</em>, it is not at all likely that sins will be committed subsequently with deliberation. Even if such (subsequent ) sins occur, they will be destroyed by atonement; if, on account of wickedness, no atonement is performed, the sins will be expiated by punishment and the Lord will (then) take the <em>prapanna</em> to Himself.</p>

<p>(19) THE CHAPTER ON THE PLACES SUITABLE</p>
<p>FOR THE RESIDENCE OF THE <em>PRAPANNA</em>. page249</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em> :</p>
<p>यत्रैकाग्र्यं भवति भगवत्पादसेवार्चनादेः</p>
<p>यत्रैकान्त्यव्यवसितधियो यस्य कस्यापि लाभः ।</p>
<p>वासस्थानं तदिह कृतिनां भाति वैकुण्ठकल्पं</p>
<p>प्रायो देशा मुनिभिरुदिताः प्रायिकौचित्यवन्तः ॥ ४२ ॥</p>
<p>The place where it is possible to concentrate all one&rsquo;s attention on such things as service at the feet of <em>Bhagavān</em> and His adoration, or the place where one can find some one or other whose wind is exclusively and staunchly fixed on <em>Bhagavān</em> - that is the place of abode for prapannās as it is almost equal to Vaikuṇṭha. Many places that have been prescribed (for abode ) by the sages generally have this fitness (in these two respects).</p>
<p>THE PLACE SUITED TO THE RESIDENCE OF</p>
<p>THE <em>PRAPANNA</em>:</p>
<p>As an end in itself, the <em>prapanna</em> is desirous and eager to live, the rest of his life in a manner that would be inoffensive and agreeable to the Lord. He is exclusively and supremely attached to the Lord as described in the <em>śloka</em>  :&ndash; The &lsquo;devotee who is exclusively attached to <em>Bhagavān</em> is not to be described or designated as belonging to a certain village or a certain family, but as belonging to <em>Bhagavān</em>, for <em>Bhagavān</em> alone is everything to him.</p>
<p>THE PLACES INHABITED BY BHAGAVATĀS ARE</p>
<p>THE MOST SUITABLE.</p>
<p>If it be asked what is the proper place for his residence, the answer is as follows:- Holy regions like Aryavarta have now, owing to the nature of the Yuga (Kali) become unfit for abode, owing to the rites of <em>varṇa</em> and <em>āśrama</em> getting mingled. Therefore the proper place for residence at present is any place where the practice of the <em>dharma</em> of the four _varṇa_s is well established. Even among these places, those regions which are. inbabited by Bhāgavatas are to be chosen by (the <em>prapanna</em>) desirous of <em>mokṣa</em> . It has been said :-&ldquo;What austerities must they have practised (in their past lives) - they who live in places where there are devotees that adore, with folded hands, Śrī kṛṣṇa, who has a complexion similar to that of a black cloud, and that look upon Him as their protector ?&rdquo; Though it is stated &quot; In Kali, O, Maitreya, men deluded by heretics will not adore <em>Viṣṇu</em>, the Lord of the World, the Ruler who created all things&rdquo;, we are also told about places where Bhāgavatas live in Kali Yuga : &quot; In Kali Yuga, there will be born, here and there, noble souls who consider that Nārāyaṇa  is the supreme object of attainment. They will be born in numbers in Tamil Nad on the banks of the Tamraparni, of the Kritamala, of the Palar, of the renowned Cauvery and of the river which flows westwards and again : &ldquo;Those who drink the waters of these rivers, O, king, become pure ia mind and greatly devoted to <em>Bhagavān</em> who is called <em>Vāsudeva</em>&rdquo;. As stated in these passages, it is these places inhabited by Bhagavatās, that are suitable for the residence of the <em>prapanna</em> in this Kali Yuga. In Śrī Narayaniya the devas and the rishis said, &ldquo;When <em>dharma</em> stands on a single leg ready to go elsewhere, how are we to live, O Lord? Please tell us this”, <em>Bhagavān</em> replied as follows: &ldquo;You should live in places where <em>guru_s of good character and possessed of self-control are held in reverence and where <em>dharma</em> has not undergone any deterioration. The places which should be chosen by you, O best of devotees, are those where flourish the Vedas, yajņas, austerities (tapas), truth, control of the senses and the slaughter of animals only for the sake of <em>dharma</em> (sacrifices). A_dharma</em> will not touch you with its foot&rdquo;.</p>
<p>THE HOLY PLACES WHERE BHAGAVĀN IS WORSHIPPED IN TEMPLES ARE</p>
<p>SPECIALLY SUITABLE:</p>
<p>Among them, the boly places where <em>Bhagavān</em> has chosen to be present as archā would be proper for the prapannas&rsquo; residence. He should live permanently in one among them which is suitable for his service to the Lord). As an example of holy places where sattva is predominant, _Śrī_r_aṅga_m is indicated in the following passage . &ldquo;Until the &lsquo;fall of the body, live in peace here in _Śrī_r_aṅga_m itself.&rdquo; That only the holy places of <em>Bhagavān</em> are suitable for the residence of the wise man has been stated by the great sage (Vyāsa) in the context of the places of pilgrimage in Āranya Parva, thus :- &ldquo;The place where the Supreme Being, the God Nārāyaṇa  who is eternal, dwells &ndash; that is sacred; that is most holy; that is the place of the sacred water that purifies; that is the place fit for austerities; that is the place where the divine seers and the siddhas and all others perform penance&rdquo;, and (in another context) elsewhere, we find -&rdquo; There is a mountain called Gomanta, O, king, which is full of all the minerals. On that mountain dwells the lotus-eyed Lord Nārāyaṇa , the Lord of Lakṣmī , who is sung in hymns (there) by those who desire <em>mokṣa</em> .&rdquo; <em>Bhagavān</em> Vālmīki also has stated :- “This mountain, Chitrakuta, which resembles Himavan, the king of mountains, is possessed of glory, for ŚrīRāma born of the race of Kakustha dwells on it like Kubera in Nandana.&quot; The word subhaga in this siloka refers to the glory of that mountain as one to be visited for having been the residence of <em>Bhagavān</em>. In the Sātvata śāstra s also, the holy places where there are the spontaneous manifestations of <em>Bhagavān</em>, those that were established by siddhās and those founded by devotees and the degrees of sanctity attached to them are described separately and it is also stated there that those who dwell within the boundaries of these holy places will attain a special boon at the time of their laying down the body :-&ldquo;The wind&rdquo; of man which is under the sway of the foul senses is always surrounded by impure influences. It is, however, purified in the last moments by residence in the abode of Nārāyaṇa .&ldquo;Therefore as stated in the <em>śloka</em>  :-&ldquo;A man should live in a place where there is a temple of Viṣṇu  and do some kind of service (there). If he is unable to perform any service, he should At least abstain from what is forbidden&rdquo;; the <em>prapanna</em> would do well to live in a place sanctified by the presence of <em>Bhagavān</em> and Bhāgavatas and capable of promoting sattva <em>guṇa</em>.</p>
<p>It is true that it is said: “ The places where a man in full control of his senses lives — that place has in it Kurukṣetra, Naimisa and, likewise, Pushkaram.&rdquo; But this should be taken to mean that, when a righteous man lives in some insignificant place, because of his inability to live elsewhere, that place becomes sanctified by his residence. This is illustrated in the episode of Sandili.[ Sandili, a great devotee of the Lord, was living on an island in the sea. Garuḍa, who saw it, wondered why she should dwell in such a mean place. Owing to this offensive thought, his wings were burnt away and he recovered their use only after obtaining her pardon.]</p>
<p>Therefore the statement in the following <em>śloka</em>  :&ndash; &ldquo;The man &quot; who performs <em>prapatti</em> by uttering this <em>mantra</em> at the very time when he attains this knowledge &ndash; that man attains <em>mokṣa</em>  wherever he may die losing his consciousness whether it be in a holy place of pilgrimage or the house of one who eats dog&rsquo;s flesh&rdquo; - this statement that there is no special place prescribed for death, should also be understood in the light of what has been said above, as pointing out that this will be no hindrance to the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em> .</p>

<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>मनसि करणग्रामं प्राणे मनः पुरुषे च तं</p>
<p>झटिति घटयन् भूतेष्वेनं परे च तमात्मनि ।</p>
<p>स्वविदविदुषोरित्थं साधारणे सरणेर्मुखे</p>
<p>नयति परतो नाडीभेदैर्यथोचितमीश्वरः ॥ ४४ ॥</p>
<p>The Lord merges the aggregate of the senses in the mind, the mind with the senses in the vital breath (prāna), the vital breath with these in the self or soul, the self in the subtle elements (Sakshina bhutas ) and the self with these elements in Himself (the Supreme Self) very soon. So far, the process of the soul&rsquo;s departure is common to both the person who has realised Him and the person who has not realised Him. Thereafter, the Lord leads the self through different veins ( nadi)<sup id="fnref:286"><a href="#fn:286" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">286</a></sup> which lead either to the (dark) path of smoke or to the shining path of light (archirādi) or elsewhere in accordance with the qualifications (of each individual).</p>
<p>The soul of the man who has realised <em>Brahman</em> is said to be led through a vein issuing out of the head into the shining path of archis along which it passes into immortality in Vaikuṇṭha  . The soul of the man who has not realised <em>Brahman</em> is led through other veins into the dark path called dhuma or smoke. He will be born again in <em>samsāra</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having given up all _upāya_s, and having given up also all desires including the desire to enjoy one&rsquo;s self, I seek as my refuge, O, Lord, Thy feet which measured the world.&rdquo; When with these words, the <em>prapanna</em> takes the feet of the Lord, the Lord takes him by the hand, which, it has been said, is the only support of the <em>prapanna</em>: &ldquo;The hands of the Lord who is called <em>Janārdana</em> and who has been bought with the price of <em>bhakti</em> is the only support for the <em>prapanna</em>.&rdquo; The Lord who has been called &ldquo;the king of kings of all (beings)&rdquo; and who is the possessor of the two glories, <em>Līlā</em> Vibhūti (in this world) and <em>Nitya</em> <em>Vibhūti</em> or eternal glory in Paramapada, (having taken him by the hand) fixes him in a place of His own liking and the <em>prapanna</em> leads his life there, being held in as high a regard as an anointed queen and following such occupations as are consistent with his exclusive and supreme attachment to the Lord.</p>
<p>DELAY IN THE ATTAINMENT OF THE GOAL :</p>
<p>Among prapannas, there may be (some ) who, on account of certain specific evil deeds done in past lives which have begun to operate now, may become subject to such lapses as the following :- (1) They may display the feelings of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;mine&rsquo; (ahankāra and mamakara) (2) as a result of these (feelings) they may commit offences; (3) they may display a taste or desire for other objects than the Lord; (4) owing to this desire they may contact other deities; (5) they may be weak-minded; owing to this (weak-mindedness ), they may desire to adopt other _upāya_s. There may be others who, owing to good deeds done in past lives which have begun to yield their fruits in this life and owing to the specific nature of the request for benefits made at the time of <em>prapatti</em>, have never swerved from the service of the Lord. It may be asked what is the nature of the delay in the release from <em>samsāra</em> in the case of these two classes of prapannas. The answer is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In this matter, prapaninas will never have the feelings of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;mine&rsquo; in any deep-seated form such as the Cārvākas (materialists) have. Even people who walk warily sometimes stumble; so also prapannas may, on rare occasions, show these feelings; but these improper feelings or notions will disappear by later wisdom originating in reason.</p>
<p>(2) In the chapter on the atonement for offences, we explained how, if offences are committed, they will last only until the time of winning pardon or the undergoing of punishment and how the offences will be expiated within the required time.</p>
<p>In the case of those who performed <em>prapatti</em> without indicating any definite time (for the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em> ), it is said as follows: &ldquo;The man who has performed <em>prapatti</em> to me and who has not abstained from sins committed frequently, attains me late after wearing out all his sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(3) &ldquo;Since the <em>prapanna</em> is bent on attaining <em>mokṣa</em>, he is not likely to have any long-standing desire for other benefits. Like those who have both <em>Brahma</em> bhāvana and Karma bhavana, (<em>Brahma</em>, Rudra and the like), they might entertain a desire for other benefits along with the desire for <em>mokṣa</em> ; if so, <em>Iśvara</em>, who is their well-wisher, will not grant them those (so called) benefits ( as they are not for his good); for it is said :-&ldquo;Even when the <em>bhakta</em> prays for it, <em>Iśvara</em> does not permit him to do what is not good to himself. Does not the mother prevent her child that longs to fall into the fire ?&rdquo; It is said also :&ndash; &quot; He whom I want to bless &ndash; his wealth I take away from him. His relations will then desert him. He will become miserable. If, in his misery, he still clings to me, I confer on him such blessings as are unattainable even for the devas.&rdquo; The same idea is found in the story of Kundadhāra<sup id="fnref:287"><a href="#fn:287" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">287</a></sup> . Sometimes <em>Iśvara</em> creates in the <em>prapanna</em> a distaste for these other things by making him realise that they are trivial, transient and mingled with pain. Sometimes, as in the case of Soubhari and Kuchela, he gives them the benefits desired by them, but makes them feel an aversion to them afterwards.</p>
<p>Kundadhara : A certain man who was devoutly attached to Kundadhara begged him for wealth. Kundadhara, instead of granting wealth, saw to it that his follower should become attached to <em>dharma</em>.</p>
<p>Thus the man who performed <em>prapatti</em> indicating the time when he should attain <em>mokṣa</em> , will have acquired an aversion to other benefits than the Lord within the prescribed time. In the case also of the man who did not indicate any such time while performing <em>prapatti</em>, there will be delay, as has been stated in the <em>śloka</em> : - &ldquo;The man who is desirous of performing such <em>karma</em> as is a means of obtaining other benefits (than God ) enjoys pleasures unmingled with pain, and at last acquires a distaste for them (and the spirit of renunciation ), after which he reaches the abode of <em>Bhagavān</em>. In accordance with this, the delay in his attainment (of the supreme goal) will be only until the birth of aversion to worldly objects.</p>
<p>(4) In regard to contact with other deities, the Ruler of All will bring him back some day or other into the company of those who are staunchly and exclusively devoted to <em>Bhagavān</em>, correct his lapse until he gets ashamed and thus remove his deviation from the right path.</p>
<p>If, in some, this contact with other deities becomes permanent, it may be inferred that the adoption of <em>prapatti</em> as an <em>upāya</em> was incomplete in their case. It may also be understood that they may have such things as Naraka in future. In a man of this description, the fragmentary <em>prapatti</em> performed to <em>Bhagavān</em> may, at some time in the future, attain completion and become effective.</p>
<p>(5) In those who performed <em>prapatti</em> after the rise of full and great faith, there will not be any weak-mindedness nor the desire to adopt other _upāya_s. If these - viz., weak-mindedness and the desire to adopt other means &ndash; are present, it is to be inferred that their former faith was not strong enough. The Lord of All will correct these men also until they acquire great faith and make them perfect prapannas.</p>
<p>In the case of those in whom no such lapses occur, there is no possibility at all of delay in the attainment (of the supreme goal). There will be delay for them only as long as they desire it. They will attain <em>mokṣa</em>  at the time when they desire to have it. The Adhikarī who has attained the true state of a <em>prapanna</em> will always be the favourite of the Supreme Ruler, who is the Lord of Lakṣmī , as pointed out in the passage. &ldquo;O, Thou, Lord of _Śrī_r_aṅga_m, that delightest in those idle* men (prapannas ) who stand outer-most (as being incapable of <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em>, <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em> or <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> )&rdquo;. [ They are called &lsquo;idle&rsquo;, because, after <em>prapatti</em> they do not seek any other <em>upāya</em>. They are said to stand &ldquo;outer-most&rdquo; because, being unable to adopt <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em>, <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em> and <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>, they have adopted the <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) which is prescribed in the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em>  of the Gita.]</p>
<p>In the case of this <em>prapanna</em>, the Lord who is the unconditional <em>śeṣī</em>  of all, who is independent of all others and without limitations of any kind and whose will is irresistible, withholds his desire to punish, which is the cause of all fears, at the very first moment in which he utters the sentence expressing <em>prapatti</em>, in the same way as at the beginning of the meditation in the case of the upāsaka or <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> <em>niṣṭhā</em>, who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as a means to <em>bhakti</em>, of whom it is said. &quot; When the <em>vidyā</em> commences, the destruction of former sins and the absence of contact with subsequent sins (occur), for so the śrutis say&rdquo;. The Lord makes up His mind (at that very instant) to bring him and those who are his followers into the company of the eternal sūris and, not satisfied with having done only this, He devours, as it were, all the heaps of sins committed by those who have sought Him and does not reveal any trace of them outside and feels also that He should stomach even more (of these sins). He removes the sins of his followers too, even when they are committed deliberately, by His will to grant the <em>prapanna</em> His blessing. In virtue of this, they will expiate their sins by repentance and the like. It is said: &ldquo;He (the Lord) hastens to give Paramapada to the man who is fit for <em>mukti</em>&rdquo;. The Lord pities the <em>prapanna</em> for the delay which he has chosen and hastens to create in him an impatience of delay (in attainment). He produces in him an eagerness to attain the goal as illustrated in the following (verses ) :- “ Hereafter I do not want to be born in this world of ignorance&quot; and &ldquo;Do not deceive me as Thou didst before. I swear by Thee and by Thy queen whose beautiful locks of hair shed their fragrance like a garland on Thy chest - I swear that I must be taken to Paramapada.&rdquo; Having made him so eager and so impatient to obtain the goal, the Lord decides on giving him Paramapada as desired by him at the end of this life, which has come to him as a result of past <em>karma</em>: So has it been said :-&ldquo;Our Lord&rdquo; is the greatest benefactor that confers Vaikuṇṭha   on those who have performed <em>prapatti</em>, when they happen to die&quot;. The Lord* has already seen to it that the fetters of gold and iron which bind him to <em>samsāra</em> namely, his <em>pāpa</em> and puṇya, past and future, as also the <em>karma</em> which has begun to operate, except that portion of it which he has agreed to expiate (during this life) are cut off without any trace being left at all. [ Even puṇya <em>karma</em> which would lead to swarga is a fetter (though of gold ), because it stands in the way of <em>mokṣa</em>.] It is said :- &ldquo;The sins of the past and the sins committed after <em>prapatti</em> vanish like cotton thrown in the fire.&rdquo; So when the time for leaving the body has come, the Lord causes his meritorious deeds (puṇya) and his sins (papa) to be divided and distributed among others, namely, those who were his well-wishers and those who did evil to him, respectively, as the consequence of the good and the evil wrougbt to him by them. For it has been said:&ndash; &ldquo;The man who is about to attain <em>mukti</em> leaves his puṇya and <em>pāpa</em> to his friends and foes respectively and attains <em>Brahman</em> as the fruit of <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>&rdquo;. and again &ldquo;The sins which are notorious in this world and which, oppressive like Yama, make a man sink into <em>samsāra</em> left the man about to attain <em>mukti</em> without making the least noise and entered into plants (viz, his foes )&rdquo;. The authors of the _Smṛti_s have expressed the truth contained in the Upaniṣads in the manner stated above.</p>
<p>THE <em>PRAPANNA</em> MAY DIE AT ANY TIME, DAY OR NIGHT, IN THE BRIGHT OR IN THE DARK HALF OF THE MONTH : ETC.</p>
<p>In regard to those who are desirous of other benefits than <em>mokṣa</em>  and who have not fulfilled completely the means of attaining <em>mokṣa</em> , it has been said in the <em>Smṛti</em>, and in the science of the celestial bodies, in the context of the departure from the body that Day-time, the bright half of the month (Sukla paksha) and the Uttarayana are favourable times for those that die. But (as the <em>prapanna</em> has adopted successfully the proper <em>upāya</em>) there is no such rule for him in regard to the time of death. For it has been said about him ;-&ldquo;It is not right to say that the man who dies at night will not attain <em>mokṣa</em> , for the association with <em>karma</em> lasts only as long as the body lasts &ldquo;, and again &quot; For the same reason, the views is not right that the man who dies in dakshmayana will not attain <em>mokṣa</em> .&rdquo; Whether in the day of man or in the night of man, whether in the day of pitṛs (s&rsquo;ukla paksha ) or in the night of the pitṛs (Kṛṣṇapaksha ), whether in the day of the gods (uttarāyana ) or in the night of the gods (dakshmayana ) - at the time appointed by the Lord, He makes him remember all his previous thoughts and desires (for <em>mokṣa</em> ) and like a king who is gracious and who cuts off the fetters of the prince lying in the prison-house, the Lord takes him along with Him. He causes some occasion or other suited to the time, for the soul&rsquo;s parting from the body without regard to auspicious or inauspicious time.</p>
<p>THE PROCESS OF THE SELF LEAVING THE BODY:</p>
<p>Then the Lord makes the ten external senses like speech merge in the mind and the mind with the senses of action and of knowledge, which are thus eleven in number, merge in the vital breath (prāna) and the vital breath in the self. Then at the moment of the shaking of the bone in the back called vamsa, the Lord churns out the subtle elements from the gross body (<em>sthūla</em> deha) and contacts the self with the subtle elements (<em>sūkṣma</em> bhuta) and then comforts the self so mingled with the senses, the vital breath and the subtle elements by keeping it by the side of Himself in the form that He has assumed in the heart; for, by nature, He is its friend and well-wisher. After giving the self, rest and relaxation, the Lord sees that the self passes out of the body. So far, the process is the same both for the man who has realised <em>Brahman</em> and for the man who has not.</p>
<p>THE PATH OF THE JOURNEY AFTER DEPARTURE:</p>
<p>(In regard to this passage of the self from the body), it has been said as follows: &ldquo;The <em>Jīva</em>   who abides in the heart like a lamp has innumerable veins (nādi). They are of many colours:&mdash; white, black, violet, blue, golden yellow, yellow and red. Among these veids (1ādīs), which are of varied colours, there is one which proceeds upwards. The individual self (<em>Jīva</em>  ) who passes through this vein breaks through the sphere of the sun and, having passed beyond the world of <em>Brahma</em>, reaches the highest state. One hundred other nādīs also go upwards. The <em>Jīva</em>   who goes out through them attains the bodies of the devas and reaches their worlds. Some nādis of various colours go downwards and they are dim. The <em>Jīva</em>   who goes out through them is born in <em>samsāra</em> in this world, without any choice on his part, in order to experience the fruits of his <em>karma</em>. (Since the nādīs are like rays proceeding from the heart which is like a lamp, they are called rays (rasmis).</p>
<p>The Lord sees to it that the self of the <em>prapanna</em> does not go out through any of these nādīs which lead those that are thieves of themselves, ((i. e.) who do not realise that they belong to the lord) to <em>svarga</em> and naraka (hell) and are therefore like the routes along which thieves take their victims. He makes the <em>prapanna</em>&rsquo;s self enter the <em>Brahma</em> Nīdi, which is beyond the hundredth among those nādīs that go upwards and which leads to the shining path called arcirādi, and helps it to start with the support of the rays of the sun.</p>
<p>When Kooratth alvan (ŚrīVatsankamisra) was in his last moments, his tongue was parched with the fatigue (of the moment) and (unable to speak or utter any words) he caught hold of Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s feet. At that time Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em> whispered the <em>Dvaya</em> <em>Mantra</em> in his ear<sup id="fnref:288"><a href="#fn:288" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">288</a></sup> . The other disciples, who were there, said to themselves with mental depression :- &ldquo;How can we hope to get this blessing ( <em>Dvaya</em> being whispered in the ear by Śrī_Rāmānuja_)? What shall we do?&rdquo; Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em> understood their fears and said, &ldquo;Do you not know the true character of Alvan? When he is in this condition (unable to say anything owing to the parched throat), what I did was only like placing a little camphor and a piece of sugar-candy (in his mouth, to make it wet). I did not whisper the <em>Dvaya</em> in order to make the <em>upāya</em> complete with its accessories&rdquo;. The disciples were relieved on hearing this.</p>
<p>The idea is that the <em>prapanna</em> will attain <em>mokṣa</em> even if he is unconscious and unable to utter the <em>Dvaya</em> or other _mantra_s.</p>
<p>Therefore as has been said in the following two ślokas: &quot; The man who has performed <em>prapatti</em>, whether he dies in a holy place or in the house of one who eats dog&rsquo;s flesh, will attain <em>mokṣa</em>  even if he dies unconscious,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;The man who, when his mind is in its normal condition, when the body is not shattered, and when the elementary constituents of the body (dhatu) are in perfect equipoise, meditates on me who have the world as my body and who am not subject to births due to <em>karma</em> when  man lies like a log of wood or a piece of stone in his dying moments, I think of (him) my devotee and lead him to attain the highest state&rdquo;, and as has been stated also in the Tamil verses , &ndash; &ldquo;O, Lord that reposest on Adi <em>Śeṣa</em> in _Śrī_r_aṅga_m, a man seeks refuge under the strong in order that he may obtain their support when he is in distress; though I am not like Tby devotees who know how to seek Thy help, yet I approach Thee, since Thou wert gracious even to the elephant; when the langour of the dying moment has come, I may not be able to think of Thee. Therefore I entreat Thee, even now, that, at that time, Thou shouldst come to my rescue,&rdquo; &ndash; as has been said in these passages, the <em>prapanna</em> need not seek the remembrance (of God) in his last moments (by any effort of his own ).</p>
<p>THE LAST THOUGHT :</p>
<p>The statement:-&ldquo;At the time of casting the body away, you will be in full possession of your intelligence owing to my grace; you will have a vision of me and will have all your previous memories and desires (for <em>mokṣa</em>  )&rdquo; &ndash; this statement, too, has to be interpreted in a manner that would not be in conflict with the verses cited above. This is how it should be interpreted. Some _ācārya_s interpret as follows:-&ldquo;The statement made in (<em>Śaraṇāgati</em> <em>Gadya</em>) applies to those prapannas who, while performing <em>prapatti</em>, begged also for the remembrance of the Lord) in their last moments.&rdquo; This interpretation cannot be accepted for the following reason :There must be some-last thought or other at the time of casting off the body and this thought must have some object or other. If the object that is thought of were other than the Lord, it would become dangerous, for it has been said. &quot; Whatever object one thinks of at the time when one leaves one&rsquo;s body &ndash; that alone will one attain (after death)&rdquo;, So we have to conclude that) if the man has performed <em>prapatti</em> as an independent means (whether or not he begged for the remembrance (of the Lord) in his last moments while performing <em>prapatti</em>, he will get that remembrance as stated in the <em>Gadya</em>. This is the interpretation favoured by some_ācārya_s. In the verses from Sanskrit and Tamil quoted above (where the last remembrance is not declared to be necessary), what is meant is that the last remembrance is not prescribed for the <em>prapanna</em> as something to be effected by his own effort as an <em>upāya</em>. In the eighth chapter of the Gitā, and in the <em>śloka</em>  which says :-&ldquo;That <em>Bhagavān</em> whom the yogis keep in their minds by an effort at the time of leaving the body-keeping that <em>Bhagavān</em> in mind, Bhīṣma gave up his body. Was he not one who attained the fruit of his <em>bhakti</em> or <em>upāsana</em> ?&rdquo; (The last remembrance comes as an <em>upāya</em> for those who adopt <em>bhakti</em> as the means and it comes by their own effort); but in the case of the <em>prapanna</em>, the remembrance comes out of the Lord&rsquo;s grace alone. &quot; Kevalam madiya dayaya&quot; are Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s words. What does this last remembrance mean? When speech and other activities have be come impossible, the remembrance or thought which arises in the mind before the mind, too, ceases to function-this is the last remembrance. Those who stand by cannot know it. Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s commentary on the <em>Brahma</em> <em>Sūtra</em>: “It is seen  that the mind functions even after the senses have ceased to do so&quot;, means only this, that the mind&rsquo;s functioning may be inferred by some sign or other. It may also describe his own experience in some states of ill-health and the like. Therefore this last remembrance is a thing that could be known only to the man who becomes a <em>mukta</em> and to (the Lord) who gives him <em>mokṣa</em> .</p>
<p>After this, the self, whether it be of the yogi or of one who is not a yogi, takes repose by the side of the Supreme Being who is in his heart (Harda) and is in a state similar to that of dreamless sleep (<em>suṣupti</em>).</p>
<p>It may be asked whether the description contained in the slokās and Tamil verses quoted above (Nos. 20 and 21)-such as being like a log of wood or like a piece of stone, and loss of all remembrance or consciousness may not be a reference to this state of <em>suṣupti</em>. The answer is that if so, there would be no special consideration for the <em>prapanna</em> ( which certainly there is).</p>
<p>Thereafter (i.e. after repose by the side of the Supreme Being), the self or soul attains perfect knowledge being awakened by the Lord (who is wise) and who says that &ldquo;the <em>Jīva</em>   gets knowledge, memory and forgetfulness only from Him. Lighted by that knowledge, it enters into the <em>Brahma</em> Nadi. Thence  forward Time is one eternal day for the self.</p>

<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>ज्वलनदिवसज्योत्स्नापक्षोत्नरायणवत्सरान्</p>
<p>पवनतपनप्रालेयांशून् क्रमादचिरद्युतिम् ।</p>
<p>जलधरपतिं देवाधीशं प्रजापतिमागत-</p>
<p>स्तरति विरजां दूरे वाचस्ततः परमद्भुतम् ॥ ४६ ॥</p>
<p>Fire (archis), day.time, the bright half of the month sukla paksha), Uttarāyaṇa and the year, thence Vayu, Surya, Chandra and then Lightning, Varuna, Indra, Prajāpati or <em>Brahma</em> &ndash; having traversed this path in the order given above, the self crosses the river Viraja; then follows the wonder that defies (all description in words.)</p>
<p>THE ROUTE CALLED ARCIRĀDI :</p>
<p>Thus the Lord who lives in the heart and who is full of love (for the <em>Jīva</em>  ) starts with the self who desires <em>mukti</em> and who has entered into the nādi in the head from out of _Brahma_puri, namely, the gross body, by the <em>Brahma</em> Nādi, which is, as it were, the main gate (of that city). In this He resembles a king who walks to and fro with his charming child in his arins.</p>
<p>As has been said in the following verses :- &ldquo;The self&rsquo; passes through a beautiful opening in the centre of the sphere of the sun.&rdquo; &ldquo;The &ldquo;self makes an opening in the sphere of the sun, whose rays fill his chariot&rdquo;. &ldquo;He goes through the middle of the sphere of the fiery sun&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Lord helps him to climb up by a ladder to Vaikuṇṭha   through the sphere of the sun whose hot rays dispel the darkness and then removes the ladder,&rdquo; - (as described in these verses), the Lord sets the self on the path called devayına and leads him Himself with the following to guide him, namely, archis or fire, day, the bright half of the month, Uttarayana and the year, Vayu, Surya and Chandra and Lightning: with Lightning who is called also amanava and his companions, Varuna, Indra and Prajāpati, the self is helped on its way. As the Alvar</p>
<p>says :- &quot; With these guides<sup id="fnref:289"><a href="#fn:289" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">289</a></sup> who are immortal, he reaches Vaikuṇṭha   and casts off this beautiful prison house of <em>samsāra</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fire, Day, Śuklapakṣa Uttarāyaṇa and the year arc, of course, inanimate; but the deities presiding over them (abhimani devatas) are the guides here referred to.)</p>
<p>ENTERTAINMENT ON THE WAY:</p>
<p>The Lord has said, “I remember my devotee and lead him to the supreme goal.&rdquo; In every one of these regions on the way (which belong respectively to Surya, Chandra etc.), the self enjoys all those delights which are described at great length in the sāstrās of <em>Bhagavān</em> (Āgamas). Thereafter it arrives at a region which it has long been eager to see and which has been described as follows:- &ldquo;When &lsquo;shall I see with my own eyes the world called Vaikuṇṭha  ? It shines brilliantly, it is always with <em>Bhagavān</em> who is possessed of the six attributes, like <em>jñāna</em>; it can never be attained by those who are not devoted to Viṣṇu ; it is free from the three qualities of <em>prakṛti</em> or matter (<em>sattvam</em>, rajas and tamas). It is full of the eternal sūris who divide the day into five parts and render the service to the Lord appropriate to each; it is also full of released souls who are like the eternal sūris. It has presence chambers, halls, and mansions. It is beautiful with forests and gardens; it has broad and deep wells, lakes and groves which adorn it. It is free from the sufferings due to <em>prakṛti</em>; it is fit to be praised by the devās. It shines like ten thousand suns shining at once; it is constituted of pure <em>sattvam</em> unmingled with rajas and tamas,&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the self arrives at this region, it casts off the subtle body ( sukshma s&rsquo;arira) which was kept on merely for the sake of the journey and not for experiencing the fruits of past <em>karma</em>: it casts off this subtle body like a boat which is set adrift after the crossing of the river and when the self has crossed the river Viraja, the Lord endows the self with a body that is super - sensuous and not constituted of matter or <em>prakṛti</em>; it is helped to reach the lake called Airammadiyam and then to approach the asvattha tree called Somasavana and is then welcomed by five hundred celestial damsels (apsaras) with garlands, ointments, fragrant powders, raiments and ornaments. The self is then decked by them with adornments suited to <em>Brahman</em> and the fragrances, flavours and splendours of <em>Brahman</em> are made to enter into it. It is then received by the eternal sūris. As the Alwar says. &ldquo;The eternal sūris with crowns on their heads come in groups to receive these self&rsquo;s or souls who are esteemed as the servants of Govinda in successive generations. They take the self to the tower with high walls which is adorned with banners. The self is then led to the entrance where the gates are kept by guards called Indra and Prajāpati and receives super-sensuous (aprākrita) honours befitting a king. This is described in the three verses beginning with 10.9.9.-&ldquo;As soon as they (the muktas) arrive at the gate, the guards who are eternal sūris say:-&rdquo; The devotees of <em>Bhagavān</em> are our masters. So please enter our abode&rdquo;. &ldquo;The sūris, who were there, wondered at the blessing vouchsafed to these released souls arriving from the earth. They considered it their own good fortune that these souls entered Vaikuṇṭha   and washed their feet and beautiful women received them with treasures, fragrant powder, the pürnakumbha and the lamp. Then these souls lived ( for ever) with the eternal sūris enjoying endless delights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereafter the self is led into the enchanting assembly in the hall (mantapa) set with gems. As has been said in these <em>śloka</em> s: &ldquo;I do not know how long I have spent my time in vain with this <em>prakṛti</em> being subject to her sway. How can I remain associated with this <em>prakṛti</em>, which takes the excellent forms (or bodies of the devās), the middling forms (or bodies of men) and the mean forms (or bodies which experience the pains of hell)? I will depart from her and give up all contact with her and attain <em>Bhagavān</em> who is free from all blemish. I will become one with Him and I will not be one with this non - sentient <em>prakṛti</em>. It is in the fitness of things that I should be one with Him and not with this <em>prakṛti</em>&rdquo;, and &ldquo;When shall &ldquo;I see, with my eyes, Keśava who is black as a cloud, whose eyes are broad and who is playing with Lakṣmī  in the gardens? and &ldquo;When shall we all see ŚrīRama with his complexion black as a cloud and with his long arms, - Kama who is firmly set in sattva, who has taken a staunch vow to protect those that seek his help and who is bent on relieving the sorrows of the world? Just as the rising sun dispels the darkness of the whole world, ŚrīRāma will dispel all our sorrow the moment we see him&rdquo; - as stated in these <em>śloka</em> s, the Lord reveals to the <em>mukta</em> His blissful form so that be may get rid of all his sorrows, enables him to acquire his essential nature (with the eight great qualities [:- freedom from sin, being without old age, without death, without sorrow, without hunger. without thirst, with all desired objects and with a will that meets with no hindrance.] ), takes him to His feet and by sāyujya with Himself - which means equal enjoyment - places him in the midst of His eternal servants (<em>nitya</em> süris) who enjoy eternal bliss and who (henceforth) are of the same class as he.</p>
<p>Then the Lord blesses him with the grant of all such services as were desired by him and as are agreeable to Himself, having previously removed all hindrances and enabled him to attain, his essential nature, in a manifest form, and without any limitations of place, time and circumstance, so that these services may last as long as his soul lasts. The Lord embraces the <em>mukta</em> who has arrived just now and treats him, without the slightest difference, in the same manner as He treats the sūris, who are eternally free from all imperfections and who are like friends of the same age among themselves and with the Lord. The Lord is immensely delighted at the bliss enjoyed by this eternal servant of His who is staunchly and exclusively devoted to Him, and who has attained the exalted position desired by Alavandar in his Stotram and by Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em> in his Vaikuṇṭha-gadyam. [ In the Stotram and the Gadyam ŚrīAlavandar and ŚrīRama nuja cry out, as it were, saying :- When shall I go to Vaikuṇṭha   and see the Lord face to face and be His devoted and eternal servant? ]</p>
<p>ARCHIRĀDI IS NOT THE ONLY ROUTE TO MOKSA  OR VAIKUṆṬHA. THERE ARE OTHER ROUTES AS WELL.</p>
<p>As in the case of such meditations as Madhu <em>Vidyā</em> which are the means of attaining <em>mokṣa</em>  after obtaining positions like those of the Vasus, “The pure&rdquo; quality of sattva makes the self attain Nārāyaṇa who is of the form of Aniruddha. The Lord who is of the pure nature of Aniruddha leads him himself to the Supreme <em>Vāsudeva</em> (<em>Para</em> <em>Vāsudeva</em>),&rdquo; and again: &ldquo;Know, O, best of Brahmins, that this is the truth. Those who have become free from puṇya apd <em>pāpa</em>, who are devoid of <em>karma</em> which is like fuel kindling the fire of <em>samsāra</em> and who walk along the route to the world of Viṣṇu  - to them the sun who dispels the darkness of all the world is said to be the doorway.&rdquo; &ldquo;This world is sustained by the sun. With their material body burnt up by the sun, they become invisible as they have no bodies and are of the nature of the soul which is atomic in size. They then enter the god Aniruddha. Having remained in the body of Aniruddha (for some time) and leaving it, they reach Pradyumna remaining now as only mind. Leaving Pradyumna, they enter into <em>Saṅkarṣaṇa</em> who is the deity presiding over _Jīva_s (abhimānidevatā). Along with them proceed those who have performed <em>Jñāna</em> Yoga and Karma <em>yoga</em>. Having become free from the three qualities (<em>sattvam</em>, rajas and tamas), they enter into the Supreme Being who is the abode of all, who resides within the Self and who is free from all imperfections. Know that <em>Vāsudeva</em> is the abode of all (vāsa) and that He is, in truth, immanent as antaryāmin in all. Those who have subjected themselves to spiritual disciplines, who have perfect control over their senses and who have attained peace of mind enter into <em>Vāsudeva</em>, considering Him as the only object of attainment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(As in the case of Madhu <em>Vidyā</em>) and in these passages cited from the Mahābhārata, it has also been stated that there is another route for muktas :&ndash; &ldquo;They go from here to Svetadvipa, and reach gari who has the Universe as His form. Then they reach Hari in the form of Aniruddha who is in the ocean of milk. From there they go to Pradyumna, who is the Lord of <em>Brahma</em> and of all others. Thence they proceed to <em>Saṅkarṣaṇa</em>, the eternal <em>Bhagavān</em>. To those who want to have, for ever, the bliss of <em>Brahman</em>, who have attained success in being staunchly and exclusively devoted to <em>Bhagavān</em> and who perform the worship of the Lord in the five different periods of the day &ndash; to them this is another path (leading to <em>mokṣa</em> ). In the section (devoted to <em>Pāñcarātra</em> in Śrī Bhāṣya, it is said also that &ldquo;those who attain <em>mukti</em> give up the worship of the incarnational form (<em>Vibhava</em>), proceed thence to the worship of the <em>Vyūha</em> and finally after the worship of the Vyūha, attain the Supreme Being called <em>Vāsudeva</em>.&rdquo; These refer to particular classes of those who attain <em>mukti</em>. Similarly certain specified routes are laid down for those who attain <em>mukti</em> after remaining for a while in the Satyaloka, the world of <em>Brahma</em>. These also apply to special cases such as krama <em>mukti</em> (release by gradation.) It is not our object to describe these differences in the routes to <em>mukti</em>, which are diverse for diverse souls, as their knowledge is prescribed only to the respective adhikāris.</p>
<p>THE MEDITATION ON THE ROUTE. HOW USEFUL</p>
<p>TO THE <em>PRAPANNA</em></p>
<p>To the man who has adopted <em>bhakti</em> or <em>upāsana</em> as his <em>upāya</em>, the meditation on the path to <em>mukti</em> has been prescribed as an <em>aṅga</em> to be performed daily. But to the man who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as the means, there is no such need. Still, at the time of adopting this <em>upāya</em>, since he should know what his goal is in order that he may be competent to adopt the <em>upāya</em>, the meditation may help to remember the supreme goal. It becomes an end in itself, as it produces a keen delight in knowing that, very soon, the supreme goal begged for at the time of <em>prapatti</em> will be attained. In this respect it is like counting the days before the ensuing wedding. The <em>prapanna</em> will attain the desired object even by a cursory knowledge (of the path) (though the details are not known to him.)</p>
<p>Of this meditation on the path to <em>mukti</em>, the state of Sītā is an example (of whom it is said):&ldquo;It looked as if Sītā was driving in the chariot of her mind drawn by her desires which were like fleet horses, towards ŚrīRama, the greatest of kings, who was aware of his nature that always insisted on protecting those that sought his help&rdquo;.</p>

<p>ENJOYMENT OF THE BLISS OF <em>BRAHMAN</em>. page274</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>वितमसि पदे लक्ष्मीकान्तं विचित्रविभूतिकं</p>
<p>सचिवगमितस्संपद्याविर्भवत्सहजाकृतिः ।</p>
<p>स्फुटतदपृथक्सिद्धिस्सिद्ध्यद्गुणाष्टकतत्फलो</p>
<p>भजति परमं साम्यं भोगे निवृत्तिकथोज्झितम् ॥ ४८ ॥</p>
<p>Led by his guides (archis and others) to the Lord of Lakṣmī  who is possessed of varied glories in the region beyond tamas (i e.) <em>prakṛti</em> and having attained Him, the <em>mukta</em> has his essential nature in full manifestation and realises his inseparable connection with the Lord and as a consequence, acquires the *eight attributes (of freedom from sin and the like. See page _____) and without any question of his returning again (to <em>samsāra</em> ), he attains, in regard to enjoyment, perfect resemblance to the Lord.</p>
<p>THE NATURE OF THE BLISS OF <em>BRAHMAN</em> :</p>
<p>If it is asked what is this full and perfect enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em> by the <em>mukta</em> who has traversed the path (described before), the answer is as follows:- He will in all places, at all times, and in all situations, have, for his unsurpassed joys, the supreme Ruler with His countless forms, attributes, glories and activities without missing any of them. This is thus described (in the following verse):&ndash; &ldquo;She will never, in the least, miss (the sight of) <em>Bhagavān</em> whose eyes are as beautiful as the lotus and who is the Lord of the world.&rdquo; (Since the Lord enjoys His own forms, attributes, glories and activities Himself), there is perfect similarity between the <em>mukta</em>&rsquo;s enjoyment and the Lord&rsquo;s. Therefore (the <em>śruti</em> s) speak of perfect similarity.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s <em>svarūpa</em> is delightful as may be seen from the following passages. &ldquo;He is all knowledge and all bliss&rdquo;. &ldquo;The attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em> is a remedy for the disease of (<em>samsāra</em>). It is of the nature of joy which is unsurpassed and confers joy on others. It is an end in itself and lasts forever&rdquo;. Other things are enjoyable in this way: If the king is the queen&rsquo;s joy, then all objects and instruments of his enjoyment as well as the places where he finds delight are alike, objects of joy to her. Similarly the <em>mukta</em> finds joy in all that pertains to the Lord. That the Supreme Ruler who has all forms, attributes and the like is an object of enjoyment is evident from the <em>śruti</em> s and the _smṛti_s. This idea has been expressed in the section on Bhima in the <em>Brahma</em> _Sūtra_s. The <em>svarūpa</em> of <em>Bhagavān</em> is called Paramapada, because it is the ultimate and supreme object of attainment being of unsurpassed agreeableness. Since the perfect enjoyment of the <em>svarūpa</em> of <em>Bhagavān</em> happens only after reaching a most delightful region far superior to all others, that region is also called Paramapada. The essential nature or <em>svarūpa</em> of the <em>Jīva</em>, which is the recipient of this joy in the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em> which is also among the glorious possessions (Vibhūtis) of the Lord and which has, for its attributes, <em>jñāna</em> and ānanda, is also (sometimes ) called Paramapada. Along with the others, these three have, in common, only the feature of being the object of attainment.</p>
<p>It has been said above that such things as <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s <em>svarūpa</em>, attributes and forms, the region of eternal glory (<em>nitya</em> vibhūti) which is constituted of pure <em>sattvam</em> and his own suurüpa are objects of delight to the <em>mukta</em>. It may be asked, “This may be true. But by sense perception (pratyaksha) and other sources of knowledge, the objects in this world of lilā <em>vibhūti</em> are found to be disagreeable and are declared by the _śāstra_s also to be things to be given up, How then could they viz. the objects in <em>līlā</em> vibhūti be objects of delight to the <em>mukta</em> ?&rdquo; The answer is as follows:&ndash;  There is nothing inconceivable in this. What appears disagreeable to the man suffering from (excess of) bile is felt as agreeable when the bile has decreased. Again when the prince is in the prison house it is disagreeable. But when the emperor is pleased to set him free and to place him by his own side to enjoy like- pleasures, the prison house may appear agreeable as a symbol of his father&rsquo;s glory, although it has not undergone any change. It is said in the Rāmāyana : &ndash;&quot; To be with you is <em>mokṣa</em> for me; to be without you is hell to me;&quot; again, &ldquo;To me living without ŚrīRāma, the great warrior, in the midst of these Rākṣasis, of what use is life, or wealth, or ornaments?&rdquo; In Tiruvoymozi 4-8 it is said :-&ldquo;As the Lord does not care for me, it would not at all matter if I lost all that I would otherwise prize highly, viz., my beauty, my mind, my modesty, the sheen of my complexion, my intelligence, my charm, my bracelets, my girdle, my body and my very life.&rdquo; As illustrated in the passages cited above, the objects of this world (<em>Līlā</em> <em>Vibhūti</em>), which appear disagreeable or only slightly agreeable, when the <em>jīva</em> is not blessed with union with the Lord, may appear supremely agreeable, when he has become a <em>mukta</em> enjoying without intermission (the bliss of) <em>Bhagavān</em>. There is nothing inconsistent in this. The same object may be disagreeable or only slightly agreeable to a man bound to <em>samsāra</em>, while to one released from the bondage of <em>karma</em>, it is agreeable. This is the nature ordained for them by the will of God.</p>
<p>That <em>Bhagavān</em>, the Lord of <em>Śrī</em>, who has, for his <em>prakāra</em> or mode, all things whose agreeableness is dependent on His will, is the goal of attainment is implicit in the words in the dative or fourth case (Nārāyaṇāya) in Tirumantra and in <em>Dvaya</em>. The service referred to before is the overflow of love born of the perfect enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em> and the _Bhāṣya_kāra has explained it in several places in the (<em>Śaraṇāgati</em> <em>Gadya</em> ).</p>
<p>FULL AND PERFECT ENJOYMENT OF BHAGAVĀN</p>
<p>OVERFLOWS INTO <em>KAIÑKARYA</em> OR SERVICE.</p>
<p>( It is said in the _śruti_s that the <em>mukta</em> eats whatever he wants and can create whichever relations he wants). The enjoyment of food in the state of <em>mukti</em> and the contact with relations and the like are not due to <em>karma</em>, whether puṇya or papa, but are dependent only on the will of the <em>mukta</em> which is (always ) in accordance with the will of <em>Bhagavān</em>. Therefore they are not the consequences or fruits of <em>karma</em>, but fall into the category of pure service which is the overflow of the perfect enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em>. Thus the ultimate goal of attainment is the full and perfect enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em> which extends also to those services that are desired by the <em>mukta</em>. When this experience has once been attained, it never afterwards ceases and this my be seen from the following passages :</p>
<p>“The place from which the man who has meditated on <em>Brahman</em> never returns- that place is attained by him (the <em>prapanna</em>)&quot;; again, “Those great souls who have attained the highest reach me and are never afterwards born in <em>samsāra</em>, which is the abode of suffering and is ever-ch_aṅgī_ng. All the worlds including that of <em>Brahma</em> are places, O Arjuna, from which souls return to <em>samsāra</em>. But the soul that has attained me, is, O Son of Kunti, never born again.&quot;, and further &ldquo;When the man who has become dissociated from all contact with <em>prakṛti</em> has seen <em>Brahman</em> who is the 26th real, he will never be born again, because he has attained all that has to be attained.&rdquo;, and also &ldquo;The heavenly bodies like the moon and the sun (the presiding deities that govern them) are born again in <em>samsāra</em> (after reaching their high positions). But those who meditate on <em>Bhagavān</em> with the <em>mantra</em><sup id="fnref:290"><a href="#fn:290" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">290</a></sup> * of twelve syllables never come back to <em>samsāra</em>.</p>
<p>Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya: with Om (or <em>aum</em>) preceding it.</p>
<p>(The same idea is evident also) in: &ldquo;If a man utters the words Namo Nārāyaṇa with hands folded over the head (i.e. performs <em>prapatti</em>) and then goes (by the shining path), he will not be allowed to return to the world of <em>samsāra</em>, even if he furnishes security for his return to <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em> &quot; and in other passages like this.(end of page 218)</p>
<p>Even if they come to <em>Līlā</em>-<em>vibhūti</em> (this world of ours) by their own will and pleasure which are of the form of service to the Lord, there will be no diminution of their enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em> and in this sense there will be no return to <em>samsāra</em>.</p>
<p>As regards these souls that attain this endless enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em>, it is not possible to say whether their last body is that of a deva, a man or other creatures. Even such beings as <em>Brahma</em> have to attain <em>mokṣa</em>. So also the great sages say : &ndash; “Even such others as the virtuous hunter who follow gruesome professions attain the goal owing to their practice of <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> in their previous birth, as may be seen from the instance of Sramani”</p>
<p>THERE ARE NO DEGREES OF BLISS AMONG THE MUKTAS:</p>
<p>The followers of Anandatirtha take into account the superiority or inferiority of _jīva_s in the state of the quest for <em>mukti</em> and maintain that, in accordance with these degrees of merit or demerit (while in the state of seeking <em>mukti</em>), there would be differences in enjoyment even after they have attained <em>mukti</em>. They have forgotten the passages in such authorities as the <em>śruti</em> which speak of perfect equality with the Supreme Being in regard to enjoyment (after release from bondage).</p>
<p>Some hold that, in accordance with defects in the observance of the prescribed code of conduct by the seeker after <em>mukti</em>, there would be diminution in the bliss enjoyed. Even admitting that their words deserve serious consideration as those of trust worthy authorities, they mean only this much that, in the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> which occurs before <em>mukti</em>, there would be degrees of joy. It is true that there may be delay or no delay in attaining release from bondage, but after release is (once) attained, there is no difference at all in the enjoyment of bliss (between muktas and muktas).</p>
<p>Some _jīva_s attain, ia such worlds as those of Viṣṇu , the privilege of living in the same world as Viṣṇu  (sālokya ), some _jīva_s attain proximity to the presence of Viṣṇu  (sāmipya ); some attain forms similar to that of Viṣṇu  (sārūpya): these, too, are sometimes called muktas by courtesy (upacāra), since they are very near the ultimate goal (but they are not really muktas in the true sense of the word). This idea is set forth in the following <em>śloka</em>  - &ldquo;Some live in the worlds of Viṣṇu ; others approach very near to Viṣṇu ; others, again, acquire forms resembling <em>Viṣṇu</em>&rsquo;s; yet others attain sayujya with Viṣṇu . This, alone, is called <em>mokṣa</em> .&rdquo; This <em>śloka</em>  declares that only sāyujya in Paramapada is <em>mokṣa</em> . In the same way as a hundred and the like are included within a thousand, sālokya and the like are included within sāyujya. The truth of this statement may be seen in the following <em>śloka</em>  : &ldquo;I do not at all&quot;A beg for <em>mokṣa</em>  which goes by the names of sālokya and sarūpya. I long, O Lord that hast taken a vow (to protect those that seek Thy help) - I long, O Thou with long arms, for sãyujya with Tbee.&rdquo; Sayujya means the relationship between two who are united in communion (sayuk). One might be sayuk with another, although only in the common enjoyment of a certain pleasure. Here in regard to the <em>mukta</em>, the object of enjoyment is <em>Brahman</em> with His prakāras or modes. Since <em>Brahman</em> and the <em>mukta</em> both commune with each other in the enjoyment of that bliss, the <em>mukta</em> is called sayuk (with <em>Brahman</em>).</p>
<p>In this connection, it may be asked why, in one of the passages of the Veda, the two words, sayujya and sārshtitha are employed (in the same sentence ), when they mean the same thing, namely, communion in the enjoyment (would it not be redundant to use two words when one would be enough?). The answer is (that there is a difference in meaning between the two words ), and it is as follows:</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>सायुज्यमुभयोरत्र भोक्तव्यस्याविशिष्टता ।</p>
<p>सार्ष्टिता तत्र भोगस्य तारतम्यविहीनता ॥</p>
<p>Sayujyam between the two (<em>Brahman</em> and the <em>mukta</em>) means that there is no difference so far as the objects of enjoyment are concerned : sārshtita (between the two) means that there is no difference in the degree or intensity of their enjoyment. (Two men may have before them the same object of enjoyment and yet one of them may enjoy it more intensely than the other).</p>
<p>It is true that the <em>mukta</em> has nothing to do with the work of creating, maintaining, destroying and such other things in regard to the world (Jagad Vyāpāra). But just as the father who cultivates the field and the sons and others who do not cultivate it enjoy alike the fruit from the cultivated field, <em>Iśvara</em> who is engaged in the work of the world (Jagad Vyāpāra ) and the <em>mukta</em> who only witnesses it have the same degree of enjoyment in the joy arising from that work. The author of the <em>Brahma</em> Sūtras has stated at the beginning of the section : &ldquo;(The &lsquo;<em>mukta</em>&rsquo;s enjoyment is ) exclusive of the work of the world&rdquo; and concludes it by saying:&rdquo; The resemblance or equality (sāmyam) between the <em>mukta</em> and <em>Brahman</em> is only so far as the enjoyment is concerned, as stated in the <em>śruti</em> s, and also by inference linga&rdquo;. Sakatayana has also stated as follows:- Those who meditate on <em>Brahman</em> say that sāyujyam consists in the sameness or equality of enjoyment&quot;.</p>
<p>REFUTATION OF THE ADVAITIC DOCTRINE OF</p>
<p>IDENTITY:</p>
<p>To those (viz. Advaitins) who maintain that the word Sayujyam, means oneness or identity with <em>Brahman</em> (aikyam), the derivative or etymological meaning of the word, sãyujyam, is at variance, as also the texts in the <em>śruti</em> [ Such śrutis as the following:-<em>Brahman</em> is the eternal among eternals, the sentient among sentients. (1) He is one and satisfies the desires of the many: Svetasvatara Upaniṣad. 2) Without any blemish or stain he attains perfect resemblance (paramam samyam).]  which declare that <em>Brahman</em> is different from the _jīva_s. Besides, their view is opposed also to the _śruti_s which declare that the <em>mukta</em> will attain perfect resemblance (sāmyam) to <em>Brahman</em> and that the <em>mukta</em> will be like <em>Brahman</em>. The author of the Gita has conveyed the same idea in :- &ldquo;They will attain my likeness (sādharmyam)&rdquo;:</p>
<p>The Maharshi (Vyāsa) has also expressed this idea at great length in the discourse between Vasiṣṭa and Karala and concludes by saying that this is the supreme truth - &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> released from bondage (i.e.) the <em>mukta</em>, attains the Supreme Being and acquires attributes similar to those of the Supreme Being. He too becomes free from all imperfections when he reaches Him. Having attained the Omniscient <em>Brahman</em>, he, too, becomes omniscient. Having reached Him who is free from the bondage of <em>karma</em>, he, too, becomes free from <em>karma</em>. Having attained <em>Bhagavān</em> who is free from suffering and sorrow, he, too, becomes free from them. Having reached Him who is blissful, he, too, becomes blissful. O best of Bharatas, having attained <em>Bhagavān</em> who acts by His will alone (without being influenced by <em>karma</em>), he, too, acts merely by his will. He becomes resplendent and having attained <em>Bhagavān</em> who is without the qualities (of <em>prakṛti</em>) he, too, is without those qualities. Having reached <em>Brahman</em> who is without the body and the senses constituted of matter (<em>Prakṛti</em>), he, too, becomes free from them. Having attained the Supreme Being who is independent of <em>karma</em>, he too, becomes independent. I have thus described the truth to you, O great king, just as it is in reality. Having accepted this teaching with a mind free from discontent (asuya), meditate on <em>Brahman</em> who is eternal and free from all imperfections and who is the (ultimate) cause of the world&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the passage cited above, the <em>mukta</em> is called &lsquo;independent&rsquo; (svatantra ), because he is free from the influence of past <em>karma</em>. The _Bhāṣya_kāra (Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em>) has explained the meaning of the word Svarat (literally the independent king) as being not subject to <em>karma</em>&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Thus since in the śrutis, the _smṛti_s and the sūtras, resemblance between the <em>mukta</em> and <em>Brahman</em> (sāmyam) is explicitly stated, those places in the texts which seem to speak of identity (aikyam) between the <em>mukta</em> and <em>Brahman</em> in the state of release from bondage have to be explained in a manner that would not be inconsistent with the <em>śruti</em> s which declare difference between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>Brahman</em>. The word aikyam or (identity ) in such passages should be construed in the same manner as in the <em>śloka</em>  : &ldquo;The aikyam between Rama and Sugrīva arose O, Lady, in this way.” (Here aikyam means friendship, identity not of self&rsquo;s but of interests).</p>
<p>If it were not construed in this way, it would be in conflict with thousands of authoritative passages like the following:&ndash;</p>
<p>(1) “When the person who is twice-born (dvija) sees that he is different from the Supreme Being and that the Supreme Being is different from himself, he becomes free from bondage and will see for ever (<em>Bhagavān</em> who is) the 26th real. The Supreme Being is one and the <em>jīva</em>&ndash; who is the 25th real - is another. Since the Supreme Being is within him (the <em>jīva</em>), good men call them one. The Supreme Being, O, king, is different from the <em>jīva</em>, and the <em>jīva</em>, who is the 25th real, is different from the 24 reals. Therefore good men do not consider the <em>jīva</em>, who is the 25th real, as being identical with the Supreme Being. So in dread of birth and death, they perform, O Kasyapa, <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em>, acquire thereby purity of mind, and then perform <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em>, and then meditate on the Supreme Being as the supreme object of attainment.</p>
<p>(2) <em>Puruṣottama</em> is different from both the <em>baddha</em> and <em>mukta</em>. He is called the Supreme Being.</p>
<p>(3) He who is within the <em>jīva</em> as his Inner Ruler &ndash; He is eternal: He is free from the qualities of <em>prakṛti</em>: He should be known as Nārāyaṇa: He is the soul of all and is called Purusha by the Vedas. The consequences of past <em>karma</em> do not cling to Him, in the same way as water does not cling to the leaf of the lotus. The <em>jīva</em> who is inferior to the Supreme Being becomes subject to bondage owing to past <em>karma</em> and attains <em>mokṣa</em>  by meditating on <em>Brahman</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(4) &ldquo;Just as fire in a ball of (red-hot) iron seems to be one with the iron, though it is really different from it, so the Supreme Being pervades the world and is inseparable from it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Therefore the perfect resemblance of the <em>jīva</em> (parama samyam) (to <em>Brahman</em>) is only that arising from <em>jñāna</em> and bhoga (enjoyment) and the like. <em>Iśvara</em> has, for His definition, the following attributes which are like the umbrella and the chamara (insignia of royalty):&ndash; being the cause of the world, the conferring of <em>mokṣa</em>  on _jīva_s, being the support of the world, being the controller of the world, the one for whom all things and all sentient beings exist, the one who has everything for His body, the one who is denoted by all words, the one who can be understood from all the Vedas, the one who is the refuge of all the world, the one who should be adored by all those who want <em>mokṣa</em> , the one who grants the fruits (of all actions), the one whose essential nature is omnipresence, <em>Jñāna</em> and ānanda (bliss), the one who is the spouse of Laksh mi. These are peculiar to Him and are His distinctive features. The <em>mukta</em>&rsquo;s distinctive attributes are the following : being sustained (by <em>Iśvara</em>); being controlled by Him, existing only for the Lord (_śeṣa_tva), being atomic (anu) and such others.</p>
<p>THE MUKTA WILL NEVER BE IN <em>SAMSĀRA</em> AGAIN :</p>
<p>If it be so, it may be asked whether the <em>mukta</em>  who is not independent (of God) may not, for some reason or other, incur the possibility of a return to <em>samsāra</em>. The <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s dependence on Iswars has been stated in the <em>śloka</em>  :-“For enabling a man to get the good things of life, and for taking away from him the ills of life, there is no one other than <em>Puruṣottama</em> who is competent &lsquo;&rsquo;. The answer to that question is, &ldquo;There will be no such possibility, for has He not Himself declared :- &ldquo;Those who perform <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> with great devotion and those who have performed <em>prapatti</em> which is considered as a superior form of penance (tapas) will obtain sāyujya and will for ever render service to me. They will always be free from the ills of <em>samsāra</em>&rdquo;. Ever in the state of desire for <em>mukti</em>, the <em>mukta</em> had an aversion to the enjoyment of non-sentient things (matter) and also to the mere enjoyment of his own self (kaivalya). This aversion is now well established in him; for as he sees all things having <em>Brahman</em> as their inner self, there is no possibility of his enjoying his own self as separate (from everything else), and as he sees by constant perception (pratyaksha ) the imperfections of all other objects (than God), there is no possibility of his returning to <em>samsāra</em> of his own free will. As his knowledge of the three <em>tattva_s, <em>cit</em>. <em>acit</em> and <em>Iśvara</em> and of what is good and what is evil, which he acquired before, has now attained expansion without any break or contraction, there is no possibility of his ever going back to <em>samsāra</em> owing to a_jñāna</em> or ignorance. The knowledge which formerly in <em>samsāra</em> deepened into the form of love called <em>bhakti</em> and which he acquired by his distinctive knowledge of the specific nature of <em>Bhagavān</em> has, now, in the state of <em>mukti</em>, become ripened into the form of supreme love, because he has now a vision of all aspects of <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s distinctive nature of which even the śāstra s are incapable. Therefore <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s great love for him as stated in the <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;The jnanī is dear to me (How dear he is to me cannot be described even by me, Omniscient though I am)&rdquo; - <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s love for himna is so overwhelming that its flow is irresistible and that its current reaches even those uplands which are connected with him only in distant relationship. Therefore it cannot be stated that, though he is free from <em>karma</em>, there is the possibility of his returning to <em>samsāra</em> by the will of <em>Iśvara</em> who is independent (and all-powerful). Since the <em>mukta</em> is no longer subject to the injunctions of śāstra , there is no possibility of his violating the Lord&rsquo;s command in the state of <em>mukti</em>. He cannot do anything opposed to the will of <em>Iśvara</em> as the Lord&rsquo;s pleasure is now his pleasure. Therefore the ultimate goal or attainment called <em>mokṣa</em> , which is of the nature of perfect and full enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em> and which extends into service, has now become eternal for him (i.e.) it will last as long as his soul lasts. Considering all this, the Sitra-kāra said: &ldquo;There is no return (to <em>samsāra</em>) - no return, for the Scripture says so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>APPENDIX ( Chapter V Page 65 )</p>
<p>THE VISĀKHASTAMBHA AS DESCRIBED IN THE SATVATA SAMHITĀ AND</p>
<p>THE <em>LAKṣMĪ</em>  TANTRA.</p>
<p>In the region of eternal glory (<em>nitya</em> <em>vibhūti</em>), there is a huge column constituted of _śuddhasattva_m. It is a special form in which <em>Bhagavān</em> appears there. This column or pillar is called Visakha yoopa. The column consists of four parts called, respectively, jāgrat, (the waking state ), svapna (the dream ), <em>suṣupti</em> (dreamless sleep) and turīya (the fourth stage, counting from below upwards). In the part called jāgratsthana, which is somewhere above the base of the column, there are four divine forms on the four sides called, respectively, <em>Vāsudeva</em>, <em>Saṅkarṣaṇa</em>, Pradyumna and Aniruddha facing the east, the south the west and the north and shining like branches around that part of the column. This collection of four forms is called Jāgratvyuha. The activity of this vynha is the creation, maintenance and destruction of the world. The four forms are bright in colours, white, red and the like. They have also arms or weapons. Above this part of the column is the part called svapnasthāna. Here, too, there are four divine forms <em>Vāsudeva</em>, Sankarshna, Pradyumna and Aniruddha shining like branches, as before, to the east, the south, the west and the north. This collection of four vyuhas in the second part of the column from below is called svapnavyuha. These four forms have no activities like creation and maintenance, but have only the will to do so. Their colours, too, are not so bright as those of the lower <em>vyūha</em>. They have weapons but no banners and other accessories. Above the svapnasthana, which is the second part from below, is the third part or sthāna called sushuptisthāna. Here too there are four divine forms with the same aan es as in the two other parts already described and in the same order. This collection of four forms is called sushuptivyuha. These forms have neither activities nor even the will or the desire to act. They have just the experience of their owa bliss and nothing else. In the form of <em>Vāsudeva</em> which is like å branch of the column shooting on the eastern side, there is no such thing as a body with limbs and the like and it shines with all the six qualities. The other three forms, <em>Saṅkarṣaṇa</em> and the like on the other three sides have a body with hands, feet and the like. But they have no weapons; on the palms they bear lines resembling the conch, and the weapons. These forms have no colours. The uppermost or fourth part of the column (Turīya sthāna) has also similar four forms with the same names as in the former parts. This collection of four is the Turīya vyūha. They have no bodies with limbs and the like but resemble the <em>Vāsudeva</em> form of the <em>suṣupti</em> <em>vyūha</em>. They have no activities, no will, no weapons and no lines on the palm resembling arms. All the six qualities shine in the form called <em>Vāsudeva</em> and the other three have, each, only two of these qualities. The names jāgrat, svapna, <em>suṣupti</em> and turīya are given to them on the analogy of these states in man in the ordinary world, according to the greater or the lesser activity found in each. The turīya state is like that in a swoon when even the breath is suspended, whereas in the <em>suṣupti</em> state, the man just breathes in or breathes out; in the svapna, his external senses cease to act, only the mind is active, in the jāgrat state, both the mind and the external senses act.</p>
<p>These four parts with four vyūhas in each correspond to the four stages of development that may be found in the worshipper who meditates on them. On the lowest stage of meditation, there is no full control of the external senses and the mind; in the second stage of development, control of the external senses has been attained but not of the mind; in the next stage, the mind, too, has been controlled and the man who meditates is seen just breathing in and breathing out with no other activity or sign of life; in the last or perfect development of meditation, he is like one in a swoon, not even breathing in or out:</p>

<p>The Supreme Person who knows all things, at the same time, by direct perception (pratyaksha) and without any aid or instrument (in the form of sense organs), who is the boundless and divine ocean of mercy, protects the world, with the daughter of the ocean (Lakṣmī ), being omnipotent. Having accepted the responsibility of saving those who follow the right path, He is the <em>upāya</em> <sup id="fnref:292"><a href="#fn:292" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">292</a></sup> that is already existent.</p>
<p>By <em>Siddhopāya</em>, the author means <em>Bhagavān</em> who is the <em>upāya</em> already existent for those who perform <em>prapatti</em>. By <em>Sādhyopāya</em> he means such _upāya_s or means as <em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em> which socure the Lord&rsquo;s favour so that He may act as the <em>Siddhopāya</em>.</p>
<p>RECAPITULATION OF THE CONTENTS OF</p>
<p>THE FIRST PART:</p>
<p>We have already described below how the <em>jīva</em> ( Kṣetrajña), who has been wandering in <em>samsāra</em> from beginningless time, becomes averse to it by the mercy of God which is awaiting an opportunity (to help him), how he understands from the right _śāstra_s (the truth about ) the _tattva_s, the means or <em>upāya</em> and the ultimate goal or aim of life, and how he becomes eager to attain <em>mokṣa</em> . (We have already described,) how he adopts ( owing to this desire for <em>mokṣa</em>  ) an <em>upāya</em> or means (<em>bhakti</em> or <em>prapatti</em>) which is in accord with his fitness or competency, how he thereby does what should be done, how, having realised his state as a <em>prapanna</em> or <em>bhakta</em>, he renders faultless service in accordance with that state and in accordance with the s&rsquo;astras, for the remaining term of his life here. (We have already described,) how, after the fall of the body, he reaches a region free from the touch of matter (<em>prakṛti</em>) by journeying along the shining path beginning with archis and bow he attains there the supreme end, namely perfect service which is the overflow of the unlimited enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em>.</p>
<p>THREE CAUSES BY WHICH THE LORD&rsquo;S</p>
<p>GRACE IS WON:</p>
<p>There are three main causes for the removal of the will of the Lord imposed on men as a punishment for past sins, owing to which the _jīva_s who are subject to the sway of past <em>karma</em> have no clear knowledge concerning the <em>upāya</em> that is already existent (namely <em>Bhagavān</em>), the <em>upāya</em> by which His favour is secured (<em>Sādhyopāya</em>) and also the potency of these <em>upāya_s. They are as follows:- One is the speech that comes from the lips of Lakṣmī : If one asks, “May this <em>Śaraṇāgati</em> by mine!&rdquo; Her reply is &ldquo;Let it be yours; everything will be obtained by it alone.&rdquo; Next is the grace of the good_ācārya</em> and the third is the observance of the tradition of the righteous. The means (<em>vyāja</em>) by which the grace of the good <em>ācārya</em>  can be secured and the benefits arising therefrom may be understood from the episodes of <sup id="fnref:293"><a href="#fn:293" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">293</a></sup> Parāśara, Maitreya, Sañjaya, Aśvalāyana and others.</p>
<p>By the advice of Vasiṣṭa, Parāśara put a stop to the performance of a satra (sacrifice) which was aimed at the destruction of Rākṣasas. Pleased with this, Vasiṣṭa and Pulastya blessed him for his forbearance with a knowledge of the _śāstra_s and with the gifts necessary for the composition of a purāṇa. Maitreya studied the Vedas, the <em>dharma</em> śāstra s and the Ved_aṅga_s from his <em>guru</em> and, by his grace, obtained a knowledge of Vedānta  by which he realised how the origin, maintenance and destruction of the world occur and how there is nothing other than Viṣṇu .</p>
<p>Sañjaya says:- &ldquo;By the grace of Vyāsa, I listened to this supreme Yoga, the most secret of all, from Kṛṣṇa Himself the Lord of all Yogas&rdquo;. Aśvalāyana learnt the Rig Veda by his devotion to Śaunaka.</p>
<p>The observance of the tradition of the righteous consists in this :&ndash;</p>
<p>Full of the quality of sattva, and entering his career of discipleship in the right manner and with perfect attention and concentra. tion of mind, one should learn from the good <em>ācārya</em>  who is without any expectation of renown, wealth or honours and who is under the sway of compassion, the truths concerning the _tattva_s and the means or <em>hita</em>, which have come down in regular succession to the present day from the Lord of All, who is the first <em>ācārya</em> of all. While imparting instruction, there should be no unnecessary elaboration and no skipping over points that require clear exposition. The instruction received is such as follows:- Madhava (the Lord of Lakṣmī ) is both the father and the mother of all the worlds. O, best of men, seek refuge under that Saviour by <em>śaraṇāgati</em>&quot;. To those who are faithful and pious but who are not competent to enter on the difficult study of the _śāstra_s, which might, owing to their difficulty, unsettle the wind, this instruction by the <em>guru</em> is alone important. To others, the study of the _śāstra_s with the proper exercise of reason is legitimate for their own clear understanding and for convincing those who are deluded by the specious arguments (of rival thinkers ).</p>
<p>FORMS OF INFIDELITY:</p>
<p>It has been said, &ldquo;He who understands <em>dharma</em> prescribed in the Vedas and the _smṛti_s with the help of arguments not opposed (to the spirit of) the Vedas and stāstras - he alone knows <em>dharma</em>, and not others.&rdquo; Those who have not understood <em>dharma</em> by the proper exercise of reason will become rationalistic (and sceptical) and will misinterpret the true meaning with specious arguments inconsistent with the Vedas; it has been stated that &ldquo;by the followers of Kanada (Vaiseshika logicians), the followers of Sakya (Buddhists ) and the heretics, the <em>dharma</em> ordained in the Vedas has disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This misinterpretation or denial is of two kinds&mdash; that concerning the glorious possessions (vibhūti) and that concerning the One who possesses these glories. That concerning the One who possesses the glories consists in denying the existence of the Supreme Ruler, the Lord of Lakṣmī , or declaring some other deity as the Supreme Ruler and relegating the real Supreme Ruler to the category of His possessions (<em>vibhūti</em>). The misconception or misinterpretation concerning the glories consists in this : denying the existence of these glories (or objects created by God) or considering these vibhūtis as existing but as independent of the Lord by denying their relationship to Him, or declaring that they are dependent on oneself or others,</p>
<p>ASSOCIATION WITH WICKED MEN SHOULD BE</p>
<p>AVOIDED:</p>
<p>Any one of these forms of denial might occur in the case of a weak-minded man who has performed <em>prapatti</em>, on account of association with those who are not fit to be associated with If such a misconception should occur, it is worse &ldquo;than the great sin of taking back a thing that has been given away (to charity)&rdquo;. That sin will deprive a man of the merit acquired by all previous gifts made from the time of birth onwards. Bat this is worse, for the object of the gift was itself acquired by stealth from the person to whom it was given later, and then the person is robbed of what was given to him. Therefore, of the many causes of delusion, association with rationalists (and sceptics) is most to be avoided. This has been declared in passages like the following:</p>
<p>“These who are heretics opposed to the Vedas, those who do things forbidden in the _śāstra_s, those who are like cats (deceiving others ), sceptics, rationalists who depend only on reason, those who are like cranes ( ever injuring others who are near them) - these should never be honoured even with words &ldquo;; so it is said also:-&ldquo;A man  #suffering from starvation may beg money of a king, of his own pupil, and of the men whom he has helped to perform a sacrifice ( yajna); But one should never beg of those who are dissemblers, rationalists, heretics and men with the nature of cranes.&rdquo; Again, “One should associate with good men (i.e. men who know God.) Whether in dispute or friendship, one should associate only with them; one should never do any of these things with the wicked (those who do not believe in God), “Give up the company of the wicked; associate ever with the good; do whatever is righteous, both in the day and in the night, remember always that you yourself and those who are related to you are not immortal.” And again, &ldquo;Far better is it to dwell in à cage of flaming fire than to commit the crime of dwelling with sceptics, who do not countenance any thought of <em>Śaurī</em> (<em>Bhagavān</em>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conversation with rationalists makes men foolish in spite of their seeing, &lsquo;as their knowledge is lost by specious reasoning.&rsquo; (this association with rationalists ) removes men from every one of the four classes which <em>Iśvara</em> calls His own, in the <em>śloka</em>  : “My &ldquo;people&rdquo; are of four classes and they are all known to be my bhaktas.&rdquo; It would take them away from the group of men whom Śrī Raṅganātha calls &ldquo;lads who are worthy of His love.&rdquo; It would throw them into the midst of those who are outside the range of <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s love as declared in: &quot; There are wicked men who do not seek my protection by performing <em>prapatti</em>; they are of four classes : fools, men who are vile, men who have lost their knowledge by specious reasoning and men who are of the nature of the Asuras.&quot;</p>
<p>Even men with supreme faith that have sought the protection of the Supreme Ruler who is the Saviour of those that have no one to protect them - even they<sup id="fnref:294"><a href="#fn:294" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">294</a></sup> , we know. become deluded by association with others; though they are not cast away, they have afterwards to be corrected by good _ācārya_s.</p>
<p>Embar became subject to misconceptions owing to his association with Yādavaprakāśa and had to be corrected by Peria Tirumalai Nambi.</p>
<p>Have not the great sages declared :- &ldquo;If there were only one <em>śāstra</em>, it would be possible to acquire knowledge free from doubts. Because there are many _śāstra_s in this world, it is exceedingly difficult to obtain knowledge that is true&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;The Lord &quot; dwells in all who are free from doubt. The Lord of Lakṣmī  never dwells with those who are full of doubt owing to the exercise of free thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is true that it has been stated: &ldquo;In those  who have <em>bhakti</em> to <em>Puruṣottama</em>, there is no anger, no hatred, no covetousness nor impure minds&rdquo;, but this is applicable only to those individuals who are perfect in the possession of spiritual qualities. In the case of those who have yet to ascend to that high spiritual level, it is well-known that their minds may become deluded. Thus it has been said &ldquo;We hear that the gods (devas), in dread of the diminution of <em>samsāra</em> among those who are devoted to Govinda, become their enemies, (i.e. try to hinder devotion)&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;To &ldquo;truthfulness in speech, there are a hundred hindrances; to tapas or the performance of austerities, the hindrances are a thousand; and <em>bhakti</em> to Govinda meets with ten thousand hindrances&rdquo;. Here we will first speak of the doubts (or misconceptions) that are likely to arise in regard to <em>Siddhopāya</em>, the <em>upāya</em>, namely <em>Bhagavān</em>, that is already existent and consider the way in which these doubts may be cleared.</p>
<p>( HEREAFTER THE AUTHOR STATES POSSIBLE DOUBTS AND MISCONCEPTIONS AND TRIES TO REMOVE THEM ):</p>
<p>Doubt (1):- No <em>upāya</em> is necessary on the part of the <em>jīva</em> :</p>
<p>(1) <em>Iśvara</em> who ignored a man from beginningless time has now  concerned Himself with him (for his protection ). This is not due to any action or work on the man&rsquo;s part, but only to the Lord&rsquo;s omnipotence. If it is not so, how is it that when the Alvar asked &ldquo;The Lord has now made me realise Him and placed Himself within me. Why is it that He allowed me formerly to stray from Him?,&rdquo; no reply was given except that &ldquo;the cloud which adorned the measureless sky thundered in music&rdquo;. The implication is that there is no answer to this question except that it was the Lord&rsquo;s will to do so. Therefore why should we perform or adopt any <em>upāya</em> (for securing His protection)? Some say, therefore, that, of His own accord, and at the time when He chooses, the Lord saves us and that the Lord bestows His grace on His servants and protects them when He is pleased to do so and that no endeavour of any kind is incumbent on us.</p>
<p>This doubt may be cleared as follows :- Although <em>Iśvara</em> is omnipotent, He makes the man adopt some gesture, some means (<em>vyāja</em>) or pretext on his part and, in consideration of it, protects him in order that the faults of partiality and cruelty (vaiṣamya, nāirghṛṇya) may not stain Him. The Alwar himself has declared this truth in :-&ldquo;I said Tirumalirunjolai&rdquo; and immediately, the Lord of Lakṣmī  filled my mind with His presence.&rdquo; (The <em>Vyāja</em>, endeavour, or gesture, here, is the utterance of the word Tirumalirunjolai by the Alwar). It may be asked &ldquo;This <em>vyāja</em>, too, is adopted by the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Why did He not make the person adopt it before ?&rdquo; The answer is as follows:- The souls of men have streams of <em>karma</em> flowing from beginningless time. These streams of past <em>karma</em> produce their respective consequences at different times and <em>Iśvara</em> has to bestow, on each individual, the rewards or punishments that are in accordance with such <em>karma</em>. If He were to do otherwise, He would be tainted with partiality (and injustice). <em>Iśvara</em> did not make the person adopt the <em>vyāja</em> before, as the time for the ripening of the fruit of the <em>karma</em> had not yet come. Therefore, from the effect we have to infer the cause, as stated above. If this view be not accepted, no follower of any system will be able to answer the question why a person acquires ( at a certain time) such things as eagerness for <em>mokṣa</em>  which did not exist before. That these are due to the varied nature of the streams of beginningless <em>karma</em> is the common explanation for both those who believe in <em>Iśvara</em> and those who do not. <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s independence and omnipotence consist in His determination to protect the <em>jīva</em> when He chooses to do so, on the adoption of a <em>vyāja</em> or some form of <em>upāya</em> (endeavour) (or even an apology for <em>upāya</em> ) and in there being no power to prevent Him from doing so.</p>
<p>If this is so, it may be asked how we are to explain the verse of the Alvar cited before, when be put the question why the Lord did not choose to save him before and received an answer and also the texts according to which the Lord is the unconditional Saviour: Our answer is as follows:&ndash;The Alvar attaches great importance to <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s omnipotence and compassion and ignores the <em>vyāja</em> or _vyāja_s adopted by himself, by which special means he secured the Lord&rsquo;s compassion, when he says. &ldquo;For Thy neglect of me in former times and for taking me into Thy favour at present, I see no prominent causes other than Thy omnipotence and compassion. But, if owing to Thy omniscience, Thou hast seen any such cause, favour me with a knowledge of it&rdquo;. The Lord gave no reply and thereby the Alvar revealed to the world that the primary or prominent causes were only His omnipotence and compassion. This does not mean that there was no subsidiary cause or <em>vyāja</em> on the part of the Alvar. From this it follows that the primary cause for making the <em>jīva</em> an instrument of His <em>Līlā</em> is His omnipotence (svātantryam) and the subsidiary cause thereof is violation of the command of the omnipotent Lord which has been flowing like a stream from beginningless time. Now the primary cause for making the <em>jīva</em> an instrument of His bhoga (in Paramapada) is the Lord&rsquo;s natural compassion. The subsidiary cause (sahakāri kāraṇa ) is the <em>vyāja</em> (<em>bhakti</em> or <em>prapatti</em>) which extinguishes the Lord&rsquo;s punishment (hitherto) acting as a hindrance or obstacle. <em>Bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em> which are adopted as <em>vyāja</em> to secure <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s favour, are, themselves, the result of His compassion due to special acts of merit. These reveal <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s omnipotent and compassionate nature. The <em>prapanna</em> should bear in mind this attribute of the Lord, His being free from partiality and cruelty (vaiṣamya and nairghṛṇya) and bondage and <em>mokṣa</em>  being dependent on the violation of His command and the adoption of the <em>vyāja</em>, respectively, as they are all based on _pramāṇa_s. Thus it becomes his duty to lead the life of staunch and exclusive devotion with firm faith in the compassion of the omnipotent. This is the (real) meaning,</p>
<p>The omnipotence of one who has no compassion is dangerous to others; the compassion of one who is not omnipotent is not helpful to others and may also cause pain to the one who feels compassion. But the compassion of a person who is also omnipotent can accomplish whatever is desired and will bring delight to him and be the cause of immediately relieving the distress of those who seek his help and of giving them what they long for.</p>
<p>In regard to incarnations, it has been said, &ldquo;In the distresses of men, ŚrīRāma is greatly distressed&rdquo;. (It may be asked how this distress can be reconciled with the delight spoken of above ).</p>
<p>It means only this: that this distress is only  in order to give delight to those who are worthy of His grace. In the case of wicked men with the nature of Asuras, the distress assumed by the avatār is to make the evil-doer become deluded into thinking that he is not <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s incarnation. The great sages have declared the truth of what has been said so far in the following _śloka_s: &ldquo;It is <em>Bhagavān</em> alone that rules over time and death over those that move and those that do not move. I am stating the truth to you; the Lord of all the worlds, though possessed of omnipotence and omniscience, begins to act (during incarnations ), as if He were only a weak tiller of the soil. In this way, by His association with wonderful powers, He deludes the world, bat those who seek refuge under Him are never deluded&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who had large eyes, removed the burden off the earth, deluded the whole world and has now gone back to His own abode,&rdquo; and again &ldquo;He imitates the actions of those who have the bodies of men, but the <em>līlā</em> of the Lord of the world is dependent only on His will&rdquo;. Therefore in the stories of the avatārs or incarnations, the distress is only of the nature of play.acting and that, too, has compassion as its cause. It is of the nature of lilā or sport to the Omnipotent. Have we not seen hunchbacks and dwarfs often taken into protection by kings who do not expect any return from them? It is a matter of <em>līlā</em> or play to them and, at the same time, the consequence of compassion. That is why it is said, &ldquo;The Upaniṣads  state that the Lord of Śrī creates, maintains, controls and does such other things in regard to sentient and non-sentient things, only for His own sake. It is therefore, O, Lord of <em>Śrī_r_aṅga</em>, Thy nature to be the means of salvation (<em>upāya</em> ) for the <em>jīva</em> and also the object of attainment. Therefore I seek Thee as my <em>upāya</em> without any thought of my own interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since <em>Bhagavān</em> is the seat of the activity for the good of others, He is the Saviour of those who seek refuge under Him and since He places Himself in the place of other _upāya_s (like <em>parābhakti</em>) (in order to protect them), He is also the <em>upāya</em>. Since He is the seat of the fruit of the activity of protecting (namely, His delight), He is the <em>śeṣī</em>  and consequently the object of attainment. That His being all this is due to His essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) is understood from the _pramāṇa_s or authorities which help us to know Him, Of the principal qualities of <em>Iśvara</em>, such as <em>jñāna</em> (knowledge) <em>śakti</em> or power and compassion, knowledge and power are qualities which come into play for both punishment and favour, whereas compassion comes into play (only) in conferring favours. Compassion, here, means, the inclination to do good to others. <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s compassion comes into play in all the following in the creation and sustenance of the three kinds of sentient beings (<em>baddha</em>, <em>mukta</em> and <em>nitya</em>), in keeping them in activities pleasing to the Lord, in the eternal enjoyment of the eternal sūris, in seeing that those who have obtained release from bondage do not return to <em>samsāra</em>, in the creation of all things (like mahat, ahankāra, tanmātras, etc) in lilā <em>vibhūti</em> (i.e.) in this world, in the pure creation called His avatār untainted with matter, in propagating a knowledge of the _śāstra_s and in causing through them a knowledge of the _tattva_s and of the means of attaining <em>mukti</em>, in creating an eagerness for <em>mokṣa</em> , in enabling a person to do meritorious actions which would become the <em>vyāja</em> or <em>upāya</em> for causing the eagerness for <em>mokṣa</em> , in prescribing _upāya_s suited to the nature of each individual for wiping out the punishment for violation of His commands, in being accessory to the mind being prompted to adopt the <em>upāya</em>, in removing any obstacles that might stand in the way of the man who has adopted <em>bhakti</em> as the <em>upāya</em> (upāsaka) in standing, in the case of those who are destitute of other _upāya_s (1.6.) prapannas, in the place of these _upāya_s and protecting them from all danger, in ignoring countless offences of a serious nature committed by the <em>jīva</em> from beginningless time, by being gracious to him on account of the <em>vyāja</em> or <em>upāya</em> performed by him and releasing him from <em>samsāra</em> so that he may enjoy endless bliss, in bestowing <em>mokṣa</em></p>
<p>immediately on those prapannas who are impatient of delay, and, in the case of those prapannas who are not impatient of delay and who have forgotten to beg for a life free from sin (after <em>prapatti</em>), in creating repentance for any offences committed by them owing to past <em>karma</em> which has begun to operate (prārabdha ) and inducing the person to perform the necessary <em>prāyaścitta</em> or expiation suited to his competency; in the case of those who are too hard-hearted to perform <em>prāyaścitta</em>, in preventing their entrance into the world of Yama and loss of the benefit begged for by them by seeing that they are punished for these offences (committed after <em>prapatti</em>) in this life itself with sufferings (like blindness and lameness ) - in all these the Lord&rsquo;s compassion is the principal and common cause.</p>
<p><em>Iśvara</em>, who is endowed with compassion as described above, is called <em>Siddhopāya</em> or the <em>upāya</em> that is already existent; thus it is said:- “Those Brahmins who know the first part of the Veda and those who know the latter part of it, which treats of the Supreme Being - they state that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the eternal <em>dharma</em> (i.e.) the <em>upāya</em> that always exists. <em>Bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em>, which are adopted as the means for making Him gracious are called _Sādhyopāya_s (i.e.) _upāya_s to be adopted for securing His grace.</p>
<p>THE CONTENTION THAT THERE IS NO INJUNCTION</p>
<p>TO PERFORM <em>PRAPATTI</em> AS AN <em>UPĀYA</em>:</p>
<p>(2) The injunction to perform <em>prapatti</em> is contained in the words, &ldquo;Seek refuge under me alone&rdquo;. Some say that it is not an injunction to perform <em>prapatti</em> and that this <em>prapatti</em> should be considered as an attribute of the person specified. We answer as follows :&ndash; This attribute cannot be held as that of the person so concerned or qualified, as it does not satisfy the definition of an adjectival attribute<sup id="fnref:295"><a href="#fn:295" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">295</a></sup> . This statement is therefore contrary to pramâna or authority. If this were not so, while <em>Iśvara</em> is the <em>upāya</em> for <em>bhakti</em>, the _śāstra_s which prescribe certain forms of meditation and the like might also be considered as speaking of the attributes of the person concerned and not actions to be performed.</p>
<p>He who desires <em>svarga</em> should perform the Jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice&quot;. Here, who desires <em>svarga</em> is an attribute or adjective of the person and the injunction is that he should perform the sacrifice. In Mam Ekam Saranam Vraja, the <em>prapatti</em> has to be performed after hearing the <em>vidhi</em> or in junction; it did not exist before, like the desire for <em>svarga</em> in the example cited. Therefore, it is not an attribute; besides vraja is a verb that prescribes an action.</p>
<p>THE ROLE OF <em>SIDDHOPĀYA</em> AND <em>SĀDHYOPĀYA</em></p>
<p>(3) Therefore the exaggerated statement of some that <em>prapatti</em> is not an <em>upāya</em> is only to be taken as stressing the importance of <em>Siddhopāya</em> (i.e.) <em>Iśvara</em> who is the existent <em>upāya</em> (and not to state that <em>prapatti</em> is not an <em>upāya</em> ). <em>Siddhopāya</em> is of prime importance, because if, by proper propitiation, the punishment of the Lord is cancelled, it becomes helpful for the enjoyment or experience (of <em>Bhagavān</em>) which is natural to the Self (in its purity). If it is asked how this happens, the answer is as follows:&ndash; When the gem is cleansed of the dust (enveloping it), it shines with a natural radiance, but this natural radiance is due only to the will of <em>Iśvara</em> that ordains its having radiance. So also the expansion of knowledge and other attributes which the <em>mukta</em> acquires are due to the will of <em>Iśvara</em>, which ordains them. Likewise, in the case of the eternal süris (their eternal possession of certain attributes is due to the eternal will of the Lord). Learned men expressed this idea briefly in the <em>śloka</em>  : &ldquo;All things have their being in accordance with Thy will; among them some are ever pleasing to Thee; they are eternal; Thy noble attributes which are, by nature, subject to Thee illustrate this truth to us&rdquo;. Therefore, though <em>Siddhopāya</em> or <em>Iśvara</em> who is the existent <em>upāya</em> is all-important, the means of obtaining His grace, otherwise called <em>Sādhyopāya</em>, has also to be adopted. This is not at variance with the statements of former _ācārya_s as seen in Tiruvaymoli (10-8-9), cited before.</p>
<p>The <em>śloka</em>  which says: &ldquo;The Lord who took the necessary means or <em>upāya</em> for making me live, while yet in my mother&rsquo;s womb - is He now asleep or is He now dead in regard to the means to be adopted for making me live after being born ?&rdquo; - this is sometimes quoted in support of the statement that the Lord is alone the <em>upāya</em> and that the <em>jīva</em> has to do nothing at all by way of <em>upāya</em> or <em>vyāja</em>. It should be taken only as meaning that we should not seek any other protector (and not to forbid man from any form of endeavour). Otherwise one will have to give up evon such endeavours as have to be made for obtaining food.</p>
<p>Likewise the following s&rsquo;lokas:-&quot; The embodied being is like a lump of clay subject to the will of another and unable to help himself. How, then, can he protect another?,&quot; and &quot; The <em>jīva</em> is ignorant and absolutely helpless in matters concerning his pleasures and pains. He goes to <em>svarga</em> or naraka being directed by <em>Iśvara</em>, who rules over all,&quot; and also, &ldquo;Inscrutable is <em>Bhagavān</em>. He cannot be ordered by any one. He can go wherever He chooses. He has all beings under His control. Like a child playing with its toys, He plays with beings (and enjoys His <em>līlā</em>)&rdquo; &ndash; in these ślokas, what is intended to be stated is only the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s entire dependence (on the Lord) and <em>Iśvara</em> treating him in accordance with his <em>karma</em>. (They do not prescribe the giving up of all endeavour on the part of the <em>jīva</em> ). If this interpretation is not accepted for the verse in Tiruvoymozhi (quoted above ) and for these ślokas, there will be conflict with all _śāstra_s and also inconsistencies with what has been said before,</p>
<p>So far we have dispelled certain misconceptions that may arise from a consideration of <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s omnipotence and the compassion which is natural to Him. We will now proceed to clear doubts which might arise from a consideration of the peculiar relationship ( that exists between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>Iśvara</em> ).</p>
<p>(4) THE CONTENTION THAT BEGGING FOR</p>
<p>PROTECTION IS INCONSISTENT WITH</p>
<p>OUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE SESHI.</p>
<p>There are some who deny the need for sādhyopaya or the means or endeavour for winning the Lord&rsquo;s grace, by stressing the point that He is the <em>śeṣī</em>  for whom we exist and to whom we belong. (They argue as follows): &ldquo;<em>Iśvara</em> is the <em>śeṣī</em>  and we are like His sucklings as expressed by the sages to ŚrīRāma: &ldquo;We are like babies in the embryo&rdquo;, who ever heard of a suckling doing anything other than crying for mother&rsquo;s milk, such as paying wages for it? Would it be consistent with the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of the <em>jīva</em> to perform the surrender of the self (atma samarpanam), to ask for protection, to have full faith in His protection and such other things ?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We meet this objection as follows:- The great sages and the author of Śrī Bhāṣya observed, in their own lives, the injunction about self-surrender by begging for the Lord&rsquo;s protection with faith preceding it. They have cited _śāstra_s in support of this (traditional) practice and have handed it down as instructions for successive (generations). Therefore though <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s relationship as the <em>śeṣī</em>  is eternal, He will not protect the <em>jīva</em> who is subject to the influence of past <em>karma</em>, unless the <em>jīva</em> adopts some form of sādhyopaya or endeavour (for winning His grace). This truth has to be accepted by every one who holds by the śāstras. If the _śāstra_s are given up (as authorities), there will be no <em>Iśvara</em> at all to stand in the relationship of the <em>śeṣī</em> (to the <em>jīva</em> ).</p>
<p>It was stated previously that, owing to His being the seshi, <em>Iśvara</em> is bound to protect the <em>jīva</em> and that the <em>jīva</em> being the <em>śeṣa</em> is neither called upon nor able to protect himself. What was said there is (not inconsistent with what is said here).</p>
<p>There, with an illustration from ordinary life, the relationship between the protector and the protected was shown to consist in the protector being bound to protect and being capable of doing so. It was not meant to show that the Protector would protect in every case, whether or not there is endeavour on the part of the <em>jīva</em> to win His grace by propitiation. If that view were taken, it would mean that all souls should be eternally free from bondage. If it be maintained that, in the matter of protection, the Lord, being omnipotent, chooses to save some and not others, then it would mean that the Lord is partial to some and cruel to others.</p>
<p>Those who maintain these propositions merely on the basis of reason cannot say that the knowledge of the relationship (of the <em>śeṣin</em> and the <em>śeṣa</em> ) is alone required for securing protection and that no request for protection need be made. For have we not seen that non-sentient things, cattle, deer, birds and the like and suckling children are protected, though they have no knowledge of this relationship, just as they do not ask for protection ? If it be held that, though we have seen (such instances), yet the knowledge of that relationship is required on the authority of the _śāstra_s, we answer that, if so, by the very authority of the _śāstra_s, the special kind of knowledge consisting in <em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em> will also have to be accepted (as necessary).</p>
<p>If it be held that what is required for protection is that, while being protected, there should be, in addition to the relationship, no attempt to prevent protection, we answer that, in that case, the Lord should grant <em>mokṣa</em>  to all in such states as dreamless sleep (<em>suṣupti</em>), (where there is the relationship and no attempt on the part of the <em>jīva</em> to prevent protection). If, on the other hand, it be maintained that there should be no attempt to prevent protection in those mental states in which one is capable of doing so, we answer that we have seen protection of even non-sentient things which are incapable of preventing it and of even such sentient beings as cattle and sons which attempt to prevent it.</p>
<p>From the <em>śloka</em>  : &ldquo;Those that have nathas (lords or protectors) in the world do not perform their duty of protecting themselves. It is their Natha or lord who puts forth endeavours on their behalf, just as Sibi and others did the duties which should have been performed by Yayāti &quot; - from this <em>śloka</em> , it should not be thought that endeavour on the part of those that are to be protected is not required at all. For the word Natha is from the root nath and means, here, the begging for protection and nāthavantah in that <em>śloka</em> means, by the force of the termination (vat or mathup) those who have a protector. So the word nāthavantah in the <em>śloka</em>  suggests, by the etymological meaning of natha and by the termination (mathup) which shows the relationship (of seshin and <em>śeṣa</em>) that is necessary for the state of being carefree, the prayer for protection and the act of self. surrender. Otherwise there should be (as said before ) rnoksha for all and other such objections. If it is said that the word nāthavantah ia that <em>śloka</em>  should not be interpreted as having a suggestion of all the meanings (referred to), we have to state that analogies taken from ordinary life should not be pressed too far in the s&rsquo;astra on <em>mokṣa</em> , for they would be at variance with actual and explicit statements made in the <em>śāstra</em>).</p>
<p>We shall now explain the real purport of the words of trust- worthy authors where the apparent meaning would seem to be that, while <em>Iśvara</em> is the Protector or Saviour of all, we are not required to put forth any endeavour for our protection. Their real meaning is this.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>यदर्थन्तु कृतो न्यासस्तदर्थं न पुनः क्रिया । पूर्वमप्यपराधीनप्रवृत्तावस्य नान्वयः ॥</p>
<p>When self-surrender has been performed for the sake of a certain object, there should be no repetition of that performance for the same object, (The need for the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> or endeavour in the form of <em>prapatti</em> at first is not denied ). Even before <em>prapatti</em>, the <em>jīva</em> could not act independently of the Lord.</p>
<p>There is no injunction for an endeavour at a later time also for protection, when once the surrender of the responsibility for protection has been made in accordance with _pramāṇa_s. For even in that act of the original <em>prapatti</em>, the surrender of the responsibility for one&rsquo;s protection was made possible by <em>Iśvara</em>, out of consideration for some meritorious act performed by the <em>jīva</em> as a result of the ripening of past <em>karma</em> flowing like a stream without any beginning. Since even this <em>prapatti</em> was the Lord&rsquo;s doing, we should not be under the impression that we are protecting ourselves. We should feel that the Lord who, we are taught in the _Mūlamantra_m, is the Protector of all that He made us adopt a certain means and became propitiated thereby so as to protect us. The (following) <em>śloka</em>  conveys the same idea:&ndash; My Master Himself makes me surrender myself to Him, as I am His <em>śeṣa</em> and am ever subject to Him. (I surrender myself to Him) with the help of the intelligence given to me by Him and am now free from all responsibility in regard to my protection as He has taken that responsibility on Himself&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is the form prescribed for enabling us to meditate on <em>Bhagavān</em> without the faults of the desire for renown, gain, honour or benefit, and of attachment to the fruit, the notion of one&rsquo;s being the (independent) doer and having an <em>upāya</em>. Therefore such things as the prayer for protection are like the child&rsquo;s act of suckling the mother&rsquo;s milk and the grace of the Lord flows like mother&rsquo;s milk (after the propitiation). From this it follows that (in stressing the need for the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s endeavour), we do not minimise the primary importance of <em>Siddhopāya</em>, namely, <em>Iśvara</em>, who is the existent <em>upāya</em>.</p>
<p>So far we have dispelled the misconceptions that might arise from a consideration of the peculiar attributes and the peculiar relationship (of <em>śeṣa</em> and <em>śeṣī</em> ) which are revealed in the word Nārāyaṇa,</p>
<p>(5) <em>LAKṢMĪ</em> IS AS MUCH THE <em>UPĀYA</em> AS THE LORD HIMSELF:</p>
<p>Hereafter we shall proceed briefly to remove certain misconceptions which arise from the relationship of spouse that is expressed in the word _Śrī_mat (having Lakṣmī ) as existing between Śrī and the Supreme Ruler who has consecrated Himself for the sacrifice or yajna of saving all. As stated in the following <em>śloka</em>, &ldquo;It is said in all religious systems and in the Vedānta  that <em>Bhagavān</em> acts as the Saviour only in the company of Lakṣmī , who is the very embodiment of compassion&rdquo;. (The phrase, &lsquo;religious systems&rsquo; here refers to the four <em>Pāñcarātra</em> systems).</p>
<p>There are some who hold that, in the former part of the <em>Dvaya</em>, the word <em>Śrīmat</em> is an Upalakṣaṇa<sup id="fnref:296"><a href="#fn:296" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">296</a></sup> ( an accidental sign by which the thing is distinguished and not a permanent attribute (or vi_śeṣa_ṇa)), whereas in the latter part, the same word means a permanent attribute of Nārāyaṇa . (If this were true, it would follow that the words &lsquo;I seek as my refuge&rsquo; <em>śaraṇam prapadye</em> would apply only to Nārāyaṇa  and not to Śrī or Lakṣmī  who, in that part, according to them, is not meant to be taken as an inseparable attribute but as only an accidental mark to distinguish Nārāyaṇa , Since in the latter part, Srīmat is, according to them, an inseparable attribute (vi_śeṣa_na), it would follow that the dative and the namah would apply to the attribute and the substantive, viz. Srī and <em>Bhagavān</em>. (It would then mean that Lakṣmī  is not to be sought as the <em>upāya</em> but that adoration and service are due to her as well as to her spouse, Nārāyaṇa  ).</p>
<p>In &ldquo;That is Devadatta&rsquo;s field where the crane was sitting before&rdquo;, the crane is an Upalakṣaṇa or accidental feature to identify the field with. It is not a permanent attribute or vi_śeṣa_ṇa of the field.</p>
<p>In this (wrong) view, when the same word <em>Śrīmat</em> is found in both the parts (of <em>Dvaya</em>) and when there is no objection to interpreting it in the same way, in both the places, the adoption of an interpretation which is at variance with the well-known view of the ancient _ācārya_s and with the tradition connected with Nammalvar, the chief of all prapannas and which would give two different interpretations to the same word in the same sentence has no justification. For in the following <em>śloka</em>  it is said :- &ldquo;O Lakṣmī , with a face delightful like the moon! When (we) try to study Thee as distinct from <em>Bhagavān</em>, (we feel) that His <em>svarūpa</em> or essential nature and His being the Ruler over all are the consequence of the greatness, which is His, by His being ever with Thee. Thou art, therefore, the part (or attribute) by which <em>Bhagavān</em> is understood as being of such and such a character. Since Thou and <em>Bhagavān</em> are thus (inseparably) united, the Veda does not speak of Thee separately&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It may be asked whether, if we take _Śrī_mat as an inseparable attribute of Nārāyaṇa  in the first part of the <em>Dvaya</em> also, it would not follow that there are two _upāya_s viz., Nārāyaṇa  and Lakṣmī , and whether this would not be at variance with the texts which say that there is no other <em>upāya</em> than <em>Bhagavān</em>. We counter this objection by asking whether, if we take Lakṣmī  as the inseparable attribute, as you hold, in the second part of <em>Dvaya</em>, it would not follow that there are two objects of attainment, namely, <em>Bhagavān</em> and Lakṣmī  and whether this would not be at variance with the texts which say “There is no other interest or object of attainment than <em>Bhagavān</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>If it is now asked: &ldquo;In that case what is the objection to taking the word _Śrī_mat as only an accidentally associated mark (Upalakṣaṇa) by which <em>Bhagavān</em> is distinguished in both the parts of the <em>Dvaya</em>, the answer is as follows:&ndash;Certain qualities, certain forms ( vigrahas) and certain activities are necessary for <em>Iśvara</em> being the <em>upāya</em>. Likewise certain other qualities, certain other forms and certain activities are ever associated with <em>Iśvara</em> as the object of attainment. These necessary ( things ), also, would be at variance with <em>Iśvara</em> being the only <em>upāya</em> and the only object of attainment respectively. So they, too, would have to be considered as accidental features and not inseparable attributes, but this would be against the view of these critics who hold that <em>Iśvara</em> is the Protector or Saviour only in virtue of (such attributes as) His omnipotence and His compassion. So they cannot concede that these qualities are only accidental features (Upalakṣaṇa)</p>
<p>They might argue that these qualities, forms and activities are inseparable attributes (vi_śeṣa_ṇa) and not accidental features (Upalakṣaṇas), because they are useful for the purpose of protection. We reply that the same may be said ( with justice ) of Lakṣmī &rsquo;s relationship as spouse, both in the first part of the <em>Dvaya</em> and in the second part of the <em>Dvaya</em>. (i.e.) (She, too, is useful for the respective purposes ). The respective uses of particular things or beings are in accordance with their nature and may be understood from the _pramāṇa_s and from tradition. The use of a thing or of a being is determined, of course, by its nature.</p>
<p>The usefulness of this attribute Srī in _Śrī_mat, both in the part dealing with <em>upāya</em> and in that which treats of the object to be attained by that <em>upāya</em> has been described by Nammalvar in the following verses :- &quot; Lakṣmī  who abides in the ever-fragrant lotus will destroy the <em>karma</em> of <em>jīva_s (i.e.) those karmas which act as hindrances to <em>Bhagavān</em> becoming the <em>upāya</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;I will sweep Thy temple with the help of Thy grace and that of Lakṣmī  who abides in the lotus.&rdquo; (So also ) Bhagavān Vālmīki declared in The Rāmāyaṇa, the earliest of all kavyas, which is the very essence of the doctrine of <em>śaraņāgati</em>&ldquo;This Sītā is capable of protecting us from the great danger (confronting us), O, Rākṣasis&rdquo; and &ldquo;She &lsquo;&lsquo;is capable of saving the host of Rākṣasis from (the anger of Raghava)&rdquo;. Such authors as Hiranyagarbha and Kasyapa declared: “We should“ meditate on Lakṣmī , who can grant us all the benefits that we desire, who can take us safe out of the sea of <em>samsāra</em>, who becomes easily gracious and who can make us happy.&quot; Śrī_Bhagavān</em> Śaunaka has given this precept. &ldquo;The man&rdquo; that prays for the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em>, who is the purport of all words, should perform <em>prapatti</em> to Lakṣmī  also.&quot; The great sage Parāśara who received the knowledge concerning the truth about the Supreme Deity from boons granted to him by Vasiṣṭa and Pulastya has stated &ldquo;Thou art, O Goddess, the knowledge concerning the soul, the giver of <em>mokṣa</em> , the object of attainment<sup id="fnref:297"><a href="#fn:297" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">297</a></sup> .&rdquo; Even if, in this <em>śloka</em> , the conferring of <em>mokṣa</em>  be looked upon as an adjective qualifying the knowledge of the soul, it has to be considered as her glory or vibhūti on account of the appositional use (sāmānādhikaraṇya ). The Lord of Śrī has himself proclaimed in connection with the meditation on <em>Bhagavān</em> as the Lord of Śrī in Śrī Sātvata Samhita -&ldquo;Those who meditate on <em>Bhagavān</em> seek the protection of Lakṣmī  and with that they easily cross the sea of <em>samsāra</em> which is constituted of these three qualities&rdquo;. Apart from the śāstras treating specially of <em>Śrī</em>, these _śāstra_s which do not pertain to any special sect or cult are of great authority.</p>
<p>The <em>śloka</em>  says: Thou art the knowledge concerning the self or atma <em>vidyā</em>: Lakṣmī  is in apposition with atma <em>vidyā</em>. The meaning is that atma <em>vidyā</em> is one of her _vibhūti_s or glorious possessions. Since atma <em>vidyā</em> can confer <em>mokṣa</em> , it follows that Lakṣmī  can confer <em>mokṣa</em> .</p>
<p>Alavandar, too, has stated:- &ldquo;The whole world depends upon the glance of <em>Śrī</em>, for its support.&rdquo; and again &ldquo;Without the grace of Lakṣmī , the beloved spouse of the lotus-eyed Lord, we cannot have those glorious experiences which one might desire in this life (<em>samsāra</em>), nor the experience of our disembodied self, nor the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> in <em>mokṣa</em> &ldquo;. The author of <em>Śrī Bhāṣya</em>, in his Vaikuṇṭha   <em>Gadya</em>, says that she commands Adi_śeṣa_, Viṣvaksena and other attendants to render such service to <em>Bhagavān</em> as is suited to the time and the circumstance, and that the service to <em>Bhagavān</em>, which is the supreme goal, should be rendered in accordance with her commands. Koorathalvan too, sings his praise of Lakṣmī  in ślokas beginning with these words: &ldquo;The &ldquo;bounds of Thy greatness. O, Goddess, are not known to <em>Bhagavān</em> nor even to Thyself&rdquo;. These words are an elaboration of what is contained in the <em>śloka</em>  :- &ldquo;May Lakṣmī   confer happiness (on us) &mdash; Lakṣmī , looking at whose face, and with Her will as His aid, the Lord creates, destroys and sustains all the worlds, and grants also such things as <em>svarga</em>, naraka (hell) and <em>mokṣa</em> . Since the two are engaged in the same work and experience the same kind of delight, the Lord cannot feel happy if he performs the <em>līlā</em> of the work of the world without her participation in it,&rdquo; Bhattar, also, has commented on the word Udaara (generous ) used in the <em>śruti</em>  (viz., Śrī Sūktam) as an adjective for Śrī in this manner:-&ldquo;How generous Thou art! O, Mother, to the man who merely raises his hands folded in worship to Thee, Thou grantest wealth, the enjoyment of his disembodied self and even <em>paramapada</em> and yet Thou feelest ashamed that Thou hast not done anything adequate for him.&rdquo; Peria Jeer, too, has brought out all these ideas in his commentary on Śrī Sukta. Thus, from what we find in the <em>śruti</em> , <em>Smṛti</em> and tradition, (the reader) gifted with insight can understand that the attribute expressed in the word _Śrī_mat in <em>Dvaya</em> has its uses, just like such things as forms (<em>vigraha</em>), in accordance with its own nature.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S:</p>
<p>भरस्वीकाररहितं रक्षासङ्कल्पवर्जितम् । गुणादिकमिहेष्टं हि शरण्यस्य विशेषणम् ॥</p>
<p>ऐकरस्यजुषोश्शेषिदंपत्योस्सर्वकर्मसु । विशेषणविशेष्यत्वं श्रुतं कस्मान्न रोचते ॥</p>
<p>प्रतर्दनादिविद्यासु वेद्येऽपि परमात्मनि ।अचेतनवदिच्छामश्चेतनञ्च विशेषणम् ॥</p>
<p>इत्थं प्रपत्तिविद्यायां तत्तन्मन्त्रानुसारतः । विभुः पत्न्या गुणाद्यैश्च विशिष्टो विषयोऽत्र नः ॥</p>
<p>You (critics who do not consider Lakṣmī  as an inseparable) attribute or vi_śeṣa_ṇa of Nārāyaṇa  in the first part of <em>Dvaya</em>) maintain that such things as the qualities of the Saviour (compas. siop etc) are attributes and not mere Upalakṣaṇa, even though they cannot undertake the responsibility (bhara) of protection and cannot have the will to protect (being only qualities and therefore non-sentient). Why do you object to the idea of Lakṣmī  being the attribute (vi_śeṣa_ṇa) and Nārāyaṇa  being the substantive</p>
<p>(viseshya), when this divine couple have the same pleasure or relish in all actions and when they are both <em>śeṣī</em> s, when there is the authority of the śāstras for it? In such vidyās or forms of meditation as that of Pratardana, although the Supreme Being is the object of knowledge, we admit that sentient beings like Indra can be attributes of <em>Bhagavān</em> just like non-sentient qualities. Similarly in this <em>vidyā</em> called <em>prapatti</em>, the Omnipresent Lord is the object of approach with His Spouse and with such things as His qualities in accordance with what is stated in the respective _mantra_s.</p>
<p>We have already stated that what is understood from the _pramāṇa_s should not be set aside by mere logic or reason. Therefore, just as we accept the Lord with His Spouse, as the object of attainment in accordance with the wish of the Saviour, there is no objection to the Lord with His Spouse being the <em>upāya</em> as well.</p>
<p>Just as <em>Bhagavān</em> with particular qualities (like omnipotence and compassion) and particular forms (<em>vigraha</em>) indicated, respectively, by the words Nārāyaṇa and <em>caraṇau</em>, (the two feet) which are attributes of Nārāyaṇa  forms a single <em>upāya</em>, so also <em>Bhagavān</em> with Lakṣmī , who appears in the word _Śrī_mat as an attribute in the eternal relationship of being His Spouse, may without any impropriety, be considered as a single <em>upāya</em>. If it is said that we should give up all the attributes of the <em>upāya</em> in order to make the <em>upāya</em> single, the <em>dharma</em> of being an <em>upāya</em> (i.e. _upāya_tva) will have to be given up also.</p>
<p>It should not be thought that the substantive (here <em>Bhagavān</em>), when it gains some excellence from the attribute (here Lakṣmī ), should be considered as previously wanting in some excellence. Well has it been said in the <em>śloka</em>  :- “Thou art, O Lakṣmī,  the property of <em>Bhagavān</em> by Thine own will; hence, though His supreme excellence is due to Thee, His greatness is not dependent on any one else. A gem becomes valuable on account of its radiance. It does not thereby become in itself worthless; its</p>
<p>value, which is natural to it, does not diminish thereby, because its greatness is not due to anything else,&rdquo; In the same way as the substantive, (namely, <em>Bhagavān</em>) gains excellence from its attribute (vi_śeṣa_ṇa), namely, Lakṣmī , the substantive, too, has its own natural excellence. This is illustrated in the <em>śloka</em>  in the Rāmāyana :-&ldquo;Just as radiance cannot be separated from the sun, I cannot remain separated from Raghava&rdquo;. Brightness is the natural quality common to radiance and the sun. So also ŚrīRāma and Sītā had, in common, auspicious qualities not dependent on any one else, as described in the <em>śloka</em>  :-&ldquo;We bow to &ldquo;<em>Bhagavān</em> and Lakṣmī , who have in their very nature, all auspicious qualities, who are the causes of the world and who are beyond all comparison&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There is nothing improper in stating that the substantive and the attribute give excellence to each other as indicated in the following: &ldquo;That splendour which is ŚrīRāma is beyond all measure, for the daughter of Janaka is His&rdquo;. &ldquo;Though she is always with Thee, Thy Lakṣmī  astonishes Thee every day as if she is new; she is in every way fit for Thee by her attributes, her forms, her sportful activity and her interest in protecting others&rdquo;. “Thy Śrī”  “Thou art the Śrī of <em>Śrī</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Śrī of even Śrī&rdquo; - these expressions show how Śrī and the Lord of Śrī are excellent in themselves and add also to each other&rsquo;s greatness.</p>
<p>By the authority of texts in the <em>śruti</em>  (such as &ldquo;He is the Lord of the Universe&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Spouse of Viṣṇu  who is the empress of the world&rdquo;, and &ldquo;The syllable ma indicates that the <em>jīva</em> is the servant of both&rdquo;), and by the authority of the following <em>śloka</em> , &ldquo;The world of sentient and non-sentient beings is <em>śeṣa</em> to Lakṣmī , (i.e.) it exists for Lakṣmī : She and the world are <em>śeṣa</em> to <em>Bhagavān</em>, who is Her <em>śeṣī</em> . Notwithstanding this, the control of the world is common to both: the two together are <em>śeṣī</em> , in relation to the world&rdquo;. By these authorities it was determined by Somasi Andan in Shadarthasamkshepa, that both form always a single <em>śeṣī</em>. In the case of certain special offerings (<em>havis</em>) enjoined in the Karmakāṇḍa, the offering is made to two deities like Agni and <em>Viṣṇu</em> as if they were single. So also in this offering of the soul called <em>prapatti</em>, the two may, without any impropriety, be the single recipient. As stated in the <em>śloka</em>, &ldquo;Youth and certain other qualities are common to Thee and <em>Bhagavān</em>; however you have divided other qualities between you for your enjoyment and (that in this way) :- <em>Bhagavān</em> has manly qualities like independence of others, control over enemies, firmness and the like and Thou hast such feminine qualities as gentleness, existing only for the husband, compassion and forbearance&rdquo;; the wife is ever dependent on her Lord and in the performance of yajnas or sacrifices, only the yajamāna is spoken of (as his wife who participates in the performance is implicit, as it were, in the word yajamāna, even when one yajamana is referred to). So also in regard to the teaching of the śāstras, the mention of a single person does not mean the absence of the wife who is, as it were, inseparable from her spouse. In the verse :&ndash; &ldquo;<em>Bhakti</em>  and <em>prapatti</em> are forms of knowledge which have, for their object, only <em>Bhagavān</em>, the Lord of Lakṣmī , who abides in the lotus and as also the knowledge called the perfect enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em> has only Him for its object&rdquo; - in this verse this is really the meaning, viz., that Lakṣmī , being included in <em>Bhagavān</em>, no separate mention is made of her. This may be seen also in the passage: &ldquo;Since Thousand <em>Bhagavān</em> are thus inseparably united, the śruti does not speak of Thee separately&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Nanjeeyar heard, from Kadambi Achan, what the author of Śrī Bhāṣyam had declared and summarised it thus:-&ldquo;In places where <em>Bhagavān</em> is referred to, it should be understood that Lakṣmī  is also referred to&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Those whose object is only <em>mokṣa</em>  and who have no other aim, or interest, worship Lakṣmī  in her situation as laya (on the chest of <em>Bhagavān</em>) and as bloga in the image of the spouse standing by the image of <em>Bhagavān</em>. But just as we bow before certain images of <em>Bhagavān</em> (like Santānakṛṣṇa), which bestow primarily the benefits desired in this world, there is, for even _mumukṣu_s, no impropriety in such actions as bowing before the image of Lakṣmī  installed in a separate shrine and worshipped for certain worldly benefits (adhikaarārchā), just as we should bow before our mothers, since in all images of Lakṣmī  (wherever they may be) her being the Spouse of Viṣṇu  is an established fact.</p>
<p>When such authoritative doctrines are seen, in the words of those who are disinterested, those who are still so obstinate as not to give up their wrong notions, are in a state described in the following <em>śloka</em> s:- &ldquo;The fool&rdquo; who clings firmly to what he has learnt before, the man who is ignorant of <em>dharma</em>, the man who will not have his doubts cleared by those grown old in wisdom - this man will come to grief like a blind man falling into a ditch&rdquo;, and “ To  those who are weak in intelligence, who are wicked, who have been bitten by the serpent of specious reasoning and whose senses have become deluded -to these men, truths appear different from what they (really) are&rdquo;,</p>
<p>In the investigation of the real meaning of the word <em>Siddhopāya</em>, the following passages should be remembered:- &ldquo;There is nothing other than these two. The males are <em>Bhagavān</em> and the females are Lakṣmī &ldquo;. &ldquo;Just as Viṣṇu  is in all things, so also is she, O, best of Brahmins,&rdquo;. &ldquo;The heart of this lady is fixed on ŚrīRāma and his heart is ever fixed on her. Therefore it is that she and ŚrīRāma who is the embodiment of <em>dharma</em> continue alive for even the fraction of an hour.&rdquo; &ldquo;Both <em>Bhagavān</em> and Lakṣmī  aro omnipresent, since they are inseparably united, they are spoken of as one <em>tattva</em> or real.&rdquo; Therefore, since they form a single seshi, since they are ever of the same mind, since they are intimately attached to each other, and since they are inseparably connected with each other in their <em>svarūpa</em> or essential nature, and in their rūpa or forms, those who are established in sattva should understand the meaning of the word Nārāyaṇa with its adjective _Śrī_mat in such a manner as will not be at variance with the inseparable unity of the _tattva_m (<em>Bhagavān</em> ) with its attribute (<em>Śrī</em>) so well expressed in the <em>śloka</em>  :- &ldquo;Thy essential nature <em>svarūpa</em> and the forms that Thou takest and the <em>svarūpa</em> and the forms assumed by <em>Bhagavān</em> are in close embrace with each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>( The author summarises the gist of the chapter in a number of _śloka_s as follows:&ndash;)</p>
<p>The Lord of <em>Śrī</em>, who is the embodiment of compassion and who secures, for them, all the benefits desired by men is called <em>Siddhopāya</em>, because He is already an existent <em>upāya</em>. The ways of securing His favour are such as <em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em> and these are called _Sādhyopāya_s, because they can be adopted and accomplished by those who desire the respective benefits. When the <em>Sādhyopāya</em> flows with high mounting waves and increases the flood of compassion of the <em>śeṣī</em> , who is the <em>Siddhopāya</em>, the latter breaks through the flood of lilā which is also His. By (that very flood of compassion) all hindrances to His service, such as even the former will of the Omnipotent, disappear like dams built of fine sand. Though the acts of propitiation (like <em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em> ) are prescribed in the _śāstra_s for securing the fruit, yet <em>Siddhopāya</em> is considered as of prime importance, because the Lord alone is capable of granting <em>mokṣa</em> , since <em>bhakti</em> or <em>prapatti</em> being non-sentient, cannot give the fruit directly and since <em>Bhagavān</em> alone can act directly. To those who have adopted <em>prapatti</em> as the primary and independent means, it is specially ordained that they should rest on the Omnipresent in order that they may know that their own endeavour perishes instantly after <em>prapatti</em>. Therefore with what aim, the surrender of responsibility has been made to <em>Siddhopāya</em> - for that aim, the man should make no further endeavour and depend only on the <em>Siddhopāya</em>, In the definition of <em>prapatti</em> in the <em>mantra</em> for <em>prapatti</em>, in the injunction concerning it and in other passages and so also in Śrī Bhāṣya and the like and by tradition, <em>Brahman</em> is declared as the <em>upāya</em>. Just as we admit that certain (holy) places and the like which exist already are called <em>dharma</em> productive of spiritual excellence, so also it is said by those who understand the truth that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the eternal <em>dharma</em> (or <em>upāya</em> ). This <em>Siddhopāya</em> is to be thought of in the three mysteries or mantrās in such as the syllable a in <em>aum</em> etc.</p>

<p>It appears to us, from the _śruti_s, _smṛti_s and the words of <em>guru_s fortified by reason, that the Omnipotent Lord being propitiated by yajnas (sacrifices ), gifts made in charity, offerings made in the fire (homa ), adoration, surrender of responsibility (bhara_nyāsa</em> ), constant meditation (<em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>) and the like in accordance with one&rsquo;s competence confers benefits on men. This is also what religious tradition prescribes,</p>
<p>THE NEED FOR THE CLARIFICATION OF WHAT IS</p>
<p>MEANT BY <em>SĀDHYOPĀYA</em>:</p>
<p>A man may have a clear knowledge of <em>Siddhopāya</em> (viz. <em>Bhagavān</em>) who is omniscient, omnipotent and supremely compassionate, who, along with His Spouse, is the <em>śeṣī</em> of all and the Saviour of the whole world: he may even have become perfect in his averseness to <em>samsāra</em> , by seeing that what is considered agreeable by unintelligent persons is really disagreeable as stated in the <em>śloka</em>: &ldquo;Health&rsquo; gives (only) potency to the senses; wealth (only) creates enemies; long life makes one suffer bereavement of relations, What is there in these things that can delight a man?&rdquo;, He may have acquired an eager longing for the attainment of the Supreme Being as stated in the <em>śloka</em> :- &ldquo;He who loves <em>Bhagavān</em>, the Supreme Being, has no love for anything else&rdquo;; he may have the feeling of urgency in regard to <em>mokṣa</em> as stated in the <em>śloka</em> :- &ldquo;By paying a heavy price in the form of virtuous deeds, this boat of a body has been bought. Before this boat is broken (or becomes leaky), hasten to cross the sea of sorrow&rsquo;. In spite of all these, if he does not clearly understand (all) about the <em>Sādhyopāya</em>, prescribed in the injunction, “Seek refuge under me alone&rdquo; and in the sentence which expresses the action, &ldquo;I seek refuge&rdquo; (in <em>Dvaya</em>), which is the means of extinguishing the punishment inflicted by <em>Bhagavān</em> which binds a map to <em>samsāra</em> and which resulted from beginningless and continued violation of His commands - if he does not understand it, there is no way of propitiating and winning the grace of the Supreme Ruler, who is the <em>Siddhopāya</em>. Therefore we will remove misconceptions that might arise concerning (1) competence therefor (2) the nature of <em>Sādhyopāya</em> and (3) the accessories pertaining to it.</p>
<p>COMPETENCE: <em>PRAPATTI</em> IS OPEN TO ALL (CASTES):</p>
<p>There are some who will ask: &quot; This <em>prapatti</em> is a <em>dharma</em> prescribed in the Vedas. If so, how can it be said that every one (of all castes) is qualified to perform it?&rdquo; The answer to this question is given on the authority of the Svetasvatara <em>Śruti</em>, which says that the Supreme Ruler is the Saviour of all. This truth is confirmed by expository passages like the following: “Take me to Raghava who is the Protector of all the worlds”, and in _śloka_s like:&ndash;&ldquo;You should seek the protection of <em>Viṣṇu</em> who is fit to be approached by every one, who is easy of approach, who can never go wrong and has no one to compare with Him and who removes the suffering of those who perform <em>prapatti</em>&rdquo;. It is confirmed also by passages in the Sātvatasamhita (2.9), which says that all the three castes beginning with the Kṣatriyas and ending with the Śūdras who have performed <em>prapatti</em>, are competent to adore the four vyūhas, without _mantra_s. So also is</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man born even into low castes who has performed <em>prapatti</em> once to <em>Bhagavān</em> &ndash; that man is protected by <em>Bhagavān</em> from the ills of <em>samsāra</em> even though he is a patricide or a matricide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is true that <em>upāsana</em> or meditation (in accordance with the teaching of the Upaniṣads ) has been determined as fit (only) for the three higher castes in the section Apaśūdra; bat speaking the truth which is given as an injunction in the Vedas is enjoined for all castes; so also <em>prapatti</em> is a <em>dharma</em> common to all and may be performed either with Vedic _mantra_s or with _mantra_s found in the Tantras in accordance with the person&rsquo;s respective competence, without any violation of propriety. We have heard, in the s&rsquo;astras, of even such beings as crows performing <em>prapatti</em>. The Saviour Himself has declared: &ldquo;Women,&rdquo; Vaiśyas and Śūdras that are born of sinners - whoever they might be -they attain, O Partha, the highest state if they seek my protection&rdquo;. Here seeking of the Lord for protection by <em>bhakti</em> or <em>prapatti</em> is stated to be common to all. Even in the matter of <em>upāsana</em> or meditation (according to the vidyās in the Upaniṣads) though the beginning can be made only by men in the three higher castes, the end of the course can be attained by men in the bodies of any caste. This is stated in <em>Viṣṇudharma</em> in the following <em>śloka</em> :-&ldquo;Though _Dharmavyādha _and others belonged to low and gruesome castes, yet since, in their previous births, they had practised _bhakti_yoga, they continued it in their latest life and, having completed it therein, attained their goal like <sup id="fnref:298"><a href="#fn:298" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">298</a></sup> Sramani.”</p>
<p>(Śabari) or Śramaṇi was of the caste of hunters and attained <em>mukti</em> by <em>bhakti</em> to Bhāgavatas and <em>Bhagavān</em>.</p>
<p>Thus <em>upāsana</em> or <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> should be commenced only by the three higher castes. But there is no such restriction in the general statement about the competence for <em>prapatti</em>. Further in the special statement about the qualifications for <em>prapatti</em>, it is definitely declared that every one is fit to adopt <em>prapatti</em>. The special qualifications requisite for <em>prapatti</em> have already been described by us.</p>
<p>Therefore birth in the three higher castes or the absence of it is no compliance for <em>prapatti</em>, when unaccompanied by the inability to adopt other _upāya_s. The only qualification that is essential is <em>ākiñcanya</em>, inability to adopt other _upāya_s). This may be seen from the Tamil verse: &ldquo;I was not born into any of the four castes to enable me to perform <em>dharma</em>&rdquo;, and from the <em>śloka</em>: &ldquo;O Thou Saviour! I was born into a family renowned in the world for their fame, their purity, their practice of <em>yoga</em>, their knowledge of the truth concerning matter (<em>prakṛti</em>) with its three qualities and the _jīva_s and for their steadfast attachment to Thy lotus like feet, and yet with a mind inclined to sin, I am sunk in <em>samsāra</em>: and am going down.&rdquo; Therefore it is beyond doubt that competence for <em>prapatti</em> is open to persons of all castes who have a knowledge of the Saviour and of <em>śaraṇāgati</em> and possess also <em>ākiñcanya</em> and the like.</p>
<p>MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OR SVARUPA OF <em>PRAPATTI</em>:</p>
<p>The statement of learned men that the <em>śaraṇāgati</em> referred to in <em>Dvaya</em> means only faith in the two feet of Nārāyaṇa being the only <em>upāya</em> for the attainment of Nārāyaṇa with His Spouse&mdash;&ndash; this statement should be taken to mean only that faith in <em>śaraṇāgati</em> in the mind of the person and faith as an accessory to <em>prapatti</em> are very important. (It does not mean that faith alone is enough). So also the words of the author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> .&ndash;&quot;<em>Prapatti</em> is faith; it is prayer accompanied by a faith that <em>Bhagavān</em> will grant whatever is desired on account of a single act of prayer&rdquo; come these words of the _Bhāṣya_kara emphasise the importance of faith at the beginning and then declare in the words of Bharatamuni which define <em>prapatti</em> that <em>prapatti</em> is a prayer (for help) with faith (in the person whose help is sought). (It has been shown already that) surrender of self is the <em>aṅgī</em> and that the others (like <em>kārpaṇya</em>) are _aṅga_s (i&hellip;) Accessories. &ldquo;<em>Nyāsa</em> bastol been declared as having five accessories or _aṅga_s.&rdquo; Therefore these words of the <em>Bhāṣya</em>. kara that <em>prapatti</em> consists in prayer (for help) which might mean that the Lord expects only the prayer for help should be understood only as emphasising the importance of one of the _aṅga_s (namely, the seeking of the Lord&rsquo;s protection ), for it is said &ldquo;The Lord expects the expression of the desire for protection&rdquo;. This is only one of the _aṅga_s (and not the <em>aṅgī</em>). (The _Bhāṣya_kara should not be taken as stating that the prayer alone will do). In the shorter <em>Gadya</em> also (_Śrī_r_aṅga_gadya), <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> makes the prayer with faith preceding it and concludes with the words namostu te (i.e.) &ldquo;I bow to Thee&rdquo;. Further he uses the word s&rsquo;aranam which means seeking (the Lord) as <em>upāya</em>. From these two, it is evident that self-surrender is present. That the word <em>namas</em> in namostute means surrender of self is well-known from such passages as the following:&ndash; &ldquo;I bow&rdquo; to Bhagavao to whom, having surrendered his self which is what is meant by namaskāra, a man gets rid of his suffering and enjoys whatever he desires.&quot; In <em>Śrī</em> <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em> <em>Gadya</em> the surrender of self preceded by prayer is explicit. Therefore (since <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> states in <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em> - <em>Gadya</em>: &ldquo;Praying for protection), the person should surrender his (or her) self to Bhagaven after bowing to Him,&rdquo;) it is clear that surrender of self is different from the prayer for protection and is the angī with the prayer as an <em>aṅga</em>. It has therefore to be concladed that in the words: &ldquo;One should&rdquo; surrender one&rsquo;s self by uttering this <em>mantra</em>&quot;, and &ldquo;the surrender&rdquo; of one&rsquo;s self and of what belongs to one&rsquo;s self&quot;, the <em>aṅgī</em> which is surrender of self, is declared as a <em>vidhi</em> or injunction.</p>
<p>If this were not accepted (as true), it would lead to construing the sentence &ldquo;Saranāgati is of six kinds&rdquo; in its apparent meaning and thinking that the five accessories or _aṅga_s of <em>prapatti</em> are, every one of them, a form of <em>prapatti</em> or angī, in the same way as we conclude that there are seven different kinds of ablution (snāna) from the sentence :- &ldquo;Ablution is said to be of seven kinds&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If it is argued that the _aṅga_s are not considered to be _aṅgī_s on account of the statement: “One should perform <em>prapatti</em> with its five _aṅga_s or accessories,&quot; then by the force of the same argument and in accordance with the statement &ldquo;Nyása is accompanied by five _aṅga_s&rdquo;, we should, in reason, correct such statements as &ldquo;<em>Prapatti</em> is prayer&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>Prapatti</em> is faith&rdquo;, and hold that &quot; <em>Nikṣepa</em> or surrender is the augi&quot;, and that the rest are ( only) _aṅga_s,</p>
<p>Even if we judge by the principle that, (when there is a difference in the statements ), that statement which is made in a larger number of contexts should be accepted as true, it would be evident, from a study of the chapters on <em>Prapatti</em> in Sātvika Tantra, <em>Lakṣmī</em> Tantra, Ahirbudhriya Samhita, and the like, that <em>Nikṣepa</em> or self-surrender is the <em>aṅgī</em>. Even in the <em>śloka</em> :-&ldquo;Thou alone, shouldst be my <em>upāya</em>. It is this idea of prayer that is called <em>śaraṇāgati</em>&rdquo;, it is indicated by suggestion in the word <em>upāya</em> coming along with the word &lsquo;alone&rsquo; that what is referred to is <em>bharanyāsa</em> or surrender of responsibility which is the main theme in that context. Even in ordinary life, an accessory is often spoken of as if it were the main thing in order to emphasise some one aspect or other. The word ülambha, which means &lsquo;killing&rsquo; is employed to mean also &lsquo;<em>yāga</em> or sacrifice in a wider sense; so also in &ldquo;seek refuge&rdquo; in the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em> and the like, the verbs signify the sacrifice of the self or ātma yiiga, which is usually expressed by such words as vyāsa, <em>nikṣepa</em> and tyāga (surrender), This is in keeping with Vedic usage.</p>
<p>What is called <em>yāga</em> is a special form of thought indicating that a particular offering (<em>havis</em>) is made to a particular deity. Ātmayāga or the sacrifice (or surrender of self) is (likewise) a special form of thought indicating this : « My soul, which is the most delicious of offerings (<em>havis</em> ), is for <em>Śrīman</em> Nārāyaṇa. We have already stated (on page ____) that in this surrender of self, the nature of the action to be performed which is common to all .who desire benefits of whatever kind is the surrender of the responsibility for protection.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S :</p>
<p>*हविस्समर्पणादत्र प्रयोगविधिशक्तितः । आत्मरक्षाभरन्यासोऽकिञ्चनस्यातिरिच्यते ॥</p>
<p>अतश्श्रीराममिश्राद्यैर्भरन्यासविवक्षया । स्वप्रवृत्तिनिवृत्त्यंशः प्रपत्तिरिति लक्षितः ॥</p>
<p>अकृते तु भरन्यासे रक्षापेक्षणमात्रतः । पश्चात् स्वयत्नविरतिर्न प्रसिद्ध्यति लोकवत् ॥</p>
<p>आकिञ्चन्यभरन्यासोपायत्वप्रार्थनात्मनाम् । त्रयाणां सौहृदं सूक्ष्मं यः पश्यति स पश्यति ॥</p>
<p>Here in the surrender of self for the sake of <em>mokṣa</em>, since there is to be made an offering (<em>havis</em>), owing to the injunction regarding the manner in which the offering should be made, there is an additional feature for the man who is destitute of other <em>upāya_s, namely, the surrender of the responsibility for the protection of the self. Therefore by sach authors as Rama Misra (Uyyakkondar) and others, when they want to speak of the surrender of responsibility (bhara_nyāsa</em>), a single aspect of it, namely, the abstention from his own activity on the part of the <em>prapanna</em> has been used to indicate <em>prapatti</em>. As in the world of ordinary life, when the surrender of responsibility has not been made, abstention from one&rsquo;s own activity will not result thereafter merely from the request for protection. He who sees the subtle feature that is common to these three, namely, being destitute of all _upāya_s for protection, surrender of responsibility and the prayer for being the <em>upāya</em> &mdash; he alone sees. (That subtle feature which is common to all the three of them is refraining from all activity of one&rsquo;s own for one&rsquo;s protection. Since there is this common feature in all the three, the other two are sometimes used to denote <em>bharanyāsa</em>).</p>
<p>Thus the surrender of one&rsquo;s responsibility for the protection of one&rsquo;s self is the main injunction that is made in all _śāstra_s treating of <em>prapatti</em> and it has five accessories. (Such eminent authorities) as <em>Śrī</em> _Viṣṇu_cbitta, Vadihamsambuvaha, and Varadacharya have succinctly stated (this truth).</p>
<p>THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ONE IS <em>ŚEṣA</em> TO THE</p>
<p>LORD IS NOT IN ITSELF <em>PRAPATTI</em>:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>There are some who say: &ldquo;When a man has understood the truth regarding the _tattva_s from the _śāstra_s, has he not realised his relationship as <em>śeṣa</em> to <em>Bhagavān</em> ? Further, in the <em>śloka</em>, &ldquo;If you desire to attain the highest state and to adopt the <em>upāya</em> for it, remember that Hari is (your) master and that you are His servant and that this relationship exists for ever by the very nature (of things)” (in this <em>śloka</em>) &ndash; is not the meaning as follows:- &ldquo;If you desire the highest goal of life and the means of attaining it, you should understand clearly that you are the servant and that <em>Iśvara</em> is the master and that this relationship exists by nature&rdquo;? They ask, &ldquo;When this is so, is there an action (besides the thought of the relationship) enjoined called ātmasamarpanam?&rdquo;. This question does not deserve any consideration, just like the dictum (of the Advaitins) that, by the mere knowledge of the text of the *<em>śruti</em> [Texts like &ldquo;That Thou art&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am <em>Brahma</em>&rdquo;] . <em>mokṣa</em> can be attained.</li>
</ol>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S:</p>
<p>जितकौस्तुभचौर्यस्य सम्राजस्सर्वपाप्मनाम् ।</p>
<p>शिष्टं ह्यात्मापहारस्य निष्कृतिस्स्वभरार्पणम् ॥</p>
<p>परशेषत्वधीमात्रमधिकारिविशेषकम् ।</p>
<p>पश्चादात्मापहारस्य निरोधाय च कल्पते ॥</p>
<p>To the man who prides himself of having stolen from <em>Bhagavān</em> the gem Kaustubha (which is the symbol of his soul) and who is the prince of all sinners (ie. the greatest of all sinners) the surrender of responsibility (<em>bharanyāsa</em>) (to the Lord) has been enjoined as an expiation. The thought that he is the <em>śeṣa</em> of the Supreme Being, which qualifies the <em>prapanna</em>, serves also to prevent the theft of the soul (atmapahāra) in the future (1.6.) after <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>The man first understands from the săstras that his self which is a Real (Tattva) has the attribute of being a <em>śeṣa</em>. Then with this competency and with the accessories pertaining (to <em>prapatti</em>) and also with the specific idea of the particular benefit desired, he surrenders the responsibility for the protection of his soul (to <em>Bhagavān</em>) bearing in mind his relationship as a <em>śeṣa</em>. This surrender of responsibility which is enjoined as an <em>upāya</em> for the remission of the punishment resulting from endless sins is indeed what is called ātmasamarpana (the surrender of the self ).</p>
<p>When it is said that <em>mokṣa</em> is attained by a knowledge of the truth, it should be understood as meaning that it is only by way of leading to the adoption of an <em>upāya</em>. This is evident from the authority of the injunction (<em>vidhi</em>) contained in such passages as &ldquo;Worship** me&rdquo; and &ldquo;seek 18cefage under me&rdquo;.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em> :</p>
<p>ज्ञानान्मोक्षोपदेशे हि तत्पूर्वोपासनादिना ।</p>
<p>उपासनादिरूपाद्वा ज्ञानान्मोक्षो विवक्षितः ॥</p>
<p>The instruction which states:- &ldquo;From knowledge arises <em>mokṣa</em>&rdquo;, should be understood in one of two ways:- <em>Bhakti</em> preceded by <em>jñāna</em> or knowledge leads to <em>mokṣa</em> or from <em>jñāna</em> or knowledge, which is of the nature of <em>bhakti</em>, results in <em>mokṣa</em> (for <em>bhakti</em> is itself a form of knowledge).</p>
<p>Similarly the knowledge of the relationship of being a <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord which arises from a study of the śāstra is common to all forms of activity for <em>mokṣa</em>, by refraining from the worldly life, like <em>bharanyāsa</em> and <em>upāsana</em> or <em>bhakti</em>, Since the activity of the <em>śeṣa</em>, namely, service, is the extreme limit of the goal of attainment, it is certainly not possible to adopt any of the _upāya_s enjoined for <em>mokṣa</em>, without understanding the relationship of <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord. Even if a man adopts the _dharma_s enjoined for the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em> without knowing this relationship of being a <em>śeṣa</em>, these _dharma_s or _upāya_s themselves will (in course of time) produce that knowledge of the relationship and will become the cause of <em>mokṣa</em> by making the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> perfect and complete. So the atmasamarpanam that is enjoined for performance is not the mere knowledge of the relationship of being a <em>śeṣa</em>; if it is asked what, then, it is, the answer is that it is the surrender of the responsibility for one&rsquo;s protection accompanied by such things as the knowledge of the relationship of being a <em>śeṣa</em>.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>.</p>
<p>वाक्यमात्रेण सिद्धत्वात्सिद्धोपाय इहोच्यते ।</p>
<p>प्रपत्तिरिति वादोऽपि विधिनात्र विहन्यते ॥</p>
<p>The contention that the particular kind of knowledge called <em>prapatti</em> results merely from the sentences or passages of the <em>śāstra</em>, that it is, on that account, called <em>siddhopāya</em> and that it is not an <em>upāya</em> to be accomplished by a certain activity &ndash; this contention also is refuted by the injunction or <em>vidhi</em> (saranam vraja).</p>
<p>If it is argued that “s&rsquo;aranam vraja”[ &ldquo;seek protection&rdquo; ] merely means “Know this truth (that the Lord is the Saviour)&rdquo;, the answer is that it is opposed to the natural and obvious meaning of the words. It would also be against the plain and explicit rules or vidhis for the performance of <em>prapatti</em> as in the sentence: &ldquo;Perform this <em>prapatti</em> accompanied by its five accessories or _aṅga_s.&rdquo; If it is held that what is intended in the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em> is merely this, that <em>Iśvara</em> is the <em>upāya</em> for <em>mokṣa</em> and that no activity is enjoined in this <em>śloka</em> for the man who wants <em>mokṣa</em>, it would mean that it is merely the teaching of a truth that is needed for <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>, which is the subject treated in that context. (The <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em> would then cease to have anything to do with <em>prapatti</em>),</p>
<p>REFRAINING FROM ONE&rsquo;S OWN ACTIVITY IS</p>
<p>NOT IN ITSELF <em>PRAPATTI</em>:</p>
<p>There are some who hold that <em>prapatti</em> is merely refraining from one&rsquo;s own activity for protecting oneself and that what is enjoined for its accomplishment is only the abandonment of all _dharma_s or _upāya_s. The answer to this view is as follows:- Even though it is abstention, this abandonment of all _dharma_s is itself an activity or <em>dharma</em> of the person for his own protection (and this would be inconsistent with their own words). Further this view is in conflict also with the passage (quoted above) enjoining the performance of <em>prapatti</em> with its five _aṅga_s.</p>
<p>The view held by some that the regarding of <em>prapatti</em> as an <em>upāya</em> or as an auxiliary to <em>Siddhopāya</em> (for <em>mokṣa</em> ) is opposed to the doctrine that the <em>Siddhopāya</em>, namely, <em>Iśvara</em>, is the only <em>upāya</em>, that He is already an existent <em>upāya</em>, that He is the Supreme Sentient, that He has supreme compassion, and omnipotence and that He is independent of all others &ndash; this view is at variance with the _śruti_s and the _smṛti_s. It is not based on any general proposition such as: &ldquo;Wherever an auxiliary condition is required, there cannot be a single <em>upāya</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where an accessory is required, there is no independent doership&rdquo;). Since there are these objections and others, this view is based on fallacious reasoning. If it were considered sound reasoning, it would mean that, even in <em>upāsana</em>, whatever is accepted as auxiliary should be rejected as unnecessary.</p>
<p>If it were further argued that even <em>upāsana</em> is not a means or <em>upāya</em>, it would be inconsistent with what has been stated elsewhere by those who hold this view, for while commenting on the passage, &ldquo;Having given up all _dharma_s, seek refuge under me&rdquo;, they interpret the word <em>dharma</em> as <em>upāsana</em> or <em>upāya</em> for the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em>. If they contend that in order to remove Arjuna&rsquo;s haughtiness, <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa prescribes unnecessary burdens and uses the word <em>dharma</em> to mean what Arjuna, in his delusion or inability to understand the real purport of the teaching, considers as necessary _upāya_s in the phrase &ldquo;all _dharma_s&rdquo;, (the answer is as follows):It is stated (in Yagnyavalkya <em>Smṛti</em> 1-8):&ndash; &ldquo;The adoration of the Lord, personal purity, control of the senses, non-violence, giving in charity, repeating the Vedas, other Vedic rites - among all these, having a vision of the Supreme Being by karına <em>yoga</em>, <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em> and <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> is the highest <em>dharma</em>&rdquo;. Again it is said - &ldquo;Among all _dharma_s, the <em>dharma</em> which consists in the adoration of <em>Viṣṇu</em> is the highest, for He protects His devotee as if he were His own body&rdquo;; and farther, &ldquo;There is no other <em>karma</em>&rdquo; enjoined in the Vedas for the expiation of sins than the adoration of <em>Viṣṇu</em>&rdquo;. If those well-known _dharma_s which are described as supreme and which are activities for <em>mokṣa</em> of the nature of abstention from worldly action, are stated to be no _dharma_s, much more so would the _dharma_s prescribed for worldly ends cease to be _dharma_s, and none of the _śāstra_s would carry any authority or weight. Those who hold those views would then line up with atheists and heretics.</p>
<p>It may be asked: (The words in the Gita are): &ldquo;Give up all _dharma_s&rdquo;. In order that the meaning of the word ‘all’ may not be contracted or reduced in application, since the seeking of the Lord&rsquo;s protection is also denoted by the word <em>dharma</em> just like upāsanas, should it not also be given up, in as much as it is also an <em>upāya</em> or sādhana? Similarly to consider <em>prapatti</em> as a sādhana, or <em>upāya</em> or an auxiliary condition is at variance with the words in the Gita: &ldquo;Give up all _dharma_s or _upāya_s.&rdquo;. We ask in reply :-&quot;(What do you really mean?) If you mean that we should adopt the <em>upāya</em> giving up the thought that it will directly and by itself lead to the end in view, it applies also equally to <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>. If it is meant that we should give up the thought of <em>prapatti</em> being a <em>dharma</em> even for winding the grace of the Lord, we answer, “In that case, you will have to give up even the thought that <em>Siddhopāya</em>, namely, &ldquo;<em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa, is the eternal <em>dharma</em> or <em>upāya</em> &ldquo;, in order that the meaning of all in all _dharma_s may not suffer reduction of application.</p>
<p>If it is argued that what are to be abandoned are all _dharma_s other than the one described in this passage - (namely, the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em> ), the same answer might be given in support of the performance of <em>śaraṇāgati</em> which is prescribed in this very passage: (saranam vraja).A further doubt might arise as follows:- “Upāsanas, as _upāya_s, require that they should be originated or started; _upāsana_s have to be promoted to higher and higher perfection; _upāsana_s require the fulfilment of auxiliary conditions - Not so, this <em>upāya</em>, namely <em>Bhagavān</em>. He does not require to be originated or increased in intensity nor does He require any auxiliary help or means of approach. He is eternal, has neither growth nor decay and has always such qualities as full and perfect compassion which are of His very nature. Without any means of approach, He is ever existent as an <em>upāya</em> and is of irresistible might: Of what use, then, are <em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em> in His case ?&rdquo; The answer is that they help to obtain remission of the punishment which is the cause of <em>samsāra</em> and which has been inflicted for beginningless and successive acts of offence. When these _upāya_s are adopted for other benefits (than <em>mokṣa</em> ) (for instance, <em>svarga</em>), they generate favourable dispositions (in the Lord) suited to the attainment of the respective benefits, just like Jyotishtoma and the like and thus serve as aids. In the case of the man who desires <em>mokṣa</em>, they, as <em>vyāja</em> or <em>Sādhyopāya</em>, cause appeasement in <em>Siddhopāya</em> so as to cancel the punishment and then to remove the contraction of knowledge and the like due to that punishment, so that <em>Siddhopāya</em> or the Lord confers (on the person) benefits extending up to perfect service. It is in this way these _upāya_s help as long as the self lasts.</p>

Therefore those _pramāṇa_s or authoritative passages which state that <em>Siddhopāya</em> (the Lord) confers the ultimate goal of perfect service (<em>kaiṅkarya</em> ) along with preliminary benefits after removing all undesirable hindrances and that sādhyopaya (<em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em>) leads to these benefits by propitiating <em>Siddhopāya</em> - these _pramāṇa_s are both apposite and agree with one another very well.</p>
<p>IS THERE ANY NEED FOR THE <em>ŚĀSTRA</em></p>
<p>ENJOINING <em>PRAPATTI</em> ?</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all this, some may ask: &ldquo;Why should the <em>śāstra</em> enjoin this <em>upāya</em> called <em>prapatti</em>? (The <em>śāstra</em> has to help only when man cannot find out things for himself with his common sense or reason). In ordinary life, when a man is about to sink (into ruin ) because he cannot protect himself, he seeks the protection of some one who happens to be by his side and who has the ability to protect him. In the same way, if a man has understood himself and <em>Iśvara</em> from the śāstra which treats of the existent <em>upāya</em>, will he not seek <em>Iśvara</em> for protection, of his own accord, (without the <em>śāstra</em> enjoining it)? So there is no propriety in the <em>śāstra</em> prescribing <em>prapatti</em> in the place of <em>bhakti</em>.</p>
<p>This question is based on appropriate reasoning but proceeds too far. This is how it goes too far. In ordinary life (in the world) when a man seeks the help of another, he tries to learn before-hand in what way he should approach the other, so that the latter may take pity on him and then he seeks his protection. Similarly we should know who is competent to seek <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s protection and in what manner he should do so, so that the Lord may protect him; there is no <em>pramāṇa</em> or authority other than the <em>śāstra</em> which deals with what should be done and which can tell us how we should proceed to seek His help. It cannot be maintained that, by means of inference (or anumāna), we can understand that the Lord will protect if we seek refuge under Him and then seek His protection. For in that case, every one who has a know. ledge of the truth concerning <em>Iśvara</em> may adopt the means in the manner suggested by his own inference and the texts in the <em>śāstra</em> which prescribe <em>upāsana</em> (<em>bhakti</em>) would then become useless. The distinction that he who is capable should adopt <em>upāsana</em> and the like and that he who is not capable of them should resort to <em>prapatti</em> - this distinction cannot be established by means of inference ( anumāna ). If the stāstra does not enjoin the performance of <em>prapatti</em> in the place of other _upāya_s to those who are incapable of them, they will have to lose the fruit of these other _upāya_s as they are not competent enough for their proper performance. This is how it stands. Though in ordinary life (in the world), we see service to kings and the like conferring certain benefits, yet we hold that in regard to the weaving of garlands, the lighting of lamps, the singing of hymns, the act of prostrating, and so on (in temples), if these things are done without any reference to the _śāstra_s (as to how they should be done!, they will become offences. The worship of <em>Bhagavān</em> and His service have to be done with the right accessories as laid down in the _śāstra_s and the fruits arising therefrom have also to be understood only from the _śāstra_s. In the same way, although we see instances of <em>prapatti</em></p>
<p>io worldly life and the benefits arising therefrom, yet we can understand only from the _śāstra_s the relationship of cause and effect that exists between <em>prapatti</em> performed with particular <em>mantra_s and in accordance with the instructions of the good_ācārya</em> and certain special benefits which would result therefrom. Just as certain special forms of worship and service are prescribed for certain special benefits, <em>prapatti</em>, too, has been enjoined. If it were otherwise, no rules would have to be prescribed for the service of <em>Bhagavān</em>, in the same way as there are none for the service of the king. It would lead to the wrong view that, for <em>prapatti</em> also, the initiation into _mantra_s with the instructions of good_ācārya_s is unnecessary. That even those who are not competent for the utterance of _mantra_s may perform <em>prapatti</em> to the Saviour who has certain specific attributes and that certain specific benefits will be derived therefrom, provided it is performed in the proper way without anything wanting and without any up due excess - this cannot be determined by any sound inference, Therefore just as particular forms of worship and service to <em>Bhagavān</em> are enjoined (in the _śāstra_s) with certain accessories, there is nothing inappropriate in the <em>śāstra</em> prescribing the per formance of <em>prapatti</em> with certain accessories (_aṅga_s ).</p>
<p>THE VIEW THAT <em>UPĀSANA</em> OR <em>BHAKTI</em> IS INCONSISTENT WITH ONE&rsquo;S ESSEN</p>
<p>TIAL NATURE IS WRONG:</p>
<p>There are some who maintain that even among these _upāya_s which are enjoined by the _śāstra_s, upūsanas are opposed to the essential nature (of the <em>jīva</em> ). This should be taken to mean only a desire to praise <em>prapatti</em> with emphasis on it and not to condemn upāsanas ( as being against one&rsquo;s nature). The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(a) It cannot be said that they are against the essential nature of the jīve on the ground that they would destroy the self, for the self is eternal (and cannot be destroyed).</p>
<p>(b) It cannot be stated that the self or soul is, in its essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>), incapable, as the Sankhya says, of being a doer, and is therefore incapable, by its very nature, of performing _upāsana_s. For the self is a doer in <em>bhakti</em> (or upa. sanas) and the like is in the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, and in rendering service (to <em>Bhagavān</em> and to Bhāgavatas). As stated in the <em>Brahma</em> _Sūtra_s: &ldquo;The &lsquo;Self is a doer (capable of endeavour or effort); otherwise the _śāstra_s which enjoin doing certain things and refraining from certain other things would have no purpose or aim&rdquo;, and again, “This &ldquo;doership of the self is dependent on <em>Brahman</em>&rdquo; As stated in these passages, the self is a doer capable of endeavour, though his being a doer is dependent on <em>Bhagavān</em>. If it is maintained that the self is absolutely incapable of action, it would follow that, since purposeful action is the sign or mark, of the existence of a thing, the self is void or non-existent. If it is held that the self merely exists and is without <em>jñāna</em> (or knowledge), without the desire to act, and without the endeavour or effort needed for action, it would follow that it is incapable also of enjoyment (bhoktritvam). This would mean that <em>samsāra</em> is illusory and that there is no need for any <em>upāya</em> for the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em>. The <em>śloka</em> &ldquo;<em>Lakṣmī</em>&rdquo; comes of her own accord to a man who makes no endeavour. Another man does not obtain even food, hard though he works. This is also due to past <em>karma</em>&rdquo; - this <em>śloka</em> should not be interpreted as stating that the _upāya_s prescribed in the _śāstra_s are all of no use. It only emphasises that certain benefits come to a man as a result of certain actions performed in previous (births).</p>
<p>(c) Nor can it be maintained that _upāsana_s are, according to _śāstra_s, against the essential nature of the <em>jīva</em>, because they would bring evil consequences. For, unlike actions performed out of the desire for worldly gains (kāmya) and actions prohibited in the _śāstra_s (nishiddha), which are obstacles to <em>mokṣa</em> and which arise from desire (rāga) and the like, upāsanas cannot bind the soul to <em>samsāra</em>, because they are not performed out of a desire for worldly gains and because they are enjoined in the _śāstra_s only for those who want <em>mokṣa</em>.</p>
<p>Thus upāsanas cannot destroy the essential nature of the self, they are not impossible of performance nor do they bring evil consequences; there is, therefore, no justification for their being considered to be at variance with the essential nature (of the self).</p>
<p>(d) Again it may be argued that since the self is different from such things as the body, there is no propriety in the man who knows that, in his essential nature as the self, there is no such thing as <em>varṇa</em> or <em>āśrama</em>, performing the duties and rites (_dharma_s) and other _upāya_s which are connected with them, because they all arise from the (erroneous) notion. &ldquo;I am a Brahmin, I am a Kṣatriya.&rdquo; (It may be argued) on this ground that these rites and duties (_dharma_s) which are dependent on one&rsquo;s caste (<em>varṇa</em>) and <em>āśrama</em> may justly be considered as being against the essential nature of the self. This argument, too, is not sound for the following reason :&ndash; Even if he understands that, in its essential nature, the self is not Brahmin and the like, yet since he is, owing to certain forms of past <em>karma</em>, in close association with the body which has the attributes of Brahmin and the like, he should not give up the _dharma_s enjoined by the _śāstra_s in accordance with his <em>varṇa</em> and <em>āśrama</em> and also in accordance with his capacity for getting rid of the ills of life and for attaining good things, as long as he is with that body, in the same way as he makes endeavours to ward off such things as hunger and thirst which arise from that association with the body. Therefore it cannot be maintained that these _dharma_s should be given up on the ground that they are against the essential nature of the soul because the body is different from the soul to (the man endowed with discrimination.) In regard to the performance of these _dharma_s, it is not the delusion that the essential nature of the self has Brahminness and the like which gives competence, but the association with the body which has such attributes as Brahminness. Therefore we do not see any conflict between upāsanas and the essential nature of the self on account of the intelligent discrimination between the body and the soul which is necessary for the performance of all <em>dharma</em>. That upāsanas have within them the notion of &ldquo;I&rdquo; (ahamkara) finds no authority or sanction in the _śāstra_s, but was merely assumed by these critics to exist. (In the performance of <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em>, we are enjoined to give up the notion that we are free agents and that we want certain benefits ).</p>
<p>(e) Some say that since <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em> and the like have to be performed with the help of the body and the senses which are adventitious (upādhi) and which were acquired as the result of past <em>karma</em>, they are against the essential nature of the self. To them we reply that, even for a knowledge of one&rsquo;s essential nature and for learning <em>Dvaya</em> and the like, there is need for such things as the mind. (So they would have to say that knowledge of the essential nature and learning <em>Dvaya</em> are against the essential nature.) Thus their objection would extend to the latter also.</p>
<p>THE OBJECTION THAT THE <em>JĪVA</em> WHO IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE LORD CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT ADOPT AN <em>UPĀYA</em>.</p>
<p>(f) It might be asked, “ Whatever that might be, since the <em>jīva</em> exists solely for <em>Iśvara</em> (<em>śeṣa</em> ), he is not expected to protect himself and since he is absolutely subject to the will and control of <em>Iśvara</em>, be cannot protect himself; is it proper then to prescribe a means or <em>upāya</em> as necessary to be adopted by him for his protection and to call this an <em>upāya</em> that is capable of being adopted by him? Whea this is so, <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> and the like are productive of evil to the essential nature of the self (<em>svarūpa</em>); as they are inconsistent with his being a <em>śeṣa</em> who exists only for <em>Iśvara</em> and are not possible of adoption, as they are inconsistent with his being absolutely under the will and control of <em>Iśvara</em>&rdquo;. This objection has already been answered as leading to the logical conclusion of the possibility of salvation for all. If the Lord were to grant a <em>jīva</em> <em>mukti</em> or salvation without any consideration (<em>vyāja</em>) whatsoever, the <em>jīva</em> should be a <em>mukta</em> from beginning less time, If it is beld that <em>Iśvara</em>, being independent and omnipotent, makes a man a <em>mukta</em> whenever He is pleased, it would mean that he is partial to some and cruel to others. Similar heresies would follow : Further those _śāstra_s which prescribe the means for attaining <em>mukti</em> would become meaningless. Therefore in adopting this means enjoined as the result of the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s being a <em>śeṣa</em> there is appropriateness and also a like appropriateness in the owner protecting what is his own. It would become possible to adopt such means as are agreeable to Him with the help of the measure of independence granted (to us) by Him as the Supreme Controller and to expect His favour in regard to the fruit or object of attainment. This _śeṣa_tva or existing solely for the Lord and being absolutely subject to His will and control - these two will help, in the stage of realisation, to perform the kind of service that is agreeable to Him as that ordained by Him.</p>
<p>If these objectors hold that, on account of the knowledge of being the <em>śeṣa</em> and of entire dependence on <em>Iśvara</em>, the <em>jīva</em> should make no effort for his own protection, it would follow that the service (<em>kaiṅkarya</em> ) rendered in accordance with the _śāstra_s for the attainment of the Lord&rsquo;s favour and so also <em>prapatti</em> which is prescribed as possible, would he beyond his competence, because they are understood as being opposed to his essential nature. We have already stated that <em>prapatti</em> is capable of being adopted as a means in as much as it has been prescribed in the words &ldquo;saranam vraja&rdquo; (seek refuge), as something that has to be performed over and above the mere knowledge of the relationship (between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>Iśvara</em> ) arising from the texts. Therefore there is no inappropriateness in the <em>jīva</em>, who exists only for the Lord and who is entirely subject to His control, adopting such means of his own for his protection as he is competent to adopt,</p>
<p>THE OBJECTION THAT THE RITES OF VARŅA AND <em>ĀŚRAMA</em> AND <em>BHAKTI</em> YOGA ARE INCONSISTENT WITH EXCLUSIVE DEVOTION TO THE LORD.</p>
<p>(g) However, it may be stated, since the <em>jīva</em> has understood clearly that He exists solely for <em>Iśvara</em> and for no other, it is opposed to his nature as a supreme and exclusive devotee of the Lord to practise the rites (<em>dharma</em> ) ordained for his varṇa and <em>āśrama</em>, because they imply the mediatorship of other deities (like Agni, Surya and Varuna) and also to practise such things as <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> which have these rites as their <em>aṅga</em> or accessory. It is only s&rsquo;uddha yājis[Śuddha Yajis . Those whose adoration is solely to <em>Bhagavān</em> without any intermediary like Agni, Varuna and the like.] who worship the Lord alone (without any reference to other deities) that deserve to be called men with supreme and exclusive devotion to the Lord (paramaikānti)&quot;. This objection can arise only from a lack of clear understanding of the conclusion arrived at in such treatises as <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em>. It may be asked how. The answer is that in such vidyās as Pratardana and Madhu <em>vidyā</em>, it is distinctly stated that the Supreme Being is to be worshipped or meditated upon by the aspirant for <em>mukti</em> as having Indra and other deities as His body. The author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> has declared that in regard to the rites and duties of the <em>varṇa</em> and <em>āśrama</em> also, which are _aṅga_s or accessories to the vidyās, the object of worship or meditation is only the Supreme Self who has the respective deities as His body. Therefore what is opposed to exclusive devotion to the Lord is the worship of other deities as if they were independent, and also connection with other deities owing to a desire for certain specific fruits, when these deities have nothing to do with the rites and duties which are compulsory and recurrent (<em>nitya</em> ) as well as those which are incidental and occasional (<em>naimittika</em> ). There is no opposition to supreme and exclusive devotion to the Lord in performing one&rsquo;s ordained rites and duties without any attachment to or desire for any other fruit and with the thought that these deities are attributes of the Lord and that such words as Agni denote the Lord who has Agni and the like as His body or attributes. There is no opposition to exclusive devotion, likewise, in following the principle: &ldquo;These words (Agni, Indra etc.) directly denote, by their etymological significance, the Supreme Self. It is not improper to think so. So says Jaimini&rdquo;, for these are rites and duties enjoined (in the _śāstra_s).</p>
<p>(h) &ldquo;But&rdquo;, it may be argued again, &ldquo;the _śāstra_s have enjoined also rites for such things as bewitchment ( abhichāra)<sup id="fnref:299"><a href="#fn:299" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">299</a></sup> to produce conviction. In the same manner, the forms of meditation (or <em>upāsana</em> ) have been enjoined only in order to produce conviction or faith in the efficacy of what is prescribed (by the _śāstra_s) viz., <em>prapatti</em>. It does not mean that they are to be performed. To the aspirant for <em>mukti</em>, the end or object of attainment and the means of attaining it are both one and the same. Therefore the means favourable for the attainment of that end is only <em>Iśvara</em>, It is on account of this that the god presiding over <em>dharma</em> condemned upāsanas as opposed to the end in view, while saying to his son :-&ldquo;O, &ldquo;Bharata, If you are afraid of sins, do not begin any activity and remain with the thought that Nārāyaṇa is the only end to be attained with all your heart.&rdquo; This argument too, is not tenable for the following reasons:</p>
<p>The Vedas prescribe the rites called abhichara for causing the death of one&rsquo;s enemy. They do so in order that by seeing the effect, men may have faith in the <em>śāstra</em>.</p>
<p>(1) The rites of bewitchment ( abhichāra) and the like are sources of evil, because they are performed for purposes or fruits that are evil. Since <em>bhakti</em> or <em>upāsana</em> is enjoined for attaining <em>mokṣa</em>, it cannot be a source of evil:</p>
<p>(2) It would be inconsistent with the view of these critics to hold that <em>bhakti</em> or <em>upāsana</em> is enjoined only to produce an eager desire for the adoption of an easier means, viz., <em>prapatti</em>, by describing a more difficult means, viz, <em>bhakti</em>, for they hold that <em>bhakti</em> is no means at all (to attain <em>mokṣa</em>). Besides, <em>bhakti</em> does not yield its fruit in this life but only after it. So it cannot create faith or conviction in the other means prescribed, viz., <em>prapatti</em>. Men generally adopt, of their own accord, the easier means in preference to the more difficult means. The success of the easier means in producing the desired result will create faith or conviction in regard to the more difficult means and not vice versa. So the more difficult <em>upāya</em> cannot cause faith in the efficacy of the easier means. It will, therefore, have to be argued in support of their view that, when certain fruits or good results which will arise from a main rite or angī are stated to arise from its <em>aṅga</em> or accessory rite, it should be considered only as arthavada or mere praise having no literal truth according to a principle (or nyāya) of the Mimamsakas. Here <em>mokṣa</em> is really the fruit of <em>prapatti</em>, which is the angī and this fruit is, in the view of these critics, for the sake of mere praise (which is not true), assigned to its <em>aṅga</em> <em>bhakti</em> also. So, <em>bhakti</em> is, according to them, really not capable of yielding <em>mokṣa</em>. This argument, too, is no good as it would be inconsistent with the contention of these critics, for they would then have to admit that <em>bhakti</em> is an <em>aṅga</em> or accessory of <em>prapatti</em> (which they deny).</p>
<p>The means or <em>upāya</em>, that is favoured by <em>Iśvara</em>, who is the object of attainment, can be understood only from the <em>śāstra</em> (and it is no use asserting that <em>bhakti</em> is not favoured by Him). Reason is not competent to say that the means, viz., <em>bhakti</em> is opposed to the end in view (<em>Bhagavān</em>). If we are to object to any one thing that is prescribed in the stāstras by reasoning which is against the <em>śāstra</em>, there would, by parity of reasoning, be no validity in any of the things or _dharma_s prescribed in the śāstras and, likewise, in the s&rsquo;astras prescribing <em>prapatti</em> as well.</p>
<p>Further there is no authority for the statement that in the <em>śloka</em> quoted above (from <em>Viṣṇu</em> <em>dharma</em> :66-72), the word pātaka (sin) refers to upāsanas and the like. Therefore since <em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em> are both enjoined for the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>, they are, either of them, to be adopted in accordance with the competence (of the individual concerned).</p>
<p>(i) Nor would it be proper to hold that, though these two <em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em> are enjoined (in the _śāstra_s), <em>bhakti</em> or <em>upāsana</em> and the like are not to be practised in as much as they have not been favoured for adoption by the ācāryas; (for instance) such things as the slaying of a bull for the entertainment of a guest at dinner, though enjoined, are opposed to the traditional practice of the learned (siṣṭa). This objection, too, is not that of a thinking mind. It is only when all the _ācārya_s avoid the performance of a rite or observance, that it should be abandoned in accordance with the saying: &ldquo;Though a ritead has been prescribed in the <em>śāstra</em>, yet if it will retard the attainment of <em>svarga</em> and is also repugnant to the general public, it should not be performed&rdquo;. In regard to the rites in question, since they were adopted by such ancient_ācārya_s as Parāśara who is described by Alavandar as one of the best sages, it cannot be maintained that they are against the traditional observance of all learned men.</p>
<p>(j) In the same way, it cannot be argued that, “though these rites were suitable as _dharma_s to be practised in other yugas, since in Kali Yuga, it is not possible to find men competent to perform such things as the upusana or meditation of the Supreme Self, they are pot suited for observance in this age. That is why it has been said :-“Whatever fruit a nan obtained in Krita Yuga by renunciation (tyāga), whatever fruit a man obtained in the Dvāpara Yuga by the performance of yajnas, whatever a man obtained in Tretayuga by worshipping the Lord, that a man attains in Kali Yuga by the mere mention of His names&rdquo;, and so also in the Mahābhārata &quot; Kali Yuga has this one great advantage, O, king; in Kali, a man gets rid of his past <em>karma</em> by the mere mention of <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s names and attains the Lord&rdquo;: Against this objection we may state that even at the present time, there may be present men who are competent to perform such things as upāsanas and who, like the ancient _ācārya_s, are established in <em>yoga</em> for its own sake, for it is said :-&quot; To the * man who has Govinda at heart, there is Kritayuga in Kali yuga and to him who does not entertain Acyuta at heart, there is Kali Yuga even in Krita Yuga,&quot; If these were not admitted, it would follow that even <em>prapatti</em>, which is different from the mention of the Lord&rsquo;s names (samkārtana) is not to be performed, because it is difficult to find men who are competent to perform it and who have the intense faith (maha visvasa ) necessary for it, for it has been said :-“There is no man (O <em>Brahma</em>) who is competent to be initiated into this mantru. who is competent to perform the rite uttering this <em>mantra</em> or who will listen to it.&quot; Therefore since there is no other objection to such things as upāsanas, they can be said to be unsuitable only for those adhikūrīs who are &ldquo;destitute of all _upāya_s and who have no other way of salvation&rdquo;, because they are inappropriate for their competence in the same way as ablutions by complete immersion in water are unsuitable for those that are ill. It is in regard to such men as do not understand their being incompetent ( for <em>bhakti</em> or <em>upāsana</em> ) and who adopt it as a means that it is said: “It is owing to the weakness of mind which fails to understand its competence or incompetence that a man adopts <em>bhakti</em> as an <em>upāya</em>. Therefore even these upāsanas and the like are, for other adhikārīs, suitable to the extent of their competence. Incompetence for them arises from inability to adopt them or the inability to endure delay (in attaining salvation). The man who has this incompetence adopts <em>prapatti</em>. The man who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as an independent and direct <em>upāya</em> is proclaimed as &ldquo;one who has  performed a sacrifice, one who has done what he ought to do&rsquo; and &lsquo;one who has performed a hundred sacrifices&rsquo; by the Alvars, the great sages and the Lord&rsquo;s _Śāstra_s ( Bhagavat Săstra) and the Vedas. Further these authorities also praise all his activities up to the time of death, as if they were the varied duties connected with yajnas and ending with the final bath (avabhrita). They hold also that, in the same way as the man who has performed a yajna performs the compulsory and occasional rites (<em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> ) after it, the man who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> should perform the duties of his <em>varṇa</em> and <em>āśrama</em> as the commands of the Lord who is omnipotent and that the man who has performed the sacrifice or yajna of the self does not require the performance of any other activity for the fruit desired by him. Therefore as stated in such places as the <em>śloka</em> :-&ldquo;The Yogi is superior to all those who practise austerities (tapas); he is superior also to the jnănīs and to those who perform the rites and duties (ordained for them). Therefore, O Arjuna, become a yogin&rdquo;; the _dharma_s or activities of renunciation are superior to the activities or _dharma_s of action (<em>pravṛtti</em>); so also the <em>yoga</em> connected with the self is superior to all other yogas; of all yogas the highest is the <em>yoga</em> connected with (<em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa), the son of <em>Vāsudeva</em>, for it has been said, &ldquo;The man who fixes his mind on me and worships me with earnest faith should be considered as the highest among yogis&rdquo;. Similarly of all the _vidyā_s or forms of meditation on the Supreme Self, only the particular <em>vidyā</em> which is called nyāsa, <em>nikṣepa</em> and so on is the highest, for, among other reasons, it is easy, it has to be performed only once, and it leads to the attainment of the end soon. This truth regarding the <em>Nyāsa</em> <em>vidyā</em> is stated explicitly in the Bhagavat <em>Śāstra</em> in the following _śloka_s: &ldquo;Of all the austerities (tapas) prescribed for the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em>, the austerity called <em>nyāsa</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) is the highest &ldquo;, and &ldquo;Those who, with their thoughts fixed only on <em>mokṣa</em>, are absorbed in the per</p>
<p>formance of karmayoga and those, again, who follow <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em> aod _bhakti_yoga do not deserve to be placed on a par with even one-ten millionth of the man who has performed <em>prapatti</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To the man who is unable (owing to illness ) to perform such things as ablution by immersion,&rdquo; the medita:ion on  <em>Viṣṇu</em>, which is called mental ablation, is ordained; thereby he obtains not only the purity of those who perform the other kinds of ablution, but acquires freedom from sins and the pleasure of the immediate enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em>. In the same way, though <em>prapatti</em> is ordained for those who are not competent to perform such things as _upāsana_s, it confers the fruits attainable from them; it secures them (the <em>upāya</em>, namely, <em>upāsana</em> also); it redeems the man who is destitute of all other _upāya_s ( <em>akiñcana</em> ); and further it secures the fruit (desired by him) at the time when he wants it. Therefore <em>prapatti</em> has superior potency.</p>
<p>DOES <em>PRAPATTI</em> REQUIRE _AṅGA_S OR ACCESSORIES ?</p>
<p>So far we have removed the misconceptions that may arise about the competence for the <em>upāya</em> and its essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>). Henceforward we will proceed to remove those misconceptions that might be entertained in regard to accessories of that <em>upāya</em>. (1) Is it necessary that this <em>upāya</em> should be accompanied by such things as the determination to do what is agreeable (ānukūlya <em>saṅkalpa</em> )? Will the Saviour who said, “If a * man seeks protection with the desire for the immediate attainment of an object (arta ) or with endurance of delay in the attainment (dripta), he should be protected by those who know the _śāstra_s, even though he might be an enemy,&rdquo; &ldquo;I will, in no circumstances, abandon one who has come to me in the guise of a friend, even though there are faults in him. The great will appreciate this,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bring him here, O Sugrīva, whether he be Vibhishana or even Ravana himself. I promise protection to him&rdquo; - ( will the Saviour who said these words) and who was gracious even to his enemies care for the faults of those who have sought refuge under him? The ancients describe Him as the Protector of the whole world without any consideration of merit. Therefore these accessories (such as anukulya <em>saṅkalpa</em>) are not requisites but attributes that are most likely to be met with in those who have performed <em>prapatti</em>.&rdquo; Such is the contention of some critics. In reply to this misconception, it may be said that the passages on which it is based may really have, for their purport, the idea that though such attributes as anukulya do not continue after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, some expiation will occur and there will be no diminution in the fruit of <em>prapatti</em>, (They do not mean that qualifications like <em>ānukūlyasaṅkalpa</em> are not required at the time of the performance of <em>prapatti</em>). If this explanation is not accepted, many authoritative passages which distinguish between the main rite (<em>aṅgī</em>) and its accessories (<em>aṅga</em>) such as &ldquo;<em>Śaraṇāgati</em> is of six kinds,&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Nyāsa</em> has five _aṅga_s&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let him perform that <em>prapatti</em> which has five accessories &quot; - many such authoritative passages would offer opposition. We have already stated that (the absence of these accessories) would be against what is the subject of experience in the world in regard to the conventions regarding the surrender of objects that have to be protected and that these accessories are required only once and so on. Even the divine missile, <em>Brahmāstra</em>, requires its own accessories (_aṅga_s). Hence the <em>śloka</em> that there is no other requisite for <em>prapatti</em> anywhere and at any time&rdquo; only states that it does not require any other <em>dharma</em> or rite. (It does not mean that even) the _aṅga_s of <em>prapatti</em> are not required). Otherwise even intense faith (mahavisvasa) which these critics commend as an <em>aṅga</em> might be considered as an attribute which may be found (in a <em>prapanna</em>) and not as an <em>aṅga</em>.</p>
<p>WHY SHOULD INTENSE FAITH BE CALLED AN</p>
<p><em>AṅGA</em> INSTEAD OF MERE FAITH ?</p>
<p>In this connection, some others may contend as follows:&mdash; “When the believer has faith in what is stated in the _śāstra_s, what is the meaning of saying that there is something else called &lsquo;intense faith&rsquo; or mahavisvasa? Therefore there is no point in bolding that this mahāvisvõsa is anything other than the faith in the <em>śāstra</em> which is general and that it is a special <em>aṅga</em> or accessory of <em>prapatti</em>. This contention (or objection) is refuted by the well-known fact that there are degrees of faith as stated in the <em>śloka</em>:&ldquo;One should never place confidence in a man whom one does not trust. Even in a man whom one trusts, too much confidence should not be reposed.&rdquo; It is also refuted by the text which prescribes extra ordinary faith as an <em>aṅga</em> or accessory (in regard to <em>prapatti</em> ).</p>
<p><em>Bhagavān</em> Nārada  has declared in _Śrī_mad <em>aṣṭākṣara</em> <em>Brahma</em> <em>Vidyā</em> that there are, in different men, varying degrees of faith in the <em>Mūlamantra</em>. (He says):- &ldquo;In proportion to the degree of faith that a man has in <em>aṣṭākṣara</em>, will he attain the fruit thereof. It is impossible to measure its greatness.&rdquo; The Supreme Ruler of all will ultimately protect even those prapannas who are far from perfect and whose faith is not strong enough. If authority is asked for this statement, here it is :&ndash;&ldquo;By the man who has once uttered the two syllables &lsquo;Harih&rsquo; - by him steps have been taken for entering <em>mokṣa</em>&rdquo;. In accordance with this, Alavandar has conveyed the same idea in the <em>śloka</em> :&ndash; &ldquo;Whoever&rsquo; folds his hands in worship to Thee in any manner and at any time - his sins vanish at once. It generates all good things. It never fails to bear fruit,&rdquo; and so also, “A single&quot; drop of the ocean of nectar called <em>bhakti</em> towards the two lotuses of Thy feet will extinguish instantly the spreading wildfire called <em>samsāra</em> and confer superior happiness&quot;. By uttering the three syllables &ldquo;Govinda&rdquo;, Kshatrabandu, who stood surrounded by his past karmas swarming (like ants ), attained the highest state.&quot; As implied in these passages, <em>Iśvara</em> will promote the perfection of the <em>upāya</em> And protect the man. Has not this idea been conveyed by <em>Śrī</em> Śāṇḍilya <em>Bhagavān</em> to Devala in the following <em>śloka</em> :- &ldquo;Many of your previous births ended in vain. Consider how this life, too, may end in vain and perform <em>prapatti</em>? Froin the <em>śloka</em> :-&ldquo;The divine seers say that Thou art to be sought as the Saviour and that &lsquo;Thou protectest those who have sought Thy protection.&rdquo; &ndash; (from this <em>śloka</em>) it should be understood that intense faith can be found (only) in the divine seers and not in ordinary men) and that, by the authority of what is said by the divine seers, those whose faith is not strong should strengthen it. Therefore since there are varying degrees of faith, what is stated in the <em>śāstra</em> about intense faith being an <em>aṅga</em> of <em>prapatti</em> cannot be objected to.</p>
<p>CAUSES OF THE DECAY OF FAITH AND THE</p>
<p>REMEDY THEREFOR</p>
<p>We will now show how some people suffer from diminution of faith and state how this tendency can be corrected. Some may ask: - &ldquo;How could <em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em> lead to such opposite results as worldly prosperity and <em>mokṣa</em>  merely because of the difference in the mental attitude (of those who adopt them)? Have we ever seen the same seed yielding two different fruits owing to the diversity of intentions in the (mind of the) sower? The answer to this question is as follows:- &ldquo;The <em>śāstra</em> which is the (sole) authority in regard to matters pertaining to it in the same way as sense perception (pratyaksha) is in regard to what pertains to it &ndash; the <em>śāstra</em> can certainly declare it to be so and reason has no right to attempt to disprove it. In worldly life, if we give an object to a charitable and generous king as an article for sale, we shall obtain a liberal return; but if it is given (without any thought of such return) merely as an offering or tribute, we see it produce whatever is desired (by the person).</p>
<p>These two <em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em>, are of the nature of a rite prompted by <em>pravṛtti</em> (activity prompted by worldly interests), when they are adopted by a person who expects some benefit other than (<em>mokṣa</em>) and in the case of those who desire only the feet of <em>Bhagavān</em>, they are of the nature of a rite of renunciation (<em>nivṛtti</em>). The same holds good of such things as the rites and duties which are compulsory and regularly recurrent and those which are compulsory and occasional (ritya and <em>naimittika</em>),</p>
<p>If it be asked whether üpasāna (<em>bhakti</em>) and <em>prapatti</em>, which are different in their nature since the former has to be repeated continuously (till death) and the latter to be performed only once &ndash; whether these two could yield the same fruit; the answer is as follows:- &ldquo;It is certainly possible, since it depends upon the competency of the person (adopting the <em>upāya</em>), as in worldly life and in the Vedic tradition.</p>
<p>To those aspirants to <em>mukti</em> who have adopted <em>prapatti</em> as an independent and direct means, the <em>upāya</em> (means) and the end (which is) <em>mokṣa</em>, namely, the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em> are one and the same (i. e) <em>Bhagavān</em>. However, owing to the degree of urgency (tvarā) in the desire for <em>mokṣa</em> which arises from the suffering of <em>samsāra</em>, there may be delay or absence of delay in the attainment of the fruit in accordance with the time when it is respectively desired by the persons concerned (viz.) ārta and dripta).</p>
<p>The reason why the Alvars, Nāthamuni and the like obtained such things as direct vision (sākshatkāra) of <em>Bhagavān</em>, while others who adopted <em>prapatti</em> had to go without it is (two fold)&ndash;the difference in the desire for the fruit expressed at the time of <em>prapatti</em> and also the difference in the past good <em>karma</em> which had begun to operate in this life.</p>
<p>Though that part of the fruit formerly desired is certain owing to the performance of <em>prapatti</em> on a single occasion, yet, if a person eagerly desires some other part of the fruit not desired before, a further <em>prapatti</em> is also appropriate.</p>
<p>Some critics may entertain doubts in regard to the effectiveness of <em>prapatti</em> which is the means of attaining all benefits without exception, when it is found that some forms of <em>prapatti</em> intended to secure t_aṅgī_ble benefits in this life itself fail to do so. These critics should be made to understand that if there is no effect, it is due to some defect in the activity (<em>karma</em>), in the doer (karta) or in the means or accessories ( sadhana ), just as in the case of other rites prescribed in the _śāstra_s. (For instance, the śāstra says, “He who desires rain should perform a yajna with kariri (bamboo sprouts )&rdquo;. If the rain does not follow the yajna, it must be due to some defect in the performance of the <em>karma</em>, in the doer, or in the sacrificer or in the accessories or sadhanas employed in the sacrifice). Defect in the performance (of <em>prapatti</em>) consists in the lack of intense faith, (mahavisvasa ), and the like, Defect in the doer consists in the absence of competency prescribed for <em>prapatti</em>. Defect in the sadhanas or accessories is the absence of such things as the teaching of the wise which is essential for the performance of <em>prapatti</em> in accordance with the _śāstra_s. When <em>prapatti</em> is done without any of these defects, we see even the attainment of visible and (t_aṅgī_ble) fruits that have been desired as the result.</p>
<p>Yet others might contend as follows:-&ldquo;Such sages as Vyāsa who are alike the expounders of all _śāstra_s including the <em>śāstra</em> on <em>prapatti</em> state:&ndash; &ldquo;After studying all the _śāstra_s and after frequent investigation of their meaning with the help of reason, this one truth alone becomes evident: Nārāyaṇa should always be meditated on,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hari alone is fit to be meditated on always by people like you who are sāttvikas.&rdquo; &quot; <em>Viṣṇu</em> &quot; is constantly to be meditated on. He should never be forgotten.&rdquo; When they have arrived at this conclusion, how could it be said that, by the performance of <em>prapatti</em> on a single occasion, <em>mokṣa</em> could be attained? The passage in the Gita which says :- &quot; Those  who perform <em>prapatti</em> to me alone, get over mayā which cannot be easily got over &ndash; this passage and others like it refer to <em>prapatti</em> which is an <em>aṅga</em> or accessory to <em>bhakti</em> (<em>upāsana</em>) or meditation, Similarly such texts as the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em> should be considered as prescribing <em>prapatti</em> with its accessories only as an <em>aṅga</em> of <em>bhakti</em>&rdquo;. This contention of theirs is inappropriate. (For it has been said): &quot; Those who are incapable of meditation (<em>upāsana</em> or <em>bhakti</em>) and seek Thee as their <em>upāya</em>-even they cross over <em>samsāra</em> and enter Thy abode, <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em>,” “Whatever object is desired, by whatsoever person and whatever cannot be obtained by other means, and that <em>mokṣa</em> from which abode there is no return and which cannot be attained by <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em>, jñānayoga, or <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>, all these fruits are obtained, O great sage, by those who respectively strive for them by the performance of <em>prapatti</em>. The Supreme Self is attained only thereby.&rdquo; As stated in these passages, if <em>prapatti</em> adopted as a direct and independent <em>upāya</em> is well established, the <em>prapanna</em> acquires, as its reward, the capacity to meditate constantly on Nārāyaṇa as stated in <em>Śrī</em> <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em> <em>Gadya</em>. This is just like milk being a suitable drink for both the healthy man and the man who is in ill-health. Though meditation (<em>upāsana</em> or <em>bhakti</em>) with its (Vedic) <em>aṅga_s is not within the competency of every one, yet it is not impossible for everyone to meditate on the Lord in such measure as is possible for one with his competency, as may be seen in the passage - &ldquo;May 1, &ldquo;as the result of Thy will, be endowed with the power of constantly meditating on Thee!&rdquo; The author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em>, too, after teaching this <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) in his smaller <em>Gadya</em> (<em>Śrī</em> R_aṅga</em> <em>Gadya</em>) and in the longer <em>Gadya</em> (<em>Śaraṇāgati</em> <em>Gadya</em>) and referred to it briefly in the Vaikuṇṭhagadya, is pleased to teach this form of</p>
<p>meditation so that the desire for the end in view may gain in strength without suffering any diminution. He does so in the passage which begins as follows: &ldquo;In order to that one may continue to live the life of the spirit, one should meditate in this manner,&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE RITES <em>NITYA</em> AND NAIMITTIKA ARE,</p>
<p>ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE GIVEN UP BY THE <em>PRAPANNA</em>:</p>
<p>The author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> has also described in his <em>Nitya</em> the special form of worship (poojā) which is referred to in &ldquo;I spent my time in studying the books which mention the attributes of the Lord, in listening to others reading them and in worshipping Him,&rdquo; (The description) begins (with the sentence):- &ldquo;I will now explain the manner in which the man with exclusive devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em> should perform the adoration (ārādhana) of the Lord, Having become a worshipper with supreme and exclusive devotion to Him and with a desire only to serve Him&rdquo;, he goes on to say, &ldquo;Remain meditating (on the Lord) with a vision as clear as visual perception and with extreme love ( to Him)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This service to the Lord which is the overflow of uninterrupted meditation and seeks no other interest or profit and which consists in five forms of service in the course of the day, is in accord with what is enjoined in the scripture of <em>Bhagavān</em> (Bhagavat <em>Śāstra</em> ) and with what has been prescribed by Vyāsa, Daksha and other great sages. It is also implicit in the following Tamil verses: &ldquo;Giving up anger and deceit and controlling the senses, one should perform adoration five times in the day&rdquo;, as commented on by the ācāryas. &ldquo;Approaching&rdquo; the Lord in the morning (abhigamana), then proceeding to collect the materials required for his worship (upādāna); next performing the adoration (aradhana), afterwards uttering the sacred _mantra_s (japa); lastly meditating on the Supreme Lord (<em>dhyāna</em>); thas in the aforesaid five parts of the day, I will spend my days adoring Him with the good incense and flowers gathered by me with my own effort.&rdquo; Having heard, from the author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em>, this five-fold division of the day and what should be done in each, V_aṅgī_puram Nambi briefly summarised it in his <em>Nitya</em> in the words quoted above. This may be seen also in the treatise on daily life written by Periajeer and others. Any differences that might appear in these descriptions are easily explained as due to differences found in different Samhitas.</p>
<p>Hence the <em>prapanna</em> should spend his time in accordance with such <em>śāstra_ic scheme of life as has been taught by his_ācārya</em> in rendering service to <em>Bhagavān</em> with no other purpose than to please Him. (In this context the following passages may be borne in mind):- &ldquo;I do not desire to go to the divine world leaving Thee; oor do I desire to enjoy immortality so also without Thee, I have no desire for the glory which comes of ruling the world&rdquo;. “ You will enjoy yourself with Sītā on the slopes of the mountains. I will render all service to you whether you are awake or asleep&rsquo;&rsquo;. &ldquo;I may be born to any one in whatever family; (wherever I may be born), may I have the eager longing to enjoy the pleasure of rendering service to Thee! I will never do anything on behalf of any other deity with my body, mind, speech or head&rdquo;. &ldquo;The only object that I have in view is that the Lord should take me into His service for His own pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This daily worship of <em>Bhagavān</em> consisting of abhigamana (approach) (and the four other duties) should not be done for the sake of such things as vanity, gain or honours as done by up believers; nor should it be done for the sake of any other object in</p>
<p>view (than pleasing <em>Bhagavān</em>, as may be done by those who have no knowledge of the truth and have not yet acquired freedom from the desire for worldly pleasures (vairāgya) and other such virtues. Without any desire even for the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em> as by those who adopt <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> but have not completed it, if this mode of worship is performed with the sole desire of doing what is agreeable to the Lord for its own sake, as it is done by those who have already attained <em>mukti</em>, this abhigamana (approach) and other things will shield the <em>prapanna</em> from the approach to other deities (abhigamana), from activities for the sake of other interests (upadana), from yajnas to other deities, from words about other (deities ) and from meditation (<em>dhyāna</em> ) of the other deities.</p>
<p>Perialwar has pointed out that there will be no approach to other deities (abhigamana) in the following verse - &ldquo;Now to that I have the austerity (tapas) of rendering service to Thee, it would be a detraction from Thy glory, if I were hereafter to stand with bowed head in front of the house of any other. Kindly note&rdquo;, He has also pointed out that there will be no activity for securing other things (upādāna) in the verge :&ndash; &ldquo;I will not so beg of Thee food for eating or cloth for wear.&rdquo; That there will be no yajna or sacrifice to others is brought out in passages like these :- &ldquo;She will never adore any deity other than <em>Bhagavān</em> even in her thoughts”, “Who else merits our flowers and our adoration than our Lord ?&rdquo; &ldquo;(The worship of other deities than <em>Bhagavān</em>) is like washing a wooden doll when ones&rsquo; mother is at hand to be served&rdquo;, and &ldquo;O men&rdquo; of the world who neglect <em>Bhagavān</em> and worship _jīva_s as if they were deities! Are you washing a wooden doll with warm water when similar service can and should be rendered to the mothers that gave you birth? Are you without the grace of the Lord tbat you cannot render service to Him ?.&rdquo; In the discourse of the seven sages also, it has been declared thus :</p>
<p>“He who has stolen the<sup id="fnref:300"><a href="#fn:300" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">300</a></sup> bulb of the lotus - let him worship other deities than <em>Viṣṇu</em>, who does good to Brahmins, who exercises control over the gods, who is worshipped by all those who live in the three worlds, who is the cause of the creation, the maintenance, and the destruction of the three worlds, who is under the control of no one else, who is the support of the world and who both creates and destroys the world, and who is the <em>guru</em> of the world,&quot; and again, “He who has stolen the bulb of the lotus - he is one who never performs those _dharma_s which please the Lord, who never favours them, and who is of such a nature that he practises evil _dharma_s and evil rites.&quot; That the <em>prapanna</em> will never utter the praise of others is declared in verses like the following:&ndash;Tiruvoymozhi 3-9 and also in: &ldquo;The mouth will never sing the praise of any one other than the Lord.” So also that the <em>prapanna</em> will never think of others is declared in the following passages :-&ldquo;My thoughts are never with any deity other than the Lord. <em>Bhagavān</em> who helps the gods is aware of this.&rdquo; and &ldquo;I will never think that there are other deities that I want to attain and that will come to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During a famine, seven sages obtained the bulb of a lotus for food and went out for their bath. Indra stole it and hid it. When the sages returned and found it missing, each of them had to swear in these words to prove that he had not stolen it.</p>
<p>(Our ancient seers) have declared that even those who are not competent to perform this five-fold scheme of adoration may not fail to render this service or <em>kaiṅkarya</em>, if they will perform such compulsory and occasional rites as they are competent for, if they sing the praise of the Lord and the like and if they render service to such persons as have the competency to perform that adoration and as have exclusive devotion to the Lord in accordance with their competence and in perfect dependence on them. And this may be seen in the following passages :-“The adoration of <em>Viṣṇu</em> is</p>
<p>superior to all other adorations. The adoration of Viṣṇu&rsquo;s devotee, which is different from it, is said to be superior even to that &ldquo;; &ldquo;Satagopan&rdquo; is ever in the company of the servants of <em>Bhagavān</em> who saved Gokula with the hill (as an umbrella)&rdquo; and &ldquo;The tapas of those who are attached to the devotees of the Lord will surpass that of (even) those who sing the praise of the Lord.&rdquo; The joy of those who render this service and of those who look with delight on this service rendered by them is of the same nature as that of <em>Iśvara</em>, who alone is competent to rule over the affairs of the world (jagad vyāpāra) and of those who have already attained <em>mukti</em> and merely look on. There is nothing inappropriate in this joy being the same in the case of those who perform the service and of those who look on it with delight, for it is just like the purifying influence described in the following <em>śloka</em> :-&ldquo;To hear of the performance of <em>dharma</em> ( done by others), to see it, to think of it, to speak of it and to find delight in it - all these, O best of kings, purify always the person doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So also it is said in the Mahābhārata :-&ldquo;Therefore a Śūdra should not utter my names with the <em>praṇava</em> (the syllable Om), and in the Nāradiyakalpa &ldquo;The japa of the ashtakshara has been prescribed, for women and for Śūdras to be performed without the dative suffix thus:- (namonārayana). Similarly there are no rules for them about the svara, about <em>praṇava</em> and about touching the limbs (_aṅga_nyāsa ). It is declared in the _śāstra_s that for women and for Śūdras, japa consists in the mere utterance of the <em>mantra</em> (without them)&rdquo;. In the Varāhapurāṇam, it is said, “The man born of the caste of those who eat dog&rsquo;s flesh woke up as soon as the day dawned, finished his obser. vance which consisted in singing the praise of <em>Bhagavān</em> and returned after uttering the <em>mantra</em> &ldquo;Namo Nārāyaṇa&rdquo;. So also we find the following :- &quot; If a man goes to <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em> uttering the mūlamantra, &lsquo;Namo Nārana&rsquo; with his hands folded in reverence over his head, he will never return to the world of <em>samsāra</em> etc , and “If one is &ldquo;to utter the name of <em>Bhagavān</em>, one should say &ldquo;<em>namo</em> Narana&rdquo;. The middle of the sugar.cane (i.e.) <em>aṣṭākṣara</em> with eight joints becomes suitable to everyone, if the root and the top (i.e.) the first and the last syllable are cut off. So also there is nothing inappropriate in all prapannas enjoying the delight (rasa) of thinking of <em>Bhagavān</em> at any time whatever. It is only for <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>, which has its _aṅga_s or accessories and which is different from <em>prapatti</em>, that some are not competent. Even though <em>prapatti</em> becomes perfect by the rite which lasts only for a moment (we are taught) thus by the Saviour: &ldquo;Always utter the dvaya with the thought of its meaning (in your mind)&rdquo;. Therefore the command &ldquo;Nārāyaṇa is to be meditated on always&rdquo; should be taken as an <em>upāya</em> for some (viz. those who adopt <em>bhakti</em>) and as the fruit for others, (namely prapannas). Thus the command is in no way opposed to <em>prapatti</em> adopted as a direct and independent means.</p>
<p><em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> has explained in such treatises as <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> how <em>prapatti</em> is an <em>aṅga</em> to <em>bhakti</em> or <em>upāsana</em>. In the <em>Gadya</em> he explains how <em>prapatti</em> can also be an independent and direct means. It is true we find the following :-&ldquo;There is nothing other than <em>yoga</em> which can destroy such evil traits as ignorance (a_vidyā_) (and conceit)” and, “Past karmas cannot be destroyed even in ten thousand births without <em>yoga</em>. Only the fire of <em>yoga</em> can consume away the dry grass of <em>karma</em>.&rdquo; But since <em>prapatti</em> has been enjoined as a direct and independent means, on the strength of that ordinance, the passages cited above (on <em>yoga</em>) should be considered as applicable only to those others who are competent for them.</p>
<p>Similarly answers to other misconceptions that might arise in regard to sūdhyopāya (<em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em>) may be found in <em>Nikṣepa</em> raksha. <em>Sādhyopāya</em> as clarified in this chapter should be borne in mind in regard to the three mysteries (_mantra_s) in the appropriate place.</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>वरिक्किण्ड्रनन् परन् यावरैयॆन्नु मऱैयदनिल्</p>
<p>विरिक्किण्ड्रदुङ्गुऱियॊण्ड्राल् विनैयरैयादलिनाम्</p>

<p>The <em>Śruti</em> states at length that the Supreme Being chooses those who should win His grace; but this choice (of the <em>jīva</em> bound by <em>karma</em> for the bestowal of His grace) is based on some consideration. Therefore we obtain redemption by the mercy of the Lord who, as antaryāmī, supports the world and, as Saviour, helps us cross the sea of <em>samsāra</em> and by understanding clearly the good paths for winning His grace (<em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em>) as described in the śāstras.</p>

<p>The essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of the Omnipresent Lord (vibhu), what and of what description are His qualities, His vibhavas (avatārs), His sportful activities and the like and the limits set by His command &ndash; all these can be determined from the śrutis. So also the greatness of His devotees and the potency of the ways in which we should worship Him (<em>bhakti</em>) and the like (<em>prapatti</em>) have been determined by great men like <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> in accordance with what is stated (in the _sūtra_s).</p>
<p>We have so far shown the manner in which the misconceptions that arise in regard to the <em>Siddhopāya</em> which is revealed by the words in the second or accusative case in <em>Dvaya</em> (<em>Śrīman</em> Nārāyaṇa <em>caraṇau</em>) and Saranam and the specific <em>Sādhyopāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) mentioned in the predicate (prapadye) can be removed. It now remains to clear those misconceptions that may arise about the potency of the <em>upāya</em> - misconceptions assigning to it a greater or less potency than that warranted by the pramāņas (sources of true knowledge ).</p>
<p>THE GREATNESS OF THE DEVOTEES OF</p>
<p>BHAGAVĀN:</p>
<p>Those who have adopted these _upāya_s are, indeed, described as having the greatness of being capable of securing redemption even to those who are connected with them. It is said: “Their &lsquo;fathers and their grand-fathers dance in joy clapping (their hands) saying: “A devotee of <em>Viṣṇu</em> is born into our family and he will help to save us from <em>samsāra</em> &quot; and again, &quot; Those seven&rsquo; generations of men who were born before into my family and those seven generations who will be born after me have become the servants of the Lord. We have obtained this glorious and great existence&rdquo;. Similarly it has indeed been stated that the greatness of the man who has a knowledge of <em>Bhagavān</em> cannot be (adequately) estimated by the gods even &ldquo;: &ldquo;Even the gods cannot measure the greatness of the man who knows <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa as He is &ldquo;. However we will now state the limits (of this greatness) so far as caste is concerned, by the force of _pramāṇa_s which are not opposed to these texts (quoted above).</p>
<p>DOES <em>PRAPATTI</em> ENTITLE A ŚŪDRA TO BE</p>
<p>CONSIDERED A BRAHMIN</p>
<p>It is said: “Those Sūdras&rdquo; who have devotion&rsquo; (<em>bhakti</em> ) to <em>Bhagavān</em> are not Śūdras; they who are devotees of <em>Bhagavān</em> are Brahmins. Those who have no <em>bhakti</em> to <em>Bhagavān</em> (<em>Janārdana</em>), whatever might be their caste - they alone are sūdras&rdquo;. Thus by the presence or absence in them of the specific attribute of <em>bhakti</em> to <em>Bhagavān</em>, men of lower castes are called by the names of the higher and men of higher castes are called by the names of the lower respectively. From this, men of poor understanding might ask, “Are not the devotees of <em>Bhagavān</em> of one and the same caste?&rdquo; If this view were accepted, it would be in conflict with all the śāstras that prescribe the respective course of right conduct stating, &ldquo;Thus will the devotee of the Lord who is a Brahmin conduct himself and thus will the devotee who is a Śūdra conduct himself.&rdquo; The distance that exists between the mere Brahmin and the mere Śūdra should be considered to exist (also) between the Lord&rsquo;s devotee who is a Brahmin and the Lord&rsquo;s devotee who is a Śūdra. The _śāstra_s which state that they are equal refer only to such things as the attainment of the final goal (<em>mokṣa</em>). Kadambi Appullar has made this point clear. Further learned scholars (like Peria Achan Pillai) while commenting on the verse, &ldquo;The name, Nārāyaṇa confers a (higher) kulam&rdquo;, express the following conclusion:- &ldquo;If a man who is low by birth and by conduct attains contact with <em>Bhagavān</em>, one who has them both should shrink from calling him low, because of the potency of his devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em>&rdquo;. In answer to the question . “But this does not mean intermarriage among them &ldquo;, they declared that this (prohibition of inter-marriage) is due to caste and that the praise of the man is due to his possession of virtues. The words, &quot; It confers a higher kulan&rdquo;, and likewise, the passage - “ We will give up our former kulam, and sing the praise of <em>Bhagavān</em> &quot; mean only exaltation in the Vaiṣṇava kulam. His kulam is indeed such as will not entertain the worship of other deities as well as the Lord. The saying current in the families of those who are exclusively devoted to <em>Bhagavān</em> (ekantī) is indeed as follows : &ldquo;He to &lsquo;whom <em>Vāsudeva</em> is not the (sole) deity from birth to death let him not be born into our family and even if he is born, let him die soon.&rdquo; Though the kulam is changed, since the words caste and kulam have been used in different senses, we may say that the caste will remain the same, but that the kulam will be different. &quot; Though the cow may be of the temple, it does not cease to be a cow&rdquo;. In such passages as this:-&ldquo;He should be considered as a Śūdra&rdquo;, the great sages called men of higher castes by the words applicable to the lower castes and vice versa merely to indicate the degree of consideration or respect to be shown. Therefore the purport of the <em>śāstra</em> is only this much:“Brahmins who are not devotees of <em>Bhagavān</em> are not to be held in esteem, whereas Śūdras who are devotees of <em>Bhagavān</em> should be as much esteemed as Brahmins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this were not accepted (as the right interpretation), all rules and regulations (regarding caste) would be set at naught on the strength of the censure and praise (which) alone are intended to be conveyed) in such passages as the following :- &ldquo;Auspicious qualities which carry esteem do not arise from caste. The gods consider as a Brahmin even a caṇḍāla who conducts himself in accordance with his caste,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sannyasins and those who perform tapas (austerities) become caṇḍālas when they lapse from the code of conduct prescribed for them&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Because&rdquo; a man&rsquo;s hair has turned grey, he is not esteemed as old. He who has <em>jñāna</em>, even if he be a child, is esteemed by the gods as an old man&quot;. This is the right explanation of all such passages :</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em> :</p>
<p>प्रतिपत्तिविशेषार्थमन्यत्रान्यत्वकीर्तनम् । विशेषविधिसाकांक्षास्तत्र तत्तत् प्रवृत्तयः’’ ॥</p>
<p>When a member of one caste is praised as being of another Caste, it is to state that he should be esteemed as such at heart. But social conduct is regulated by special rules governing it.</p>
<p><em>Śrī</em> Vidura, too, performed marriages and the like in accordance with the rules of his caste. “After the best of the Brahmins had eaten, <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;&rsquo; sat on a high seat and ate the pure and delicious food offered by Vidura.” On bearing of this, Duryodhana said to <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa:-&ldquo;Without coming to Bhīṣma, Droṇa or to me, O Thou of lotus eyes, why didst thou eat, O Madhusūdana, in the house of a Śūdra?&rdquo; <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa replied, “The food&quot; offered by an enemy should not be eaten. (So also ) an enemy should not be given food to eat. You hate the Pandavas, O king. Are they not my very life?&quot; In answering thus, it is evident that <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa admitted the truth of the particular caste ascribed to Vidura by Duryodhana.</p>
<p>It may be asked: &ldquo;Is not the eating of food cooked by a Śūdra forbidden to Brahmins and Kṣatriyas ?&rdquo; The answer is as follows: &ldquo;Apastamba and others state that Śūdras who are under the supervision of Aryas are competent to cook their food&rdquo;, In other yugas (than Kali) there was no prohibition, because good Śūdras under the control of Aryas were permitted to cook the food of the Aryas. (We read) further :&ndash; &ldquo;The pure Vidura, having the qualities necessary for it, brought the food.&rdquo; testifies to it, as Vidura&rsquo;s exceptional qualities are referred to.</p>
<p>When this <em>Brahma</em> Jnani (Vidura) gave up his life by the power of <em>yoga</em>, _Dharma_putra (it is true) felt it his duty (as his nephew) to perform his funeral obsequies in the special form (of _Brahma_medha ). But it may have been performed in silence (without _mantra_s;) or it was justifiable in the case of that exceptional individual. This should not be considered as a precedent in the case of other individuals (as a principle applicable to all). If (this answer) were not accepted, it would follow that, because the virtuous Pandavas had a common wife, owing to the force of certain exceptional circumstances, others, too, might do likewise. (This would lead to promiscuity in social relations ). Therefore each individual should stand firm in his caste and render service (<em>kaiṅkarya</em>) to <em>Bhagavān</em> in accordance with what is prescribed as competent for that caste. .</p>
<p>Those who abide by the śāstras should not believe in the elevation from (lower) castes stated in the deceptive _śāstra_s (of heretics ). The case of such as Visvamitra (who became a Brahmin after being a Kṣatriya, was due to certain special causes as the charu (oblation of grain cooked in milk and other things) eaten by his mother without knowing that it was intended for pro ducing a Brahmin child - it should not be considered that it is applicable to others as well, for it is against the texts (in the s&rsquo;astras). The incidents and conduct of the Alvars who were possessed of powers even superior to those of Vidura and others should not be taken as precedents for our conduct. If we examine even their cond.ict carefully, (we shall find) that they did not transgress the rules of their respective castes.</p>
<p>The <em>śloka</em> :-&quot;<em>Viṣṇu</em>&quot; is always to be praised (in song) with true knowledge (<em>jñāna</em>). Therefore the pure knowledge concerning the eternal Lord should be obtained in clearness either from Brahmins or from Kṣatriyas or from Vaiśyas or from Śūdras or from even lower castes - this <em>śloka</em> means merely that since knowledge of <em>Bhagavān</em> is essential as an acquisition, mere knowledge in its clearness should be obtained, when men of the previous castes are not available, even from those that are below them. Notwithstanding this, the initiation into _vidyā_s (upāsanas), _mantra_s and the like should be only from such as Brahmins. This is clearly established from Vidura&rsquo;s words:-&ldquo;As I was born a Śūdra, I cannot teach any further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tuladhara and Dharmavyadha (who were of lower castes) only did this much: they treated with respect the Brahmins who came to them to have their doubts cleared regarding <em>dharma</em> and made them understand the points at issue, just like people who put pilgrims on the right path when they happen to have lost their way. They did not become the main _ācārya_s (of the Brahmins). This is how the incidents in the Itihasas should be understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Bhakti</em> or devotion is of eight kinds. If this <em>bhakti</em> is found in a mleccha, he should be considered as a devout and knowing Brahmin. To him giving is proper and from him taking is proper. He should be treated with the same reverence as I myself&rdquo;. This <em>śloka</em> has been commented upon (by Peria Achan Pillai) As meaning not that girls might be given in marriage to him and the like, but that he may be given the gift of knowledge and such like. &ldquo;Treatment with reverence&rdquo; (poojyah) is a general term. Therefore it means that if a man has devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em>, he should be treated with as much respect as the sõstras permit. Its purport is merely this much, that if a man treats such a devotee in the same way as he would treat others of the same caste, he would go to hell. The great sage summarised this in the <em>śloka</em> “He who treats a devotee of <em>Bhagavān</em>, be he a Śūdra, a huntsman, or even a man who eats dog&rsquo;s flesh, as he would treat other men of these castes - he would go to hell.&quot; Therefore the potency of devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em> should be so estimated as not to infringe the regulations of caste.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>.</p>
<p>अतो जातेर्निकृष्टायास्सर्वस्या वा विनाशतः । साजात्यं विष्णुभक्तानामिति मन्दमिदं वचः ॥</p>
<p>वैष्णवत्वेन मान्यत्वं समानं मुनि सम्मतम् । जात्यादिध्वंसतस्साम्यं मुक्तिकाले भविष्यति ॥</p>
<p>Therefore the contention that all devotees of <em>Viṣṇu</em> are of the same caste either because of the lower caste perishing or of all castes perishing&ndash;this contention is foolish. Reverence for the sake of devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em> is common, according to the sages, to all. Equality by the destruction of castes and the like will occur (only) at the time of <em>mukti</em>.</p>
<p>In the Bhagavadgītā and elsewhere, in such passages as the following, the regulations and limits of the respective castes and regulations of conduct in accordance with castes have been declared in unequivocal terms, even in the case of men who have devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em>:-&ldquo;Women,&rdquo; Vaiśyas and Śūdras, even among these, whoever seek me as refuge will attain the highest state&quot;. &ldquo;The man who is absorbed in the performance of the duties and rites pertaining to his caste will attain the supreme end of life. Learn from me how this happens. The man attains his end by worshipping <em>Bhagavān</em> with the performance of his ordained <em>karma</em>&rdquo;; &ldquo;Therefore the Śūdra should not utter my names with the <em>praṇava</em> (aum)&rdquo;, &ldquo;<em>Bhagavān</em> who is the Supreme Person is adored by the man who performs the duties and rites of his <em>varṇa</em> and his <em>āśrama</em>. There is nothing which delights <em>Bhagavān</em> other than this&rdquo;. &ldquo;The man who does not deviate in the least from the karmas ordained for his caste, who considers alike those who wish him well and those who wish him ill, and who never deprives another of what belongs to him and never does any action of violence (himsā) - know that this man who has a mind free from faults like desire is a devotee of <em>Viṣṇu</em>&rdquo;. Thus the virtue of being a devotee of <em>Bhagavān</em> and the specific fruit which will result from it (<em>mukti</em>) are common, whereas diversity of castes and diversity of codes of conduct persist (uptil <em>mukti</em>). This is evident from such passages as this.&quot; The Śūdra is ( really) &ldquo;fortunate and Kaliyuga is (really ) fortunate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>SATTVAM OF THE BODY AND SATTVAM OF THE MIND.</p>
<p>It has been said, &ldquo;Tamas&rdquo; (ignorance, sloth etc., ) is found in great measure in the Śūdra, rajas in the Kṣatriya and <em>sattvam</em> in the Brahmin&quot;. Owing to the preponderance of such qualities as <em>sattvam</em>, in the body, a man is entitled to be called a Brahmin, a Kṣatriya and the like. But this is different from the praise of being a Brahmin that is often given in certain passages, owing to the quality of <em>sattvam</em> and the like in the mind. The qualities of caste pertaining to the body which are due to the special qualities of the body arise even at the time of birth and remain until death. The Brahmin-like qualities which arise out of the preponderance of <em>sattvam</em> in the mind may be present in all castes. In such as Prahlāda they are present even at the time of birth. In others, owing to such specific causes as contact with āchāryas, these (mental) qualities are acquired (later). Some (texts in the) _śāstra_s are applicable to a person as a consequence of the particular caste pertaining to the body. Owing to the Brahmin-like qualities (of the mind) and the like, the attainment of the supreme end of life and the _upāya_s therefor and also such things as eulogy may be found in all castes. If in a Brahmin are found such features as are incongruous (with his caste), it will meet with censure that, born in a caste which is declared by the _Śāstra_s as being capable of such virtues as self restraint and mental serenity, he lapsed from the condition suitable to him. If a man born in other castes acquires the higher virtues, he will be extolled bigbly as stated in the <em>śloka</em> :-&ldquo;Men are to be honoured in the following order of preference&ndash;for the possession of <em>vidyā</em> (<em>jñāna</em>), of right <em>karma</em>, of age, of relatives and of wealth. Even a Śūdra possessing these is fit to be honoured in old age&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If the excellence arising from the body and from the qualities of the mind were to cause pride or arrogance, it would lead to evil consequences. If the inferiority in the one (caste due to the body) and in the other (mental virtues) as described respectively in the following passages, &ldquo;I was not born in any of the four castes where <em>dharma</em> could be practised.&rsquo;; and “I was born in a family renowned in the world wherein every one was pure and performed <em>yoga</em>, where every one knew the truth about <em>prakṛti</em> with its three qualities, and the _jīva_s, where every one had his mind firmly fixed at Thy lotus-like feet and yet I inclined to sin and am now sunk in <em>samsāra</em>, O Saviour&rdquo; &ndash; if these two kinds of inferiority are realised by a person and if it should generate in him <em>kārpaṇya</em> (humility) so that he adopts the particular <em>upāya</em> suitable for his <em>ākiñcanya</em> (helplessness), it will be extolled, because it will lead to the attainment of the ultimate end. Thus though there are regulations regarding castes and the code of conduct pertaining to each caste, there is nothing to prevent a person from being honoured in the mind as established above.</p>
<p>EKĀNTINS AND PARAMAIKĀNTINS:</p>
<p>Among those who are devoted to <em>Bhagavān</em>, those who do not bow to any other deity are Ekāntins (i.e.) men with exclusive devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em>, as stated in the <em>śloka</em> :&ndash; &ldquo;Exclusive devotion (Ekāntitvam) to <em>Bhagavān</em> is common to all these three. Exclusive devotion consists in indifference to all other deities and in depending on Him alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among them the man with <em>jñāna</em> is called Paramaikantin or man with supreme and exclusive devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em>, because he does not want anything else and among these latter, the supreme and exclusive devotion of those who, impatient of delay, have performed <em>bharanyāsa</em> to the Almighty <em>śeṣī</em>, and who, understanding the truth of the <em>śruti</em> that those asking for other things are like putting their money to interest, do not ask even for <em>mokṣa</em> as a reward and consider service (<em>kaiṅkarya</em>) as an end in itself (5) &ndash; the supreme and exclusive devotion of these men is like gold which is sixteen points pure.<sup id="fnref:301"><a href="#fn:301" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">301</a></sup></p>
<p>The great sages who can estimate this degree of purity have described, at considerable length, the greatness of these men with supreme and exclusive devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em>, in such treatises as the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>This means cent per cent purity.</p>
<p>It is said in the &quot; Vihagendra Samhita&quot; as follows: &ldquo;The man who is always thinking of Nārāyaṇa - whatever be the calling (vritti) he $ ($ another reading is cheshta (i.e.) movement (instead of vritti)) follows for his living, that is adoration; whatever he says (jalpah) is japam; whatever he sees is meditation or <em>dhyāna</em>; the water that has received contact with his feet is incomparably holy water; whatever is left after he has eaten will purify; his mere words are a sacred <em>mantra</em>: whatever he touches becomes pure.&rdquo; These _śloka_s, it is true, are authoritative, but &ldquo;whatever be the calling, that is adoration&rdquo; does not refer to any calling that is condemned in the <em>śāstra_s. It means that even if the man is obliged, owing to the unfavourable conditions brought about by place, time and the like, to follow a calling which is not ordained for him, it will be a proper means of obtaining the materials required for the adoration of the Lord, for it has been said: &ldquo;In <strong>times of adversity, a man may follow a calling slightly lower than that prescribed for him.&rdquo; The passage which says : - &ldquo;Even the sin committed for my sake will be counted as <em>dharma</em>&rdquo; has also the same purport. If this (interpretation) were not accepted, it would extend even to those callings that are prohibited. Even if the reading (in the <em>śloka</em> cited above) be cheshta ( movement) and not vritti (calling), just like the acts intended for keeping the body alive and those that are enjoined by the <em>śāstra</em>, which are (therefore ) accepted, the word cheshta (movements) would refer to such things as the closing and the opening of the eyes which are natural and which are reckoned in the secret <em>śāstra</em> (i.e.) Bhagavat <em>Śāstra</em> as among <sup id="fnref:302"><a href="#fn:302" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">302</a></sup> the offerings to the Lord. This will not extend to those movements that are forbidden (in the _śāstra_s). Only those which are not forbidden and which are consistent with one&rsquo;s nature and reason and with <em>śāstra</em> are ordained as fit to be offered. This applies also to the <em>śloka</em> in the Gita which elaborates this idea, namely, “ Whatever you do for the protection of the body, whatever you eat, whatever offerings you make in the fire and whatever tapas you perform, do it, O son of Kunti, as if it were an offering to be placed before me.&quot; If, in such cases, any offence is committed against the _śāstra_s, one should perform, on the occasion, expiatory rites which are of the nature of service obligatory for the occasion (<em>naimittika</em>), in accordance with what is competent for one. &ldquo;Whatever he says (jalpah) is japa&rdquo; does not refer to vain chattering such as is forbidden in the <em>śloka</em> : “Harsh speech, exaggeration of merits, tale- bearing, inappropriate talk&ndash; these are the four sins of speech.&quot; It refers to the series of speeches and counter-speeches that are held by the man with his disciples, preceptors, fellow students, scholars and those who are in pursuit of spiritual excellence in order to teach what is not known, to confirm what is already known or to remove doubts. Or the word jalpah in that <em>śloka</em> might mean the succession of speeches that are made in debate to refute infidels and heretics, for, though it is stated as a general rule, &ldquo;One should not debate merely for the sake of a quarrel without the desire to know the truth&rdquo;, yet the <em>dharma</em> - śāstras declare: &ldquo;One should</strong> condemn, according to one&rsquo;s ability, those who speak ill of <em>Bhagavān</em> or of one&rsquo;s_ācārya</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;Whatever he sees is meditation or dhyāna&rdquo; does not refer to such things as witnessing forbidden dances. It describes how when this man proceeds to render service (<em>kaiṅkarya</em>), whatever object meets his eye appears to him as having <em>Brahman</em> as its inner self, for it has been said, &lsquo;I am Hari: all this is Janārdana; the causal substances like mahat and the effects which are producd therefrom are not different from Him. The man who thinks in this manner &ndash; he will never fall a victim to the diseases of pleasure and pain which arise in <em>samsāra</em>&quot;, So also it is said, “Whatever appears ( before his eyes) is the Supreme Self&quot;. The sentence “ T&rsquo;he water that has received contact with his feet is incomparably holy water&quot; only assigns a superior merit when it is due. When the water from the feet is considered as holy, if there is exclusive devotion to Nārāyaṇa in the person, it is said to be holier than other sacred waters. It does not refer to such things as impure water which may, by chance, come into contact with his feet. The statement &ldquo;Whatever is left after he has eaten purifies” refers only to certain specific remnants (of food) (ucchishta) which are prescribed as purificatory in contexts like a repeated Upanayana. Owing to the excellence of this quality, (the remnant of the food) is said to have superior purifying power. The words, certainly, do not mean that when disciples, sons and the like are devoted to Nārāyaṇa, whatever is left as remnant after they have eaten is purificatory for _ācārya_s and parents. It is said in the Sanatkumāra Samhita that the man who has eaten the food that has been offered to other deities or what is left as a remnant after those who are other than _guru_s have eaten should, for purification, live on milk alone for a month (payovrata), should always utter ashtākshara and eat also _Brahma_kurcha - panchagavya. This passage prescribes the code of conduct for one who follows the <em>dharma</em> of <em>Bhagavān</em> and has been taken for illustration by Alavandar in his Agama Prāmānya. Therefore the verse - &ldquo;If the *remnant of the food that has been already eaten by the devotees of the Lord is given to me, it will immediately make me pure&rdquo;&mdash; is only applicable to _guru_s. Even if it is of general application, it means only this much - &ldquo;If those who are devotees of the Lord should give me what is left over after their meal, it would purify me, even though they have been obliged, by force of unfavourable circumstances like place and time, to follow occupations lower than those ordained for them and to make others also follow them.&rdquo; In this (Tamil) passage, if the word <em>śeṣa</em> should mean only what is left in the vessels in which the food was cooked as in the question and answer (after a srāddha) - &ldquo;what is to be done with the food left over ?,&rdquo; and &ldquo;let it be eaten in the company of friends&rdquo; - if it should mean only this, there is nothing wrong. The word ucchishta, too, has been employed in the _śruti_s to mean what is left in the cooking vessel after (people) have dined. Madu and others have determined to this effect :- &ldquo;One should give up wealth and pleasure (artha and kama) when they are against <em>dharma</em>. Even <em>dharma</em> which is likely to bring suffering or which is likely to rouse disgust among people in the world should be given up&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The <em>śloka</em> which says: &ldquo;Whatever I do by the nature of <em>prakṛti</em> and with my body, my speech, my senses, my intelligence or my soul, I offer all that to the Supreme Nārāyaṇa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot; His very speech should be considered as a sacred <em>mantra</em> &ldquo;. This means that even the words in the vernacular language employed by him as necessary for spiritual elevation should be cherished like Tiru_mantra_ and reflected upon. It does not mean that his talk on worldly affairs is fit to be uttered as japa. The saying : &ldquo;His words in jest should be cherished as the texts in the _śruti_s&rdquo; should also be interpreted in this sense. “All that he touches becomes pure&rsquo;; This should be interpreted as follows:- When a man is ill (and cannot himself bathe ), another is allowed to touch him and bathe for his sake; when the ācārya initiates the <em>śiṣya</em> into the sacred _mantra_s, he touches the <em>śiṣya</em> with his hand; this touch is called &ldquo;touch with the hand of <em>Viṣṇu</em>&rdquo;. When an idol is newly installed, it is touched with the hand by great devotees of the Lord. In certain other circumstances, too, the touch with the hand is prescribed as purificatory. The passage means, therefore, that his touch of all things is even more purificatory in such contexts as are ordained in the _śāstra_s.</p>
<p>If this (interpretation) were not accepted, it would follow that the things which are condemned in the following <em>śloka_s would become pure by his touch:-&ldquo;The fruit of the fig tree (attikkai in Tamil) should not be eaten&rdquo;. &ldquo;One&rdquo; should not eat kommatti or (mull_aṅgī</em>), athikkāi, suraikkai and kovaippazham. <em>Bhagavān</em> ever stands far away from the man who always eats them.&rdquo; He who eats white brinjals, soap-nut (nettamkottai), kommatti (or mull_aṅgī_), kuvalai, athikkai, kāndal in ignorance-to him <em>Bhagavān</em> is always at a distance. He who eats, kommatti, sittavarai, kāṇḍal, nilaippanai and suraikkai - to him <em>Bhagavān</em> is ever at a distance.&rdquo; He who eats white brinjals, kommatti, cheese (or curds) made from the milk of a cow within ten days of its calfing, the bulb of the lotus &ndash; he will never think in his last moments of <em>Bhagavān</em>, the Lord of the world, &ldquo;He who has eaten &ldquo;velangãi , peerku, irulli, vellulli, nāikkudai (mushroom) urpanrikkizhangu - he should perform the expiatory ceremony called &lsquo;Chandrāyana&rsquo;. “To eat the sprout of the cocoanut, sanaippukkirai, mushroom, kusumbai, suraikkai, fruits or vegetables that have been produced with nightsoil as manure, milk mixed with salt, ghee that has been poured into the remnants of food on the leaf or plate, water in the place where the dhoby washes clothes to eat these is the same as to drink toddy.&rdquo; &ldquo;The man who thinks of“ <em>Bhagavān</em> should never drink vinegar (kadi). It is reckoned as liquor. Therefore one should earnestly avoid it.&rdquo; &ldquo;The &ldquo;Vaiṣṇava who touches blood even without knowing what it is - I never condone his offence, O goddess of the earth, even after a thousand apologies.&rdquo; &ldquo;He who is born a * Brahmin and eats anna (cooked food) on the Ekādaśī day - he eats sin in every morsel and the morsel is comparable to the dung of the dog &ldquo;.&rdquo; He who is not ill and yet eats anna (cooked food) on the Ekādaśī day-be sins as though he has drunk liquor. There</p>
<p>is no doubt of this. The man who drinks liquor goes to hell by himself, whereas the man who eata anna on Ekādasi day drags his ancestors (also) into hell&rdquo;. &ldquo;The mind becomes impure by eating forbidden food, by coveting what one has not got, by seeing various objects of sense-pleasure and by want of cleanliness in the body&rdquo;. &quot; Yama plans to kill the Brahmin with (the weapons of) failure to study the Vedas, the absence of right observances, laziness and forbidden food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If no such discrimination were accepted, it would conflict with many _śāstra_s which have been recognised as great authorities and also with the traditional observances of the learned (siṣṭa ). Therefore to state such views is merely of the nature of exaggera. tion (of some one aspect). Even by the man who, has supreme and exclusive devotion (<em>paramaikāntin</em>) and whose greatness is boundless, these restrictions imposed by the săstras are not violated. This may be understood from the observances until the last day of their lives, of great_ācārya_s like Nāthamuni, Alavandar and <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>.</p>
<p>THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RITES OF THE _VARṆA_S</p>
<p>AND _ĀŚRAMA_S IS OBLIGATORY:</p>
<p>Those who are outside the pale of the Vedas and those who hold heretical views give up, owing to delusion, these restrictions and regulations which are ordained in the Vedas and the _śāstra_s based on the Vedas. That this kind of renunciation is due to tamas is declared by <em>Bhagavān</em> in the <em>śloka</em> :- &ldquo;One  should not give up the <em>karma</em> ordained for the castes and the _āśrama_s. Their omission arising from ignorance is renunciation (tyāga) due to tamas&rdquo;. He has (also) declared that the giving up of activities and abstentions which are of the nature of pain is renunciation due to rajas, in the following:- &ldquo;He who gives up <em>karma</em>,because it is painful and fatiguing to the body - he renounces owing to rajas and does not obtain the fruit of renunci ation.&rdquo; His tyāga or renunciation is like that of the man who becomes sannyāsin because of the difficulties of maintaining a family.</p>
<p>While giving up, in accordance with our competence, what should be given ap and doing what should be done, we should give up the thought, &ldquo;I am doing all this as an independent agent, this activity is dependent on me; this will be the means of my attaining such and such an object&rdquo;. We should, on the other hand, think that the Supreme Ruler is the (real) doer and that we render service to Him, which is His due, with the sole object of pleasing Him. If we follow this line of thought (in what we do and in what we refrain from ), it is renunciation due to sattvan, and this has been declared by <em>Bhagavān</em> in :-&ldquo;To perform the <em>karma</em> ordained for a man with the thought that it is an end in itself and that it ought to be done without the thought that the <em>karma</em> is his (independent) action and without the desire for gain of any kind - this is, O Arjuna, renunciation due to <em>sattvam</em>&rdquo; The man should observe (these rites and regulations ) solely for the purpose of pleasing <em>Bhagavān</em>. He should not even ask for <em>mokṣa</em> as a reward, for he should realise that, by the grace of the All merciful Lord which has been won by the <em>prapatti</em> performed before, <em>mokṣa</em> is certain. (He should) render service (<em>kaiṅkarya</em>) like those who have already attained <em>mukti</em>. This would resemble a healthy man eating food with milk (without any thought of the care from illness to be obtained from milk). Such a code of conduct is the highest limit of renunciation due to <em>sattvam</em>. This is like eating food when men are hungry. Otherwise their conduct would resemble that of men who eat cakes for winning a wager, (They cannot derive any true pleasure therefrom).

<p>THE REAL MEANING OF &ldquo;HAVING GIVEN UP ALL _DHARMA_S&rdquo;</p>
<p>IN THE <em>CARAMA</em> <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>While commenting on the words (in the Carama <em>Śloka</em> ) “Having given up all _dharma_s&rdquo;, the author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> interpreted them at first to mean that the giving up of _dharma_s means the giving up of the thought that, in his action, the man himself is the doer seeking a certain gain for himself by that means. This is renunciation of action due to <em>sattvam</em> (and not the giving up of the <em>dharma</em> itself  viz., <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em>). This form of thought should be borne in mind by the man who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as a direct and independent <em>upāya</em>, at the time of the performance of <em>prapatti</em> and also in his further actions (after <em>prapatti</em>), which are ends in themselves and have no relation of any kind to an <em>upāya</em>. In the second interpretation given of those words (by the author of of the <em>Bhāṣya</em>), they mean that when the man of poor ability who cannot brook any delay in the attainment of <em>mukti</em> falls into grief or despair at the thought of all the _dharma_s or rites prescribed in the _śāstra_s and his inability to perform them, the Lord, in order to dispel his despair, ordained another means which is easy of perforinance and has to be adopted only once and said: &ldquo;You need not go about seeking other _upāya_s&rdquo; The <em>prapanna</em> should note that in order that one may be competent for <em>prapatti</em>, the absence of adoption of any other <em>upāya</em> before its performance is a requisite which has been present of its own accord by the grace of God. In regard to actions after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, this giving up of the adoption of other _upāya_s is insisted on in the <em>śāstra</em> itself and this shows how <em>prapatti</em> does not require any aid (after it is once done).</p>
<p>If the word <em>parityajya</em> (having given up) merely states what has, on account of inability, already occurred (and not what is enjoined), the meaning (of the first part of the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>) would be that this having given up is a qualification for <em>prapatti</em>. If, on the other hand, the words (having given up) state what is ordained or enjoined to be done, then the meaning would be that <em>prapatti</em> does not require anything else to be performed. Thus, if <em>parityajya</em> (having given up) merely states what has already taken place or what has already occurred, the words <em>mām</em> ekam will have to be thought of as meaning that nothing else (than <em>Bhagavān</em>) is required for the attainment of the desired end. If, on the other hand*<sup id="fnref:303"><a href="#fn:303" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">303</a></sup> <em>parityajya</em> means that <em>prapatti</em> requires nothing else for yielding its fruit, the words, mã suchah (do not grieve), show, by the force of logic or meaning, that the grief or despair which is a mark of being destitute of other means is what is required for competency for praputti (<em>adhikāra</em>;)</p>
<p>To the man or adhikārī who grieves at his inability to adopt the _dharma_s or _aṅga_s enjoined for <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>, the <em>Carama</em> <em>Śloka</em> says, “Perform <em>prapatti</em> to me and you need not adopt any other <em>dharma</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>प्रकृतोपासन न्यायात्तदङ्गानामुपस्थितौ । अन्येषाञ्चैतदङ्गत्व त्यागोऽत्र प्रतिपाद्यते ॥</p>
<p>If <em>prapatti</em> stands in the place of <em>bhakti</em> or <em>upāsana</em> as one of the <em>Brahma</em> Vidyās, then the question arises whether the _aṅga_s of <em>bhakti</em> might be considered as the _aṅga_s of <em>prapatti</em> as well. But, in <em>prapatti</em>, they are not required as _aṅga_s. This is indicated by the words <em>mām</em> and ekam.</p>
<p>(If the word, <em>parityajya</em>, makes an injunction that other things should not be considered as _aṅga_s for <em>prapatti</em>, and if the words (māsuchan) (do not grieve or despair) show that the previous grief or despair is qualification for <em>prapatti</em> (<em>ākiñcanya</em>), then, where is the appropriateness of the word ekam (it may be asked ). The answer is :- the word ekam is intended to show that in the mental or sāttvika renunciation of action by <em>sattvam</em>, it should be borne in mind that the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s doership is all dependent on the Lord and other such things, that in <em>prapatti</em>, the means (<em>upāya</em>) and the end are one and the same (viz., the Lord) and that <em>prapatti</em> stands in the place of all (other) _upāya_s.</p>
<p>Our acharyās like (Appallar) have argued thus:</p>
<p>Since <em>nitya</em> and naimittika <em>karma</em> are enjoined on a man (irrespective of all fruit or gain that might arise from it) simply by virtue of his being a servant of the Lord, they should not be given up, lest he should be violating the command of the Master, (although they may not be required as _aṅga_s for <em>prapatti</em>).</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S:</p>
<p>आज्ञाविरोधिभिस्स्वार्ह प्रायश्चित्तपराङ्मुखैः । स्वाधिकारोचितस्सर्वैः प्रत्यवायो दुरत्ययः ॥</p>
<p>आज्ञानुपालने तत्तत्प्रत्यवायनिवारणम् । स्वामिसन्तोषतः प्रीतिरिति लाभद्वयं स्थिरम् ॥</p>
<p>अनिच्छातो निवर्तेत स्वर्गाद्यं कर्मणां फलम् । अमर्यादस्य दुर्वारः प्रत्यवायोऽन्यहेतुकः ॥</p>
<p>Those who have violated the commands (of the Lord) and have not performed the expiatory ceremonies ( <em>prāyaścitta</em> ) enjoined for these violations according to their competence - they must suffer the consequences of the violation. By acting in accor. dance with the commands, one avoids the evil consequences (due to violation) and enjoys (also) the pleasure arising from the delight of the Lord. Thus two gains are certain.</p>
<p>Such things as <em>svarga</em> that are declared to be the fruit of certain (good) karmas will not arise (as the <em>prapanna</em> performs them without desiring any fruit.) But if the man performs forbidden actions, the evil consequences will necessarily follow (though not desired by him), owing to another cause (viz. doing the forbidden thing).</p>
<p>When <em>prapatti</em> was treated (by the _Bhāṣya_kāra) as an <em>aṅga</em> of <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>, it was only to illustrate how it wins <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> as a fruit, since it is capable of securing all fruits. In this context, we should bear in mind that, on the lines of the _Bhāṣya_kara&rsquo;s second interpretation (of the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> ), <em>prapatti</em> stands in the place of all _upāya_s including <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>, which are difficult of performance. In accordance with his first interpretation, (that every <em>dharma</em> should be done with the thought that it is performed not by oneself but by the Lord and for His own ends - sāttvika parityāga) and not out of any desire for one&rsquo;s own gain, the meaning should be considered as enjoining the performance of <em>prapatti</em> with that thought and the service rendered by the <em>prapanna</em> as an end in itself.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S:</p>
<p>सुदुष्करेण शोचेद्यो येन येनेष्टहेतुना । स स तस्याहमेवेति चरमश्लोकसंग्रहः ॥</p>
<p>भावाभावौ न धर्माणां प्रपत्तेरङ्गमिष्यते । स्वतन्त्रशिष्ट्या शक्येहा शेषाभावोधिकारगः ॥</p>
<p>क्रत्वनङ्गतया ये तु तदानीमननुष्ठिताः । स्वकाले स्वविधेरेव कार्यास्ते तद्वदत्र नः ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a man falls into despair or grief because he is not able to adopt certain _upāya_s which are prescribed as productive of the desired results - to that man I stand as those _upāya_s. This is the gist of the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The performance or the non-performance of certain _dharma_s (like <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em>) are not to be considered as _aṅga_s of <em>prapatti</em>. The man desires to perform these actions of which he is capable, because they have been ordained for him (without any reference to <em>prapatti</em> ). The non-performance of those actions of which he is incapable constitutes <em>ākiñcanya</em> (helplessness) which is necessary for <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>Rites like dars&rsquo;a and purnamāsa have not been prescribed as requisites for yajnas (sacrifices ). So at the time of the performance of yajnas, they are not performed. But on occasions like the new-moon day, they have to be done because they are enjoined on their own account. So also here; (i.e.) <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> are not prescribed as _aṅga_s for <em>prapatti</em>; they are not to be performed at the time of <em>prapatti</em> as its _aṅga_s, but because they have been enjoined on their own account, without any relation or reference to <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>The teaching &ldquo;Give up <em>dharma</em> and a_dharma_&rdquo; relates to the giving up of those _dharma_s which are said to be productive of certain gains (kāmya) and of those karmas which are forbidden.&quot; So also &ldquo;give up satyam and also anritam&rdquo; means &ldquo;Do not desire satyam the enjoyment or experience of your self as an end in itself; also do not desire the enjoyment of<sup id="fnref:304"><a href="#fn:304" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">304</a></sup> ] anrita the pleasures of the world, wealth and the like &ldquo;. It may also mean: &ldquo;Give up speaking even that truth (satyam) which will cause pain to</p>
<p>One interpretation of the word <em>satya</em> is the changeless eternal <em>ātmā</em> or self; <em>anṛta</em> refers to non-sentient things which contribute to the pleasures of wealth.</p>
<p>others.&rdquo; In order to reveal the excellence of his teaching, it is repeated again :-&rdquo; Having given up both satyam and anritam&rdquo;, it is said further, &ldquo;Give up the thought which enables you to give up satyam and anritam, namely, the thought that you are the doer&rdquo;, in order to enable us to realise that even our doership is dependent on another (the Lord ). Thus there is no authority here for violating the commands of the Lord.</p>
<p>Now let us consider what was taught to Uddhava :- In spite of what has been said so far, some quote the words addressed to Uddhava.&ndash;&ldquo;Give up, Uddhava, all injunctions (vidhis) (like sandhyā, which are prescribed as a means to an end); give up all prohibitions such as “don&rsquo;t injure others&rdquo;; give up the _dharma_s to be actively performed and also the _dharma_s which prescribe the avoidance of or abstention from certain acts and also the requisites (_aṅga_s) which you have heard so far and which you will learn hereafter as being necessary for both of them (Give up all these) and seek refuge in Me alone by all means, for I am the Inner Self of all beings. By doing so, you will attain <em>mokṣa</em>, where there is freedom from all fear&quot;. They quote these words and argue as follows &ldquo;Since, here we are enjoined<sup id="fnref:305"><a href="#fn:305" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">305</a></sup> to give up the abstention from certain actions, and since in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>, it is not proper to restrict or limit the meaning of sarva (all) in sarva karmāni, it follows that we should give up even the abstention (from evil acts ).&rdquo; This would mean that we should perform forbidden things as much as lies in our power. Since the doing of these forbidden things is something that, according to them, is enjoined, these people argue in their delusion that even if the <em>prapanna</em> does forbidden things deliberately after <em>prapatti</em>, there would be no stain left. This is extremely ridiculous, for the (notorious) charvakas (alepakas) say that even if a man sins, it leaves no stain behind, whereas the argument stated above goes further and is tantamount to saying that (the <em>prapanna</em> ) should necessarily commit sin: This is &ldquo;like the fish swallowing greedily the bait made of iron covered with something which is delicious to eat, without any thought of the consequence. It is in reflecting on such (perversities) that the great sage became sad: &ldquo;Whatever ** the good man shirks from, that the wicked man is delighted with. How painful is the perversity of this world !&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Giving up abstention from forbidden things&rsquo; would mean doing forbidden things.</p>
<p>If the interpretation (given by these men) were the real meaning (of the teaching to Uddhava), it would follow that all the forbidden things done by a man throughout his life would be the requisites (_aṅga_s) of <em>prapatti</em>. The injunction that <em>prapatti</em> with its _aṅga_s should be done only once would then have no meaning. It is not possible to do all the forbidden things at the moment of performing <em>prapatti</em>. Nor have we seen any one performing <em>prapatti</em>, doing as much of the forbidden as lies in his power. According to this contention of theirs, even sins cannot be called sins (since they are enjoined), in the same way as injury ( to animals) in the Agnishomiya sacrifice is not called a sin ( because it is enjoined). All this would be in conflict with their own commentary on the words &ldquo;I will release thee from all sins&rdquo;, including the sins that might be committed deliberately after <em>prapatti</em>. It would imply that we should commit the three kinds of offences of the wind, speech and body ) as much as lies in our power. It is also opposed to the code of conduct followed by previous _ācārya_s, to the tradition of our ancients, to their own actual conduct and, further, to the observances of present day aspirants to <em>mukti</em>. Those who contend in this manner should, when they are attacked by a <em>prapanna</em> owing to the desire for wealth or for pleasure, have to say; “Is this not, indeed, the <em>dharma</em> expected of a <em>prapanna</em> ?&rdquo;, and feel delighted. This would be opposed to countless _pramāṇa_s and is also not the real purport of the words in question. Some_ācārya_s would explain this contention that abstention from forbidden things is also included in the words sarva _dharma_n (as something to be given up) is due to ignorance of the meaning of the word <em>dharma</em>. It is in this way: Among abstentions only that which is done in accordance with prescribed rules as a means to secure a particular object is called <em>dharma</em>. Mere non-violence (<em>ahimsā</em>) is only the absence of sin and is not <em>dharma</em> in the primary sense of the word ( for ao rules or restraints are observed). Therefore to give up non-violence undertaken for the sake of an object and in accordance with rules and restraints (<em>niyama</em>) means to give up the object aimed at and the rules and restraints in practising it. Beyond this, there is no au. thority for giving up the abstention from forbidden things that is prescribed in the <em>nivṛtti</em> _śāstra_s (i.e.) _śāstra_s for securing <em>mukti</em>,</p>
<p>Even if it be held that more <em>ahimsā</em> which is not accompanied by <em>niyama</em> (the observance of rules and restraints ) is also meant by the word dharia, we submit the following:</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S:</p>
<p>अधर्म परिहारेऽपि धर्मत्वेन विवक्षिते । स्यात्स्वतन्त्रविधेरेव नित्यं तस्य परिग्रहः ॥</p>
<p>“If the word <em>dharma</em> includes in its import also the giving up of a_dharma_, the giving up of a_dharma_ will have to be done always, as it is an independent <em>vidhi</em> or injunction (which has nothing to do with <em>prapatti</em>),</p>
<p>प्रपत्त्यङ्गं प्रतिज्ञातुं न शक्यं साधुसंसदि ॥ प्रपन्नमधिकृत्यैव सदाचारानतिक्रमः ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible to contend in an assembly of the wise that the giving up of what is pleasing (to the Lord) anukulya and the performance of what is disagreeable ( to Him) prātikulya are _aṅga_s to <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>प्रपत्त्यध्यायपठितः प्रतिसन्धीयतामिह ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us bear in mind the fact that the injunction not to violate the code of conduct of the good (such as giving up sandhyā or <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em>) which we find in the chapter on <em>prapatti</em> is intended to apply only to the <em>prapanna</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When it is thus clear that these should not be given up as they are injunctions which have no relation to <em>prapatti</em> and which are independent rules. it may be asked what is the meaning of the teaching to Uddhava which says &ldquo;Give up what is enjoined for action and also what is forbidden, give up action and abstention from action&rdquo;. The answer is that they mean only this much : that they should not be observed as _aṅga_s or requisites for <em>prapatti</em> :</p>
<p>In the case of the aspirant for <em>mukti</em>, it may mean also those activities and abstentions which are enjoined as means for securing certain other ends (than <em>mokṣa</em>) in those _śāstra_s that enjoin them, 88 in the passage: &ldquo;Give up those _dharma_s that are the means of securing <em>dharma</em>, artha and kāma,&rdquo; As against this, if it were held that <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> karmas and the like are themselves (_svarūpa_tyāga) to be given up, it would be opposed to everything that has been pointed out before. Those who are intelligent and who are sāttvikas will appreciate this conclusion and approve of it. (The Alvars) have stated this in such passages as the following: &ldquo;We will never do what ought not to be done. We <sup id="fnref:306"><a href="#fn:306" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">306</a></sup> will never go (to any <em>ācārya</em>), and study heretical _śāstra_s&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Vouchsafe Thy grace so that I may not do wicked deeds&rdquo;. If we consider the import of the verse &ldquo;O Lord of the world! Consider my offences as virtuous acts&rdquo;, it also means the prayer that the offences should be pardoned. Therefore if the <em>prapanna</em> happens to commit an offence, he is bound to obtain pardon as declared in the passage :- &quot; Whether &ldquo;offences are committed deliberately or in ignorance, the only expiation that is required is to say &quot; Pardon me &ldquo;.</p>
<p>It may also mean &ldquo;we will never do what is evil&rdquo;.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>‘प्रायश्चित्तान्तराशक्तः कालक्षेपाक्षमोऽपि वा । पुनः प्रपद्यते नाथमभिन्दन् लोकसंग्रहम् ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who is incapable of other forms of expiation or who is impatient of delay performs <em>prapatti</em>, once again, to the Lord, without transgressing the rule of lokasangraha&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The contention that when there is aspiration for <em>mukti</em>, no forbidden things will be done deliberately means only that it would be unlikely, being inappropriate. It is like the saying that &ldquo;in the Brahmin there is control of the senses&rdquo;. (It does not mean that the control is always found). Even in the case of great sages</p>
<p>and of men who were sage-like, there have occurred forbidden actions and expiations therefor. If it were otherwise ((1.e) that the aspirant for <em>mukti</em> would never commit an offence deliberately) then, since those who are upāsakas following <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> are also aspirants for <em>mukti</em>, it would follow that they, too, would not commit offences deliberately and the conclusion that is arrived at in <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> that freedom from stain caused by later sins is applicable only to sins committed in ignorance and that there is no pardon for sins committed deliberately - this conclusion would then become meaningless.</p>
<p>There is no difference between the upāsaka (the follower of <em>Bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>) and the <em>prapanna</em> in regard to what is forbidden on account of caste (<em>varṇa</em> ), <em>āśrama</em>, sex (<em>jāti</em>), gotra (family), pravar, ( ancestry), right conduct, race kula, place, time, bodily or mental condition (avastha), character (<em>guṇa</em>) or convention (samaya). If what is forbidden has been done, there is difference in the manner of expiation, because that depends on the competency (<em>adhikāra</em>).</p>
<p>The verse, &ldquo;My servants will never commit offences. Even if they commit them, I will consider them as if they were virtuous actions&rdquo; - even this verse indicates that offences are not unlikely. The sentence &ldquo;If they commit offences, I will consider them as virtuous actions&rdquo; means “If done in ignorance, I will pardon them. If offences are committed deliberately and if they do not obtain pardon, I will condone them after inflicting punishmeat, but will never forsake them. That, as a matter of fact, these offences are not virtuous acts is indicated therein when it is said: &ldquo;It will be considered as if they were good deeds&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is (distinctly) stated: “If there is an offence, expiation should be done at once. The expiation that is to be done is to perform <em>prapatti</em> again&rdquo;. Therefore it cannot be contended that, if the <em>prapanna</em> commits an offence deliberately after <em>prapatti</em>,</p>
<p><em>Iśvara</em> will not have the desire to punish (the <em>prapanna</em>), nor can it be said that if the Omnipotent Lord desires to panish and if pardon be not obtained, there will be no evil result following (for when He has once willed, the result must take place, for He is Almighty). If it be held that the offence would only cause the absence of pleasure to the Lord, then if that displeasure would not cause any evil (to the man), there would be no need to perform a later <em>prāyaścitta</em> (which is distinctly ordained in the passage cited above.) If it be held that the utmost that would happen (on account of the offence) is only absence of pleasure to oneself in addition to that of the Lord, the evil consequences, namely, absence of pleasure will have to be admitted. It may be said :-(Let there be absence of pleasure; absence of pleasure being only a particular form of knowledge, it would last only for an instant). There is no reason for performing a prayaschitta in connection with the absence of one&rsquo;s own pleasure which has passed away. It it is said that the expiation or <em>prāyaścitta</em> is intended only to avoid the absence of pleasure in oneself that might continue, then, there is every reason to perform expiation owing to the fear that the sufferings stated in the _śruti_s and the _smṛti_s (for non-performance of ordained rites and observances - <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> ) would follow when the time comes for its fruition, for these sufferings are on the same footing as this displeasure ).</p>
<p>Therefore in order to avoid (1) these sufferings and (2) the interruption to the enjoyment of the Lord (Bhagavad anubhava) here and the diminution of it caused by the weakness of the senses, the fading of the intelligence, sorrow and the like and (3) in the case of those whose term of life has not already been unalterably fixed, delay in the ultimate gain, viz., <em>mokṣa</em> by the extension of the age limit - in order that this may not happen, <em>prapatti</em> has to be performed again. Even those who hold the opinion that this is not required will have to concede that the performance of this latter <em>prapatti</em> will be pardoned by the Lord (even if it be considered as an offence ), since they hold the opinion that the Lord will forgive (even ) the doing of forbidden things.</p>
<p>We have already explained that it is not possible to perform <em>prapatti</em> in anticipation for offences that might be committed deliberately in future and that there is nothing improper in performing a later <em>prapatti</em> in order to obtain a fruit or object which was not prayed for in the previous <em>prapatti</em> (in the chapter on Expiation for Offences ). Thus it may be understood that there is nothing improper in observing the code of conduct followed by the good and arising from the commands of the Lord, (viz., <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> ).</p>

<p>He who maintains the view that the <em>prapanna</em> will not be tainted even when he does forbidden things, - why does he view. with anger those who, in accordance with the Lord&rsquo;s commands, observe the code of conduct ordained as proper ?</p>
<p>When it is held (by these disputants) that even when the (Lord&rsquo;s) commands are violated, He would not fail to protect, how could it be said that He would withhold His protection when His commands are performed ?</p>
<p>No form of service (to the Lord) is proper without right conduct. When a man has not made himself clean, he is not fit to worship the Lord.</p>
<p><em>Dharma</em> is born of right conduct: and the Lord of <em>Dharma</em> is Acyuta.&rdquo; The meaning of all the _śāstra_s is explained in these words in the fifth Veda (Mahābhārata).</p>
<p>The remembrance of the <em>prapatti</em> (performed before ) which is taught by the wise is for the purpose of giving up such prāyaschittas as one is not competent to perform and the performance of such others as one is competent for,</p>
<p>When <em>prapatti</em> is remembered, the thought will arise that sins committed in ignorance will cause no taint. It will also be understood that when they are committed deliberately, the performance of a further <em>prapatti</em> is necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore the wise man should remain without committing any offence. But when offences have occurred, the proper thing to do would be another <em>prapatti</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The activities of the man who performed <em>prapatti</em> ( at first) praying that he should be sinless and of the man who performed a further <em>prapatti</em> in order that his later life may be free from sin will invariably be free from sin.</p>
<p>PRĀYASCHITTA FOR DELIBERATE OFFENCES</p>
<p>IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY:</p>
<p>Some may say, in (utter) disregard of texts to the contrary, that (even ) the offences committed deliberately by the <em>prapanna</em> would be pardoned, their opinion being based on certain incidents in the Itihāsas and the Purāṇas. This contention, too, arises from an ignorance of the real opinions in the respective contexts. (For instance) when Sugrīva transgressed the time fixed by him for carrying out the terms of the alliance, the offence caused the appearance of great grief in <em>Śrī</em> Rāma&rsquo;s mind and he said, &ldquo;The way in which Vālin was slain is not yet closed. Abide by the terms of the agreement, O Sugrīva. Do not go the way of Vālin.&rdquo; On hearing these words, Lakṣmaṇa became so angry that the Lord had to bring down his wrath. He went to Sugrīva (to denounce him). On that occasion, did not (Hanuman), the scholar versed in the science of Indra&rsquo;s grammer, counsel Sugrīva as follows:- &ldquo;I do not see any other means for you, the offender, to escape from this situation except by begging the pardon of Lakṣmaṇa with folded hands&rdquo;. Sugrīva, too, accepted this advice and said to Lakshman. &ldquo;If out of over-confidence or out of affection, I have transgressed in any way, pray, let the offence of your servant be pardoned&rdquo;. And Lakṣmaṇa too, had to seek Sugrīva&rsquo;s pardon for overstepping the proper bounds of speech by</p>
<p>saying:- &ldquo;Pardon me for any harsh words that I may have uttered after listening to the words of <em>Śrī</em> Rāma in his grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus even in the life of a <em>prapanna</em>, offences may occur deliberately, owing to past <em>karma</em> which has begun to operate (prārabdha). When they have occurred, the <em>prapanna</em> should repent and obtain pardon. When Alavandar says &ldquo;I have not</p>
<p>observed <em>dharma</em> (i.e.) karmayoga etc&rdquo; and when it is said, &ldquo;I have given up the rites that are to be performed by a Brahmin after ablution in the form of adoration to the three sacrificial fires&rsquo;&rsquo;, it means only this much that he was not capable of such things as <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em> and not that we should give up the observance of the Lord&rsquo;s commands (<em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em>), in so far as it lies in our power.</p>
<p>Therefore even to a <em>prapanna</em>, action in obedience to the commands of the Lord and in accordance with the respective caste is an obligation that should be carried out until the bodies characterised by such things as Brahmin-ness are cast off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is superior excellence in a person (adhikārī) if, among the ordinary ways of right conduct, there is to be found in him the purity of conduct arising from the many purificatory ceremonies prescribed in the _śāstra_s. So also there is superior excellence in the man who, in addition to the qualities of the spirit, such as self control, has also compassion to living beings. Superior also is the excellence of the man who, among all means of attaining his ends, adopts <em>bhakti</em> or <em>prapatti</em> There is also a supreme excellence in the man who, among all things desired as ends, chooses only <em>mokṣa</em>. (The <em>śloka</em> may also mean):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Superior is the excellence of the man who has the qualities of the spirit such as self-control and compassion to that of the man who merely follows the right code of conduct; superior is the man who has chosen the right <em>upāya</em> (<em>bhakti</em> or <em>prapatti</em>) to him who has only the qualities of the spirit; superior still is the man who has chosen the right end (namely) <em>mokṣa</em> to the man who has only chosen the right <em>upāya</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This determination of the potency (of <em>prapatti</em>) should be borne in mind as being connected with the quality of <em>Iśvara</em> as the controller indicated in the three mysteries (_mantra_s).</p>

<p>(THE) POTENCY (OF <em>PRAPATTI</em> ).page389</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>शिलादेः स्त्रीत्वादिर्विपरिणतिरस्त्वद्भुतमिदं</p>
<p>ततोप्येतच्चित्रं यदुत दहनस्यैव हिमता ।</p>
<p>तृणस्यैवास्त्रत्वं रिपुषु निहतेरेव हितता</p>
<p>पदत्रेणैवेह त्रिभुवनपरित्राणमिति च ॥ ५७ ॥</p>
<p>It is, of course, wonderful that stones and the like should become women and the like (Ahalya); (but) more wonderful is it that fire should become as cold as snow (as in the case of Hanuman) and that a blade of grass should become a missile (Kakasura); even more wonderful is the act of slaying when it becomes the means of redemption (as for Sisupala and others). So also it is most wonderful that the sandal (of <em>Śrī</em> Rāma) should protect the three worlds.</p>
<p>(Since the glory of <em>Bhagavān</em> is so wonderful, there is nothing surprising in <em>prapatti</em> to Him accomplishing wonderful things.)</p>
<p>We have already spoken about the limits within which <em>prapatti</em> has potency. We will hereafter remove the misconceptions of those who would minimise its potency,</p>
<p>It has been said: &ldquo;The man who has done good or evil deeds of a very serious nature will experience their fruits even here (in this life) within three days, three fortnights, three months or three years&rdquo;. In the same way, it has been said, &ldquo;<em>Bhakti</em> as an <em>upāya</em>* destroys all sins other than those which have begun to yield their fruits (prarabdha,, whereas <em>prapatti</em> (sadhya_bhakti_ ) is superior to <em>bhakti</em>  and destroys even those sins which have begun to operate (prarabdha)&rdquo;. Therefore <em>prapatti</em> gets rid of even sins that have begun to bear their fruit (prarabdha) and yields the fruit of its own performance. As has been stated in regard to other vidyās (forms of meditation: <em>upāsana</em>), that the sins committed before and those committed after <em>upāsana</em>) will both be destroyed, <em>prapatti</em>, which is superior to them as a <em>vidyā</em> destroys (even) the suffering due to <em>karma</em>  which has begun to operate so that it may not continue the next instant, the next day or the next life in accordance with the degree or intensity of the man&rsquo;s impatience. This is the real purport of the words, &ldquo;Do not despair or grieve&rdquo;, mā suchah (in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>).</p>
<p>THE PURPOSE OF <em>IŚVARA</em> IN MAKING</p>
<p>THE <em>PRAPANNA</em> SUFFER:</p>
<p>(In this connection) the following question may be asked by some who minimise the power of <em>prapatti</em> :&ndash; &ldquo;If this is the real meaning, should not the sufferings which are seen in the actual life of a <em>prapanna</em> as the result of prārabdha <em>karma</em>  and the performance of actions which would result in further suffering-should not these sufferings cease (at once)? If it is said that the Lord will grant the cessation of these (sufferings) only if He is prayed to, for it, by the sufferer, the question arises, &ldquo;Why does not <em>Iśvara</em>, who is the well-wisher of all (living beings), grant, of His own accord, the cessation of these connected sufferings also, in the same way as <em>prapatti</em> grants incidentally such things as the ability to purify those who are in one&rsquo;s society. We do not see <em>Iśvara</em> doing this. Therefore what is said (in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>) about all gricf disappearing should be taken as not literally true, but as (exaggerated) praise of the potency of <em>prapatti</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The answer to this question is as follows:- &ldquo;<em>Iśvara</em> is always inclined to bestow His grace. He is eager to confer <em>mokṣa</em> on those who seek His protection even at (the time of) the beginning of uttering the sentence which states <em>prapatti</em>. But owing to the man&rsquo;s desire, the Lord agrees to keep him here (in this world), for some time longer. If he enjoys the inferior pleasures of life without any pain (or sorrow or suffering), his desire will never disappear. Nor will the assurance that the realisation of the Lord is truly enjoyable grow in him. Therefore as has been said in the following _śloka_s:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He to whom I want to show favour - his wealth I take away from him. Then his relatives forsake him. So he is ever full of sorrow or pain. If the man who suffers in this way continues to cling to me, I show him that grace which even the gods cannot obtain&rdquo;; (as has been said in these _śloka_s), <em>Iśvara</em> avails Himself of those karmas which have begun to yield their fruit (prārabdha) and which are the cause of these sufferings and punishes these men of hard hearts in order to correct them as a father and the like would (do in the case of such as their sons) with a whip at hand. It is therefore proper to consider such punishments as special favours.</p>
<p>When the king asked whether a disease could be (helpful), Bhattar replied that even a disease could be a teacher for us. Sufferings are teachers to the <em>prapanna</em>, because, if his term of life is already unalterably fixed, they would create repentance in the mind and if his term of life could be extended, they would teach him not to desire extension of life. This is well-known in such instances as Kurathalvan<sup id="fnref:307"><a href="#fn:307" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">307</a></sup></p>
<p>The sufferings are intended only to reveal, to some, their offences with their consequences and then conceal them in order to create utter disgust, disgust like that of Perialvar who says:&mdash; &ldquo;My mind cannot bear the thought of living in <em>samsāra</em>, which is like living in a house in the roof of which there is a serpent,&rdquo; so that thereby they, too, might long for the release from <em>samsāra</em> which <em>Iśvara</em> has made up His mind to confer on them. In such contexts, the aspect of the experience of sorrow or pain is the fruit of evil deeds (in the past). The correction that ensures and that generates (the desire for) performing <em>prāyaścitta</em> is the fruit of the <em>upāya</em>, viz. <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>Azhvan on losing his eye-sight did not long for his eyes again, as they would make him look at the objects of sense-pleasures.</p>
<p>Among these, some punishments are the fruit of certain good deeds in the past which have begun to operate (prārabdha). When the crow (Kakasura in the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>) fell (at <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāma</em>&rsquo;s feet) praying for life, the Lord gave him his life; the fruit of his <em>prapatti</em> was full and complete. Even the punishment inflicted on this wicked crow whereby he lost the sight of one eye was not really of the nature of a punishment. It was a special form of favour (because it would prevent him from doing evil again),</p>
<p>Therefore just as we learn that the Lord&rsquo;s punishment, which is brought about by sins committed in an instant (but) which make the sinner wallow in Hell till the great dissolution (Bramā Pralaya), has great potency, so also we should learn that the special form of praņāma to <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa which is called <sup id="fnref:308"><a href="#fn:308" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">308</a></sup> sukrita pranāma has great potency, for it has been said: &ldquo;A single praņāma to <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa enables a man who wanders about in the wild and trackless forest of <em>samsāra</em> to reach the boundary called <em>mokṣa</em>&rdquo; and also : “ Would it be right to say that a single sukrita pranāma  to <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa is equal to ten horse sacrifices ? (No). The man who has performed ten horse sacrifices returns again to (<em>samsāra</em>), but the man who has performed &lsquo;praņāma to <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa never returns&rdquo;. In accordance with the truths revealed in these _śloka_s, we should interpret the following texts without circumscribing the potency of <em>prapatti</em>, in so far as it does not conflict with the meaning of the <em>śāstra</em> :.- &ldquo;He who performs <em>prapatti</em> only once and says, “I am Thine&rdquo;-to him I grant freedom from fear of all beings. This is my vow&rdquo;, &quot; If you are afraid of sin, O Bharata, desist from all action and remain with the thought that Nārāyaṇa is alone the object to be attained by all possible means &ldquo;, and “Even if a man born of a low caste performs <em>prapatti</em> to the Lord and that only once, the Lord protects him even if he has murdered his father and mother&rdquo;,</p>
<p>Sukṛta praṇāma consists in folding the two hands in añjali thrice and in performing aṣṭāṅ_ga_ namaskāram twelve times touching the ground with the brow, the nose, the eyes and the cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord protects him even if he has murdered his father and his mother&rdquo; - Only when this has not been committed after <em>prapatti</em>, will this <em>śloka</em> not be opposed to the rule concering prayaschitta. If it be done after <em>prapatti</em>, we have already shown how redemption could be obtained. In this way also could be easily explained such passages as this :- &ldquo;Good men protect those who have sought their protection and who pray to them saying, &ldquo;I am yours&rdquo;, even though they have murdered their fathers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>THE POTENCY OF <em>PRAPATTI</em>.</p>
<p>There may be some who are followers of our Viśiṣṭādvaita darśana, who are aspirants to <em>mukti</em> and have sought the protection of <em>Bhagavān</em> through any one of the following paths prescribed in the <em>śāstra</em>, viz., <em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em>, <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em>, <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em> or <em>prapatti</em>, but who are still in the earlier stages of <em>yoga</em> like *Yatamana sanjna, when they have just begun to control the senses. On finding in such men certain diseases like desire for money not completely cured, some to whom freedom from all desires is all important (even more than devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em>) would call them ignorant men unfit to be talked to. But this is improper as pointed out in the Bhagavat <em>Śāstra</em> in the sections dealing with the professions followed by those who suffer from poverty. What has been said about those who follow the wrong path should not be applied to those who follow the right path but stumble in it (occasionally). About the former it has been said: &ldquo;No gifts should be received from those who observe <em>dharma</em> hypocritically for the sake of praise, from rationalists, from heretics and from those who are like cranes (ever bent on catching fish while appearing like one in contemplation): &ldquo;They are to be considered heretics who consider <em>Bhagavān</em> to be like others. They are unfit for the performance of all (_śāstra_ic) rites&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Those who wear matted locks as an ornament and who have shaved their heads bat who eat without performing yajna to the gods and the like, who are without any purity and who omit the performance of tarpanas and sraddhas to their forefathers (pitṛs)-even by talking to such persons men go to Hell&rdquo;. (What has been said in these _śloka_s does not apply to those who have only slipped or stumbled while following the right path).</p>
<p>NO OFFENCE SHOULD EVER BE COMMITTED</p>
<p>AGAINST BHĀGAVATAS :</p>
<p>Anong Bhāgavatas, it is true that degrees of regard have been prescribed for those who have not received the purification by fire<sup id="fnref:309"><a href="#fn:309" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">309</a></sup> (or who have not done the rites or <em>karma</em>  ordained for thern), who have not the.purification due to the wearing of the caste mark ( puṅḍra) (or who have given up their sūtra ), who have not had the purification due to nāma (or who have renounced their _guru_s, gods and the like), and those who have not been initiated into the sacred _mantra_s (or who have no association with good men). But even these will obtain redemption by some means or other (prāyaśćitta and the like) (provided they have not deviated from their exclusive devotion (to <em>Bhagavān</em>). The śāstras have, indeed, laid down the rule that offences should not be committed even against these (men). What has been said of the potency of <em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em> in the following _śloka_s applies even more to that of <em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em>: “The endeavour that has been commenced in this <em>karma</em> -<em>yoga</em> never ends in vain; there is no offence if it is not completed; even a small fraction of this <em>dharma</em> redeems a n:an from measureless <em>samsāra</em>”, and “The &ldquo;man who has begun <em>yoga</em> but has not completed it never perishes either here or in the higher world. (Is it not clear) that the man who has done a good thing will not meet with an evil end?&rdquo; Further the Supreme Ruler Himself said to Arjuna and <em>Dharma</em>. putra respectively :&ndash;&ldquo;Even &ldquo;if a man is of impure ways, if he worships me without the desire for any other fruit, he is certainly a good man (sādhu). He is worthy of esteem, for his intentions are good&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Even&rdquo; if my devotees are inclined to sin, no sin will cling to them, in the same way as water does not stain the leaf of the lotus&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The marks of the conch and the discus (chakra) made with red-hot iron on the two upper arms.</p>
<p>It has (also) been said in the discourse between Puṇḍarīka and Nārada :- He who has sought the protection of the Lord, O best of Brahmins, whether he be clad in a garment of bark, whether he wears matted locks (jatā), whether he holds a triad of sticks (like a sannyāsin), whether he has shaved his head clean or whether he bears the marks of other _āśrama_s or whether he has not any of them- (it does not matter)-  for these are not the causes that win <em>mokṣa</em>. Even those who have no pity, who have wicked minds and are always inclined to evil ways &mdash; even they attain the highest state, provided they have sought the protection of Nārāyaṇa&rdquo;: &ldquo;If the devotees of Viṣṇu commit sins, the sins will not taint them, because they will perform <em>prāyaścitta</em> at once. They purify the whole world like the rising sun.&rdquo; &ldquo;The man in whom, at the end of thousands of virtuous lives, arises the thought that he is the servant of <em>Vāsudeva</em>, who is the Supreme Self in all the worlds &ndash; that man will go to the world of <em>Bhagavān</em>. There is no doubt of this. (Such being the case), is it necessary to speak of those who, with the seoses under control, have fixed their souls in <em>Bhagavān</em>&rdquo;. In these _śloka_s, it is stated that, even if devotees of <em>Bhagavān</em> continue to sin, they will doubtless attain <em>mukti</em> by performing prayaschitta and that (this being so) much more easily will sinless men attain <em>mukti</em>, further the great sage declared also this, among other truths, that those who have no devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em> will never attain the desired goal even by superior deeds of virtue: &ldquo;Those  who do not turn their faces to Nārāyaṇa will never reach the desired goal, even though they have performed a hundred horse-sacrifices and many hundreds of Vajapeya sacrifices&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since it has been said &ndash; &ldquo;He who understands <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa as He is even the gods cannot know the extent of his greatness&rdquo;, even the eternal sūris cannot indeed measure his greatness. Therefore, even if sufferings afflict the devotees of <em>Bhagavān</em> who have continued to commit offences deliberately, they should not be treated with disregard. Has it not been stated as follows:- &ldquo;By bowing before those who are not devotees of <em>Viṣṇu</em>, by speaking of <em>Bhagavān</em> with irreverence, and by the vilification of the devotee of <em>Viṣṇu</em>, (by all these), a man will surely have his fall. There is no doubt of this&rdquo;? &quot; The man who has stolen the bulb of the lotus - let him vilify sanıyāsins always; let him treat with disregard the devotees of <em>Viṣṇu</em>, let him be averse to (the study of) Vedanta, let the man who has stolen the bulb of the lotus be outwardly good, but inwardly wicked; let him hate those who know <em>Brahman</em>, and censure the rites and observances prescribed in the _śāstra_s. Let the man who has stolen the bulb of the lotus be ever perverse in his intelligence and delude those who follow the right code of conduct and who have no firm faith in the śāstra which treats of the <em>jīva</em> and the Paramātmā&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> has, in his <em>Śaraṇāgati</em> Gadyanı spoken of offence to <em>Bhagavān</em> and the like ((i.e.) offence to His devotees) along with the sins of omission and commission (while they too are sins of omission and commission). This is to indicate that offence to <em>Bhagavān</em> (and to Bhāgavatas) is extremely serious, as when we speak of bovine cattle and bulls, the bull is mentioned separately, though it is included in &ldquo;bovine cattle&rdquo;, simply to emphasise the bull. All sins are, of course, offences against <em>Bhagavān</em>. So the separate mention of some kinds of sin is to refer to offences against <em>Bhagavān</em> and His devotees. <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s aim in this separate mention, is to state that whatever offences may be committed against others, if similar offences are committed against <em>Bhagavān</em> or His devotees, they would, by their very nature, lead to more severe punishments just, like treason against kings. The sphere of <em>samsāra</em> is, as it were, the nursery to Hell. Such being the case, it is very difficult to find in it people who walk in the right path. So to think ill of those who follow, in regard to <em>Bhagavān</em>, any one of the paths like <em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em>, which are like the first steps leading to <em>mukti</em>, in accordance with their competence (<em>adhikāra</em>), is to commit an offence against the devotees of <em>Bhagavān</em>.</p>
<p>When it is said :-&rdquo; There &lsquo;is no <em>mukti</em> for one who is extremely devoted to the science of grammar (Sabda <em>Śāstra</em>), for one who sets much store by food and clothing, for one who delights in living in a beautiful house and (as also), for one who is able to allure the minds of the people in the world by one&rsquo;s speech &ldquo;, it means (that there is no <em>mukti</em> for them) when there is no devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em>. The same is the meaning of the <em>śloka</em> :- “Those who are addicted to the pleasures of sex and to good food, and those who commit (the offences of) theft, uttering falsehoods and speaking harsh words, are men that have given up <em>dharma</em> and the gods avoid them and keep at a distance from them on that account.&rdquo; The same is also the purport of such _śloka_s as the following :Those whose minds are firmly fixed on the pleasures of the senses while being averse to Govinda - from then, that Supreme <em>Brahman</em> is at a great distance&rdquo;. So also it is said:-&rdquo; To those? who always think of Govinda and whose minds are firmly fixed on Hin ma to them <em>Bhagavān</em> may be considered to be always at hand&quot;. Such passages declare that there will be no delay (in attaining <em>mukti</em>) for those who are devoted to <em>Bhagavān</em> and who have, at the same time, given up the pleasures of the senses.</p>
<p>Even those who wander about in the disguise of the devotees of <em>Bhagavān</em> without any devotion at heart to Him and who are therefore like tigers wrapped in the skin of the cow for the purpose of springing on cows &ndash; even these are to be treated with respect for their appearance and for their names (Bhāgavatas), in the same way as Uparichara and others treated such persons as the Asuras, until their inner nature was revealed. It is in regard to these actors by profession that (we find) the saying :-&ldquo;The outward mark is not the cause of <em>dharma</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;Though the fruit of the soap-nut&rdquo; tree has the property of rendering (muddy) water clear, yet the water is not rendered clear by the mere utterance of its name&quot;.</p>
<p>THE UTTERANCE OF BHAGAVAN&rsquo;S NAME PURIFIES</p>
<p>ONLY THOSE WHO DO NOT HATE HIM.</p>
<p>From the _śloka_s and Tamil verses that follow, it should not be understood that the mere mention of <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s name, though in contempt or vilification, will destroy all sins:-&ldquo;Thos (who suffer from troubles), who are miserable, who have no steady foothold anywhere, who are afraid of <em>samsāra</em> and who are afflicted with terrible diseases - (all these) obtain freedom (from their ills) by the mere mention of the word &lsquo;Nārāyaṇa&rsquo; and become happy&rdquo;. The man who, even without his being aware of it, pronounces the name of <em>Bhagavān</em>, is freed from all sins, in the same way as a forest is freed from deer owing to the fear of a lion&quot;, &ldquo;The mention of <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s name - though it be to call a person who (merely) bears that name, though it be in irony, though it be pronounced wrongly, though it be in derision -(the mere mention of His name) will destroy all sins&rdquo;. &ldquo;Hari destroys all sins when he is remembered even by men with evil hearts. Even if fire is touched unawares, it certainly burns.&rdquo; &ldquo;The mentions of many of the names of <em>Bhagavān</em> which describe his attributes and actions is much more than is necessary). The mention of a single name is enough; for Ajamila, sinful though he was, attained <em>mukti</em> by calling his son &lsquo;Nārāyaṇa&rsquo; at the time of his death&rdquo;. &ldquo;Kshatrabandhu&rdquo; attained the highest state by the mention of the name &lsquo;Govinda&rsquo; with its three syllables, though he was in the midst of past evil deeds which surrounded him like ants. Why then, should we suffer from <em>samsāra</em>, while we have <em>Śrī</em> Raṅganātha who is so inordinately fond as to be easily accessible towards His servants.&quot; (All these passages should not be taken as literally true). They only mean that, if the man has no hatred for <em>Bhagavān</em>, the mention of <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s name is extremely purificatory, though his faith in <em>Bhagavān</em> is weak, though he utters the name like children and the like without a knowledge of its meaning, though he blabbers the name without any thought, though, his intentions being different, he utters the same as a conventional name or in irony and the like, though he is associated with other aims and though he has faults. Certainly it does not mean that derisive speech concerning <em>Bhagavān</em> and the like would destroy sins. Derisive speech and the like concerning <em>Bhagavān</em> have indeed been counted among the deadly sins (pataka). Has it not been said: &ldquo;They who hate the Supreme Self and do not remember Keśava &ndash; they will not find any good in bathing in the holy waters - nor those who associate with them (out of regard)&rdquo; and also :&ndash; &ldquo;The son that hates his father should be looked upon as born to somebody else. He who always hates <em>Bhagavān</em> should be looked upon as being born to a man of the lowest caste&rdquo;?</p>
<p>It is said in the Bhāgavatam :-&ldquo;The Gopis attained <em>mukti</em> by love (to <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa); Kamsa out of fear (of <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa), Sisupala and other kings by hatred (to <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa), the Vrishnis owing to their relationship; you ( the Pandavas) out of friendship to him and we (Nārada  and others) by devotion&rdquo;. It states that, in some way or other (fear, hatred, love, friendship etc.), those who are associated with <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa will obtain redemption, provided they have done good deeds in the past. The same idea is found also in the <em>śloka</em> :- &quot; Associations with <em>Bhagavān</em>, who is ever pure, whatever be the form it takes, will destroy sins&quot;. These two _śloka_s refer to individuals who had a special competency owing to good deeds done in past lives. This is well-known from the purāṇas which relate the earlier and the later incidents in their lives. (It should not be considered applicable to others.)</p>
<p>RESIDENCE IN HOLY PLACES.</p>
<p>The statement (in certain passages) that the parting from life in certain holy places of <em>Bhagavān</em> will help the attainment of <em>mukti</em> should be understood as applicable only to those who are not ill-disposed to <em>Bhagavān</em>, though, in their indifference, they may be like animals. If not understood in this manner, it would follow that even those who are bent on doing what is displeasing to the Lord would attain <em>mukti</em> (which is absurd).</p>
<p>he passage in the Sātvata Samhita, which says: &ldquo;The mind that is impure owing to subjection to the wild senses &ndash; that mind becomes pure in the last days by living in the holy places of Nārāyaṇa&rdquo; - this passage only means to say that though such men could not realise <em>Bhagavān</em> formerly owing to their addiction to such pleasures as those of the senses which are not opposed to the _śāstra_s, they will attain purity of mind in their last days&quot;. This is evident from the context in Sātvata Samhita (where the passage is found.) “He whom the yogis endeavour by their efforts to fix in their minds at the time of separation from the body&quot;. He enters into their minds without any effort on their part in their last moments. This much superiority they have. This is shown also in the case of prapannas of whom it is said:  They attain to a clear vision merely by My Grace&quot;.</p>
<p>Therefore to those who are inimical to <em>Bhagavān</em>, there is no redemption by these marks which serve their enmity - namely, appearance, bearing the name of <em>Bhagavān</em>, residence in a holy place, and the utterance of His names&quot;,</p>
<p>Things which are displeasing to the Lord, when done in holy places, contribute very greatly to ruin and this is well-known from many _śāstra_s. This is also due to the might of <em>Bhagavān</em>.</p>
<p>To those who are devoted to <em>Bhagavān</em>, whatever acts they do in order to please Him, will, as in the case of Vritra and Kshatra bandhu, themselves destroy all sins and will be the cause of their redemption by some <em>vyāja</em> or gesture.</p>
<p>Sach being the case, <em>Iśvara</em>, who has already made up His mind to grant, to these devotees (who may have some faults also), the blessings of <em>mukti</em> to which they are entitled by their nature, &ndash; <em>Iśvara</em> will ( by some punishment or other means) enable them to expiate their offences. So we should clearly understand that <em>Iśvara</em> is the only controller of whom it is said: &ldquo;He alone&rdquo; is the Ruler who controls: there is no second controller.&quot; . &ldquo;Know that&rdquo; He is the controller over all: He is more subtle than the subtlest ;&quot; and &ldquo;He who dwells within the heart - He controls the whole world: by whom else is any man controlled ?&rdquo; (With this knowledge in our minds ) we should refrain from treating with disregard these devotees on the strength of what is said in such passages as this : The slayer&quot; of Madhu ( Madhusūdana) does not remain in the mind of the man which is impure owing to such things as (evil) desires; the swan never delights in water that is muddy.&quot; On the other hand, we should feel delighted at any good features that might be found in such devotees, even as in finding water in a wilderness.</p>
<p>It has been said :-&ldquo;Whatever a man often does with the activities of his body, mind and speech - it makes a man its captive. Therefore one should (ever) perform what is good. So we should never deviate from the right path with the body, mind or speech.There is a saying that &ldquo;The poison tree called <em>samsāra</em> bears two (kinds of) fruits which are like nectar - one is <em>bhakti</em>  to <em>Bhagavān</em> and the other association with those who are His bhaktas&rdquo;. Therefore we should feel it a blessing that we have obtained the unattainable privilege of association with those really great men who may appear small (in the eyes of the ignorant) and who have the great good fortune of having sought the protection of the Supreme Being, for this should be the great object of desire during our life. time here. We should rest assured &ldquo;that evil&rdquo; deeds can never be ours, as we have been accepted by the Lord (as His servants)&rdquo;, and &ldquo;That the Lord who wields the chakra (the discus) protects us and that (therefore) no one can do anything harmful to us.&rdquo; We should therefore crown ourselves, even here, in anticipation of the empireship of perfect service to the Lord which will be ours in Heaven (Paramapada). This potency which has been determined so far should be remembered in connection with such places as indicate the fruit in the three mysteries (_mantra_s), as established by necessary consequence.</p>

<p>The Supreme Self whose greatness is described in the Vedas, which reveal the truth, is beyond all limitations and beyond all measure in regard to His glory. Therefore, about those who approach Him and seek His feet, though such things as low birth and certain weaknesses may be found in them, yet it cannot be said that their greatness is, in any way, limited. This truth has been taught to us by those who are highest among men and who are free from all partiality.</p>

<p>(1) THE GOD OF THE <em>MANTRA</em>:</p>
<p>Of us who, with a knowledge of its meaning, are meditating on the <em>mantra</em> taught to us by our ācharya which consist of the <em>praṇava</em> (<em>aum</em>) at the beginning with the word <em>namas</em> (<em>namo</em>) and then the word Nārāyanāya revealed in the Vedas - of us who are not competent to adopt other _upāya_s and the responsibility of redeeming whose souls has been accepted by our Lord, May He dispel very soon all those obstacles (past <em>karma</em> ) which stand in the way of our enjoying the imperial bliss of service to Him!.</p>

<p>May that great seer dwelling in the hermitage of Badarika ( Nārāyaṇa ), the friend of (all ) good men, who occupies a certain chariot called <em>Mūlamantra</em> with (its eight syllables as ) its eight wheels and who instructs his reverent pupils, Nara and others (Nārada  and the like) in the <em>dharma</em> concerning himself which is characteristic of Krita Yuga - may that great seer confer (His) blessing on us !</p>

<p>The three _mantra_s Namo Nārāyaṇaya, Namo Bhagavate Vāsudevāya, and Namo Viṣṇave, with the <em>Praṇava</em> (AUM) preceding each are called <em>vyāpaka</em> _mantra_s for they have the words, Nārāyaṇa, <em>Vāsudeva</em> and <em>Viṣṇu</em>, which by their etymology, convey the meaning &lsquo;Omnipresent&rsquo; or &lsquo;all pervading&rsquo; (<em>vyāpaka</em>).</p>

<p>Commentators say that there is here an implied reference also to the author himself who obtained all his knowledge concerning the mūla <em>mantra</em> from his <em>ācārya</em>, <em>Śrī</em> Appullar.</p>
<p>THE PURPORT OF THE THREE _MANTRA_S AND THEIR</p>
<p>RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER:</p>
<p>So far we have explained the most essential truths which every sātvika should remember and established them on a firm basis (of authority (<em>pramāṇa</em>) and argument). We will now proceed to show in what ways, in the three great mysteries (_mantra_s) which reveal all these (truths), the words and the sentences should be construed (in order that their meanings may be properly understood).</p>
<p>Among them, the first, namely, Tiru_mantra_ (<em>aṣṭākṣara</em>) helps us to understand such things as our essential nature, (<em>svarūpa</em>) which finds true happiness only in being the <em>śeṣa</em> of the Supreme Being. By that (revelation), it creates a longing for the Supreme Goal of attainment preceded by the removal of all obstacles thereto and also a feeling of urgency (tvarā) (in regard to that attainment) whereby the competency for the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) becomes perfected. <em>Dvaya</em> reveals clearly the manner in which this particular <em>upāya</em> should be adopted by this adhikārī with an antecedent longing for the fruit thereof. The <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> enjoins (as a <em>vidhi</em>) the adoption of this <em>upāya</em>. Though it is possible to find all these truths in each of these three _mantra_s by itself, from the words themselves and from the sense</p>
<p>suggested by them (ārtha ), yet each of these three has a primary aim (which is different from that of the others). In the Tiru <em>mantra</em>, the first syllable ( a ) in the first word ( <em>aum</em>) expresses, in a concise form, the Supreme Reality who is the Protector or Saviour; in the middle word (<em>namas</em> ) (<em>namo</em>) and the third word (Nārāyanāya ) are to be understood respectively the <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) and the Upeya (the end or goal, viz., service to Nārāyaṇa ); what is stated briefly (in the Tiru_mantra_) is made clear in <em>Dvaya</em>. (1) The word prapadye in <em>Dvaya</em> indicates the particular kind of adhikāri (namely, one who is destitute of other _upāya_s - <em>akiñcana</em>) by the first person singular and (2) the needlessness of other _upāya_s, is inferred from the sense, and (so also) (3) the disappearance of the hindrances to the goal is implicit in the last word <em>namas</em>, The <em>Carama</em>-<em>śloka</em> explains distinctly these (three things), (that are only hinted at in the <em>Dvaya</em> ). These three (_mantra_s) are to us (men destitute of other _upāya_s), maintenance, nourishment and enjoyment (of the fruit), being, respectively, the causes of knowledge (<em>jñāna</em> ), practice or adoption (anushtāna ) and the end or fruit (of our endeavour.)</p>
<p>It has been said: &ldquo;The God, Nārāyaṇa, who is perfect in the possession of the six attributes is certainly in the form of <em>aṣṭākṣara</em> in the mouths of those who utter the <em>mantra</em>,&rdquo; So, from the tongue of the <em>ācārya</em>, it dispels the darkness (ignorance) in the cave of the disciple&rsquo;s heart and makes him realise his pure and essential nature, which finds bliss only in being the <em>śeṣa</em> of the Supreme Being. Since it gives (in this manner) real (spiritual) existence to him, the Tiru_mantra_ is his maintenance (dhāraka). The <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> is the cause of his advancement in the particular kind of knowledge which would enable him to adopt the final <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>). It is the final word as a precept or instruction concerning the <em>upāya</em>, omitting nothing that should be learnt. Therefore the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em> is his nourishment (poṣaka). <em>Dvaya</em> is the cause of the attainment of the Supreme Goal of existence by a single utterance of it and enables a person by constant meditation to feel that he has attained his object. Therefore <em>Dvaya</em> is an object of enjoyment (bhogya).</p>
<p>THE PRIMARY IMPORTANCE OF TIRU_MANTRA_:</p>
<p>Among these three <em>mantra_s), in regard to Tiru_mantra</em>, the seer, (rishi), the metre (chandas) the god revealed by it, (devata), the germ (<em>bīja</em>), the potency (<em>śakti</em>), the colour (<em>varṇa</em>), the application (viniyoga), the locality (sthāna) and nyāsa should be learnt from the respective kalpas and traditions (sampradaya). The greatness and glory of Tiru_mantra_ are well known froin Upaniṣads like Atharvana and Kaṭha, from s&rsquo;astras like that of Manu, and from various kalpas like Nārāyanātmaka Hairaṇyagarbha kalpa, Nāradīya kalpa and Bodhāyanīya kalpa.</p>
<p>It has been said :-&ldquo;Of &ldquo;all _mantra_s, the _mantra_s treating of <em>Bhagavān</em> are the highest. Of the countless _mantra_s treating of <em>Bhagavān</em>, the three vyāpaka _mantra_s are the highest, so also the eternal <em>mūlamantra</em> is the highest of all _mantra_s ; of all secrets, this is the supreme secret; of all things that purify, this is the most purificatory&rdquo;. So it is the highest among the three vyāpaka _mantra_s; it is the essence of all the Vedas; it is capable of removing all evil influences; it is the means of obtaining all the objects desired by men; it helps in the adoption of all _upāya_s; it can be uttered by all castes, either in its Vedic form (with <em>aum</em>) or in its tantric form (without the <em>aum</em>), in accordance with their respective competence; it reveals, in no uncertain terms, all the reals (_tattva_s), both those that are pervaded by <em>Bhagavān</em> and that which pervades all (viz the Supreme Self); it does not require the help or aid of any other <em>mantra</em> and is common to all the forms of <em>Bhagavān</em> (like <em>Śrī</em> Rāma, <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa and so on)<sup id="fnref:312"><a href="#fn:312" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">312</a></sup> . Owing to these reasons, all _ācārya_s delight in it. The Alvars, too, sing its praise with delight in the following passages &ndash; &quot; Having learnt Thy holy <em>mantra</em> with eight syllables&rdquo;, &ldquo;Those who have been initiated by the <em>ācārya</em> into the <em>mantra</em> with eight syllables and utter it with the proper <em>niṣṭhā</em> are capable of ruling over <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em>&rdquo;, &quot; Those who constantly delight in the <em>mantra</em> with eight syllables and utter it become capable of ruling over <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em>&quot;, &ldquo;You were devotees that sang the name of the Lord saying &ldquo;Namo Nārāyanāya&rdquo; so that country and town might understand&rdquo; and &ldquo;By uttering the holy name Namo Nārāyaṇāya in the proper way (i.e.) without seeking any material gain&rdquo; etc, etc. The seers (rishis) too, have declared as follows:- &ldquo;Many were the great seers like Sanaka who attained the abode of <em>Viṣṇu</em> by uttering the <em>Aṣṭākṣara</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;Just&rsquo; as among the deities there is no one superior to Nārāyaṇa, there is, among the _mantra_s, no <em>mantra</em> superior to the <em>Aṣṭākṣara</em>&rdquo;; &ldquo;Raising my hand and swearing that it is true, I declare this to you! O my children and my disciples, listen. There is no <em>mantra</em> superior to the <em>mantra</em> of eight syllables. Adore <em>Bhagavān</em> with it always. Show your devotion to Him with it, and worship Him with it. Those who show their devotion to Him by looking upon this <em>mantra</em> as supreme will never perish (i. e. will not be in <em>Samsāra</em>.)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sitting, or lying down, or standing anywhere, we have adopted only the <em>mantra</em>, Namo Nārāyanāya as our <em>upāya</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They may all be worshipped with the utterance of the mūla_mantra_, whereas other _mantra_s are to be used only in connection with particular forms.</p>
<p>The Supreme Ruler had this <em>mantra</em> taught to Puṇḍarīka by Nārada ; he received it as his supreme good; and as stated in the <em>śloka</em> ; &quot; Puṇḍarīka &ldquo;whose mind was ever bent on <em>dharma</em> understood that, of all things to be attained, Nārāyaṇa was the highest and attained <em>mukti</em> by uttering the <em>mantra</em> with eight syllables : Namo Nārāyaṇāya&rdquo;. He practised this <em>mantra</em> and</p>
<p>obtained release from <em>samsāra</em>. The supreme Ruler, Himself, initiated Tirum_aṅga_i Alvar into this <em>mantra</em>,</p>
<p>IT MAY BE UTTERED BY ALL WITH THE OMISSION OF</p>
<p>THE PRAŅAVA AND THE SUFFIX OF THE</p>
<p>FOURTH CASE AT THE END:</p>
<p>When this <em>mantra</em> is taken without the <em>praṇava</em> (at the beginning) and the dative suffix at the end of Nārāyaṇa (i. e.) (as Namo Nārāyaṇa), every one is competent to utter it. This may be seen from the Varāha purāna in the context of the sanctity of Kaiśika Dvādaśī, where it is said : &quot; (Nampaduvan), who was of the caste that eat dog&rsquo;s flesh, came back after pronouncing the words: Namo Nārāyaņa&quot;. It may also be evident from the following Tamil verses: “When the name of <em>Bhagavān</em> is uttered, one should say Namo Nārāyaṇa &ldquo;, &quot; Having obtained this excellent garland called Namo Nārāyaṇa etc&rdquo; and &quot; there is certainly a tongue in the mouth and there is certainly also the <em>mantra</em> called Namo Nāraņa&quot; which should be uttered at a single breath&quot;.</p>
<p>To Brahmins and the like (Kṣatriyas), the <em>mantra</em> consists of eight syllables including the <em>praṇava</em> just as it occurs in the Veda. It has been stated: &ldquo;Karma<sup id="fnref:313"><a href="#fn:313" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">313</a></sup> is said, in the ocean of nectar called <em>Pāñcarātra</em>, to be of three kinds: to Brahmins <em>karma</em>  is Vaidic (i.e.) to be performed with Vedic _mantra_s; to Kshatrias, <em>karma</em>  is both Vaidic and tantric; to Vaiśyas and Śūdras <em>karma</em>  is tantric; or <em>karma</em>  may be tantric to all. Aṣṭākṣara, (the <em>mantra</em> with eight syllables), <em>Dvādaśākṣara</em> (the <em>mantra</em> with twelve syllables <em>Namo Bhagavate Vāsudevāya</em> with the <em>praṇava</em> at the beginning) and the <em>Ṣaḍakṣara</em> (the <em>mantra</em> with six syllables, <em>Namo Viṣṇave</em> with the <em>praṇava</em> at the beginning) - these are the principal _mantra_s of <em>Viṣṇu</em> whose splendour is beyond all measure. These _mantra_s with the <em>praṇava</em> ( at the beginning) are Vaidika _mantra_s; without the <em>praṇava</em> they are Tântric _mantra_s. To women and Śūdras the utterance of the <em>Mūlamantra</em> should be without the dative suffix (of the word Nārāyaṇa). So also there is, for them, no svara, no <em>praṇava</em> nor _aṅga_nyāsa or other rules. To them the utterance of the mere <em>mantra</em> (without <em>praṇava</em> ) is enjoined.&rdquo; In accordance with this, it has been stated further: &ldquo;The syllable a in the latter part of the word Nārāyaṇa (i.e.) ayana denotes <em>Viṣṇu</em>. If the nasal sound of the vowel m (anuswāra) at the end of the word ayanam be added to it, it becomes am and this &lsquo;a with the m becomes the germ (<em>bīja</em>) of mūlamantra. By this addition, the <em>mantra</em> comes to consist of eight letters.</p>
<p>When the worship of <em>Viṣṇu</em> is performed with only Vedic _mantra_s, it is Vaidic <em>karma</em> ; when it is performed only with the _mantra_s found in <em>Pāñcarātra</em>, it is tantric and when it is performed with both, the <em>karma</em>  is said to be both Vaidic and tantric.</p>
<p>Even without the <em>praṇava</em>, these adhikārīs (women and Śūdras) obtain the same fruit or goal and this may be seen from the following <em>śloka</em> - &ldquo;Of what use are many _mantra_s for the purpose of the fruit desired? Of what use are many vratas (ascetic observances )? The <em>mantra</em>, Namo Nārāyanāya, confers all the boons that may be desired&rdquo;. The a in am which has been prescribed as a substitute for praṇava (<em>aum</em>) should be considered as having, in brief, all the meaning contained in <em>praṇava</em>, because the syllable a being the first letter is stated (in the <em>śāstra</em>) to denote everything in a concise form. The meaning of the syllable u in the praňava, namely, &lsquo;only&rsquo; is inferred from the meaning. The ideas of knowership and the like contained in the third letter of <em>praṇava</em>, namely m should be understood as being present in the base of the second syllable of <em>namas</em> (or <em>namo</em>), namely m.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF PRAŅAVA AND ITS POTENCY:</p>
<p>When the <em>praṇava</em> is used as an independent <em>mantra</em> by itself, it may be pronounced in a single unit or instant of time (mātra), or two units of time, or three or three and a half units of time and its meanings vary in accordance with these units of time to denote either <em>Brahman</em> as effect ( kārya ) or <em>Brahman</em> as cause ( kāraṇa): (i. e.) when it is pronounced in a single unit of time, it means <em>Brahman</em> with the earth as His body; when in two units, it means, <em>Brahman</em> with the antariksha (the middle air or sky) as His body: when in three units, it means <em>Brahman</em> with the world of <em>svarga</em> as His body; when in three and a half units of time, it denotes <em>Brahman</em> the Pure and the ultimate cause (of every thing). In some _śāstra_s it is said that, when the <em>praṇava</em> begins any of the three vyāpaka _mantra_s, it should be considered as a single syllable (without any parts as a-u- m) and as denoting then the Supreme Self.</p>
<p><em>Praṇava</em> or the Veda consistiog of three letters, existed at the beginning, and the three Vedas, Rik, Yajus, and Sāman were within it (in a, u and m respectively). It should be kept as a secret. It is a Veda with three letters and is different from the other Vedas. He who knows the <em>praṇava</em> is a Vedavit (one who knows the Veda or the three Vedas).&rdquo; The greatness and glory of <em>praṇava</em> are well known from such passages as the above. In the nyāsa_vidyā_, the <em>praṇava</em> is an independent <em>mantra</em> and refers to the surrender of the self, for it has been said: “The <em>havis</em> or offering called the self should be taken with the <em>mantra</em> beginning <sup id="fnref:314"><a href="#fn:314" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">314</a></sup> vasuranya and offered in the eternal fire called Acyuta with the <em>mantra</em> called <em>praṇava</em>&quot;. For the same reason some construe it even here as denoting surrender. Others construe that the <em>praṇava</em> should be considered in the Tiru_mantra_ only as helping to realise one&rsquo;s being <em>śeṣa</em> (to the Lord), since primarily it gives knowledge of the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of the <em>jīva</em> being <em>śeṣa</em>, If so, it contributes a qualification or element of competence for the <em>upāya</em> (viz. praying for protection).</p>
<p>The <em>mantra</em> vasuranya in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad.</p>
<p>It has been said :-&ldquo;By a knowledge of <em>Iśvara</em>, the devont <em>jīva</em> attains supreme purity&rdquo;. When we consider <em>praṇava</em> as giving only a knowledge of the <em>śeṣī</em> (<em>Bhagavān</em>), &lsquo;supreme purity&rsquo; would mean that it removes the unfitness of the <em>jīva</em> for the adoption of the <em>upāya</em>. When we consider <em>praṇava</em> as indicating a kpowledge of the <em>upāya</em>, namely, <em>Bhagavān</em>, (and not the knowledge of the seshi), &lsquo;supreme purity&rsquo; would mean <em>mokṣa</em>. <em>Bhagavān</em> Śāṇḍilya explained, as follows, the way in which the meaning of <em>praṇava</em> should be considered:- &ldquo;This Supreme Being is of such and such a nature and the <em>jīva</em> is of such and such a nature. Yoga is said to be a knowledge of the relationship between the two (that <em>Iśvara</em> is the seshi and the <em>jīva</em> the <em>śeṣa</em> )&rdquo;. This meaning has been elaborated as follows:-&ldquo;the a (in*<em>praṇava</em>) is <em>Viṣṇu</em> who creates, sustains and destroys the world, the m (in it) means the <em>jīva</em>, who exists for the fulfiment of the purposes of <em>Viṣṇu</em>. The u (in it) indicates that this relationship between the two can exist only between them (and no others). So <em>praṇava</em> which consists of three letters and is the essence of the (three) Vedas reveals this meaning.&rdquo; The Tamil verse which says, &ldquo;I am the &ldquo;servant of <em>Bhagavān</em>, the Lord of Tirukkannapuram; how am I entitled to be the servant of anyone else ?&rdquo; - this Tamil verse also explains the meaning of <em>praṇava</em>. The _śrut_is and the _smṛti_s describe the three letters of <em>praṇava</em> as the essence of the three Vedas.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF A IN <em>PRAṆAVA</em>:</p>
<p>That these letters have these meanings will be seen from the following passage in Vamana purāna : -&lsquo;By the first letter a in the <em>praṇava</em>, which is one of the members or limbs of the <em>mantra</em> with eight letters, <em>Bhagavān</em>, who is the support of everything, is denoted; the letter a is the origin of all words and <em>Brahman</em> is the origin of all things denoted by these words.</p>
<p>Therefore a denotes <em>Bhagavān</em>. He is denoted by that letter. This relationship between the letter a and <em>Bhagavān</em> is seen from the meaning to be appropriate.&rdquo; <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> stated in the Vedārthasangraha that by the first letter (of <em>praṇava</em>) which is the origin of all words is denoted Nārāyaṇa who is the origin of all things denoted by these words. From this it follows that Bhaga van is the material and the instrumental cause of the whole world and that, as may be inferred from this, He is both omniscient and omnipotent and has other such qualities. &ldquo;a means  negation (No) and when masculine denotes <em>Viṣṇu</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;The letter a denotes <em>Viṣṇu</em>&rdquo;; &quot; By using the letter a, which is the first name of Nārāyaṇa, what (an excellent) benedictory prayer has been made !&quot; All this is evident from the Nighantus and the usage of scholars.</p>
<p>When this a denotes the Supreme Ruler, it is derived, according to the science of grammar, from the verbal root ava which means to protect, to please etc., (the termination va is dropped) and the word that results refers to one who is a protector and so on (one who pleases). Though this root has many meanings, its best-known meaning is to protect; further it is this meaning which is required here (in connection with the <em>mantra</em> &lsquo;<em>aum</em>&rsquo;); besides there is no authoritative etymological explanation that it should be considered as having many meanings; so the first meaning given (in grammar), namely, to protect is the direct and primary meaning of the word and the other meanings, when required, should be considered as suggested (lukshaņā) by the primary meaning. This is the appropriate way of explaining and the ācāryas have commented on it only in this way as meaning the Protector or Saviour. As the meaning &lsquo;protector&rsquo; is not restricted by any limiting adjunct, the protectorship extends to all. The manner of protection varies with the objects of protection as shown by the pramāņas (sources of knowledge). Since the protection is not stated to be based on any reason or condition, it might appear to be unconditioned (nirupādhika) but <em>Iśvara</em>, who is omnipotent and independent, expects some <em>vyāja</em> or action prescribed by His will to be performed by the <em>jīva</em>, which would serve as a justification for conferring <em>mokṣa</em> and the like on those who are in <em>samsāra</em>. Towards the _nitya_s ( the eternal süris) and those who have already attained <em>mukti</em>, the protection is full and complete by way of maintaining what is already present and this is the result of <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s natural and unconditioned mercy. But this natural mercy (karunya) is restrained in the case of those in <em>samsāra</em> by the condition (upādhi) of the need for punishment which has arisen by beginningless offence when actions which are displeasing to Him have occurred. <em>Prapatti</em> and other _vyāja_s have been prescribed in the _Śāstra_s only for removing this condition which acts as a restraining force (on the Lord&rsquo;s (mercy).</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>त्राणे स्वामित्वमौचित्यं न्यासाद्यास्सहकारिणः ।</p>
<p>प्रधानहेतुस्स्वातन्त्र्यविशिष्टा करुणा विभोः ॥॥</p>
<p>The fact of being the Master makes it appropriate that He should proteot; <em>prapatti</em> and the like are (only) secondary helps.The primary reason (for protecting) is the Omnipresent Lord&rsquo;s mercy which is not dependent upon anything else.</p>
<p>As stated in the <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;In all siddhāntas and in Vedanta, it is declared that the Lord protects with His consort <em>Lakṣmī</em>, ever by His side, for she is the very embodiment of mercy&rdquo;, the Lord who has determined to grant redemption to all is ever ready (to do so) with His consort. The relationship with His spouse for the purpose of protection, which is evident from the pramāņas is derived (not explicitly from the words but) by inference from the purpose (of protection) which is evident from the <em>pramāṇa_s. Whenever <em>Bhagavān</em> is referred to, <em>Lakṣmī</em> should also be considered as referred to, for it results from the principle:- &ldquo;If two things are enjoined as necessary, wherever one of them is mentioned, the other should also be considered as indicated” (Sanniyogasiṣṭanyāya). Thus the ācāryas, too, have said, “Since Thou(<em>Lakṣmī</em>) art ever inseparably connected with Thy Lord, even the Veda does not mention Thee separately.&rdquo; In all vidyās or forms of meditation (prescribed in the Upaniṣads) all qualities and attributes of <em>Brahman</em> which define His Nature are to be meditated upon (even though only one or two of them are actually mentioned in the particular <em>Vidyā</em>). Similarly this attribute, Namely, <em>Lakṣmī</em>, who is the most important of all attributes should also be borne in mind. It is this attribute (<em>Lakṣmī</em>) which rules out other deities, (for they are not related to <em>Lakṣmī</em> in that way) and defines <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s essential nature which is not dependent upon anything else, as having an excellence which surpasses everything else, His essential nature, form and glories, which do not arise from any other source, acquire even greater splendour from the essential nature, form and glories of <em>Lakṣmī</em>, who is His attribute, and shine thereby. This may be seen in the simile; &ldquo;like radiance which cannot be separated from the sun.&rdquo; And this has been declared by the great sages who understood the nature and person of the Supreme Deity. So also in the word Nārāyaṇa in Tiru_mantra</em>, Nārāyaṇa&rsquo;s relationship to His consort should be borne in mind. This relationship to the spouse is distinctly and explicitly stated in the <em>Dvaya</em> (_Śrī_mat - with <em>Śrī</em>). In <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s elaboration of the <em>Dvaya</em> in his <em>Gadya</em><sup id="fnref:315"><a href="#fn:315" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">315</a></sup> , it is true that, among the nārās in the words beginning with <em>Bhagavān</em> Nārāyaṇa (Nārānām + ayanam) <em>Lakṣmī</em> is included among the nāras by commentators. (From this it might be argued that she is also a <em>jīva</em> like other nāras). But this inclusion is only to indicate Her dependence on Her Lord and Nāras means etymologically only “those who are related to Nara&quot; without the specification of the form of relationship. So from that, it should not be inferred that <em>Lakṣmī</em> is also a <em>jīva</em>.</p>
<p><em>Śaraṇāgati</em> <em>Gadya</em>.</p>
<p>Here the first letter a is in the dative or fourth case singular, the (usual) dative singular suffix has been dropped. The reasons for holding that the a is in the dative singular (when no case - suffix is seen ) are as follows: (1) In the place which enjoins the surrender of the self to the Supreme Self (i.e.) the Taittirīya Upaniṣad, the <em>praṇava</em> is prescribed as the <em>mantra</em> (for doing so); (so it should mean &rsquo;to the Supreme Self (dative)&rsquo;, (2) the <em>mantra</em> should reveal the nature of the action to be performed, (3) the self to be surrendered is seen in the third letter (m) (in <em>aum</em>) and the Supreme Brahman for whom it is surrendered is seen in the base (<em>prakṛti</em>, viz. a) of the first letter; (4) the person to whom the surrender is made and the object which is surrendered should not be in the same case. Therefore the a (which is the first letter) should be considered to be in the case (i.e.) (dative) suited to the word indicating the person to whom the surrender is made. The view of perverse interpreters (Advaitins) that a and the m (in <em>aum</em> are in the same case (nominative or first case ) and indicate the identity in the essential nature of the <em>jīva</em> and the Supreme Self is opposed to many <em>pramāṇa_s (like pratyaksha and sabda); besides it would not fit in with the natural and obvious meaning of the word <em>namo</em> (<em>namas</em>) and the dative of the word Nārāyaṇa (i.e.) Nārāyaṇāya which are uttered along with the <em>praṇava</em>, This is obvious also from the text twhich distinguishes <em>praṇava</em> as the bow, the self as the arrow, <em>Brahman</em> as the target and the act of surrender as the hitting of the target (the arrow and the target cannot be identical). In the <em>praṇava</em> in Tiru_mantra</em>, when the intention is the surrender of responsibility (<em>bharasamarpaṇam</em>), the dative or fourth case should be considered to have the same meaning as the dative in the <em>praṇava</em> considered as an independent <em>mantra</em> (i.e.) the person to whom the surrender is made. When the <em>praṇava</em> is interpreted as indicating the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of the self which consists in existing solely for the Supreme Self (i.e.) in being <em>śeṣa</em>, the dative signifies &lsquo;having another&rsquo;s interests alone as one&rsquo;s interests&rsquo;. Therefore it reveals the relationship of <em>śeṣa</em> and <em>śeṣī</em> which exists between the <em>jīva</em> and the Paramātmā. We should then bear in mind that we are unconditional _śeṣa_s (nirupādhika <em>śeṣa</em>) to the Supreme Self, who is the unconditional seshi (nirupādhika seshi).</p>
<p>When the Lord who is the Supreme Ruler says, “You are my <em>śeṣa</em>&quot; and pursues him, the <em>jīva</em>, owing to his egoism, tries to wriggle out saying, “ I exist only for myself.&quot; Therefore the thought that we are _śeṣa_s to the Supreme Ruler will give (spiritual) existence to the <em>jīva</em>, who is otherwise, as it were, (spiritually) non-existent. To indicate the importance of this thought that we are _śeṣa_s), the relationship to the <em>śeṣī</em> (for a) is declared even before the mention of the <em>śeṣa</em> (namely m the <em>jīva</em>).</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>;</p>
<p>॥ निश्चिते परशेषत्वे शेषं संपरिपूर्यते । अनिश्चिते पुनस्तस्मिन्नन्यत्सर्वमसत्समम् ॥</p>
<p>When the relationship of our being _śeṣa_s to the Supreme Being is well established in the mind, the other requisities (for spiritual life) such as self-control and serenity (sama and dama) follow easily as being necessary to it. When that thought is not established in the mind, all the rest serve no purpose and are, as it were, non-existent.</p>
<p>When <em>Iśvara</em> is the <em>śeṣī</em> of all, He is always (to be thought of as) with His Consort, for it has been said, “The two kinds of glory (<em>nityavibhūti</em> and <em>līlā</em> - <em>vibhūti</em>) are <em>śeṣa</em> to me and to her, O <em>Brahma</em> and this is declared in the Vedanta and in my _śāstra_s (Pancharātra āgamas).&quot; So also it is said &ldquo;Being seshi is single and it rests with two (<em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Lakṣmī</em>).” In the Agnisho miya sacrifice, the deity (to whom the <em>havis</em> or offering is made) is not Agni alone not Soma alone; the deity of the sacrifice (which is single) is Agni and Soma. So also in this offering of the self, the deity to whom the offering is intended is both (<em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Lakṣmī</em>). In order to reveal this, it was said “Being <em>śeṣī</em> is single and it rests with two&rdquo;. When we consider the <sup id="fnref:316"><a href="#fn:316" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">316</a></sup> text<sup id="fnref:317"><a href="#fn:317" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">317</a></sup></p>
<p>Kaṭha text: By the letter a is denoted <em>Viṣṇu</em>, the ruler of all the worlds, and <em>Lakṣmī</em> who is supported by <em>Viṣṇu</em> is denoted by the letter u; the m indicates that the <em>jīva</em> is their servant. This is the definition of <em>praṇava</em>.</p>
<p>in the Kaṭha <em>śruti</em>, it becomes clear from the words themselves that the self is <em>śeṣa</em> to both. To be <em>śeṣa</em> is to serve the purposes of another without the primary desire to gain something for oneself.</p>
<p>vide page _______</p>
<p>The author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> has explained it as follows:-“ He is the <em>śeṣa</em> whose essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) has, for its sole interest, the promotion of the glory or excellence of another; the other is the <em>śeṣī</em>.&quot; The genitive dual case ending which is indicated by the Kaṭha <em>śruti</em> (their servant) is elliptical. The genitive or sixth case, which ordinarily indicates relationship in general, extends here to the special relationship of being <em>śeṣa</em> to <em>śeṣī</em> which is understood from the _pramāṇa_s. Or it may be considered that in order to make clear the relationship of existing only for them&rsquo;, (viz. <em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Lakṣmī</em>), the dative dual termination is present, though in ellipsis. If we take this view, the <em>śruti</em> which says &ldquo;the servant of both&rdquo; explains the meaning of the elliptical dative dual.</p>
<p>If we take this interpretation that the u refers to <em>Lakṣmī</em> and that the self is <em>śeṣa</em> to both (<em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Lakṣmī</em>) the ‘only’ formerly stated to be the meaning of u (in a u m) is not given by the word itself but is suggested by the context. It comes to this that this self (the <em>jīva</em>) is the unconditioned <em>śeṣa</em> to both <em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Lakṣmī</em> and to no other.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF U IN  AUM :</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, we take the middle letter u to mean &lsquo;only&rsquo; in accordance with Vedic usage, the meaning &lsquo;only&rsquo; is to prevent the doubts concerning the relationship of being <em>śeṣa</em> extending to any other (deity) unconditionally and this is done by the word itself (and is not merely suggested by the context). Since it declares that the relationship of being <em>śeṣa</em> to other deities than <em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Lakṣmī</em> does not pertain to one&rsquo;s essential nature, it follows that contact with other deities should not exist to the man who has a knowledge of the nature of his self, and this avoidance of contact extends even to the devotees of other deities. In the chapter on the Ultimate Object in Life, we have already stated that, since being <em>śeṣa</em> to Bhāgavatas is pleasing to the Lord, it does not constitute the offence of being <em>śeṣa</em> to others.</p>
<p>Thus if by the force of the word itself (namely u), we get the meaning that the relationship of being <em>śeṣa</em> is ruled out in the case of others, it is also evident that the idea of the relationship not existing (towards the Lord) is also ruled out, (since there is no limitation of time (i.e.) the self is always <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord and is never non-<em>śeṣa</em> to Him). By this ruling out of the non-existence of the relationship of <em>śeṣa</em>, the substance (dravya) called the sentient being&rsquo; is seen to be an attribute incapable of being separated from <em>Iśvara</em> (at any time or place) and is therefore shown to be his body, in the same way as non-septient matter is His body.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF M IN AUM:</p>
<p>The third letter m (in <em>aum</em>) denotes, primarily, the <em>jīva</em> but means also by implication (Upalakṣaṇa) all other things which are <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord. That this (m) denotes the <em>jīvātmā</em> may be understood from the following: (1) The letter m which denotes the <em>jīva</em> should be used to perform vyāpaka <em>nyāsa</em> (i.e. ) to perform <em>nyāsa</em> in one&rsquo;s body as if it pervades the whole body&quot;: (2) The five groups of consonants (in the Sanskrit alphabet) each containing five letters beginning with k (क) and ending with m(म) denote the twentyfive _tattva_s or reals as stated in the Tattvasagarasamhita and the like. The Supreme Ruler is always within these reals as their Inner Self” and (3) “The five* letters in the Ka (F) group denote the five elements (bhutani), those in the Cha (च) group denote the five senses of action (karmendriyās); those in the ta (ट) group denote the five senses of knowledge (jnanendriyas), those in the ta (त) group denote the five tanmatras (like smell) the pa (प) denotes the mind, the pha (फi) ahaṅkāra, ba (ब) denotes mahat and bha (भ) <em>prakṛti</em>. The _jīva_tma is denoted by the letter m and he is the twentyfifth <em>tattva</em> or real.&quot;</p>
<p>From these it is evident that the jivātma is different (both) from the twenty-four reals which have the defects of inertness and non-sentience and from the twenty-sixth Real, (namely, <em>Iśvara</em>) who is the (ultimate) cause of everything, the Saviour of all and the seshi of all and who is indicated by the first letter (in <em>aum</em>),</p>
<p>In the Tiru_mantra_, the words, and Nāra (in Nārāyaṇa), refer only to the attributes, namely, the <em>jīva</em> (and matter) as determinate words ( Niṣkarṣaka words)<sup id="fnref:318"><a href="#fn:318" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">318</a></sup> and do not refer to the Supreme Self within the <em>jīva</em> (and matter).</p>
<p>According to Viśiṣṭādvaita doctrine, many words are indeterminate in meaning; for example go or cow may mean the body of the cow, or the soul of the cow or the Supreme Self within the cow as its Antaryāmi; some words are determinate in meaning, for instance &lsquo;cowness&rsquo; ( gotvam ) which refers only to the jāti (genus) &lsquo;cow&rsquo; of the cow. The m (in <em>aum</em>) refers to the <em>jīva</em> and not to the Supreme Self).</p>
<p>If we examine the grammatical form of this letter (m), it is found to have been derived from the root mana meaning &rsquo;to know&rsquo; and other such roots (mas - meaning &lsquo;measure &lsquo;) and it denotes the jīvātmā who is atomic and who is of the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of <em>jñāna</em> and (at the same time) possessed of the attribute, <em>jñāna</em>. This is in accordance with the <em>Brahma</em> <em>Sūtra</em> (2-3-19), which says &quot; The jīvātmā is a knower (i.e.) he possesses the attribute &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; (and is not merely <em>jñāna</em> or knowledge as the Advaitins contend) and this is from the śruti itself&quot;.</p>
<p>Though the <em>jīvātmā</em> is said to be, in general terms, of the essential nature of knowledge, yet since this essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) is known from the _pramāṇa_s (sabda and the like) to be agreeable and pleasing, it is also of the essential nature of <em>ānanda</em> or bliss which is a specific form of knowledge.</p>
<p>When the _jīva_tma is said to be possessed of the attribute, knowledge, since the _pramāṇa_s declare him to be possessed of knowledge without any restrictive word, it should be understood that in the state of <em>mukti</em>, his knowledge is all-pervasive and got limited by conditions (or upadhi) and without any restriction or limit.</p>
<p>When we consider this natural and pure form of the jivātma, it will appear that it is free from the inertness and other such defects of nonsentient things and so also from such things as pain, suffering etc., which are found in <em>samsāra</em>. Hence in the essential nature and the attributes (<em>svarūpa</em> and <em>dharma</em>) of the jivātmā, there is also spotlessness or freedom from all impurity or defect (nirmalatva). The seeker after salvation should meditate that the jīvātmā is absolutely pure and has its enjoyment only in being <em>śeṣa</em> to the Supreme Being and this may be seen from the <em>Brahma</em> <em>Sūtra</em> (3-3-52) which says: &ldquo;No, only the state (of the jivātmā) that differs from the state of <em>samsāra</em> (should be meditated upon), for that is the state which will ensue (in <em>mokṣa</em>) as in the contemplation of <em>Brahman</em> as He is &ldquo;.</p>
<p>To the <em>prapanna</em>, the meditation on the fruit of attainment in <em>mukti</em> is useful in creating a desire for that fruit. The forms of meditation (concerning the form of the self) are different in accordance with the difference in the fruits desired and this is evident from the eighth chapter of the Gita and <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> and other such treatises.</p>
<p>Since the _pramāṇa_s declare a plurality (or very large number) of souls, this third letter m (in <em>aum</em>), used in the singular, denotes the <em>jāti</em> or genus (and not a single individual), as in the <em>Brahma</em> <em>Sūtra</em> (2-3.18) which says. The soul (or self) is not (generated) for (so says) the <em>Śruti</em>.&rsquo; (Here the word &rsquo; soul&rsquo; denotes the genus and therefore it really means &rsquo; souls&rsquo; (or self&rsquo;s).</p>
<p>Though it is stated here that all souls are _śeṣa_s to <em>Bhagavān</em> in general terms as in: &ndash;&ldquo;All souls are the servants of the Supreme Self by their very nature&rdquo; &ndash; yet since the individual is also included in the all souls,&rsquo; it follows that for that reason, every one should realise that he is also the servant of the Lord.</p>
<p>Here the knowledge of being a <em>śeṣa</em>, the abandonment of the conceit of one&rsquo;s independence (of the Lord), the adoption of the particular <em>upāya</em> (namely, <em>prapatti</em>) and the prayer for the fruit to be attained, namely, the service of a <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord have all to arise in the individual; therefore the individual is the principal (figure). So some _ācārya_s say that the word <em>aham</em> (I) should be taken as understood and as being the substantive to which the m (which means the <em>jīva</em>) is the adjective &ldquo;I who am a <em>jīva</em>&rdquo;. In that case, as stated also in _śloka_s which elaborate the <em>praṇava</em>, &ldquo;Whatever is mine and I myself are Thine, O Lord, Madhava! I am well aware of this &ldquo;; since attributes always follow the principal (or the substantive), the qualities and attributes are also intended by implication (Upalakṣaṇa), (2) Other _ācārya_s hold that the third letter itself (m) shows the <em>aham</em> (or I) by dropping, in the word (asmat=I) of the first part as and the latter part at and retaining only the consonant m in the middle, in accordance with Vedic usage. In <em>Nyāsa</em> <em>vidyā</em> (as described in the Taittiriya upanishad) which enjoins the offering of the self as an oblation to the Supreme Being, the <em>praṇava</em> is called the <em>mantra</em> (for it). In order that the action to be performed may be made clear, the actual words indicating the Supreme Self and the individual self should be expressed and not remain merely implicit. Since according to the <em>pramāṇa_s, the first letter (a) denotes the person to whom the surrender is made and the middle letter (u) has some other meaning (either only or <em>Lakṣmī</em>), by the law of what remains (pāriseshya) the third letter (m) should indicate the oblation, namely, the individual self that is to be offered. Therefore it is appropriate to hold that this (third) letter should mean <em>aham</em> (or I). Therefore it is that Bhattar commented on the <em>praṇava</em> in Tiru_mantra</em> as follows:- &ldquo;I exist only as the property for <em>Bhagavān</em> who is indicated by the letter a&rdquo;.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF NAMAS OR NAMO IN TIRU_MANTRA_:</p>
<p>So also the ma in <em>namas</em> (<em>namo</em>) denotes the individual self in any one of the three ways indicated before (1) 25th <em>tattva</em> (2) the knowing self and (3) short for <em>aham</em>. This ma is in the genitive or sixth case ending, and the na (which precedes it) means negation &rsquo;no&rsquo; or &rsquo;not&rsquo;. So it is equivalent to na mama (not mine). The negation na (not) is placed first to indicate its greater importance as in the sentence drishtā Sītā (seen was Sītā). The genitive case in ma is a mark of relationship in general (sambandha sāmanya) and implies (here) the particular form of relationship (that of a <em>śeṣa</em> to the <em>śeṣī</em>). It is with this idea indeed that Bhattar said, &quot; I do not then exist for myself.” The idea contained in this <em>namas</em> which has the same purport as the ‘only’ of the middle letter u in <em>praṇava</em>&ndash;for all sentences should be considered as expressive of exclusive affirmation (avadharana) - this idea is of the greatest importance, and it is said in such _śloka_s as the following:- &quot; The cause of <em>samsāra</em> (bondage) is the two letters mama (mine) and the cause of attaining the eternal <em>Brahman</em> is the sentence having three letters na mama (I am) not mine).&rdquo; The idea of the following <em>śloka</em> has also the same porport as this <em>namas</em>:-&ldquo;All that is crooked is the cause of <em>samsāra</em>; all that is straight is the cause that effects the attainment of <em>Brahman</em>&rdquo;. (Here the idea that we exist for _Bhagavān_i is straight and the idea that we exist for ourselves is crooked.)</p>
<p>If it is asked “What is it that is not mine (na mama)?&rdquo;, the answer is found supplied by the context (anush_aṅga_) viz., the third letter in <em>praṇava</em> and is as follows :</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not belong to myself&rdquo;. In the chapter on <sup id="fnref:319"><a href="#fn:319" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">319</a></sup> anush_aṅga_(The Context) it is evident that the meaning indicated by the context (anush_aṅga_) is more appropriate than the meaning arrived at by the insertion of a new word (adhyāhara).- Here na mama <em>aham</em> &ldquo;I am not mine&rdquo; specifies that I am not mine. As the middle letter (in <em>praṇava</em> ) namely only, has already stated that I exist only for <em>Iśvara</em>, which negates _śeṣa_tva to others, this specification in <em>namas</em> indicates that in others oneself is also included. By the principle illustrated in  go-balīvarda<sup id="fnref:320"><a href="#fn:320" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">320</a></sup></p>
<p>Namas. Advaitins might say that the ma is in the ablative or fifth case meaning &ldquo;than I&rdquo; (There is nothing other than I) and if we consider that the word kinchit is understood and insert it, ‘na ma&rsquo; may mean &ldquo;There is nothing else other than l&rdquo;. Here the word kinchit has to be understood (adhyāhara) which is not so appropriate, as anuṣ_aṅga_</p>
<p>(The specification is to show the negation of oneself in special as not having been included in the ‘others&rsquo; stated in the middle letter).</p>
<p>Though the Sanskrit word Go[गो] would include &ldquo;bull&rdquo; yet the phrase go and bull is often used to emphasise bull and draw special attention to it.</p>
<p>Aham na mama (&ldquo;I am not mine&rdquo;) is the sentence in <em>namas</em>. From this it becoms clear that even one&rsquo;s <em>svarūpa</em> (essential nature) does not belong to oneself. Since attributes and qualities always follow the principal or substantive, it is tantamount to saying, specially, that one is not the unconditioned master of anything (belonging to one). This is the purpose of the specification,</p>
<p>If we do not take the word <em>aham</em> from the context (anush_aṅga_) and accept the interpretation given above, it would mean that the general misapprehension that certain things (for example, our body and our qualities) really belong to us will be taken away from one&rsquo;s self.</p>
<p>Thus <em>namas</em> dispels one&rsquo;s conceit (abhimāna) about oneself and about those which appear to be one&rsquo;s by stating that they do not belong to one and the root causes of <em>samsāra</em>, namely the notions of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;mine&rsquo; which are false, are thereby removed. The conceit (ahamkāra) which is thus removed is a form of illusory knowledge. The word ahamkāra is used also to mean one of the twenty-four reals (tattvas), but that ahamkāra is not capable of being removed by mere intelligence. It persists with the <em>jīva</em> until its separation from the subtle body (sīkshma <em>śarīra</em>). Though this connection with the non-sentient <em>tattva</em> (real) called ahankāra continues to exist, its effects in the form of the disease of conceit (abhimana) and the like which are illusory are cured by medicine in the forın of discrimination (viveka) resulting from such things as the mūlamantra.</p>
<p>Since, from the middle letter of <em>praṇava</em>, the notion that one is <em>śeṣa</em> to any other than the Lord is got rid of, there is no need to state separately that one is not <em>śeṣa</em> to oneself. Therefore the purport may also be to show that the person to whom certain things appear to be <em>śeṣa</em> and who appears to be <em>śeṣī</em> is not the unconditioned master or <em>śeṣī</em> of any of these things. All those things that are <em>śeṣa</em> to the <em>jīva</em> (like his body, his attributes, his wealth etc.) are indeed those that were given to him for His own purposes by the Supreme: Ruler, who is the <em>śeṣī</em> of all.</p>
<p>Those qualities and the like of the _jīva_s which are eternal have become theirs by the eternal will of <em>Iśvara</em>. The transitory bodies and the like which are theirs in the impure state (<em>samsāra</em>) and in the pure state (after <em>mukti</em> when they might take bodies for some purpose or other)&ndash;these result from the transitory will of <em>Iśvara</em> as the effect of past <em>karma</em>  (in the case of the former) and without any relation to <em>karma</em> (in the case of the latter).</p>
<p>The <em>praṇava</em> states that the <em>jīva</em> is <em>śeṣa</em> to none other (than <em>Bhagavān</em>). So it becomes evident that he is not <em>śeṣa</em> even to himself as he is other than <em>Bhagavān</em>; it follows from this that, in the same way as he is <em>śeṣa</em> to nobody else (than <em>Bhagavān</em>), no other thing is unconditionally <em>śeṣa</em> to him. This does not appear in the <em>praṇava</em>. Therefore this may be the purport of the <em>namas</em> that the <em>jīva</em> is in no way independent (i.e.) that he has no svatantryam). In that case, taking from the context (anush_aṅga_) the m in <em>praṇava</em>, it would give the meaning &ldquo;I am not capable of maintaining or looking after myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is also possible to understaod (adhyāhara), the word svatantrya (independence) after na mama. It would then read na mama svātantryam (I have no independence). The absence of independence in the case of the sentient being is the inability to act independently (of the Lord) (i.e.) without His help. This is because, though in the state of bondage and in the state of release, he acts in accordance with his own mind, he can act only with such things as the senses given by <em>Iśvara</em> and by His stimulation and with His help.</p>
<p>The protectorship of all, indicated by the base (<em>prakṛti</em>) (viz) a in the first letter of <em>praṇava</em>, ensues, in the case of those who adopt an <em>upāya</em>, only by stimulating them to the adoption of any one of the _upāya_s. Though the <em>jīva</em> adopts the <em>upāya</em>, since his activity is dependent on the Lord and since the one who affords protection by granting the fruit (of the <em>upāya</em>) is the Supreme Ruler who is gracious, it is only His protectorship of all indicated in the base of the first letter (of <em>praṇava</em>) that is confirmed by this <em>namas</em>. Similarly <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s being the unconditional <em>śeṣī</em> of all which is stated by the dative case (fourth case) of the first letter a in the <em>praṇava</em> (where the case ending has been dropped) &ndash; this is confirmed by the interpretation suggested before, which denies unconditioned seshitvam to the <em>jīva</em>. As declared in the <em>Brahma</em> <em>Sūtra</em> (2-3-40), “The doership of the <em>jīva</em> is due to the Supreme Being as stated in the <em>Śruti</em> &ldquo;, the independence that the <em>jīva</em> seems to possess is granted to him in the execution of His own purposes by the Supreme Being who is the unconditioned <em>śeṣī</em> of all. The <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s being seshi to other things is also due to its being given to him by the unconditioned seshi for the fulfilment of His own purposes. To sum up</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S:~</p>
<p>॥ श्रीमान् स्वतन्त्रस्स्वामी च सर्वत्रान्यानपेक्षया ।</p>
<p>निरपेक्षस्वतन्त्रत्वं स्वाम्यञ्चाा न्यस्य न क्वचित् ॥</p>
<p>तारस्य नमसश्चेमौ सारौ देशिकदर्शितौ ।</p>
<p>अनन्यशरणत्वादेरधिकारस्य सिद्धये ॥</p>
<p>The Lord of <em>Śrī</em> is (alone) independent in all things and is (alune) the Master (of all) without being dependent on any one else. Independence without any dependence for help on others and mastership belong to no one else.</p>
<p>This gist of the <em>praṇava</em> and of the <em>namas</em> has been taught to us by (our) üchāryas, in order that we may have the competence (for <em>prapatti</em>), namely, such as having the Lord alone as our refuge.</p>
<p>In ordinary life, being master over others and being inde pendent of others are considered desirable, and being a servant and being dependent on others are considered undesirable. This is merely due to past <em>karma</em>  as a conditioning factor (upādhi). But here (in spiritual life), being a servant (of the Lord) and being dependent (on the Lord) are agreeable to those who have a know ledge of the truth, for they are appropriate and natural to our <em>svarūpa</em> (essential nature), as stated in such passages as the following: &ldquo;We are all, by  nature, His servants&rdquo;. Thus it becomes evident that the <em>jīva</em> exists solely for another (<em>Iśvara</em>) and is entirely dependent on Him. So the <em>jīva</em> may rightly be employed to do what is pleasing to the <em>śeṣī</em>, who alone is independent (and omnipotent). Therefore it follows that the <em>jīva</em> should be <em>śeṣa</em> (and render service) to His devotees, as stated.( in the Tamil verse) ;-&rdquo; The Lord who is absolutely pure, has made me the servant of His servants&rdquo;. If the Lord who is the <em>śeṣī</em>, and who is independent (and all powerful) is pleased to make us _śeṣa_s to His good devotees, it cannot be called improper or inappropriate; nor can it be avoided (or resisted). Since He is <em>śeṣī</em>, He has a right to employ us in whatever He desires, and since He is all powerful, He can enforce it. This idea may also be seen in the (Tamil) verse :- &ldquo;I will never&rdquo; associate with those who think that there is any deity other than Thee. But gladly do I accept (the privilege of) being servant to Thy devotees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S :</p>
<p>॥ स्वेच्छयैव परेशस्य तादधीन्यबलात्तु नः । भगवद्भक्तशेषत्वं स्वेच्छयापि क्वचिद्भवेत् ॥</p>

<p>अन्योन्यशेषभावेऽपि परस्वातंत्र्यसंभवः । तत्तदाकारभेदेन युक्त इत्युपपादितम् ॥</p>
<p>Being <em>śeṣa</em> to His devotees results to the Supreme Ruler from His own desire; but to us, it is a consequence of our being dependent on Him. (Sometimes) even to us, it may come as a consequence of our own desire, for to one who appreciates the worth of (virtuous) qualities, a desire to serve may arise towards those who are great by their virtues. Thus service may be done owing to an appreciation of (noble) qualities, like the service of Lakṣmaṇa to <em>Śrī</em> Rāma. The omnipotent Lord has Himself said. &ldquo;I [<em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s words] render service to those who are my kinsmen by virtue of my being independent. I give one half (of what I have) to my kinsfolk and enjoy the other half. I forgive also harsh words (employed) by them towards me &ldquo;. Thus by virtue of these words of His, He has willed that we should be _śeṣa_s to Himself and to His devotees. It has already been shown (in the chapter on the extreme limit of the ultimate goal of life) that the service rendered as _śeṣa_s by the devotees to one another is due to the will of the omni-potent Lord and is appropriate in different ways (in exalting others and in being exalted by them).</p>
<p>Since the <em>jīva</em> who is thus (<em>akiñcana</em>) destitute (of any <em>upāya_s) has to receive the desired object from the independent <em>śeṣī</em> in accordance with His will, the prayer for protection (saranavaranam) which is explicitly stated in <em>Dvaya</em> and the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em> for winning His favour is necessary and it is here implicit, in <em>namas</em> of the Tiru_mantra</em>. Since the surrender of the self and the prayer for protection are inseparable, the word which denotes either denotes also the other and is intended to express both. The word <em>namas</em> is itself (often) employed to stand for the prayer for protection, as may be seen from the following _śloka_s: &ldquo;The deity with eyes broad like lotuses that was seen by me before - He has now become (incarnate as) your relative viz. <em>Janārdana</em>, the tiger among men&rdquo;. &ldquo;Madhava&rdquo; is both the father and the mother of the whole world. Seek His protection, O best among men, for He is capable of protecting (you).&rdquo; &quot; When Markandeya gave them this advice, the three sons of Kunti and the twins, O best of the Bharatas, made namaskāra to <em>Janārdana</em> along with Droupadi &ldquo;, so also in the episode of Damayanti (we find the following); &ldquo;She considered that the time had come to seek refuge of the gods. So she made namaskara with (all) her speech and (all) her mind.&rdquo; (Since <em>namas</em> has been used to signify the prayer for protection ), it indicates that the responsibility for protecting oneself is not of the <em>jīva</em> (na mama bharah), where the word bharah (the burden of responsibility) is understood. Thus its purport may also be the surrender of responsibility. That the word <em>namas</em> indicates the surrender of self (atna samarpanam) is also wellknown from the following _śloka_s : &ldquo;Of all yajnas which&rsquo;s are performed with samit and such like as an aid, the man who has surrendered his self (ātma samarpana) to <em>Bhagavān</em> with the word <em>namas</em> is said to have performed the best Yajna,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I bow to <em>Bhagavān</em>, for <em>namas</em> (bowing) or atma samarpaņam to Him enables a man to get rid of his suffering and enjoy whatever he wants &ldquo;.</p>
<p>That the word <em>namas</em> has these meanings, viz., “I do not belong to myself; nor is any activity of mine <em>śeṣa</em> to me; all these are <em>śeṣa</em> only to <em>Bhagavān</em>,&rdquo; is stated in the section on the namaskāra in Nirukti.</p>
<p>THE THREE MEANINGS OF NAMAS:</p>
<p>Sthula, Sukshma and <em>Para</em> :</p>
<p>Ahirbhudnya (Siva) commented on the word <em>namas</em> as having three different meanings : a gross meaning (sthūlārtha) a subtle meaning (suīkshmārtha), and a supreme meaning (para), in the following _śloka_s :</p>
<p>I. STHULĀRTHA :</p>
<p>(8) The act of an intelligent man bowing his body, of his own accord, before another who is higher (without expecting any gain fron it) is called <em>namas</em>. In the _śāstra_s, all sentient beings are spoken of as belonging to two classes, the higher (Jyāyān), and the lower (ajyāyān). There is no one other than these. The primary meaning of the higher being&rsquo; is He who has superior excellence both in time and (place) and in attributes. <em>Bhagavān</em> is present at all times and in all places and possesses also qualities that are beyond (all) measure. So He alone is the higher (Jyāyan). All sentient beings other than He are lower (ajyāyān). The relation between these two, the higher and the lower, is that He is the <em>śeṣī</em> and the others (who are lower) are _śeṣa_s (to Him). The higher is only One; all the rest are lower and the relation between these two consists in this, that He is bowed to and that the others bow to Him. He who is bowed to is called the higher and the <em>śeṣī</em>; the others who are _śeṣa_s are said to be those who bow ( to him). The relation between them and Him is not on account of any gain (expected by them); this relation between the higher and the lower is due to their nature, when the sentient being bows to the Higher Person without expecting any gain and with a certain feeling; that feeling is called nanana ( bowing) (b) Namanam (bowing ) consists in the thought: &ldquo;<em>Bhagavān</em> is always my seshī and I am always his <em>śeṣa</em>,&rdquo; for it is this thought that is the cause of the bowing (of the body). This bowing makes <em>Bhagavān</em> bend in favour to the man who bows (i.c.) it makes <em>Bhagavān</em> grant to the man who bows whatever is desired by him. This is certain. <em>Bhagavān</em>, who is higher, observes the bowing of the man who is lower and bends (is inclined) (to do him grace). Since it makes <em>Bhagavān</em> bend in favour, this action is called <em>namas</em>: (c) Uttering the word <em>namas</em> with speech, having this <em>namas</em> in mind and bowing with the body&ndash;this is <em>namas</em> in its perfection (<em>śaraṇāgati</em>) and what is different from it in being defective in one or other of the three aspects is called defective <em>namas</em>. This is perfect <em>prapatti</em> (as <em>aṅgī</em>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you its accessories or _aṅga_s in their perfection : Listen. &ldquo;The <em>prapatti</em> that I perform to <em>Bhagavān</em>, the Supreme Being, is itself my eternal fruit. I desire no other fruit.&rdquo; To have this (thought) is the best of accessories (_aṅga_s). The desire for (other) fruit or gain is opposed to this <em>aṅga</em>. <em>Ākiñcanya</em> or being destitute is the condition of being without the knowledge or the ability to perform <em>bhakti</em> . This state of destitution is due to false notions (vāsanas) that have been persisting in the mind from beginningless time and to the man&rsquo;s being by nature without independence. It is due also to the mind being covered by the impurities of desire and hatred (rāga and dvesha). The external manifestation of this teeling of helplessness is called kārparyam and it is the second <em>aṅga</em>. The thought that one is independent and could act of one&rsquo;s own accord is opposed to this. The third <em>aṅga</em> is the thought that, though <em>Bhagavān</em> is the Supreme Being, He is merciful to all creatures and is ever bent on showing His grace to them. This is called mahavis&rsquo;vāsa or intense faith and the thought that <em>Bhagavān</em> will reward or pupish according to one&rsquo;s <em>karma</em>  and will (therefore) be indifferent towards one-this thought is opposed to intense faith. The fourth <em>aṅga</em> is the thought that <em>Bhagavān</em> is all-powerful and can protect us and the prayer (resulting from it) for protection. This would arise if we give up the thought that <em>Bhagavān</em>, though merciful, is wanting in the ability to protect us. The obstacle to this <em>aṅga</em> is the thought that He would be indifferent to us as He is without the quality of goodness. The fifth <em>aṅga</em> is called the avoidance of what is disagreeable (to <em>Bhagavān</em>). It consists in avoiding actions which would be against the will of the Master, The obstacle to this is doiog what is for bidden in the śāstras. The sixth <em>aṅga</em> is the determination to do good to all creatures in as much as all creatures-both those that move and those that do not move&ndash;are His body. Doing what is harmful to them is opposed to this. Thus have I explained to you namana (or s&rsquo;aranāgati) which consists of the _aṅga_s and the upāngas<sup id="fnref:321"><a href="#fn:321" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">321</a></sup> which mean avoiding what is opposed to them. This is the gross (<em>sthūla</em>) meaniog of the word <em>namas</em>.</p>
<p>_Aṅga_s are accessorics, up_aṅga_s are those that are accessories to _aṅga_s: here the avoidance of what is opposed to the respective _aṅga_s.</p>
<p>II. THE SUBTLE MEANING - SUKSHMĀRTHA:</p>
<p>Learn (now) the subtle meaning - (sukshmārtha). Whenever the sentient being considers himself and what is connected with him as his own, the two letters ma, and ma in mama (mine) signify the notion of mine&rsquo; or <em>mamakāra</em>. The thought regarding oneself and those things that are connected with one that one is independent and that these things belong to oneself - this thought has arisen from the false notion which has grown in strength owing to wrong impressions (vāsanas) which are from time immemorial (beginningless ). This notion can be countered by the right thought viz., me na (These are not mine). The meaning of me na is, “I am not independent. I am not <em>śeṣa</em> to myself (but to God). (My) body and other things are not mine; they are _śeṣa_s to the Supreme Being.&rdquo; By this right understanding, those false thoughts that they belong to oneself disappear, Owing to those false thoughts that have arisen from false impressions (vāsanas ), which are from time immemorial (anadi) and which have grown in strength by notions opposed to the true nature of things, (we think as follows ):- &ldquo;I am independent: these things are mine.&rdquo; This thought is got rid of by the word <em>namas</em> uttered by the man performing <em>prapatti</em> with the right understanding that <em>Bhagavān</em> (<em>Viṣṇu</em>) is the inner self or soul of all. Thus has the subtle meaning been explained,</p>
<p>III. THE SUPREME MEANING: (parārtha):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen now to the supreme meaning (para), which is different (from what has been said before). The syllable na indicates the <em>upāya</em> (or endeavour): ma indicates that it is principal or all - important and the visarga (final aspirate) vis., S (in <em>namas</em>) means <em>Bhagavān</em>. This is the meaning obtained from that word (<em>namas</em>):-&ldquo;In order to attain <em>Bhagavān</em>, who is eternal and who is the highest ruler, who is omnipotent and is called <em>Puruṣottama</em> - (in order to attain Him), <em>Bhagavān</em> is Himself the principal means called namana, Thus have I explained to you the three meanings of <em>namas</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo; Since, in the above, it is stated that only the Sapreme <em>śeṣī</em> should be bowed to or sought as refuge, it is evident and appropriate that the Being to whom <em>namas</em> is due is the Supreme <em>śeṣī</em>. In order to make it clear who this Supreme Seshī is, the specific name (<em>Bhagavān</em>) is given. In one of the _śloka_s quoted before,it is said, &ldquo;Doing what is forbidden by the _śāstra_s is opposed to this (avoiding what is disagreeable to Him)&rdquo;, and so also &ldquo;Doing evil to other creatures is opposed to this doing what is pleasing to Him). The gist of these sentences is that, if at the time of performing <em>prapatti</em>, there occurs an act which is deliberate and is disagreeable (to the Lord), there are absent the determination to do what is pleasing (to Him) and also such things as the abstinence in thought from doing what is disagreeable (to Him). If, after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, the man deliberately does what is disagreeable (to Him), he acts in a manner which is opposed to the command of <em>Bhagavān</em>, whom he sought with eagerness (while performing <em>prapatti</em>).</p>
<p>In the _śloka_s cited above, the gross meaning (sthūlārtha) is that which appears obvious from etymological derivation according to grammar. The subtle meaning (sūkshmārtha) is that which appears from interpretation based on the similarity of syllables on the strength of Nirukta. The supreme meaning (parārtha) is that which is explained in the secret _śāstra_s (i.e.) _śāstra_s which comment on the meaning of the secret _mantra_s with the help of the conventions regarding the meaning of letters. (In the _śloka_s cited above), in the first (sthulartha) interpretation, the behaviour which is inherent by nature to the <em>śeṣa</em> (namely, namana) and the structure or constitution of <em>Sādhyopāya</em> with its _aṅga_s, are explained. Then, in the second, they clarify the <em>svarūpa</em> of the <em>jīva</em>, as this is essential to the aspirant to <em>mukti</em> who adopts the <em>upāya</em>, namely, that he has no unconditional independence. Then in the third (i.e.) para, the _śloka_s indicate the nature of <em>Siddhopāya</em> (<em>Bhagavān</em>), who can be won by the adoption of the particular <em>Sādhyopāya</em> and who is also the object to be attained. It may also be understood as stating that surrender (of self) is more important&rsquo; than all other _upāya_s. All these are to be understood in their proper places where the ten different interpretations are given later on.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S:&ndash;</p>
<p>एवं शिक्षितनानार्थनमश्शब्दसमन्विताः । सर्वे करणतां यान्ति मन्त्रास्स्वात्मसमर्पणे ॥</p>
<p>जीवसामान्यमुखतश्शृङ्गग्राहिकयापि वा । मकारौ तारनमसोस्स्वानुसन्धानदाविह ॥</p>
<p>इह या स्वानुसन्धानप्रक्रियैकस्य दर्शिता । अन्येषामपि तत्साम्यान्नान्योन्यशरणा इमे ॥</p>
<p>अतस्स्वपर-रक्षायां पराधीनेषु जन्तुषु । निरपेक्षशरण्यत्वं नियतं कमलापतौ ॥</p>
<p>All the _mantra_s that are combined with the word <em>namas</em> with its various meanings as stated above become operative _mantra_s to be einployed while surrendering one&rsquo;s self. The ma in <em>praṇava</em> and in the <em>namas</em> lead to the consideration of one&rsquo;s self either by reference to the <em>Jīva</em> as a genus (<em>Jāti</em>) including one, or by reference to &lsquo;I&rsquo; directly which is like catching hold of the horns (i.e.) (by pointing to what is essential and all-important). Since the consideration that has been pointed out in regard to one, applies equally to others as well, there is no question of any one being the Saviour of any other. Therefore since all creatures are dependent (on another) in the matter of protecting themselves and protecting others, protectorship not dependent on others is vested only in the Lord of Kamala (<em>Lakṣmī</em>)</p>
<p>THE WORD NĀRĀYAṆA IN TIRU_MANTRA_:</p>
<p>The word Nārāyaṇa here (in Tiru_mantra_) explains (in full), by its conventional usage and by its etymology, the unconditional Saviour who appears in the first letter (of the <em>praṇava</em>) as the Protector of all and as the <em>śeṣī</em> of all. His grace is to be obtained by means of the <em>sādhyopāya</em> called <em>śaraṇāgati</em> (seeking protection or refuge of the Lord), whicb is seen either implicitly or explicitly in the word <em>namas</em>. He is to be the recipient of the service rendered by the <em>prapanna</em>, which is implicit in the dative (fourth) case ( of the word Nārāyaṇa) (i.e.) Narāyaṇāya.</p>
<p>Explanation or elaboration is the clarification of what has been briefly stated before in another manner, so that there may be no ignorance, doubt or misconception (about its meaning). This explanation may be seen wherever it occurs [(i.e.) the meaning hinted at in the first letter a (of <em>praṇava</em>) is explained in the word Nārāyaṇa and the meaning of m in <em>praṇava</em> is explained in the word Nara and so on] .</p>
<p>This word, Nārāyaṇa, which is of great help in showing clearly the two _tattva_s, namely, the <em>śeṣa</em> and the <em>śeṣī</em> finds the first place, in the _Viṣṇu_gāyatri and in the Tirunarayaniyam, where certain names are commented upon before other vyāpaka names of <em>Bhagavān</em>.</p>
<p>[ 053:-_Viṣṇu_gayatri: Nārāyaṇaya vidmahe; Vasudevaya dhimahi, Tanno _Viṣṇu_h prachodayat,]</p>
<p>(Nārāyaṇa, <em>Vāsudeva</em> and <em>Viṣṇu</em> are called <em>vyāpaka</em> names because their etymology indicates that the one referred to by them is present everywhere).</p>
<p>In the Nārāyaṇānuvāka which aims at determining the person of the Supreme Deity, who is the object of meditation in all vidyās, the word Nārāyaṇa is repeated many times, thus showing great regard, for the purpose of declaring that <em>Brahma</em>, Siva and others, who might, on first thought, be considered as the Supreme Deity, on the strength of the presence of their names in. the _vidyā_s are only the vibhūtis (or glorious possessions) of Nārāyaṇa just like the universe (which attests His glory). This it does by stating them in *grammatical co-ordination or apposition with Nārāyaṇa (sāmānādhikaraṇyam)<sup id="fnref:322"><a href="#fn:322" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">322</a></sup> .</p>
<p>Grammatical co-ordination: The following sentences in the Nārāyaṇānuvaka are referred to here: “ This universe is all the deity Nārāyaṇa: He is the inner self of the universe: Nārāyaṇa is the Supreme Jyotis (Light): The Supreme Being is Nārāyaṇa: Nārāyaṇa is the Supreme <em>Brahman</em>: Nārāyaṇa is the Supreme Tattva (Reality)&hellip;&hellip;. He is <em>Brahma</em>: He is Siva: He is Indra : He is Akshara and He is the Supreme Independent Sovereign Ruler&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It declares that even these, (<em>Brahma</em>, Siva and others) are included in the meaning of Nāra (the first part of the compound) and that Nārāyaṇa is their resting place or refuge.</p>
<p>The potency of this name is well-known from the following passages: &ldquo;Those who are afraid of <em>samsāra</em> and who suffer from terrible diseases are relieved of their sufferings by merely uttering the word Nārāyaṇa, and attain happiness”. “The man in whose mouth is the auspicious word, Nārāyaṇa, is followed by Nārāyaṇa even as the calf is followed by the cow.&rdquo; &quot; The word Nārāyaṇa is always available. Oar speech is within our control. Notwithstanding this, the <em>jīva_s fall into the darkest hell by not uttering the word&rdquo;: &quot; The name, Nārāyaṇa, confers (on the man who utters it) good birth in a Vaishnavite family: it confers also wealth.” “The mother  who gives the name, Nārāyaṇa, to her son will never go to hell.&rdquo; In the Nāradīya kalpa it is said: &quot; Even those who utter the mere word, Nārāyaṇa, are relieved of their diseases, of their dangers, of their fears and of their sorrows. There is no doubt of this.&rdquo; In another purāņa it is stated that if the number of vowels and consonants (in the word, Nārāyaṇa ) be taken separately into account, it will (be seen to) resemble Tiru_mantra</em> in having eight letters and may be treated as such.</p>
<p>The compound word Nārāyaṇa may be split up into its two component parts thus: Nārāh ayanam yasya (He to whom Nārās are the resting place ) and Nārāņām ayanam (the resting place of Nārās). The word Nārās is here determinate in meaning and denotes only the nārās (sentient beings and non-sentient things) and does not refer also to the Lord who is their inter self. Therefore the two words are not in grammatical apposition. Nammalvar distinctly showed the meanings of these two ways of combining the two parts of the word (samāsa) in the following two passages by using the word at the end and at the beginning respectively. &ldquo;He who has, as His _śeṣa_s,&rdquo; countless _jīva_s with knowledge and bliss as their attributes and with self-luminousness as their nature and also His own noble qualities&ndash;that Nārāyaṇa,&rdquo; and &quot; Nārāyaṇa&quot; is the Lord of all the seven worlds&quot;. In this are implicit (<em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s) possessing the two kinds of attributes, namely, freedom from defects and possession of all auspicious and noble qualities and, likewise, His possession of the two vibhūtis (glories), namely <em>Līlā</em> <em>Vibhūti</em> (this (material) Universe) with all the sentient and nonsentient beings in it) and <em>Nitya</em> <em>Vibhūti</em>, (the transcendental region of eternal glory with all that it contains). It should be borne in mind that this nārās includes the queen, the ornaments, the weapons, the attendants, the furniture and the like, the door-keepers, the retinue and such others.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>॥ कारणत्वमबाध्यत्वमुपायत्वमुपेयता । इति शारीरकस्थाप्यमिह चापि व्यवस्थितम् ॥</p>
<p>In the word Nārāyaṇa, are contained all the attributes (of <em>Brahman</em>) which are established in the four chapters) of the Sarīraka <em>Śāstra</em>:(<em>Brahma</em> sūtras), namely, His being the cause of the Universe, the irrefutability of the proposition that He is the cause, His being the <em>upāya</em> for the attainment of <em>mukti</em> and His being the object of attainment (in <em>mukti</em>). All this has been explained by Bhattar in His <em>Nitya</em> in the words beginning with &ldquo;Knowledge, bliss, purity and the like.”</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF NĀRĀS:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I created the waters, which are called nārās, and lay within them. Therefore am I called Nārāyaṇa.&rdquo; &ldquo;The waters are called Nārās because they were born of Nara (i. e. <em>Bhagavān</em>). They were at first His abode. Therefore is He called Nārāyaṇa.&rdquo; In these two _śloka_s, the waters refer by implication (Upalakṣaṇa) to the other sattvas (reals) as well. This is evident from such passages as the following :- &ldquo;The sattvas or reals had all their origin from Nara. Therefore are they known as Nāras. To Him they are the abode, therefore is He considered to be Nārāyaṇa.&rdquo; In this interpretation of the word as a grammatical compound Bahuvrihi samāsa ( Nārah ayanan yasya), it is stated that the _tattva_s had their origin from Nara and are therefore called nāras. From this it follows that, as stated in Mahopanishad and elsewhere, Nārāyaṇa is the cause of all (things and beings ) including <em>Brahma</em> and Isana ( Siva) in every way (i. e. the material cause and the instrumental cause). The word ayana (resting place ) is derived in this way:-‘I yate iti&rsquo; ayanam. That which is pervaded is ayana (the passive voice being used for deriving the word). This declares that He pervades all, as they are all pervaded by him and that in order that He may do so, He has unparallelled subtleness (sukshmatva). Ayana may be derived also in another way: Iyate asmin iti : (That in which it is), in which case it would mean that in which everything rests. The word Nārāyaṇa may be considered also as a compound of the tatpurusha type (tatpurusha samāsa), in which case it would be split into Narāņam and. ayanaın (the abode of Nārās ). It is true that the compound word should then be in the neuter gender Nārāyaṇam, but by the authority of nirukti, the masculine form Nārāyaṇah is not improper. The _pramāṇa_s are the following :-&ldquo;He is also called Nārāyaṇa, for He is the resting place or abode of Narās&rdquo;. &ldquo;The multitude of all _jīva_s is called Nārās. Since <em>Bhagavān</em> is to be attained by them and is also the <em>upāya</em> for attaining Him, He is called Nara yana&rdquo;. &ldquo;Nāra is so called because it means the multitude of _jīva_s which are indicated by the word nara. I am the goal to be attained by them; I am also the <em>upāya</em> for that attainment. Therefore am I called Nārāyaṇa by the seers.&rdquo; &ldquo;The wise call the multitude of _jīva_s by the name Nāra. He is called Nārāyaṇa because He is their ayana (abode or resting place). Therefore those who are thoroughly conversant with the Vedas and the Vedanta declare Him to be the kinsman, the mother, the father, the <em>guru</em> and the abode or resting place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE DERIVATION OF THE WORD NARA:</p>
<p>The verbal root ‘in’ means &rsquo;to perish&rsquo;; so ra (in nara) denotes non-sentient things (i.e.) matter which perishes (i. e.) changes its essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>). Nara therefore, denotes those that do not perish or change their essential nature (i.e.) chetanas (sentient beings, using the na samāsa on the analogy of words like Naga - which means .mountain&rsquo;, for it does not (na) go</p>
<p>or move (ga) and naika, na-eka &quot; not one&rdquo; (1. c.) many&rsquo;. So Nara means sentient beings only; nāra means the multitude of naras. Their ayanam (abode or resting place) is Nārāyaṇa. This declares that He who has under His control the three kinds of chetanas or sentient beings (the bound, the released and the eternal) and also nonsentient things, their essential nature (or existence) their sustenance, and their activity&ndash;He is, to the three kinds of multitudinous souls (the bound, the released and the eternal) who are denoted by the word nara, the Dispenser of what they desire. It says also that since He is blissful, He is, of his own accord, the <em>upeya</em> (i. e.) the object of attainment and is also the support or resting place (<em>ādhāra</em>), for it is said, “ Thus has it been explained how the three worlds have <em>Viṣṇu</em> as the <em>ādhāra</em> (resting place or abode)” and “He has entered into the three lokas, viz. the non-sentient, the sentient and the released souls and supports thern without undergoing any change.&quot;</p>
<p>How these meanings are traceable in the word ayana will now be explained :- The word ayana may be derived from the verbal root in (which means to go), in three ways: (1) īyate anena iti ayana). Ayana is that by which or with which one goes, where it refers to the instrument (karana) or aid. ( When derived in this way) <em>Iśvara</em> becomes the <em>upāya</em> or means (2) iyate asau iti ayana) &ldquo;That which is reached. In this derivation <em>Iśvara</em> becomes the <em>upeya</em> or object that is reached or attained: (3) īyato asmin iti ayana): &ldquo;that in which it rests.&rdquo; In this derivation <em>Iśvara</em> becomes the support or ādhāra on which everything reste. Ayana may also be derived from the verbal root ay, which means &ldquo;to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is evident that <em>Iśvara</em> has in Him the qualities necessary for being the <em>upāya</em>, the <em>upeya</em> and the like, viz., easy accessibility (saulabhyam) and being supreme (paratvam). When ayana means &lsquo;abode&rsquo;, if we take Nārāyaṇa to be a bahuvrihi compound ( Nārāh Ayanam Yasya) (He whose abode is Nārās ), it is considered to indicate that Nārāyaṇa pervades all things and beings within them (i, e.) that He is immanent within them. If we take Nārāyaṇa to be a tatpurusha compound (Nārāņam ayanam: the abode of Nārās, the (compound) word indicates that He pervades them froin without (they being within Him) (i.e.) that He is transcendent. These two are declared in the śrutis (i.e.) in Nārāyaṇānuvakam) Immanence (or antarvyāpti) means being present inseparably connected with other things and beings in such a way that it cannot be said that He is not present where they are: Transcendence (bahirvyapti) means being present also in places where they are not present. Such things as Time ( Kāla) are omnipresent (vibhu). So it should not be stated that <em>Iśvara</em> is outside of them. When it is said &ldquo;Nārāyaṇa who is smaller (aiyiin) than all the smallest: the meaning of the word (aṇu is not &lsquo;of small size&rsquo; but subtle&rsquo;. So the passage really means: “Nārāyaṇa who is subtler than all the subtle things &ldquo;. It means that owing to His being subtle nothing can prevent Him from being within them,</p>
<p>In the <em>śruti</em> ( which says “ He is smaller than the grain called s&rsquo;yāmāka), the purport is that He is of the size of the object within Which He is present (i.e.) of the measure of the upādhi or conditioning factor, and this is distinctly stated in the <em>Brahma</em> sūtras and their commentary (<em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya_m). Being full and complete in every object, on the part of One who is both immanent and transcendent, means that that aspect or phase of His which is within any one upadhi or conditioning factor is capable of (creating, sustaining and destroying) and doing such other things to all things and beings. It does not mean that His essential nature is all contained (and exhausted) within any one object (to the exclusion of all others). If we understand it in that sense, it would be opposed to His transcendence. If we explain this by saying that <em>Iśvara</em> has the power of bringing together those which cannot be brought together (aghatitaghatanā <em>śakti</em>), it would be acceptance of the position of other systems (like Bhaskara&rsquo;s and Yadava prakasa&rsquo;s), which maintain the possibility of bringing together things which are opposed to each other (Bhaskara and Yađava prakasa say that difference and non-difference can coexist). Here in Tiru_mantra</em>, when the Supreme Ruler of all is indicated by the first letter (of <em>praṇava</em>), the base nara of the word Nāras and the word ayana, all these words are purposely used to indicate His being the Protector and His being the ultimate  cause (in a), His being eternal and His being the netă (guide) (in the word nara) and His being the resting place or support and the inner self in the word (ayana) in different ways. (It should not be thought that these three mean the same thing and that two of them are therefore redundant).</p>
<p>If it be asked: &ldquo;While the <em>Cetana</em> or sentient being is already indicated by the third letter of <em>praṇava</em> (m), why should it be mentioned again in the word Nara (in Nārāyaṇa)&rdquo;. The answer is as follows: &ldquo;I do not exist without Thee, (my support); Thou dost not exist without me, (for I bring out Thy character:) &quot; &ldquo;Rāma&rsquo;s younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa), and Lakṣmaṇa&rsquo;s elder brother&rdquo;. (In the two passages mentioned above, there is apparent repetition, but it is not a fault since it serves a definite purpose). (In the first passage ), the first part of the sentence emphasises the importance of the <em>śeṣī</em> and the second emphasises the importance of the <em>śeṣa</em>; so also (in the secodd. passage ) Rāma&rsquo;s importance is hinted at in <em>Rāmānuja</em> (Rāma&rsquo;s younger brother) and Lakṣmaṇa&rsquo;s importance is hinted at in Lakṣmaṇapurvaja (Lakṣmaṇa&rsquo;s elder brother): Thus each is characterised by the other. In the <em>praṇava</em>, the <em>śeṣī</em>&rsquo;s inportance is prominent as in the chariot of Arjuna ( where Arjuna is prominent and <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa is not, being only the charioteer ); in the word Nārāyaṇa, the <em>śeṣī</em>&rsquo;s importance is prominent as in the Rasamandala (the Rasakrida described in the Bhāgavatam), where <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa is all-important and the Gopis not so.</p>
<p>Even in the <em>praṇava</em>, though verbally the <em>jīva</em> is prominent, the prominence, so far as the purport is considered, is of the Protector or Saviour.</p>
<p>The <em>jīva</em> who appears in the <em>praṇava</em> as of the form (ākāra) of <em>jñāna</em>, both in his essential nature and in his attribute, and also as being atomic (aņu), is described in the word Nara as eternal (without change or deterioration.) Further since Narāh means &rsquo;the multitude of naras&rsquo;, it makes clear the fact of the _jīva_s being different from one another. If (on the other hand) we take the word Nārah to mean those who have their origin from Nara (<em>Bhagavān</em> ), it indicates that the _jīva_s have <em>Brahman</em> for their cause (in so-far as their embodiment is concerned). Owing to these additional meanings appearing in the word (Nārāyaṇa), the two words serve a purpose ( and are not redundant).</p>
<p>(When the word Nārāyaṇa is taken as a bahuvrihi compound which can be split into Nārāh ayanam yasya), the word ayana is in grammatical co-ordination with Nārāh. By the word ayana, such ideas as their (nārāh) being pervaded by <em>Bhagavān</em> are to be understood. The meaning of the śruti  that in regard to many chetanas who are eternal, one <em>Cetana</em> who is eternal is the cause of their attaining the desired objects&ndash;this meaning may also be seen here.</p>
<p>It is true that the <em>jīva</em> is, according to the _pramāṇa_s, eternal. When he was described before as taking his origin from <em>Brahman</em>, what was meant was that, in respect of his body which is his attribute, the origin was from <em>Brahman</em> (but not his essential nature, which is eternal.)</p>
<p>The other interpretations which are given in kalpas like Narayanatmaka are also similar to these.</p>
<p>In the <em>śloka</em> :&ndash; “Both sentient beings and non-sentient things which are all different from <em>Viṣṇu</em> are called Nāram. He who has nāram as His ayanam (abode or resting place) is Nārāyaṇa&rdquo; (in the light of this <em>śloka</em>) what was stated before (in Padmottaram), viz., Nārāh is the collection of all persons&rdquo; should be taken in a wider sense (Upalakṣaṇa) to include also the collection of all _tattva_s (non-sentient included). Because even non-sentient matter is not perishable in its essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) and also owing to the continuity (pravāha) of the different states (avasthās) into which it changes, (even) non. sentient matter is eternal. Nārāh means therefore by implication (Upalakṣaṇa) all the _tattva_s which are eternal and which are denoted by the word Nara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nara means also Nārāyaṇa for the following reasons : (1) While pervading all (beings and things), He (i. e.) Nārāyaṇa is na ra (one who does not change or deteriorate), for He is not tainted by the faults or impurities in them and by the sufferings which might be caused by them; (2) the verbal root nr means &quot; to lead&rdquo;: He who leads (souls) is Nara : (3) In the Sahasra nāma, Jahnu, Nārāyaṇa and Nara are said to be the names of <em>Bhagavān</em> : (4) In the passage, &ldquo;The waters are the sons of Nara, the word Nara indicates only Nārāyaṇa and this is evident from the sentence in Vyasa_smṛti_ :&ndash; &ldquo;The waters took their origin from Nārāyaṇa and they alone became afterwards His ayana or resting place&rdquo;. So the eternal and Supreme Ruler who leads all (to Himself ) is called by the name Nara.</p>
<p>In the <em>Ahirbudhnyasamhitā</em> (we find the following _śloka_s : “Those that are related to nara are nārāh. That nara is <em>Puruṣottama</em>. It is He that confers knowledge on those that have sought His protection. It is He that dispels all (their) ignorance. Wherever He may be, He does not updergo any change. Hence He is called Nara, because He is always the same (na ra), Sentient beings and non-sentient things that are related to Him are His _śeṣa_s. They are supported by Him, controlled by Him and created by Him. He has entered into them for supporting them. Therefore are they called Nārāh (because they are sup ported, created and controlled by Nara). He controls all nārās; that is, by being within them, He pervades them in order to do such things as sustaining them. The nārāk are helpful (to us) in ander standing Him, for, by their existence is His existence understood. He is the ayana or abode of nārās and they are always His abode. To souls that are nārāh, He is the supreme end to be attained and also the means or <em>upāya</em> of attaining Him &ldquo;. This interpretation makes it clear that those attributes which define the essential nature of the Supreme Being such as(satyam, jñānam and ānandam) and the qualities or attributes of the essential nature so defined, such as compassion, His activities and the specific forms assumed by Him and likewise the three kinds of sentient beings, (the bound, the released and the eternal) and all non-sentient things — all these are meant by the word nārāh. From all this it may be inferred that He has the attribute of being the support of all except Himself. Hence it declares also that He stands by Himself and in Himself (alone). From this, the delusion maintained by men of perverted vision (Advaitins) that Purusho tama, who pervades, supports, controls and masters them and the nārās who are related to Him are identical in their essential nature-this delusion will disappear, since it is evident that He is the soul of all and that He has such glories as that of being denoted by all words.</p>
<p>The word nara (meaning . &lsquo;one who does not change&rsquo;) brings out the meaning of the clarificatory texts in the <em>śruti</em> (where Brahman is declared to be satyamn, the Real that is un ch_aṅgī_ng). The word nāra which means those things which have their origin in Nara as declared in the passage : &ldquo;Those reals or _tattva_s that are born of Nara are called nārāh”-this word brings out the meaning of the śruti that declares <em>Brahman</em> to be the ultimate cause of all; the word ayana brings out the meaning of the texts prescribing forms of meditation or worship (as leading to the attainment of ends desired by men).</p>
<p>Such texts as those in the Subālopanishad declare that the Supreme Being who is the inner self of all and who has all kinds of kinship (to us) is Nārāyaṇa. (By this declaration) these passages state that the Supreme Being is no other deity than Nārāyaṇa.</p>
<p>Those who are relatives in the world became relatives (to us) by the will of <em>Bhagavān</em>. “O, Best of  deities, Thou art my mother. Thou art my father: Thou art my kinsman: Thou art my <em>guru</em> : Thou art my learning: Thou art my wealth. So Thou art by all &ldquo;, The Lord is my master who is my benefactor, He is my father, ny kinsman, my king.&rdquo; &quot; Thou art the world&rsquo;s father, its mother, its beloved son, its affectionate friend, its wellwisher and its <em>guru</em> : Thou art the goal to be attained and also the <em>upāya</em> or means by which it is to be attained. I am Thine, I am sustained by Thee. I am Thy servant. I am one who considers Thee as the highest benefit. I am one who has performed <em>prapatti</em> to Thee. Therefore the burden of protecting me is Thine&rdquo;. The Supreme Ruler is thas one who is the unconditioned relative in every form. If He is pleased (with us), there will be no one who will be opposed to us, for it has been said :&ndash; &ldquo;He from whose favour all these people will become favourable (to us)&ndash;that Rāma is now soliciting the favour of Sugrīva, the best of monkeys&rdquo;, and &ldquo;When Keśava,&rdquo; the best of deities, who loves His devotees, is pleased, (with a man), his mind becomes clear thereby and all creatures&ndash;those that move and those that do not move become favourable to him. “When <em>Bhagavān</em> who is the God of all gods and who controls even <em>Brahma</em> is gracious, all the three worlds become favourable&rdquo;. “<em>Iśvara</em> is, by His very nature, &ldquo;the well-wisher of all creatures &ldquo;. If He is (at any time) differently disposed, it is due to the upādhi or circumstance of the <em>cetana</em> (or sentient being) having disobeyed His command. Even that disposition (of <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s) will change (and become favourable) by some little gesture or consideration (<em>vyāja</em>). Have they not</p>
<p>declared: &ldquo;Even after approaching <em>Śrī</em> Raṅganātha who is so mad as always to take pity on His servants, why do we still continue to be afflicted by <em>samsāra</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE DATIVE (FOURTH) CASE OF</p>
<p>THE WORD NĀRĀYAṆA (i.e.) NĀRĀYAŅĀYA:</p>
<p>We will now set forth the meanings of the fourth case such as &quot; for the sake of some one&rdquo; which will correspond with the meaning of the sentences to be shown hereafter :</p>
<p>Considered in the obvious and ordinary way, it may be thought that the fourth case is used because of the word <em>namas</em> (which governs the fourth case (according to grawmar). In that view there is nothing noteworthy in the use of the dative case. This is the part of the Tiru_mantra_ which is the cause of the attainment of the fruit (desired), for it has been said: “That part of the <em>mantra</em> (<em>mūlamantra</em>). which remains after the sixth letter counting from <em>namas</em> (i.e.) a and which is after the fifteenth letter counting the consonants of the alphabet beginning with ka (i.e.) na, and leaving the consonantal part of ṇa that part which remains after the ì in Nārāyanāya, (i. e.) āya, is called the potent part of that <em>mantra</em>.&rsquo; This part is concerned with the attainment of the fruit. According to some interpretations, the prayer for the attainment of the fruit is found here. There is no difference of opinion in regard to the statement that the meanings of a word differ in accordance with the purpose, the context, the mark or sign, the propriety, the locality and the time of its use and not by the were word as such. One of the meanings of the fourth case that are accepted is sampradūna (ie) to make the word indicate the person to whom a thing is given and who thereby becomes its seshin. Here in the fourth case Nārāyaṇāya in Tiru_mantra_, it is true that what does not belong to <em>Iśvara</em> is not given to Him, for the <em>jīva</em> is always Nārāyaṇa&rsquo;s <em>śeṣa</em> and belongs to Him. So it might be thought that the sampradana which is indicated by the fourth case does not apply here. But in as much as the <em>jīva</em> offers to <em>Iśvara</em> what already belongs to Him for protection by Himself, it may be held that the fourth case indicates sampradana and Ahirbudbnya (Siva) commented in this manner on the dative or fourth case in the Vyāpaka _Mantra_s :</p>
<p>&ldquo;The surrender or offer of the self which is shown to be subordinate or <em>śeṣa</em> is indicated by the fourth case in such words as <em>Viṣṇu</em> (i.e. Namo followed by <em>Viṣṇu</em>). When the qnestion is asked: &ldquo;To whom is this self which is subordinate offered or surrendered for the sake of protection &ldquo;, the answer is &quot; to <em>Viṣṇu</em>&rdquo;. Thus Vishou is indicated by the fourth case&rdquo;. This is a commentary also on the fourth case in words like Nārāyaṇa as the <em>śloka</em> says &lsquo;in such words as <em>Viṣṇu</em>&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In this Tiru_mantra_, the meanings of the seven sacred letters beginping from na have been separately stated in the <em>mantra</em>. _smṛti_s and these meanings have been summarised as follows by some  _ācārya_s in passages like the following :- &ldquo;The meaning of na is looking after the welfare of all, helping to incline the wind (of the <em>jīva</em>) towards Paramapada and destroying those unworthy qualities of the self which are opposed to it. Since the letter ma signifies doing what is good to those who have sought (Him), helping to expand their attributive <em>jñāna</em> (knowledge), and securing for them the respect of others : these are said to be its meanings by those that know. The letter ‘na’ signifies giving up scepticism, rendering service always to <em>Bhagavān</em> and doing the work of the ācārya which consists in leading the <em>śiṣya</em> to Parumapada. These benefits will, in the opinion of those that know the <em>mantra</em>, accrue to those that meditate on this letter. Those that meditate on the letter rā will acquire the love of the Lord, give up the love of those that sre other than the Lord and protect the kingdom (from evils). By the letter ya, wise men acquire the eagerness to adopt the Yoga necessary for attaining <em>Bhagavān</em> and also its fruit.</p>
<p>From the letter ’ņā’ one acquires the desire to praise the Lord and the command of language necessary for praising Him. The letter ‘ya’ causes dread in (the minds) of Yakshas, Rākṣasas, Vethala, and goblins (bhūtas). Those that know the _mantra_s have thus described the function of the different letters &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Thus Tiru_mantra_ which has been rendered free from the stain arising from perverse controversialists with the help of a careful study of the interpretations derived from grammar, nirukta and the like - will, like a mirror, reveal clearly the essential nature of the Supreme Being, and also whatever is difficult to see in regard to one&rsquo;s own essential nature.</p>
<p>THE ATTRIBUTES OF _BHAGAVĀN _ TO BE MEDITATED</p>
<p>UPON WITH REFERENCE TO TIRU_MANTRA_:</p>
<p>When we reflect in accordance with the _pramāṇa_s, on the essential nature of the Supreme Being, who is the deity indicated by this (<em>mantra</em>) in all the forms which are explicitly stated and which are also implicit in this <em>mantra</em>, we should reflect on the following qualities of His in principal and on other excellent traits connected with them:- such qualities as His being the protector : His protectorship being the result of His very nature: His protectorship extending to all, the many ways of His protection, correspondiog to the nature of the thing to be protected, His being the protector at all times, His being the protector in all places, His protection being of all kinds, His protection being directed by His own interest, the omniscience so essential for a protector, His omnipotence, the protection being irrevocable by any except His own will, the irresistibility by others of His protection, His supreme mercy, His expecting an occasion for protection, His requiring from the <em>jīva</em> just a pretext or <em>vyāja</em> for extending His protection, His accessibility to all those who have sought His help.

<p>Service without the body: Perhaps this should be taken to mean anubhava or experience.]</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>इह सङ्ग्रहतश्श्रीमान् गोप्ता शेषी समाधिकदरिद्रः ।</p>
<p>शरणं सर्वशरीरी प्राप्यस्सेव्यश्च साधुभिर्भाव्यः ॥</p>
<p>(Thus) here in Tiru_mantra_, the Lord is to be reflected upon by good men in a concise form (in the letter a) as the consort of <em>Śrī</em> (<em>Lakṣmī</em>) and as the Saviour:(in the dative or the fourth case whose affix has been dropped) as the <em>śeṣī</em>, and as destitute of equals and superiors : in the word <em>namas</em> ) as the <em>upāya</em> or means of attaining Him: (in the word Nārāyaṇa) as the in-dwelling Self of all, (and in the fourth case of that word) as the object of atlainment and as the Person to whom service is due.</p>
<p>THE QUALITIES OF THE JIVĀTMĀ:</p>
<p>In the same way, when the <em>jīva_tma who is to attain the Supreme Being, which is the object of his attaioment, reflects on himself with the help of the Tiru_mantra</em>, he should note the following principal qualities of his own, which are indicated explicitly by the words themselves and which lie implicit in their meaning and other qualities connected with them, which are all accepted on the authority of the pramāṇ as : &lsquo;That he has to be redeemed by <em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Śrī</em> (<em>Lakṣmī</em>), that he cannot be saved by any one else, that he has one who will protect him in all places, at all times, and in every manner, that he has a Saviour who has noble qualities, that he has one (<em>Lakṣmī</em>) to recommend</p>
<p>him (to the Lord&rsquo;s mercy), that he is the servant of the Lord and (His consort) <em>Lakṣmī</em>, that he is their eternal servant, that he is their unconditional servant, that he is not entitled to be the servant of anyone else, that, in his essential nature, the self is <em>jñāna</em> (knowledge), that it is bliss, that it is self-luminous, that the self shines to itself, that the self is denoted by the word &lsquo;I&rsquo;, that the self is atomic (anu), that it is subtle (sukshma), that it cannot be cut (burnt and so on), that the self or soul is different from the twenty four _tattva_s or reals, that (in its essential nature) the self is pure, that it is different from <em>Iśvara</em>, that the self is a knower (having kaowledge as its attribute), that the <em>jīva</em> has, by nature, the capacity to enjoy all things as agreeable, that he is competent to desire the supreme end of life, that he is fit to be commanded (by the Supreme Being), that he is fit to render service, that be has in him the power to have a direct perception of all things, that he is entitled to have unsurpassed bliss, that he is a doer who can act subject to the will of the Supreme Being, that he is a master (of certain things) under certain conditions or upādhis, that he is the <em>śeṣa</em> of the devotees of the Lord, that he is their servant, that he is destitute of _upāya_s other than the Lord, that he is steeped in such things as <em>avidyā</em>, that his knowledge is capable of expansion with the help of (suitable) instruments (karana) and the like, that be is beset by the fears due to <em>samsāra</em>, that be should look forward to the removal of <em>avidyā</em> and the like, that he is destitute of any means (of attaining the end), that he has such things as the good-will of <em>Iśvara</em>, that he should seek and obtain a good <em>ācārya</em>, that he is competent to adopt <em>sādhyopāya</em> (<em>bhakti</em>  or <em>prapatti</em>), that he should stand firm in the <em>upāya</em>, that he has great potency, that he may be called an object of creation, destruction and the like in virtue of his having the body as an attribute, but that the self is imperishable, that the self is one among many, that the selves are countless, that the selt is pervaded by <em>Iśvara</em> (who is its in-dwelling Self), that he is subject to the control of <em>Iśvara</em>, that he is supported by <em>Iśvara</em>, and that as a consequence of these, the self is the body of <em>Iśvara</em> that the <em>jīva</em> is the cause of the sportive delight</p>
<p>(lilā rasa) of <em>Iśvara</em>, that he is entitled to be the instrument for the Lord&rsquo;s enjoyment (bhoga) (in <em>Nityavibhūti</em>), that his passage to his goal depends on <em>Iśvara</em>, that the attainment of that goal depends on <em>Iśvara</em>, that he should seek neither worldly prosperity nor kaivalya, that he should eagerly long for the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em>, that he should become free from all <em>avidyā</em>, that the self would manifest itself in its essential nature, that the self is capable of visualising everything (in the state of <em>mukti</em>), that his sole enjoyment should consist in the experience of <em>Bhagavān</em> in every form, that he is capable of having unsurpassed bliss, that his being an enjoyer is (only) for the enjoyment ot of <em>Bhagavān</em>, that the self (in its realised state) can take any form and the like at will, that its will is irresistible, that the self will have perfect resemblance to the Lord except in regard to those uncommon qualities or attributes that define His essential nature, that the sell&rsquo;s delight is in rendering every kind of service to <em>Bhagavān</em> and that the self will never return to <em>samsāra</em> (after attaining <em>mukti</em>). (67).</p>

<p>अनन्योपायता स्वस्य तथानन्यपुमर्थता ॥</p>
<p>In the three words of this (Tiru_mantra_), we should reflect, in brief, on our being entitled to be the <em>śeṣa</em>, of no one other than the Lord, that we have no other <em>upāya</em> than the Lord, and that we have no other end to attain than the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus the Tiru_mantra_ has ( as stated in Nāradiyakalpam) everything that a man ought to know. From it one can understand the essential nature of <em>cit</em> (sentient beings ) <em>acit</em> (non-sentient matter) and <em>Iśvara</em>, as well as the differences among the <em>jīva_s themselves. The Tiru_mantra</em> also teaches the unconditional differences between the <em>jīva</em> (the individual self) and the Supreme Sell, as, the former is <em>śeṣa</em> and the latter <em>śeṣī</em>. It determines Also the person of the Supreme Deity who is both the material and the instrumental cause of the whole universe. Therefore even those who live in the same locality as those that meditate on the Tiru_mantra_ in this manner will never have delusions such as.the following :- &quot; There is no <em>Iśvara</em> or God&rdquo;; &ldquo;<em>Iśvara</em> is attributeless&rdquo;; &ldquo;<em>Iśvara</em> is absolutely indifferent (to the welfare of the _jīva_s), &ldquo;His god.head is a mere reflection or image which has no reality&rdquo; • His divinity is the result of some special <em>karma</em>  performed by Him&rdquo;. “He is occasionally subject to such things as <em>karma</em> &ldquo;. &ldquo;The three gods, <em>Brahma</em>, <em>Viṣṇu</em> and Siva, are of equal rank&rdquo;, &ldquo;The three gods mentioned above are really one : &quot; The Supreme Reality or Tattva is someone beyond these three gods&rdquo;, &ldquo;One of these, Brabma and Siva, is <em>Iśvara</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;The essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of <em>Iśvara</em> is subject to change or modification&rdquo;. &ldquo;The material cause and the instrumental cause can never be the same&rdquo;, &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> and <em>Iśvara</em> are only a single self&rdquo;. &ldquo;The difference between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>Iśvara</em> is due to certain limiting factors or conditions (upādhi)&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> and <em>Iśvara</em> are eternally (both) different and non-different,&rdquo; &quot; The <em>jīva</em> is <em>śeṣa</em> only on account of his <em>karma</em> &ldquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is at times <em>śeṣa</em> and at other times not a <em>śeṣa</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is inert (<em>jaḍa</em>)&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is, in his essential nature, knowledge (and does not possess knowledge as an attribute)&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is eternally free from bondage&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> only seems to enjoy (i.e. his enjoyment is not real but illusory). &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is not a doer or agent&rdquo;. &quot; The <em>jīva</em> is a doer or agent independent of <em>Iśvara</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;The self laats (only) until the pralaya&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> lasts only until <em>mukti</em> (and then becomes one with the Supreme Being)&rdquo;. There is only one <em>jīva</em> (all the others are illusory)&rdquo;, &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> stands self-supported&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is, in his essential nature, an effeci baving its origin in a cause.&rdquo; &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> can, in no sense, be considered as an effect (even with regard to His body and the like)&rdquo;, &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> can attain his end only by <em>karma</em> &ldquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em>, in the state of release from <em>samsāra</em>, is like a stone (having no knowledge and the like)&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> finds delight only in his own disembodied self&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is absolutely independent of <em>Bhagavān</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is one with <em>Iśvara</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is without such things as activities&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> can separate and unite (with <em>Iśvara</em>)&rdquo;. &ldquo;The _jīva_s vary in the bliss that they will enjoy after <em>mukti</em> &ldquo;. &ldquo;The _jīva_s have such differences as being fit to have only salokya and the like &ldquo;, and other such delusions due to perverted systems of religious thought and to those who are outside the pale of Vedic religion.</p>
<p>So also weakness of faith in the Consort of <em>Śrī</em> as a Protector, the search for other Redeemers, the protest  [See page (89 of the book ).] against being dependent on God, the delusion of being the unconditional <em>śeṣa</em> to others, reverence to other deities, association with those who are their devotees, and, likewise, the delight in serving those who are unfit for service, such delusions as that the body and the soul are the same, such delusions as that the self is independent of <em>Bhagavān</em>, the earning (of money or other things) for one&rsquo;s own use, offence to the devotees of <em>Bhagavān</em>, forgetfulness of the fact that one is helpless and destitute of _upāya_s, a longing for the continuance of life in <em>samsāra</em>, the fear that the soul will suffer annihilation, the taste for doing what is improper, the classification of men into friends and foes, the seeking of other kinsmen (than <em>Bhagavān</em> ), the desire for other ends (than the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em>), averseness to the supreme goal of life and other such hindrances to one&rsquo;s firm stand in one&rsquo;s essential nature, in the real <em>upāya</em> and in the end in view - all these ( delusions) will never approach them.</p>

<p>TEN WAYS OF CONSTRUING AND INTERPRETING</p>
<p>TIRU_MANTRA_:</p>
<p>We shall now consider in what manner the Tiru_mantra_ should be considered as forming a sentence or sentences and the meaning of such sentence or sentences:</p>
<p>The Tiru_mantra_ is considered as being a single sentence, as being two sentences and as beiаg three sentences, in different traditions. So also the meanings of the sentence or sentences are reflected opon in many ways:</p>
<p>ONE SENTENCE-INDICATING <em>UPĀYA</em>.</p>
<p>When it is looked upon as a single sentence, the connection of words is to this effect :-&rdquo; Adoration to Narayaṇa whose nature is such as can be ascertained from the <em>praṇava</em> (<em>aum</em>), for it has been said: &ldquo;Praṇava&rdquo; is the word that denotes <em>Bhagavān</em>.&rdquo; (It is true that) the praṇava itself is the name of <em>Bhagavān</em>, but there is no repetition or redundancy in another name being used, viz,, Nārāyaṇa, for, as stated in Śāṇḍilya <em>Smṛti</em> and the like, the <em>aum</em> (or <em>praṇava</em>) is not of much avail, because its meaning by itself is not definite&rdquo;. Therefore, in the Vyāpaka <em>mantra_s, the other name is for the purpose of indicating the particular (deity). This way of construing the sentence, when considered in the light of the gross interpretation described in such places as the Ahirbudhnya Samhita (see before) will make it (Tiru_mantra</em>) appear as indicating the <em>upāya</em>. However the essential nature (of the <em>jīva</em>) and the supreme goal of life are also implicit in it (for, without a knowledge of them, no <em>upāya</em> can be adopted).</p>
<p>ONE SENTENCE INDICATING <em>KAIÑKARYA</em>.</p>
<p>(2) Considering such passages as &quot; (They) fold their hands together (in anjali) and with great delight utter the word <em>namas</em>&rdquo;. the <em>mantra</em> is held also as indicating the activity of the <em>śeṣa</em>, namely, service, which is included in the supreme experience of <em>Bhagavān</em> in <em>mokṣa</em>. This form of service must (necessarily) be preceded by a reflection on (one&rsquo;s) essential nature or &ldquo;svarūipa  (i. e.) that of being a <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord. This can be made use of also by those who have adopted the <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>), even in their present state, when they can realise the happiness (of that service to the Lord).</p>
<p>TWO SENTENCES INDICATING SVARUPA:</p>
<p>(3) When these two ideas become well-established, it is necesary to have a clear and distinctive knowledge of one&rsquo;s essential  nature. For that purpose, the Tiru_mantra_ may be looked upon as being two sentences (a) a Nārāyanāya um - (b) <em>namas</em> (or na mama) meaning (a) &ldquo;I am the unconditional <em>śeṣa</em> of <em>Bhagavān</em> alone who is indicated by the letter a (in <em>aum</em>) and who has such attributes as being the universal Redeemer and the support of all and (I am the <em>śeṣa</em>) of no other. (b) I do not belong to myself, neither am I the unconditional master of anything nor have I any (absolute or unconditioned) independence. If it be asked &quot; Will there not be redundancy owing to the letter a and the word Nārāyaṇa being both the names of <em>Bhagavān</em>? The answer is (as follows):&ndash; In that case one of the two should be considered as An adjective to the other) for the purpose of indicating the special qualities (such as protectorship) contained in its etymological interpretation. The redundancy would also cease if we construe the sentence into &quot; (I am the <em>śeṣa</em>) of Nārāyaṇa who is denoted by the letter a in (<em>aum</em>)&rdquo;. Do we not see the word &lsquo;<em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;, which is His name, being employed in apposition or grammatical co-ordination (sāmānādhikaraṇya)) with the word · <em>Vāsudeva</em>! (in the <em>Vāsudeva</em> <em>mantra</em> )? There is no redundance, as the word Nārāyaṇa serves a purpose, being used for removing all doubts as to which deity is the ultimate universal cause denoted by the letter which is the origin of all letters (namely a ). The order of words in a sentence is dependent on the ways in which they are recited (according to tradition); but the construction or syntactical con. nection of the words is in accordance with the meaning.</p>
<p>When thus taken as two sentences, the whole of the Tiru_mantra_ is descriptive of the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of the <em>jīva</em>. In the light of this coustruction, namely, that of describing the essential nature, the ancients used to say: &ldquo;Be born in Tiru. <em>mantra</em>, grow up in <em>Dvaya</em> and stand firm in <em>Dvaya</em> alone&rdquo;. * Birth&rsquo; is due to the birth of a kaowledge of one&rsquo;s essential nature and the disappearance of the state which preceded it. This may be seen (from the verse): “Before I had a knowledge of my essential nature, I was like one unborn. After attaining that knowledge, I was born and I do not forget this&rdquo;. That is acknowledging, of one&rsquo;s own accord, that one is the <em>śeṣa</em> of no one other than <em>Bhagavān</em>, that one is not subject to the will of any one other than <em>Bhagavān</em> that, consequently, one has no other interests than being <em>śeṣa</em> to Him and that one has no other saviour than He. &ldquo;Growth&rsquo; means the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> resulting from a knowledge of a particular thing that has to be performed as being suited to one&rsquo;s competency. &ldquo;To stand firm in <em>Dvaya</em> alone&rdquo; means to become well-established in this <em>upāya</em> and in the (know. ledge of the) fruit arising from it, without associating oneself with any other <em>upāya</em> and without any other end in view. Thus Tiru <em>mantra</em> and <em>Dvaya</em> combined together reveal the <em>svarūpa</em>, the <em>upāya</em> and the end for which the <em>upāya</em> is adopted.</p>
<p>TWO SENTENCES INDICATING THE <em>UPĀYA</em> :</p>
<p>(4) In this construction of Tiru_mantra_ into two sentences, some consider that the whole of Tiru_mantra_ has, for its purport, the surrender of the self with its accessories. In that case, the m in praṇava should be considered to be in the nominative or first case. By the principle of the offering of the <em>havis</em> (or oblation), Tiru_mantra_ would then mean &ldquo;This unconditional oflering, namely, the self or soul is surrendered to Nārāyaṇa who is denoted by the letter a as His responsibility and who is the deity subject to no conditions or limiting factors (upādhi). In this unconditional sacrifice of the self, the word <em>namas</em> (na mama) would come to mean that one dissociates oneself from oneself and says, &quot; The burden of my protection is not mine.&rdquo; As when (an offering is made) with the words: “This is for Indra and not mine&rdquo;, here also, the two sentences are essential; one to express the connection (of the offering) with the Supreme Being and the denial of its connection with oneself. Also in this surrender with the words <em>namas</em> (na mama), the purport may also extend to the denial of one&rsquo;s being an agent or doer absolutely independeat of the Supreme Being. The two sentences may also be considered to suggest the meaning; &ldquo;The burden of my protection is of no other (than <em>Bhagavān</em>) nor is it my own&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That Tiru_mantra_ has, for its purport, the offering or surrender of the self was stated in the <em>Nitya</em> as follows :- &ldquo;After offering the self to the deity with the mūlamantra etc&rdquo; This idea is shown also in <em>Śrī</em> <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em> <em>Gadya</em> as follows: &ldquo;Praying that <em>Bhagavān</em> should accept one for eternal service to Himself alone, one should prostrate oneself and offer the soul to <em>Bhagavān</em> with the utterance of the sacred mūlamantra&rdquo;,</p>
<p>TWO SENTENCES INDICATING PURUṢĀRTHA:</p>
<p>(5) In each of the two sentences, some understand a word (like syām) meaning &lsquo;I pray that etc&rsquo; or &lsquo;May I&rsquo; etc. (In that case the first sentence would be <em>aum Nārāyaṇāya syām</em>, and the second <em>na mama syām</em>), and their meanings would be:</p>
<p>“May I render service to Nārāyaṇa denoted by the letter a! May there be no hindrances to this!&rdquo; Tiru_mantra_, as a whole, would then be a prayer for the attainment of what is desired and the removal of all undesirable things and this is considered the supreme end. In that case the reflection on one&rsquo;s <em>svarūpa</em> is implicit in it. Similarly even when the Tiru_mantra_ is considered to have, for its purport, only the indication of one&rsquo;s <em>svarūpa</em>, (as in the third meaning) it would, by suggestion or implication, indicate the specific end to be attained. The <em>upāya</em> and the prayer would then be known from the respective _pramāṇa_s which ordain <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>It is often said that Tiru_mantra_ has, for its purport, the knowledge of <em>svarūpa</em>, of <em>upāya</em> and of <em>puruṣārtha</em>, because a knowledge of these which did not exist before is acquired from it. The knowledge of these is prāpya (to be acquired) and the Tiru_mantra_ from which this knowledge arises may therefore be said to be prāpyapara (i.e.) to have, for its purport, the knowledge of these three. But the expression prapyapara does not mean that Tiru_mantra_ has, for its denotation, this knowledge. It denotes the <em>svarūpa</em>, <em>upāya</em> and <em>puruṣārtha</em> and not the knowledge of these which afterwards arises from it. (For example: the word *cow&rsquo; denotes the animal called &lsquo;cow&rsquo;; but when the word &lsquo;cow&rsquo; is employed, we got also a knowledge of the cow. From this we should not say that the word &lsquo;cow&rsquo; denotes the knowledge of the cow. It denotes only the cow though, subsequently, the knowledge also arises. To put it in other words, the denotation of the word and the items of knowledge which may arise when the word is employed are two different things. &lsquo;Cow&rsquo; and knowledge of the cow&rsquo; are two different things.</p>
<p>THREE SENTENCES:</p>
<p>When Tiru_mantra_ is considered as consisting of three. sentences (there are several ways of understanding the meaning:) (6) &amp; (7) The <em>svarūpa</em> or essential nature (of the <em>jīva</em>) and his supreme goal (<em>puruṣārtha</em>) are stated by the words themselves and the <em>upāya</em> is implicit in the meaning (though not expressed by the words); (8) or the <em>svarūpa</em> and the <em>upāya</em> are stated by the words themselves and the <em>puruṣārtha</em> is implicit in the meaning: (9) or the <em>upāya</em> and the <em>puruṣārtha</em> are stated by the words themselves and the <em>svarūpa</em> is implicit in the meaning (10) or the <em>svarūpa</em>, the <em>upāya</em> and the <em>puruṣārtha</em> ( all the three) are stated (distinctly) by the words themselves.</p>
<p>(6) If it be asked how this is, the answer is as follows: The first two words indicate <em>svarūpa</em> and the third word <em>puruṣārtha</em>.</p>
<p>As stated in the following <em>śloka</em> : I am the property (<em>śeṣa</em>) na mama of only <em>Bhagavān</em> who is denoted by the letter a; I do not exist for myself : He who is denoted by the word &lsquo;Nārāyaṇa&rsquo;, which means the person whose abode or dwelling place is the multitude of the etermal nārās (i.e.) _jīva_s &mdash; To Him the varied forms of service which I should reader in virtue of my nature should appear (to me) in all places and in all states&rdquo;. (as stated in this s&rsquo;loka ), the praṇava and the <em>namas</em> clarify the <em>svarūpa</em> ; and the third word Nārāyaṇāya with the predicate understood (Namely syām) is a prayer for the attainment of the goal, in view of the idea of existing for <em>Bhagavān</em> expressed (already) by the <em>praṇava</em>. The form of the prayer would be “May I be for Nārāyaṇa!&rdquo; In this view, the prayer for the removal of hindrances (to _śeṣa_tva) results from the meaning (and not from the words themselves, because the attainment of the <em>puruṣārtha</em> is impossible without the removal of hindrances). As stated in the <em>Dvaya</em> and in such passages as &ldquo;Thou shalt enjoy thyself on the slopes of the hills in the company of Sītā&rdquo;, since the one to whom service is due has a spouse, the meaning would here also be, “May I be for Nārāyaṇa as well as for <em>Lakṣmī</em>!&rdquo;. If the predicate be needed, a word like bhaveyam (May I be) should be understood. This prayer has indeed been made in such forms as the following:&ndash; “May I render faultless service remaining with <em>Bhagavān</em> constantly in all places and in all states.&rdquo; &ldquo;Vouchsafe upto me Thy grace so that I may render service to Thee&rdquo;. &ldquo;I pray for eternal service to Thee&rdquo; and &quot; I should be Thy eternal servant,&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Existing for His sake&rsquo; is eternal; so there is no need to pray for it; this relationship of existing for His sake (as His <em>śeṣa</em>) is already expressed by the praṇava. Therefore prayer is inside here for service (to <em>Bhagavān</em>), which is the overflow of the full and perfect enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> and which contains within itself all other ends of life as in the common saying: &ldquo;In the ocean is a small puddle (i.e.) the larger contains the smaller within it)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S:&mdash;</p>
<p>॥ अत्र स्वलाभापेक्षापि स्वामिलाभावसायिनी ।</p>
<p>स्वामिप्रयोजनापेक्षाप्यतस्स्वानन्दहेतुका ॥</p>
<p>Here in the dative or fourth case ( in the word Nārāyaṇāya ), although the <em>jīva</em> expects his owa gain (namely, the attainment of his <em>puruṣārtha</em> ), yet it ends in the Master gaining pleasure or delight. (Therefore there is no violation of the proper function of the, <em>śeṣa</em>). (Likewise) desiring that the Master should gain conduces also to one&rsquo;s own bliss or <em>ānanda</em>.</p>
<p>&quot; Whether it is said, &ldquo;I beg for service which would please Thee&rdquo; or &quot; Thou shouldst find delight in having my service&rdquo; - in either case, both are gainers&rdquo;. (This is the idea). It has been said:-&rdquo; Food is of two kinds, that which has three qualities and that which has six qualities: That which has three qualities<sup id="fnref:324"><a href="#fn:324" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">324</a></sup> is for those bound by <em>karma</em> ; the other is for others&quot;. Here the food with six qualities is the enjoyment of the (six) qualities of <em>Bhagavān</em> and also the different kinds of service which result from them and which are most enjoyable.</p>
<p>That which has three qualities : material objects of enjoyment having sattvam, rajas and tamas.</p>
<p>(In the <em>Brahma</em> Sūtras) it is said that since the _śruti_s indicate that there would be perfect resemblance or equality (bhoga mātra sāmya) only in regard to enjoyment between <em>Brahman</em> and the <em>mukta</em>, the perfect equality is only in enjoyment and in <em>jñāna</em> or knowledge. Therefore there is nothing (in the _śruti_s or the sūtras) opposed to the <em>mukta</em> being a <em>śeṣa</em> (to <em>Bhagavān</em>) which pertains to his essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) and, as a result thereof, rendering service (<em>kaiṅkarya</em>) to Him. It has been explained in <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> and elsewhere that when, in the state of aspiring to <em>mukti</em> and in the state of <em>mukti</em>, the <em>jīva</em> meditates on his being <em>Brahman</em>, what is meant is that this contemplation is only in virtue of the self or <em>jīva</em> being the body of <em>Bhagavān</em>. Therefore this notion of &ldquo;I am <em>Brahman</em>&rdquo; is indeed the result of the body (here the self or <em>jīva</em>) being dependent on the inner self (<em>Bhagavān</em> ) and existing only for the fulfilment of His purposes. (Therefore there is no impropriety in the self being <em>śeṣa</em> to <em>Bhagavān</em> even in the state of <em>mukti</em> ). The service that is rendered in the state of release or <em>mukti</em> comes from the very nature of the self: it is free from the pairs of opposites<sup id="fnref:325"><a href="#fn:325" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">325</a></sup> , constant and un-intermittent, and produces unlimited delight. In the state of aspiration to <em>mukti</em> (<em>mumukṣu</em>) the service that is rendered for its own sake is due to the circumstance or upadhi of some good <em>karma</em>  done in the past; it has to endure the pairs of opposites (dvandva ) such as heat and cold and pleasare and pain; it is interrupted by sleep and other such (hindrances) and the delight arising therefrom is limited.</p>
<p>pairs of opposites like pleasure and pain, heat and cold etc.</p>
<p>Here all activities of the <em>jīva</em> which do not form the service of <em>Bhagavān</em> and which do not fit in with His commands will yield adverse results of some kind or other. Among those activities which are permitted by <em>Bhagavān</em>, those which are for the purpose of attaining <em>svarga</em>, cows and the like will yield fruits which may appear to be pleasant but which are mingled with many undesirable elements. Therefore they are, for that reason, hindrances. So, as stated in the <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;One should give up the performance of those actions which are aimed at attaining the three ends, namely, <em>dharma</em>, wealth (artha) and pleasure (kāma),&rdquo; the aspirant to <em>mukti</em> may perform those rites or actions in relation to <em>Bhagavān</em> which are the means of securing <em>bhakti</em>  and <em>jñāna</em> and also of promoting the glory of <em>Bhagavān</em> and of Bhāgavatas without caring for any other fruit. Since these rites or actions are not productive of life in <em>samsāra</em>, they would be included in the proper form of service, The state of being a <em>śeṣa</em> to <em>Bhagavān</em> indicated in the <em>praṇava</em> extends to that of being a <em>śeṣa</em> to His devotees in so far as laid down in the _pramāṇa_s, as a consequence of the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s absolute subjection to and sole existence for Hiin, which are indicated appropriately by the word <em>namas</em>.</p>
<p>So the <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service to <em>Bhagavān</em> which is desired in the word Nārāyaṇāya extends to His devotees. This idea is expressed in such _śloka_s as the following :- &ldquo;I am greatly pleased with those who have devotion towards my devotees. Therefore one should honour them greatly&rdquo;, and. “Therefore in order to obtain the grace of <em>Bhagavān</em>, one should please His devotees. By this the Lord becomes heartily inclined to show His grace. There is no doubt of this &ldquo;.</p>
<p>The saying that “dependence upon others is miserable&rdquo; means (only) that the dependence on the worthless, which is due to past <em>karma</em> and which is not suited to one&rsquo;s <em>svarūpa</em>, is the cause of misery. Being subject to (the will of) <em>Bhagavān</em> and tadiyas is the prescribed goal suited to one who realises the essential nature of his self and it is therefore the cause of unsurpassed delight. &ldquo;Tadiyas&rdquo; or &lsquo;Bhāgavatas&rsquo; means those who feel a delight in being the servants of the Lord.</p>
<p>There are some who maintain that service to His devotees (tadiyas) logically follows when one desires to serve Nārāyaṇa who his for His attribute Nārās, for service to the substantive in Nārāņām ayanam iacludes (they say) service to Nārāṇām (all nārās ) which is the adjective or attribute. (If the logic of this statement that what is prescribed for the substantive should be considered as prescribed also for its adjective or attribute, (in other words ), if being the attribute is itself the cause (of being honoured and served), then every thing that is denoted by the word Nārās here, such as <em>Brahma</em> and the other gods, the enemies of <em>Bhagavān</em>, cattle and the like, would come under those to whom service shonld be desired. If it is said, “He desires to serve men&rsquo;s sovereign&quot;, it does not follow that he desires to serve men also who are the adjectives of the sovereign (in the phrase &lsquo;men&rsquo;s sovereign&quot;), So also, by mere logic, the desire to serve Nārās will not become proved. (That will require _pramāṇa_s for proof). Therefore only this much can be said:- By the authority of the _pramāṇa_s, since the aspirant desires to do what is pleasing to the Master, he desires to serve those who are dear to Him and who realise that they are His _śeṣa_s and have no other interests in life. Even in the experience of the state of <em>mukti</em>, the experience of everything else indicated by the word Nāra which is included in the experience or enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> - even this is not understood from (the) logic (of the adjective and the substantive ). It is understood from the authority of the <em>pramāṇa</em>, (namely the <em>śruti</em>) which says &quot; He sees all, and attains all things&quot;.</p>
<p>So far the Tiru_mantra_ was construed as having three sentences among which the first two were held as indicating the <em>svarūpa</em> of the <em>jīva</em> and the third as indicating the prayer for the attainment of the <em>puruṣārtha</em> or goal aimed at.</p>
<p>(7) Different from this is the construction of Tiru_mantra_ into three sentences of which the <em>praṇava</em> brings out the <em>svarūpa</em> or essential nature, <em>namas</em> forms the prayer for the removal of hindrances or evils, and the <em>puruṣārtha</em> which will result from that renewal is indicated in Nārāyaṇāya syām (&ldquo;May I be for Nārāyaṇa !&rdquo;) That the <em>namas</em> in Tiru_mantra_ too, like the <em>namas</em> in <em>Dvaya</em> has, as its purport, the prayer for the removal of hindrances - this interpretation, too, is explained in Bhattar&rsquo;s <em>Nitya</em> in the _śloka_s: “As stated in the <em>praṇava</em>, I am the <em>śeṣa</em> of <em>Bhagavān</em>; in spite of it, I wily subdued by the notions of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and Mine&rsquo; owing to (my) past <em>karma</em> . The word <em>namas</em> states that, hereafter, I should reinember my being <em>śeṣa</em> to <em>Bhagavān</em> and render service to him&quot;. Therefore the syntactical construction becomes (in this interpretation): Aham na mama syam &ldquo;I shall not be my own <em>śeṣa</em> or na mama kinchit syat&rdquo; &ldquo;May I have no hindrances&rsquo;&rdquo; Syām or Syāt being understood. So it amounts to a prayer for tha complete removal of all hindrances such as <em>avidyā</em> or ignorance, <em>karma</em> , the impressions left by them (vāsanas), the taste or inclination (ruchi) and the association with <em>prakṛti</em> or matter. This has been shown in the passage in Vedārthasangraha, where it is said. &quot; Owing to beginningless <em>avidyā</em> or ignorance, two kinds of <em>karma</em>, good and evil (<em>puṇya</em> and <em>pāpa</em>) have been flowing like a stream. On account of this, the <em>jīva</em> becomes enclosed in bodies of four kinds: <em>Brahma</em> and the other gods, men, animals and plants. So in accordance with the notion entertained by the <em>jīva</em> regarding his nature, the streain of <em>samsāra</em> increases in its volume. In order to get rid of the fear caused by it which is hard to resist etc.” So also it ia said, &quot; In order to protect the souls of samsārins whose nature is such that they have false notions of &lsquo;I&rsquo; about the body, bad ways of life due to these (false notions) and the impure body which results therefrom, the Lord of the _Nitya_suris was born into all sorts of castes and species &ldquo;.</p>
<p>It may be asked :-&rdquo; When a prayer has been made for the removal of hindrances, where is the need for another prayer for the attainment of the desired end? Will it not follow as a natural consequence? Has it not been said: “When the <em>jīva</em> attains <em>Brahman</em>, those qualities or attributes of his which are natural to him and which were, till now, hidden begin to shine forth. This is revealed by the word Svena in the <em>śruti</em>&quot;. &ldquo;In the same way as the brightness or radiance of a gem is not produced (anew) but is a natural consequence of washing away the dirt covering it), so also <em>jñāna</em> or knowledge is not produced in the soul (anew). When a tank or a well is dug, the water and the ether (space) are not created but simply come into prominence (having already been there). It is only what already exists that is manifested clearly, How can there be the production of a thing which did not exist ? So also on the removal of undesirable or evil qualities, qualities like knowledge begin to shine forth. They are not created anew, for these qualities are eternal in the <em>jīva</em> (since they belong to his essential nature) &ldquo;?</p>
<p>The answer to this question may be expressed as follows :</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>स्वतस्स्वार्हं यथाभागं पुत्रः पितुरपेक्षते ।</p>
<p>सापराधस्तथा दासः कैङ्कर्यं परमात्मनः ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;The son begs of his father for his share of the property, though it is lawfully his. In the same way the servant (the <em>jīva</em>) who has offended (the Master) begs of the Supreme Being that he should be permitted to render service &ldquo;. There is nothing inappropriate in the <em>jīva</em> who has lost what he is entitled to, praying thus:&ndash; “May I have what is my sharel Be Thou so gracious as to pardon my offence;&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the passages quoted above, it would appear also that just  when the hindrance is removed the radiance natural to the gem begins to shine by the will of God, as stated in.&rdquo; All things exist as such only by Thy will&rdquo;, so also such things as the expansion of jñāna which naturally belong to the <em>Jīva</em>, are manifested as a result of the Lord&rsquo;s will, which is of the form of the compassion natural to Him.</p>
<p>But it may be asked: &ldquo;In a <sup id="fnref:326"><a href="#fn:326" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">326</a></sup> system of thought which holds that the non-existence (of a thing) means the presence of some other thing, the removal of hindrances should, by itself, be the attainment of what is desired. Hence will not the separate prayer for it be redundant? Besides has not the author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> declared: “The disappearance of <em>avidyā</em> (literally, ignorance; <em>karma</em>  ) is itself <em>mokṣa</em>&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Vísishtadvaitins hold that the non-existence (of a thing) is simply the existence of some other thing and not a category apart. For example, when we say, &ldquo;There is no pot on the floor&rsquo;, the non-existence of the pot is merely the existence of the floor. Tarkikas hold, on the other hand, that non-existence or the absence of a thing (abhava) should be considered as a separate category.</p>
<p>To that question the answer is as follows: - For the sake of some purpose, a single thing may be indicated (in two ways), in its essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) and also in a form that is opposed to it. So (here ), it is called the attainment of what is desired and the disappearance of what is not desired, because of the intention to signify a special purpose. In the state of <em>samsāra</em>, the dis. appearance of something that is undesirable may be another undesirable thing or the disappearance of what is desired and what is not desirable alike. But in the state of <em>mokṣa</em>, since every thing (without exception) that is undesirable disappears, whal remains is all agreeable So the two (the disappearance of the undesirable and the attainment of what is desired) were stated separately in order to show, with great regard, that the former state (<em>samsāra</em>) is most undesirable and the latter most desirable, since it (is free from all undesirable elements and) has only what is desirable. Further the two have to be stated separately, since the withdrawal of punishment by <em>Bhagavān</em> and such things as the expansion of the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s knowledge are different things. It is not improper to pray separately for these two things since the remission of punishment by God which is the cause of the contraction of knowledge and the like is different from such things as the expansion of knowledge, service and the like which results from the disappearance of the contraction of knowledge, service and the like, which were the results of that punishment.</p>
<p>There is also another reason for two separate prayers - In some other systems of thought (like that of the Tārkikas), <em>mokṣa</em> means the disappearance of all undesirable things and the attainment of a state similar to that of a stone (with no positive content in the form of enjoyment or bliss). In order to show that <em>mokṣa</em> in our system is not of that kind, bat has a positive content of enjoyment or bliss, the two are stated as being separate and also to show that in the attainmeot of <em>Bhagavān</em> (in <em>mukti</em>), there is no such thing as an alloy of misery or pain just as there is in attaining such states as the position of Indra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus if it is held that the <em>svarūpa</em> and the prayer are expressed explicitly by the words themselves, the <em>upāya</em> prescribed by the sütras, for the attainment of the end in view (<em>puruṣārtha</em>) namely, the <em>Sādhyopāya</em>, is implicit in the meaning of <em>namas</em> which states the disappearance of undesirable things in the case of the man destitute of all other _upāya_s as a result of <em>bharanyāsa</em>.</p>
<p>(8) <em>SVARŪPA</em> AND UPÃYA :</p>
<p>Since the prayer for the <em>puruṣārtha</em> is not a mere desire but the soliciting of a protector, the <em>aṅga</em> and other accessories may be considered also as implicit and not expressed. The Tiru_mantra_ would then mainly indicate the <em>svarūpa</em> and <em>upāya</em>. If we split Nārāyaṇa into nārāņām ayanam yena &ldquo;He by whom He becomes the resting place of nārās (the world of _jīva_s), the word ayana may be considered also as indicating the <em>upāya</em>, for He is the <em>upāya</em>.</p>
<p>(9) <em>UPĀYA</em> AND PURUṢĀRTHA :</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em></p>
<p>केचित्तु चरमश्लोके द्वये चोक्तक्रमादिह । भरन्यासपरं तारं शेषं फलपरं विदुः ॥</p>
<p>Some_ācārya_s considered that, as in the order in which these are expressed in <em>Dvaya</em> and in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>, here, in Tiru_mantra_ also, the praṇava (tāram) expresses <em>bharanyāsa</em> or the surrender of the responsibility of protection and that the other two words <em>namas</em> and Nárāyaṇāya express the attainment of the end in view.</p>
<p>(10) THREE SENTENCES INDICATING RESPECTIVELY</p>
<p><em>SVARŪPA</em>, <em>UPĀYA</em> AND PURUṢĀRTHA</p>
<p>Tiru_mantra_ may be considered also as stating all the three, viz., <em>svarūpa</em>, <em>upāya</em> and <em>puruṣārtha</em> in that order. In this case the praṇava states the <em>svarūpa</em> or essential nature of the <em>jīva</em> (as <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s <em>śeṣa</em>), the <em>namas</em> states the <em>upāya</em> and what remains (i.e.) Nārāyaṇāya states the prayer for the <em>puruṣārtha</em> or the attainment of the end in view.</p>
<p>The details concerning these three should be understood by a study of the Vedanta śāstras. The construction or interpretation given above of Tiru_mantra_ has resemblances to the order in which the <em>tattva</em>, the <em>upāya</em> and the <em>puruṣārtha</em> are explained in the Vedantha _śāstra_s. Does not that śāstra proceed in this way? So the first two chapters (adhyāyas) (of the <em>Brahma</em> sūtras), the Supreme Real (<em>Brahman</em>) and the reals subordinate to it are determined. In the third chapter, competency (<em>adhikāra</em>) and accessories (_aṅga_s) are stated along with the <em>upāya</em> and in the fourth chapter, the fruit or the attainment of the goal is explained by way of conclusion. The essential nature of the Supreme Real and that of the lower reals explained in the first two chapters (adhyāyas ) and the fruit or goal of attainment explained in the fourth are the same for the man who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as a direct and independent means or <em>upāya</em>. The shortcomings and sufferings in <em>samsāra</em> which are dealt with in the sections (pāda) on Vairagya and Ubhayalinga in the third chapter and the Redeemer&rsquo;s being opposed to all that is of the nature of blemish (heya) and His being the sole possessor of all auspicious qualities &mdash; these, too, must necessarily be understood by the <em>prapanna</em> who is an aspirant to <em>mukti</em>. The different forms of meditation or worship (<em>upāsana</em>) of <em>Brahman</em>, which are treated of in the third section (pāda) of the third chapter (of the <em>Brahma</em> sütras ), should be adopted by those who are competent for them (i.e.) those who have adopted <em>bhakti</em>. The man who is not competent for them and who is destitute of other _upāya_s should realise that these forms of meditation are too high for him and adopt nyāsa as his <em>upāya</em>. For, as stated in the following sub-sections:- Nānā śabdādi bhedāt (<em>Brahma</em> _sūtra_s 3-3-56) (The forms of meditation or worship or vidyās concerning <em>Brahman</em>) are different from one another, for their names are different and vikalpah avisiṣṭa phalatvat (3&mdash;3&ndash;57). (Any one of them may be adopted as there is no difference in the resulting fruit). <em>Nyāsa</em> is different from the other _vidyā_s and in yielding the fruit conferred by them, does not require any other aid. The man who has adopted <em>upāsana</em> (or <em>bhakti</em> ) should perform the rights and duties pertaining to his <em>varṇa</em> (caste) and <em>āśrama</em> (stage of life) as an accessory or <em>aṅga</em> to the <em>vidyā</em> or form of meditation as stated in <em>Brahma</em> _Sūtra_s (3.4.33)  The man who practises <em>bhakti</em>  should perform the duties of his <em>varṇa</em> and <em>āśrama</em> as an <em>aṅga</em> to <em>bhakti</em> .&rdquo; The man who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as a direct and independent <em>upāya</em> should perfom these rites and duties as having been enjoined by <em>Bhagavān</em> and for their own sake (without expecting any gain or reward), for it is said in the <em>Brahma</em> Sūtras (3.4 - 32). “Since they are enjoined, yajnas and other rites become the duties of the (respective) āsramas&rdquo;. If this is understood the, <em>svarūpa</em>, <em>upāya</em> and <em>puruṣārtha</em> which are explained in the Sārīraka _Śāstra_s (<em>Brahma</em> sūtras) are all to be found within the sacred <em>Aṣṭākṣara</em>. We have already explained how the five truths that ought to be understood may be found in this. (Chap. 4).</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF THE TEN INTERPRETATIONS OF</p>
<p>TIRU_MANTRA_ GIVEN ABOVE:</p>
<p>Thus the ācāryas consider Tiru_mantra_, which has innumerable meanings within it, as having ten (different) meanings in accordance with their respective tradition: When the Tiru_mantra_ is considered as a single sentence, it is thought of as indicating (1) the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of the <em>jīva</em> and (2) his activity as a <em>śeṣa</em>. When coosidered as two sentences, it is thought of as indicating (1) the essential nature of the self and (2) the surrender (of the self) by a positive and a negative statement, Namely, (The burden of protecting me is <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s : it is not mine) and so also (3) as indicating a prayer for the <em>puruṣārtha</em>. When it is considered as three sentences, it is thought of in the following ways:- (1) The first two words indicate the <em>svarūpa</em> and the third word indicates the prayer: (2) The <em>praṇava</em> indicates the essential nature or <em>svarūpa</em>, and the other two words indicate the prayer for the removal of undesirable elements and for the attainment of the desired end. (3) In the same manner, the first word indicates the <em>svarūpa</em> and the other two indicate the <em>upāya</em>, (4) the first word indicates the surrender (of the self) and the other two indicate the prayer for the attainment of the fruit ( desired), (5) The three words indicate respectively the <em>tattva</em>, the <em>upāya</em> and the <em>puruṣārtha</em>.</p>
<p>When some of these meanings are considered as the main interpretations, the others, too, should be looked upon as being implicit in the meaning, though not expressed explicitly by the words thenselves.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S :</p>
<p>॥ तदेवं पदवाक्यार्थैस्तत्त्वविद्गुरुदर्शितैः । तत्तत्कुदृष्टिकथितं निरस्तं योजनान्तरम् ॥</p>
<p>Therefore by the interpretations of the words and the sentences thus taught (to us) by the ācāryas, who have realised the truth, other interpretations stated by those who are outside the pale of Vedic religion and by heretics (within that fold) have been rejected.</p>
<p>The man who has attained a clear and sure knowledge of Tiru_mantra_ which cannot be shaken by those outside the pale of Vedic religion and by heretics &ndash; that man has been described as follows in the <em>śloka</em> :- &ldquo;He has mounted the (top most) storey of the palace of the knowledge of Tiru_mantra_ and has obtained freedom from all anxiety (about himself). The wise man looks down (from there) at ignorant people suffering for lack of this knowledge, like a man on the top of a mountain looking at people standing below (it)&rdquo;. The knowledge referred to in the following <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;Food, sleep, fear and sex are common both to animals and to men. The superiority of men to animals consists in their possession of knowledge. Those who are without knowledge are like animals&rdquo;-the knowledge referred to here is this clear and sure knowledge. (The man who has this knowledge) will never be moved or troubled by praise or censure as stated in the <em>śloka</em> : &quot; Here he is called a wise man (pandita) who like the (unsullied) waters in the depths of the G_aṅga_ will never feel elated by praise or pained by censure&quot;. &ldquo;In the land where the man who has a true knowledge of Tiru_mantra_ and who stands firmly in its meditation, is honoured, there will be no disease, no famine and no fear of robbers&rdquo;. As stated in this <em>śloka</em> : No such evil will occur there. It has been stated by those who are proficient in Ayurveda : “Adoration to that unique physician who killed, without exception, all diseases like rāga (desire) which are chronic, which lie spread over all parts of the body and which cause feverish activity, ignorance, dissatisfaction (with everything)&quot;. The <em>śloka</em> quoted above really means, in accordance with the above statement in Vāgbhatam, that (in the land where a knowledge of Tiru_mantra_ is honoured) there will be no such principal diseases as rāga or desire, no contraction of knowledge, for knowledge has been described as wealth or <em>Śrī</em> and no such great robbers as those who steal the self which cannot be stolen by external robbers. (The person who considers the self which truly belongs to <em>Bhagavān</em> as his own is a robber).</p>
<p>OTHER VYĀPAKA _MANTRA_S</p>
<p>The ideas contained in the other Vyapaka <em>mantra_s which contain the words (<em>Viṣṇu</em> and <em>Vāsudeva</em>), namely Namo Vishnave preceded by <em>praṇava</em> and <em>namo</em> Bhagavate Vāsudevāya preceded by praňava are just those which have been declared as existing in Tiru_mantra</em>. As interpreted by Ahirbudhnya such qualities as pervasiveness, splendour, entrance (into all) or immanence and will, which are deduced from the respective verbal roots are additional qualities in the Supreme Being, <em>Viṣṇu</em> and decisive of His being the Supreme Deity&quot;. The meanings of the word &ldquo;<em>Viṣṇu</em>” as derived from the root Vish which means &ldquo;to pervade, &lsquo;vas&rsquo; which means to &lsquo;shine&rsquo;, ‘vis’ . which means &rsquo;to enter&rdquo; and ‘ish’ which means &rsquo;to will&rsquo; and so also the meanings of the <em>Vāsudeva</em> derived from ‘vasati’, ‘vasayati’, which mean respectively, &ldquo;He dwells within all&rdquo; and &lsquo;He makes all dwell within Himself&rdquo; and ‘Divyati’ which means &lsquo;shines&rsquo;, from which follow His being the support of all, His being free from any taint due to contact with them, His sportive activity, and His will to conquer - all these meanings are contained in parts of the word “ Nārāyaṇa&quot;.</p>
<p>As stated in the <em>śloka</em> : “Whatever a man ought to know is all contained in <em>aṣṭākṣara</em>, that is, the Vedas viz., Rik, Yajus, Saman and so also Atharvan and other collections of words,&quot; as stated therein, this <em>aṣṭākṣara</em> is, by itself, the revelation of all that is desired by the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>, in relation to the <em>tattva</em> (Truth) and <em>hita</em> (the means or <em>upāya</em> for reaching the goal). A single utterence of it is equal to frequent repetitions of all the vedas, for it has been said, &ldquo;Whatever fruit is gained by those who repeat the Rik, Yajus and Sama Vedas many times &ndash; that fruit is gained by the man who utters the <em>aṣṭākṣara</em> <em>mantra</em> only once. A single utterance of this <em>mantra</em> is equal to a repetition of all the Vedas. Though, as stated in the <em>śloka</em>: &ldquo;In proportion to the faith that a man has in the <em>Mūlamantra</em> does he attain the ends he desires, it is impossible to estimate adequately its greatness&rdquo; (though, as stated in the <em>śloka</em>), there are degrees of success varying in accordance with the degrees of faith, the potency (of the <em>mantra</em>) is boundless (incapable of being measured) in the case of those who have great and intense faith (mahā visvāsa ) in it. Since in that <em>śloka</em> (100) it is not specifically stated by whom it is impossible to measure its potency, it may be inferred that even Nārāyaṇa who propagated this <em>mantra</em>, who is the subject of this <em>mantra</em> and who is, by nature, omniscient and who incarnated as Nara and Nārāyaṇa and propagated (by precept and practice) the Scripture without letting it become extinct-that even Nārāyaṇa knows that its potency is not capable of being measured. Tirum_aṅga_i Alvar who wis initiated into this <em>mantra</em> and its meaning by the seer of this <em>mantra</em> (<em>Bhagavān</em>, who is also its deity, has declared as follows:- &ldquo;If thou shouldst, with the help of the <em>mantra</em> of eight letters, always enjoy <em>Bhagavān</em>, who appears at the end of the Vedas which form the wealth of Brahmins, thou shalt be happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those wise men with eight qualities who meditate on the <em>mantra</em> of eight letters which treats of <em>Bhagavān</em> who is possessed of eight qualities and who created the eight-bodied (Rudra), the eight-eyed (<em>Brahma</em>), the eight quarters and their eight guardians, the eight _prakṛti_s, and the eight great mountains-these wise men have, within their (easy) reach, the eight great flowers, the eight siddhis or super-natural powers, the eight kinds of <em>bhakti</em>  or devotion, the eight _aṅga_s or accessories of <em>yoga</em>, the eight kinds of wealth, the eight great qualities, the eight times eight arts or kalās and the rasa or emotional state or sentiment which is beyond the eight rasas, namely, the emotional state called sānti or serenity of spirit.</p>
<p>EXPLANATION OF TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>To those great and wise men who meditate on the sacred <em>aṣṭākṣara</em>, which treats of the Supreme Ruler, who is the (ultimate) cause of all and who is opposed to everything of the nature of blemish and is, at the sametime, the abɔde of all auspicious qualities -(to these great men) whatever is desired by them among the spiritual virtues, the eight forms of wealth and the like is never beyond their reach. The &rsquo;eight-bodied&rsquo; means Rudra who obtained the boon of having eight bodies, namely, the five elements (bhutas-earth, water, fire, air and ether or space), the moon and the sun and the man who performs a yajna or sacrifice; the eight-eyed refers to <em>Brahma</em> who has eight eyes because of his four faces; the eight quarters; the eight guardians of the eight quarters such as lndra, the eight _prakṛti_s are the eight _tattva_s or reals like avyakta, mahat and ahañkāra, the eight great mountains means the eight chief mountain ranges<sup id="fnref:327"><a href="#fn:327" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">327</a></sup> ; &lsquo;who created these means the Supreme Being possessed of eight qualities who created all these; His eight qualities are being (1) without subjection to <em>karma</em> , (2) without old age, or (3) death, or (1) grief, (5) or hunger or, (6) thirst, (7) the possession of eternal objects of enjoyment and (8) omnipotence or the ability to accomplish whatever He desires ; to those wise men possessed of wisdom with its eight _aṅga_s who meditate on the <em>mantra</em>&rsquo; means to those enlightened men who are possessed of understanding with its eight _aṅga_s and who meditate on the sacred <em>aṣṭākṣara</em> which is the chief <em>mantra</em> among those that treat of <em>Bhagavān</em>.&rsquo; The eight _aṅga_s of wisdom are &quot; quickness of grasp, retention of what is learnt, remembrance, the ability to explain, inference, modification of what has been stated (to adapt it to new situations), reason, the knowledge of Truth - these are the eight qualities of understanding &ldquo;. The eight great flowers are the following :-&ldquo;Non-Violence (<em>ahimsā</em>) is the first flower, control of the senses is (another) flower: then comes the flower called compassion to all creatures, then the flower of forgiveness in special, then the flower of knowledge, the flower of tapas and so also the flower of contemplation (<em>dhyāna</em>) and the flower of truth these eight kinds of fiowers are most pleasing to <em>Viṣṇu</em>, The eight siddhis are inference, the knowledge of words, learning Vedanta, freedom from the three kinds of suffering; that in the body brought about by animals, and that due to the (anger of the ) gods, like storm and lightning. the possession of friends and charity. The eight forms of devotion are the following :- Love to God&rsquo;s devotees without an eye to their faults, delight in the worship offered to Him by others, an eagerness to listen to stories concerning <em>Bhagavān</em>, changes in the voice and the body and tears in the eyes while listening to them, efforts to worship <em>Bhagavān</em>, freedom from hypocrisy in one&rsquo;s relations towards God, constant meditation on God, and freedom from the expectation of rewards from God. The eight _aṅga_s of <em>yoga</em> are yama, <em>niyama</em> and the rest (<em>āsana</em>, <em>prāṇāyāma</em>, <em>pratyāhāra</em>, <em>dhyāna</em>, <em>dhāraṇa</em> and <em>samādhi</em>); the eight forms of wealth are:- the power to contract one&rsquo;s body to a much smaller size, the power to make one&rsquo;s body assume larger dimensions, the power to make oneself light (of weigbt), the power to make oneself heavy, perfect control over oneself, control over others, the attainment of whatever is desired, and success by merely desiring it.</p>
<p>They are Himavān, Vishada, Vindhya, Mālyavān, Pāriyātraka. Mandara. Malaya and Meru.</p>
<p>The eight great qualities are those which manifest themselves after <em>mukti</em> or those stated in the <em>śloka</em> &ldquo;Eight qualities enable a man to shine (above others): They are:&ndash; right to knowledge, good birth, control of the senses, learning the meaning of the Veda from the ācārya, the skill to win over one&rsquo;s rivals, freedom from talkativeness. charity in proportion to one&rsquo;s wealth and gratitude.&rdquo; Eight times eight kalās are the sixty four arts and crafts. The eight rasas are sṛṅgāra (love), vīra (heroism), karuņa, (pathos); adbhuta (wonder); hāsya (humour); bhayānaka, (terror or fear) bībhatsa (the grotesque or gruesome) and raudra (anger).The ninth is s&rsquo;anti. Among these, there is nothing which he cannot have at his desire. The imperfect development of spiritual qualities results from want of earnestness in meditation. The inability to attain the right forms of wealth is due to neglect. The delay in the release from <em>samsāra</em> is due to weakness in the desire for it.

<p>This <em>mantra</em> (<em>Dvaya</em>) which is used for performing s&rsquo;aranagati to the Lord of Padma ( <em>Lakṣmī</em>) is of the nature of the dawn coming after the dark night of <em>samsāra</em>; for having caused it to be heard by <em>Bhagavān</em>, a man is in the position of one who has done his duty; having repeated it frequently, he is in the position of one who has attained his goal.</p>
<p>The particular <em>upāya</em> (viz. <em>prapatti</em>) which was stated as being indicated directly and explicitly by the middle word of Tiru_mantra_ (<em>namo</em>) or by implication in its meaning and the goal of attainment ( <em>puruṣārtha</em> ) viz. service to the Lord which is indicated in the third word (Nārāyaṇāya) are shown clearly and distinctly in <em>Dvaya</em>. This <em>mantra</em> is revealed in kattavalli separately, in two parts (with other passages coming in between ) and is enjoined as fit to be meditated on with the two parts together. It is also explained in such treatises as <em>Śrī</em> Prasna Samhita in Pancharātra with details about the number of syllables in it (the aumber of letters, sentences, their order etc ). Therefore it is a tantrika <em>mantra</em> based on the <em>śruti</em>. The statement of some that it is a sentence given by ancient_ācārya_s means only this much: that it should be held in great esteem because it was taught by the ancient achüryas or that <em>Bhagavān</em> who is the Supreme_ācārya_ enjoined it in the Bhagavat <em>Śāstra</em>, (Pancharātra). Those who desire to know may find its rishi (its beejam etc.) as for the <em>Mūlamantra</em> and the like in accordance with such treatises as the <em>Mantraśāstra</em> and the Science of Grammar (vyākarana).</p>
<p>THE REASON FOR ITS BEING CALLED DVAYA:</p>
<p>This <em>mantra</em> is called <em>Dvaya</em> (the Two) because it treats of two points, the <em>upāya</em> and the <em>upeya</em> (the means and the goal of attainment, which are implicit in two _śloka_s (of the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> ), Namely, &ldquo;He (&lsquo;Lakṣmaṇa) fell at the two feet of his brother and said in the presence of Sītā, &ldquo;Thou shalt enjoy thyself with Sītā on the slopes of the mountains. Whether thou art awake or asleep, I (Lakṣmaṇa) will render every form of service to Thee&rdquo; The man who is not for any other <em>upāya</em> or for any other end or object (in view) has full competence for the adoption of this <em>mantra</em>.</p>
<p>Some (acharyas) say that this <em>mantra</em> is called <em>Dvaya</em> (The Two), because it indicates (1) the soliciting (varana) of a Saviour and (2) the surrender of the responsibility (bharasamarpaņam), both in one The same is the reason for the word <em>Dvaya</em> being employed in respeet of such other _mantra_s as &ldquo;<em>Śrīman</em> Nārāyaṇa Swamin&rdquo;. To this <em>mantra</em> also, such things as the adoration of The <em>guru</em> which are prescribed in the following _śloka_s in regard to another <em>mantra</em> concerning <em>prapatti</em> are applicable : &ldquo;After prostrating before the <em>guru</em>, this sacred <em>mantra</em> (literally: the king of _mantra_s) should be learnt. The <em>guru</em> is, himself, the supreme <em>Brahman</em>; the <em>guru</em> is himself the great <em>upāya</em>; the <em>guru</em> is himself the great <em>vidyā</em> or form of meditation; the <em>guru</em> is himsell the sacred <em>Siddhopāya</em>, the <em>guru</em> is himself <em>mokṣa</em>, the <em>guru</em> is himself the great wealth of <em>jñāna</em> or koowledge and <em>bhakti</em>  because he initiates (one) into the <em>mantra</em>, the <em>guru</em> is most venerable. This <em>mantra</em> does not require any suitability or any auspicious position of the stars for its initiation nor any purity attainable from baths in holy waters. Nor does it require for its successful initiation any japam, homam, daily repetition and the like. First one should prostrate in full before the <em>guru</em> three times and touch his feet with one&rsquo;s head and receive the <em>mantra</em> like a poor man expecting a hidden treasure. Having thus received the <em>mantra</em>, one should seek refuge under me. By this <em>mantra</em> alone should ope surrender one&rsquo;s self to me. He who has done so becomes one who has done what one ought to do &ldquo;.</p>
<p>It is learnt from the _Śāstra_s (Kaṭhavalli and the like) that a single utterance of this <em>mantra</em> by a believer preceded by a knowledge of its meaning as a whole will secure salvation. The potency of this <em>mantra</em> as distinguished from that of other _mantra_s has been described as follows (by <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>):- &ldquo;In whatever manner you utter the <em>Dvaya</em> etc.&rdquo; It has been said:&ndash; &ldquo;The man by whom the name of <em>Bhagavān</em> is uttered even unconsciously is freed from all sins as a forest with a lion in it from animals that are afraid of lions &ldquo;, and (so also), &ldquo;The extent of potency that Thy name, O Hari, has in condoping sins exceeds even that of sins that can (ever) be committed by a man who eats dog&rsquo;s flesh (i. e, a chandāla,&rdquo;. If, in such passages, the potency of a mere utterance of the Lord&rsquo;s name is praised in very high terms, what is said in such treatises as the śruti about even a single utterance of this great <em>mantra</em> which reveals, in full, the Redeemer, the surrender of the self to Him and the fruit to be obtained there from can be easily realised by the force of _pramāṇa_s. The reason of this potency may be understood from the _pramāṇa_s and from tradition or sampradaya. It is not proper to argne about these subjects which are of the nature of mystic doctrines. We can only place faith in them on the strength of what is stated in the s&rsquo;astras. In such treatises as the Mahabhiirata. it is said: - &ldquo;Arguments based on reason are of no avail in regard to divine and other mys teries. The man who desires his happiness should have implicit faith in them like one who is deaf and who is blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The self-surrender which is the purport of this <em>mantra</em> has been praised in such <em>śloka_s as the folluwing and in other contexts : &ldquo;A man should surrender to <em>Brahman</em> his true and natural self free from all limiting conditions like a_vidyā</em>. This is <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em> and the <em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em> which is necessary for it. Other things are vain talk.&rdquo; Instead of Other things are vaio talk&rdquo; there is</p>
<p>another reading of the <em>śloka</em> which would mean “This is (real) knowledge and what is to be acquired with the help of knowledge.&rdquo; Though this <em>śloka</em> has, for its purport, the surrender of the self, the surrender of the responsibility or burden of protection which is described here is contained within it. Other <em>mantra_s which are mentioned in such treatises as Vyāsa_smṛti</em> and in Svetas&rsquo;vatara upanishad like, “A  man should remember that he is the body of the spotless and resplendent <em>Viṣṇu</em> and with an eager longing for Him, who is the object of attainment, and without any desire for other ends, (he) should surrender his self to <em>Viṣṇu</em> uttering the <em>mantra</em> &ldquo;Tad Vishnoh&rdquo; - None of those other <em>mantra_s reveals the Redeemer, the act of seeking His protection and the fruit arising from it so clearly (as this <em>Dvaya</em>). Even in the Tiru_mantra</em> these three are stated (only) with extreme conciseness. Therefore this <em>Dvaya</em> which reveals, in full, the object of attainment and the means of attainment is the most important of all _mantra_s dealing with <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THIS <em>MANTRA</em></p>
<p>The s&rsquo;aranāgati <em>Gadya</em> is a commentary on <em>Dvaya</em> :</p>
<p>(<em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>) has in his <em>Gadya</em> (prose treatise) given the meaning of this <em>mantra</em> as known from <em>śruti</em>, <em>smṛti</em>, Itihāsas Purāṇas, Bhagavat <em>Śāstra</em> and the like and in accordance with the traditional order of interpretation of great_ācārya_s :&ndash; It is as follows:-The purport of the word _Śrī_mat (in <em>Dvaya</em>) is explained in these words in the <em>Gadya</em>);-&rdquo; (<em>Lakṣmī</em>) whose essential Nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) and whose form rūpa are such as can be held in esteem by <em>Bhagavān</em> and as are in conformity with the nature of) <em>Bhagavān</em> Nārāyaṇa &ldquo;. In the words beginniog with &ldquo;opposed to everything of the nature of blemish&rdquo; (in the <em>Gadya</em>), (<em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>) has described at length <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>), His form (rupa ), and His attributes and glories (vibhūtis). So the meaning of the word Nārāyaṇa has been commented upon (in them.) In the commentary on the word &lsquo;Nārāyaṇa&rsquo;, <em>Lakṣmī</em> who has been already stated in _Śrī_mat is once again made to appear in the midst of His glories (vibhūtis) in the word _Śrī_vallabha in the <em>Gadya</em> in order to explain her role as mediator (between the <em>jīva</em> and her Spouse). Then <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> takes for comment the words <em>Śrīman</em> Nārāyaṇa employed in the sentences treating of the goal and the means of attaining it. The person competent for <em>prapatti</em> indicated by the first person singular in the word prapadye (I seek Him for refuge) is explained in the words (in the <em>Gadya</em>) which mean &ldquo;I seek the refuge of Thy two lotus feet&rdquo; explain the words <em>caraṇau</em> (feet) and saranam (refuge) and so also the verb (in <em>Dvaya</em>). Later <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> indicates distinctly the word <em>Dvaya</em> which is commented upon.</p>
<p>It may be asked: &ldquo;Why should (he) dwell at such length without specifying the word Draya either in the beginning or at the end, but only here?&rdquo; The answer is as follows:- Here in regard to the <em>upāya</em> and the <em>upeya</em> or what is to be attained thereby, the most important is Nārāyaṇa with <em>Śrī</em> (<em>Lakṣmī</em>). Therefore the word Nārāyaṇa with its attribute <em>Śrī</em> which occurs in two places rip <em>Dvaya</em>) has been already commented upon. So in order to show that along with the <em>Sādhyopāya</em> (namely <em>prapatti</em>)) which is indicated by this <em>mantra</em>, the principal <em>upāya</em> and the principal object of attainment have been commented upon, the word <em>Dvaya</em> is here inserted (i.e.) to mean that the <em>Dvaya</em> has been, for the most part, explained. Then in the _śloka_s which begin with &lsquo;pitaran mataram&rdquo; and in certaio sentences taken form Jitante, and Bhagavadgītā and other passages which express the same idea, <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> shows that the resulting meaning of the <em>Dvaya</em> is the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) without any other object and with no other <em>upāya</em> in one&rsquo;s view or power, and the form of prayer for pardon with the thought of the Saviour&rsquo;s nature preceding it. Thereafter following the order indicated by the meaning (and not by the actual order of words in the sentence), <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> explains the prayer in the word <em>namas</em> for the removal of (all) hindrances. After this, he explains the supreme aim of life which is indicated by the suffix of the dative (or fourth case) in the words which end in the fourth case (Narāyānāya), which includes such aims as superior <em>bhakti</em>  (<em>parābhakti</em> ) that precede the attainment of the supreme aim (the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em> and His <em>kaiṅkarya</em>). Then he points out how <em>Bhagavān</em> is so full of compassion (as shown also in the second half of the <em>Caramaśloka</em>,) as to vouchsafe success both in regard to this life and in regard to what is to follow thereafter. (This he does) by the words stated to have been spoken by <em>Bhagavān</em>. Therefore all that is stated by (<em>Rāmānuja</em>) in the (<em>Śaraṇāgati</em>) <em>Gadya</em> is intended to be conveyed by the <em>Dvaya</em>. This is indicated also by the words in the <em>Gadya</em>) which mean “uttering the <em>Dvaya</em> in this manner with an understanding of its meaning etc&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The ācāryas of old have declared that the statement in such writings as the <em>Gadya</em> that superior <em>bhakti</em> ( para-<em>bhakti</em> ) and the like (li, e. parajñāna and parama bhaktı) have, for their result, <em>kaiṅkarya</em> describes what occurs in the state of <em>mukti</em>. Since what follows later in order namely, the direct vision of the Lord (para-<em>jñāna</em>) and the eager desire for the uninterrupted enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> are preceded by the eager longing to do so, they are said to result from para-.<em>bhakti</em> .</p>
<p>At the time of departure from the body, the grace of the Lord who dwells in the heart (of the <em>jīva</em>) grants to those who have performed <em>prapatti</em> that spiritual ripeness which would enable them to have a vision of the Lord. When the seed of a plant is soaked in the oil of ankola (azhinjil), it produces sprouts, leaves, flowers, fruits and the like in a few instants. So also, in just a few instants, the grace of the Lord enables the self to attain that spiritual perfection which would inake possible <em>parābhakti</em> , parajñāna and parama_bhakti_ . This state of perfection or ripeness which is referred to in the <em>Gadya</em> is as appropriate as what is taught in such treatises as the Sātvata concerning the special religious observances (vrata) for attaining <em>mokṣa</em> - for instance, that the minds of men rendered impure by stains caused by the wicked senses become pure at the time of their death, as a result of their residence in a place where there is a temple dedicated to Nārāyaṇa. Such (great souls) as Nammalvar, Nāthamuni and others enjoyed the Lord even before their death, owing to some special grace of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p>Nammalvar has, in the following passages and elsewhere, stated the meaning of <em>Dvaya</em>: - &ldquo;Meditate  soon on the feet of Nārāyaṇa and His consort and acquire a new life&rdquo; (here the words up to and acquire express the <em>upāya</em> stated in the first part of <em>Dvaya</em> and what follows indicates the meaning of the second part); “The man that has sought the feet of <em>Bhagavān</em> black as the raincloud and who has thereby attained new life&rdquo; and &ldquo;O Thou on whose chest abides <em>Lakṣmī</em> because she cannot endure separation from Thee even for an instant, etc&rdquo;.</p>
<p>THE DETAILED INTERPRETATION OF DVAYA:</p>
<p>The meaning of <em>Śrīman</em>:</p>
<p>The word <em>Śrīman</em> Nārāyaṇa which stands first in <em>Dvaya</em> refers to the Supreme Reality (para_tattva_) which is the refuge of every one. The determination of the person of the Supreme Reality is well known to be arrived at in the śrutis by reason of His being the Lord of <em>Śrī</em> and by the word &lsquo;Nārāyaṇa.&rsquo; The word _Śrī_mat in the first part (of <em>Dvaya</em>) is to show that, when Nārāyaṇa becomes the Redeemer, He is with His attribute (<em>Lakṣmī</em>). Arulalapperumal Emberumanar states :- &quot; Before understanding the sabstantive which has attributes, the attributes have to be understood. Therefore to understand Hari who has <em>Lakṣmī</em> for His attribute, the attribute, &lsquo;<em>Lakṣmī</em>&rsquo;, has (first) to be understood.&rdquo; That this (<em>Lakṣmī</em>) is an attribute both in the first part (of the <em>Dvaya</em>) and in the second has already been explained in the chapter <em>Siddhopāya</em> s&rsquo;odhana as also the principle that when the <em>upāya</em> has an attribute, there will be no duality of the <em>upāya</em>. (See page : ___).</p>
<p>The meaning of <em>Śrī</em>:- In the Bhagavat _śāstra_s (Pancharātra), the word <em>Śrī</em> has been etymologically interpreted in six ways: (1) srīyate (is resorted to); (2) srayate (resorts to); (3) srnoti (listens); (4) srāvayati (makes listen); (5) srniti (removes); (6) _śrī_nati (makes ripe). The other words that are required to make the meaning clear have to be understood from what is appropriate (in the context) and on the strength of _pramāṇa_s. (1) &amp; (2) _Śrī_yate and Srayate :- Among them when we take the word to mean that She (<em>Lakṣmī</em>) is resorted to by those who desire spiritual re-birth and that she resorts to the Supreme Ruler of all in order to give them spiritual rebirth, we may take the following <em>śloka</em> (for authority):- &ldquo;When Thy beloved Lord is displeased with a man who has committed serious offences in order, like a father, to reform him, Thou, O mother, sayest to Him, &quot; What is this? Is there any man in the world who has no faults?&rdquo; and persuadest Him by suitable devices to accept the offender by making Him forget (vismārya) his offences. Therefore art Thou our mother.&rdquo; As stated in this <em>śloka</em>, she helps to mitigate the anger of the Supreme Ruler who wields the rod of punishment for the sake of promoting the welfare of the offender. Thus she sees to it that the Lord&rsquo;s natural compassion becomes the cause of the man&rsquo;s ( spiritual) rebirth. The word <em>Śrī</em>, in this interpretation, would describe her greatness as a mediator (who intercedes on behalf of the <em>jīva</em>) owing to her excessive love which is that of a mother. The word vismārya, which means &lsquo;by making him forget&rsquo; has, for its purport, as in the word avignāta (in avijnāta sahasrāms&rsquo;u), which literally means (not knowing), the removal of the thought of punishing entertained by the omniscient <em>Iśvara</em>. The same is the meaning of the word &lsquo;fascinated in the passage, &ldquo;He who is fascinated by the &ldquo;charms of <em>Lakṣmī</em>, the lotus-born etc&rdquo; The word &lsquo;mediator (purushakara) means &ldquo;another intelligent being who is sought as a means or <em>upāya</em> for securing the favour of an intelligent being who can satisfy the wants of one&rdquo;. This mediator or purushakāra&rsquo; is the mediate (as distinguished from the direct) cause for the attainment of the (desired) fruit.</p>
<p>We have already pointed out in Niksheparaksha, as an authority, that by (her) very nature, by the practice (of the wise), by what we see in worldly affairs and by the words of _guru_s, and so also by the <em>śruti</em> and <em>smṛti</em>, dependence on an interceding) mediator is established (as a rule to be followed). &ldquo;By Her very nature&rdquo; means &ldquo;By her nature in which there is no admixture of the anger arising from mental strength characteristic of a father and in which love (as for a child) resulting from a motherly feelings becomes over-whelming.&rdquo; It is her nature (always) to say: &ldquo;There is no one who does not commit an offence&rdquo;; &ldquo;Who will get angry, best of monkeys, with these Rākṣasis who are under the authority of a king and being servants, render service to him?&rdquo; &ldquo;I cannot endure (to see) the sufferings of these servants of Ravana and therefore I pardon their offences&rdquo;. Her being the Lord&rsquo;s favourite is also such that, if she should intercede (on our behalf), the Lord cannot refuse. Since her very nature is such, it cannot be said that, to secure her help, the intercession of some one else will be needed and so on ad infinitum. As (an instance of) the practice of the wise, it is well-known from the Purāṇas, that, when <em>Brahma</em> and others were afraid to approach the Lord on seeing His wrath against His enemy, Hiranya, which arose owing to His intense love for Prahlāda, they approached the Supreme Ruler, who was then in the form of Nrisimha, with <em>Lakṣmī</em> as their leader (mediator) and praised Him. (Instances) may be seen also in such contexts as the following:- &quot; The renowned&rdquo; Lakṣmaṇa thus spoke to Sītā and the noble-minded Rāma.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lakṣmaṇa, the descendent of Raghu, seized the two feet of his brother, <em>Śrī</em> Rāma, and said these words, in the presence of Sītā.&rdquo; In worldly affairs, too, this may be seen in kings pardoning the servants of the zenana as a result of even slight propitiation though their offences are great. This idea is also the purport of the śloka:-&ldquo;O Mother <em>Lakṣmī</em> ! We who find our sole delight in rendering service to Thee and have only that as our aim, approach the Lord, look at Him and delight in serving Him, here and elsewhere, with the idea that He is Thy Spouse, in the same way as the people of Mithila looked upon <em>Śrī</em> Rāma as the bridegroom and the beloved husband of Sītā&rdquo;. The words of _guru_s are such passages as that of Nammalvar who says :-&ldquo;O Thou on whose chest abides <em>Lakṣmī</em>, who says she cannot endure separation from Thee even for an instant&rdquo;. Texts may also be seen in support of this in the _śruti_s which are in the form of <em>Śrī</em> Sūktas. The _Smṛti_s based on these are the words of Śaunaka and others -such as the following :- &ldquo;The man who begs for the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em>, who is the purport of all words, should, of necessity, seek the protection also of <em>Lakṣmī</em>. It is not enough to perform <em>prapatti</em> to the Lord alone&rdquo;. Since it is evident from many _pramāṇa_s that <em>Lakṣmī</em> plays the role of a mediator interceding at the feet of the Lord, it is but proper to understand it (in this way) in this context. Thus she is resorted to as a mediator and as the attribute of <em>Siddhopāya</em>.</p>
<p>As stated in the following _śloka_s ;- &ldquo;O <em>Lakṣmī</em>,  with a countenance as delightful as the moon! When we consider <em>Bhagavān</em> and Thee separately, (we see) that the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of <em>Bhagavān</em> and His being the Supreme Ruler over all are the outcome of the superiority resulting from His being associated with Thee. Therefore Thou art that aspect of His which declares Thy Lord as being such and such.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou art, O <em>Lakṣmī</em>, the property of <em>Bhagavān</em> solely by Thine own will. Though His greatness (and superiority) result from Thee, they are not dependent on any one else for the reason given above. A gem is precious because of its radiance; still it should not be considered as having no worth (in itself). Its natural value does not diminish and is not dependent on anything else &ldquo;,-(as stated in these _śloka_s) she is attached to <em>Bhagavān</em> (the <em>Siddhopāya</em>) like rays to the sun and the like, contributing to His splendour.</p>
<p>When we take the etymological meaning to be that she is to be reverenced by all, while she (herself) reveres the Supreme Ruler over all, she is the lady entitled to the service of all (of us). She is herself of the nature of a <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord as stated in: “ Thy beloved Spouse is <em>Bhagavān</em> who is called <em>Puruṣottama</em>&rdquo; and in the <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;All things, those that move and those that do not move, are, O Goddess that rulest over _Śrī_r_aṅga_m, for Thy <em>līlā</em>. The eternal sūris who are said to be constantly looking at the region of eternal enjoyment (bhoga) namely, <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em>, were appointed to be Thy servants. By Thy compassion alone are we among those who are protected. Thy <em>śeṣī</em> is <em>Bhagavān</em>; all the rest are subject to Thy grace&rdquo;. W&rsquo;hen the (etymological) meaning of the word <em>Śrī</em> is taken to be as stated in the <em>śloka</em> : “The whole world depends on <em>Lakṣmī</em> for support&rdquo; that all things depend upon Her for protection and that she is attached to all things, that aspect of the Lord of <em>Śrī</em> which is declared by such words as Nārāyaṇa (<em>Viṣṇu</em> and <em>Vāsudeva</em> ) is declared also of <em>Viṣṇu</em>&rsquo;s consort. The author on <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em>, too, has said Bhagavatī <em>Śrī</em> in the same way as He says <em>Bhagavān</em> Nārāyaṇa in that context; (i. e.) he calls for Bhagavatī to show that She has the same distinction as Her Spouse.</p>
<p>(3) &amp; (4) When the (etymological) meaning (of <em>Śrī</em>) is taken to be, &lsquo;She listens&rsquo; (śṛṇoti) and She makes listen (śrāvayati) it would mean: &ldquo;When we who have offended (against the Lord) pray to Her that she should persuade Him to be accessible to us on our approaching His feet for protection, she listens to the cry of suffering of those who have sought Her as a refuge and pleads (to the Lord) on our behalf god helps to mitigate our suffering. The words which (literally) state her activity (really) aim at stating Her role as a mediator. Having heard from Him these words : &ldquo;Those who seek my two feet as their sole <em>upāya</em> or refuge - I myself take them, O, my beloved! out of <em>samsāra</em>&rdquo;, and also &ldquo;Compassion is a supreme virtue&rdquo;, she would, when the proper occasion arises, say, like the female pigeon to the male pigeon in the <em>śloka</em> :&ndash; &ldquo;Listen, my beloved husband, with attention to what I am going to say for your good. He who has sought refuge under you should be protected even if it be at the cost of your life&rdquo;. It may also be considered to have the following meanings : Having heard from the Supreme Ruler that He is ever bent on the advancement of the world&rsquo;s welfare, she would offer her advice to be listened to even by her enemies as in the passage : &quot; If you should desire to save your abode (viz. Lanka) and to avoid a horrible death, it would be in your interest to obtain the friendship ot <em>Śrī</em> Rāma, who is the best of men &ldquo;..</p>
<p>(5) &quot; When the etymological meaning (of <em>Śrī</em>) is taken to be that she removes all faults (śṝṇāti), it would mean that she removes all hindrances in the way of those who have adopted the <em>upāya</em> (namely <em>prapatti</em>), such as <em>karma</em> , and this idea is brought out in the following passages :- &ldquo;In all siddhāntas (systems of religious thought) and in the Vedānta, it has been declared that when <em>Bhagavān</em> affords protection, He does it always with <em>Lakṣmī</em>, who is the very embodiment of compassion, by His side&rdquo;, and so also, &ldquo;<em>Lakṣmī</em> who resides in the ever fragrant lotus destroys all the (past) <em>karma</em>  of _jīva_s&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(6) In the etymological interpretation, &ldquo;She makes the world ripe by her qualities” (śṛṇātii), the root (<em>Śrī</em>) would mean that, by her attributes like compassion, she enables those who have sought her protection to become ripe enough to have the qualities necessary for rendering service to the Lord. This idea is brought out in the passage: &ldquo;Having Thy grace and the grace of Thy Consort who abides in the lotus, I will sweep the floor of Thy temple&rdquo;. Bearing in mind all these excellences (of <em>Lakṣmī</em>) stated in all these interpretations, Alavandar wrote: &quot; Thy name too is <em>Śrī</em>. How can we have the fitness to praise Thee?&rdquo; Bhattar, too, had in mind her being unconditionally gracious and said :- &quot; <em>Bhagavān</em>&rdquo; is ever gracious because of His association with Thee. Thy graciousness is not due to any cause or condition. It exists of its own accord, for art Thou not <em>Śrī</em> ?&rdquo; Among these meanings those that are appropriate to <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s being the <em>upāya</em>  should be borne in mind in regard to the first part (of <em>Dvaya</em>), while those that are appropriate to <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s being the object of attainment should be borne in mind in regard to the second part (of <em>Dvaya</em> ).</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>॥ स्वाम्युपाय उपेयश्च स्वरूपादिसमर्पणे । प्रथितः प्रतिसंबन्धी श्रीमान्निगमचक्षुषाम् ॥</p>
<p>In the surrender of such as one&rsquo;s essential Nature (and the burden of protection etc.), the Master is well known, to those who see with the eye of the śrutis, as the <em>upāya</em> or means and as one to whom the surrender is made. He is also the <em>upeya</em> (the object of attainment).</p>
<p>Though the word <em>Śrīman</em> means in general &lsquo;one who is associated with <em>Śrī</em>, yet here, as a consequence of the _pramāṇa_s (i.e.) <em>Śruti</em> which says (<em>Lakṣmī</em> is His Spouse) it means the husband or Sponse of <em>Śrī</em>.</p>
<p>The relationship which appears to be general really means, on the strength of the Śruti, the specific relationship (of being the spouse ). Since He is called the Spouse of Her who is resorted to for protection and who is (also ) the world&rsquo;s mother, His being the Supreme Being and His easy accessibility are both indicated (thereby). Though <em>Śrī</em> is included in the word (Nārā) (in Nārāyaṇa), she is taken here separately in order to show that there is a difference between her and other things (included in Nārā) (in that she has omnipresence and other such qualities). She is shown as an attribute (of the Lord) (in the word <em>Śrīman</em>) in order to bring out the idea of her existence solely for Her Spouse, in accordance with the _pramāṇa_s (i. e. of Her own will and that of Her Lord ).</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE SUFFIX MATUP (IN <em>ŚRĪMAN</em>):</p>
<p>Though suftixes&quot; like <em>matup</em> have (all) the following meanings :- &rsquo;excess&rsquo; &lsquo;censure&rsquo; praise&rsquo; &rsquo;eternal connection superiority (over others)&rsquo;, &lsquo;association&rsquo;, and &rsquo;the statement of mere existence&rsquo;, yet here, by special usage, it indicates &rsquo;eternal connection&rsquo; which is well-known from the _pramāṇa_s. This eternal connection between <em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Śrī</em> is indeed such that even when He assumed the form of a _Brahma_charin (in <em>Vāmanāvatāra</em>), He is said to have concealed, with the deer-skin, His Spouse, abiding in His chest&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The two objections that have been raised by some in this context are not sound: The first objection is that the suffix <em>matup</em> is not employed when, of two things that are put in grammatical apposition or co-ordination (sāmānīdhikaranya), one is inseparable from the other and cannot exist without the other. For instance, when we say “<em>Brahman</em> is Ānanda, <em>Brahman</em> and <em>Ānanda</em> (bliss ) are in grammatical apposition or co-ordination with each other. Since anandam or bliss is an inseparable attribute of <em>Brahman</em>, <em>matup</em> is not added to it as a suffix. But when we say, &rsquo;the man having a stick (dandi)&rsquo;, the suffix <em>matup</em> comes after danda (stick), because the stick can be separated from the man and can exist without the man. So the objector says that since the suffix occurs in <em>Śrīman</em>, Srī should be considered as separable from Nārāyaṇa ( as in Dandi) which is put in apposition with it.</p>
<p>The second objection is as follows:-“If <em>Śrī</em> is separable from Nārāyaṇa and can exist where He is not (as during Sītā&rsquo;s separation from <em>Śrī</em> Rāma) the two words <em>Śrī</em> and the word meaning <em>Bhagavān</em> should not be put jo apposition or co-ordination without the suffix, but we do find them in grammatical apposition or co-ordi pation when <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa says :-&ldquo;Among women, I am the deity of fame, <em>Śrī</em> (<em>Lakṣmī</em>) and Vāk (Saraswati)&rdquo; and also in the sentence :-&quot;<em>Bhagavān</em> is“ <em>Lakṣmī</em> who abides in the lotus &ldquo;.</p>
<p>These (two) objections are unsound for the following reasons - The existence of the suffix does not, by itself, determine whether there is inseparable connection or no. For example: By the principle enunciated in <em>Brahma</em> _Sūtra_s 2 – 3-.29, &quot; The <em>jīva</em> is called <em>jñāna</em> because the attribute <em>jñāna</em> or knowledge is an essential and distinctive quality of the <em>jīva</em>, in the same way as <em>Brahman</em> is called <em>Ānanda</em> (bliss), because <em>Ānanda</em> is an essential and distinctive quality of <em>Brahman</em>.&rdquo; Here there is inseparable connection between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>jñāna</em> and the two are put in apposition with each other, whereas usage such as the <em>jīva</em> is one having <em>jñāna</em> (Jñānavān) is also frequently found. That is, though there is inseparable connection between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>jñāna</em>, the suffix <em>matup</em> is attached to <em>jñāna</em>, as in dandi, where the connection is separable. It is clear from this that the existence or non-existence of the suffix <em>matup</em> does not, of itself, afford evidence about the separability or inseparability of connection<sup id="fnref:328"><a href="#fn:328" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">328</a></sup> .</p>
<p><em>Śrīman</em>, jñānavān, daṇḍi have also the suffix <em>matup</em> though in different variations).</p>
<p>When it is said, for instance, &quot; The king himself is all the subjects&quot;, where there is no suffix <em>matup</em> after the word lokāh (subjects) in the appositional use, it cannot be stated that there is inseparable connection between the king and his subjects and that the latter cannot exist without him, for the meaning of the sentence is something entirely different (from separability or inseparability of connection). So the proper thing to do is to understand the nature of the connection with the help of other _pramāṇa_s which bring it out clearly (and not merely by the existence or non-existence of the suffix <em>matup</em>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here (in regard to <em>Lakṣmī</em>&rsquo;s inseparable connection with <em>Bhagavān</em>), since the _pramāṇa_s declare eternal connection (between them), both in the state when they are sought as <em>upāya</em> and in the state when the fruit (of the adoption of the <em>upāya</em>) is enjoyed and since in this <em>mantra</em> (<em>Dvaya</em>), this idea of inseparable connection needs to be stressed, the <em>matup</em> indicates that the two stand inseparably connected, both in the first part of <em>Dvaya</em> and in the second part and this conclusion is arrived at on the strength of such _pramāṇa_s as the following :- “ Lakṣmaṇa,&rdquo; the descendant of Raghu, seized the two feet of <em>Śrī</em> Rāma firmly and said these words in the presence of Sītā&quot;, and &quot; You will enjoy your self in the company of Sitā on the slopes of the mountains and whether you are awake or asleep, I will render every form of service to you&quot;. (The first passage describes their inseparability in the state of <em>upāya</em> and the second in the state of the attainment of the fruit, namely, the rendering of service to them (<em>kaiṅkarya</em>). Nammalvar, too, realised in his mind this inseparability in the following passages :&ndash; O, Thou, on whose chest resides <em>Lakṣmī</em>, whose home is the lotus, because she cannot endure separation from Thee for an instant !, &quot; While <em>Lakṣmī</em> with her beautiful bracelets and Thou stand together, I see that the supreme end of existence is to enjoy Thee and render service to Thee like the eternal sūris and other selves&quot; (the former describes the state of <em>upāya</em> and the latter the state of attainment) and so also in, &ldquo;Here (where we adopt the means or <em>upāya</em>) and there (in <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em>) where we enjoy <em>Bhagavān</em>, there is no one other than Nārāyaṇa who is ever found in (intimate) connection with <em>Lakṣmī</em>&rdquo;. ((48) describes both the states). This realisation (of inseparable connection between <em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Śrī</em>, is essential for seeking the Lord&rsquo;s protection without any misgivings or heSītātion and whenever we desire it,</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD NĀRĀYAṇA AND</p>
<p>THE QUALITIES DISCLOSED IN IT ;</p>
<p>Even the intercession of the mediator which appears as a requisite is effective (only because of the relationship between Nārāyaṇa and the <em>jīva</em> and because of His qualities which are disclosed in the word Nārāyaṇa. (i.e. It is because Nārāyaṇa is intimately associated with the _jīva_s and has certain great qualities that <em>Lakṣmī</em>&rsquo;s intercession proves effective). This may be seen in the passage: &quot; <em>Bhagavān</em> may even say:&quot; &ldquo;My devotees will never commit offences, Even if they offend, it is only for my glory ( to bring out my unique forgiveness&rdquo; ).</p>
<p>It may be asked whether it is not enough to say <em>Śrīman</em> (and not <em>Śrīman</em> Nārāyaṇa) as the word Şrimān by itself has been declared to be one of the names of <em>Bhagavān</em> in the <em>śloka</em> :&ndash; _Śrī_dharah: Srīkarah: Sreyah: <em>Śrīman</em>, Lokatrayasrayah and elsewhere. The answer is as follows: &ldquo;The word <em>Śrīman</em> is here used as an adjective qualifying Nārāyaṇa, because the word Nārāyaṇa is required here (in <em>Dvaya</em> ) in the first part in order to enable us to bear in mind the special qualities (indicated by that word) which are adapted for His being the <em>upāya</em> and, in the second part, in order to show that Nārāyaṇa, the <em>śeṣī</em>, who has both kinds of <em>vibhūti</em>, is the object of attainment.</p>
<p>Though the word &lsquo;Nārāyaṇa&rsquo; used here (in <em>Dvaya</em>) has, for its purport, all the qualities which were etymologically derived from the word in the chapter on the mūlamantra, yet, since in the first part (of <em>Dvaya</em>) the aim of the word &lsquo;Nārāyaṇa&rsquo; is to show His beiog the refuge, the following are the principal among the qualities to be borne in mind : affection (like that of a cow for the calf), that of being the Swāmin or Master, good nature, easy accessibility, omniscience, omnipotence, irresistible will or purpose, supreme compassion, gratitude, firmness, perfection or fulness, supreme generosity and the like. These qualities have been briefly told in such passages as the following:- &ldquo;O, Thou so that art full of matchless qualities, that ownest the three worlds, O, Thou, that art my Saviour and that dwellest on the mountain Tiruvengadam which is longed for by hosts of gods and rishis! (Saulabhya)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Of these vātsālya or affection is the tenderness which accepts a man for protection ignoring his offences, as in the <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;I will never ignore one who comes to me like a friend, even if there be faults in him. This will not be censured by the good &ldquo;. It is (a quality) needed for not avoiding Him on account of one&rsquo;s offences. Swamitva or the attribute of being the master is the special kind of association existing between <em>Bhagavān</em> and the <em>jīva</em>, which is disclosed in the <em>praṇava</em> and the like. This is necessary to inspire confidence that He will protect (us) for His owo glory. Sausīlya, or good nature, is shown in His intimate companionship with such people of low birth as huntsmen, monkeys and cow-herds in spite of His superiority to all beings. This (quality) is necessary for inspiring confidence which would not make one despair saying : &quot; Where is He who is the Master of all and who is armed with the discus and where am I&rdquo;? but which would encourage one to expect Him to render even such service as driving the chariot and conveying a message. Soulabhya or easy accessibility consists in &lsquo;His being within the range of the eyes of all men&rsquo; even though He is beyond the reach of even such great yogis as Sanaka and Sanandana. This (qualiiy) is necessary in order that we may not give up the longing for Him owing to a notion that He is too difficult of approach. Omniscience consists in His seeing all things, as stated in such _śloka_s as the following: &ldquo;There is nothing in any of the three worlds that is not known to Thee&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I bow to <em>Bhagavān</em> who, by His very nature, sees all things at the same time&rdquo;. This is necessary for the thought that there is nothing unknown to Him among the good things to be given to those who have sought His protection and among the hindrances to be removed from them. Omnipotence consists in the ability to accomplish what cannot be accomplished (by others). This is necessary to give us the assurance that, though we are now in <em>samsāra</em> (or bondage of births and deaths ), He can make us enter the assembly of the eternal suuis, Satyasankalpatva means that His will or purpose can never be thwarted even by Himself. This is necessary for the confidence that we shonld have that the words: “I will release you from all sins&rdquo;, will never prove futile. Supreme compassion is the desire to remove the suffering of others without any thought of one&rsquo;s own interests. This is necessary for the knowledge that He will pardon on some pretext (<em>vyāja</em>) even those who have committed innumerable offences, as in the _śloka_s : &ldquo;I will never give up the man who seeks me in the manner of a friend, even though he has faults&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Fetch him, O Sugrīva, best of monkeys, whether he be Vibhishana or even Ravana himself. I promise security to him&rdquo;. Gratitude consists in looking upon even trivial acts of kindness with the greatest regard, as if they were supreme deeds of helpfulness and never forgetting them. (lnstances of this) may be seen in such _śloka_s as the following: &ldquo;Since <em>Śrī</em> Rāma is large-hearted, he does not remember even hundreds of offences committed by others against him. He delights (on the other hand) on even a single act of help :&rsquo;, and &ldquo;That cry for help uttered aloud by Draupadi even from a distance calling me &ldquo;Govinda!”-that cry is never away from my mind like a debt that has increased with the interest accumulated on it&rdquo;. This quality makes one say to oneself: “If He sees anything of worth done by me within the limits of my ability, He will never forsake ine&rdquo;. Firmness is the quality of persistence in protecting suppliants. This is necessary to inspire the faith that He will never forsake us, even though others who are very intimate with Him try to dissuade Him, as (when <em>Śrī</em> Rāma said):-&ldquo;I will never give up the man who comes to me in the manner of a friend&rdquo;. Paripurnatvam (perfection or fullness) consists in (His) having all objects that are desired or desirable. This is necessary to make us endeavour to serve Him in the way that is within our limited power, with the knowledge that is what we offer to him (upahara), He will consider only the fervour of emotion or feeling and not measure its worth or value. This may be seen in the following words (of the Lord): &ldquo;Though what is offered to me by my devotees is atornic, it appears very great to me owing to their love. What is offered to me by those wanting in devotion, however great it might be, never gives me delight&rdquo;. &quot; Whatever is given to me with love, be it only such trivial things as a leaf, a flower, a fruit or even (mere) water, I eat it, because it is given with devotion by one who is devout”. Supreme generosity is the liberality in making gifts which makes a person feel that he has not done enough, even when he has given all that he possesses without any thought of the slightness of the endeavour on the part of the person benefited, the greatness of the benefit conferred or the unworthiness of the beneficiary. This is a quality which induces men like Dadhibhāṇḍa<sup id="fnref:329"><a href="#fn:329" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">329</a></sup> and others to ask with importunity for the great benefits of spiritual life even for those who are connected with them, Thus such qualities in the Redeemer as are useful for seeking His protection and the manner in which they are useful should be borne in mind.</p>
<p>Dadhibhāṇḍa begged <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa for spiritual benefits not only for himself but for those related to him</p>
<p>In the state of practising the vidyās or forms of meditation (prescribed in the śrutis), only certain qualities (of <em>Brahman</em>) pertaining to that <em>vidyā</em> are ineditated upon. Still in the state of enjoyment of the fruit of the meditation, the object of enjoyment is <em>Brahman</em> with all his qualities. In the case of the word occurring in the second part of <em>Dvaya</em>, though all qualities may be present, since the aim is to attain Nārāyaṇa with such qualities as are essential for our service to Him whicb arise from His essential nature and from His qualities, the most inportant qualities to be understood are His being the <em>śeṣī</em> and His being capable of affording (perfect) bliss.</p>
<p>In another chapter (in chapter 11 Parikara vibhāga), we have (already) stated that here (in the word Nārāyaṇa in the first part of <em>Dvaya</em>) the determination to do what is agreeable and the avoidance of what is adverse are indicated on account of the relationship (of master and servant) implied in it.</p>
<p>There are some (acharyas) who take <em>Śrīman</em> Nārāyaṇa caraṇau as a single compound word. There are others who take it as three separate words <em>Śrīman</em>!, Nārāyaṇa!, <em>Caraṇau</em> and supply the word tava (Thy) between Nārāyaṇa and caranau. In this interpretation, they have in mind such passages as “  Do not approach those who say these words&rsquo;. &ldquo;O Thou with eyes like the lotus, O <em>Vāsudeva</em>, O <em>Viṣṇu</em>&hellip; &hellip;be Thou my <em>upāya</em>&rdquo;.  May  Thou Thyself be my <em>upāya</em>!&rdquo; and the Tamil verse: &ldquo;O Thou on whose chest resides <em>Lakṣmī</em> who dwells in the lotus &lsquo;O Thou, my Redeemer, I seek Thy feet as my <em>upāya</em> having no other <em>upāya</em> and no other object of attainment&rdquo;, &ldquo;O <em>Śrīman</em> Nārāyaṇa, my Master&rdquo; and other such _mantra_s and also <em>Śaraṇāgati</em> <em>Gadya</em> which is an elaboration of <em>Dvaya</em>. &rsquo; (In all these</p>
<p>instances <em>Bhagavān</em> is addressed in the vocative case and the prayer in the <em>Gadya</em> seeking His protection follows). So also the first part of <em>Dvaya</em> is interpreted thus :- &lsquo;O Thou with <em>Lakṣmī</em> for Thy Spouse, O Nārāyaṇa, I seek Thy feet for refuge,&rsquo; (understanding the word Thy (tava)). Thus, whether we take it as a single compound word or as three separate words, there is no difference in the manner in which the attribute (adjective) <em>Śrī</em> and the substantive Nārāyaṇa stand in relation to each other in the first part of <em>Dvaya</em> and in the second.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF CARAŅAU.</p>
<p>The word Caraṇau means not merely &rsquo;the two feet&rsquo; but by implication, the divinely auspicious form (of the Lord), (which is not of matter or <em>prakṛti</em>). That the Lord of <em>Śrī</em> is the Supreme Deity superior to everyone else and that He is in association with an eternal form are most important among things that should be known. This may be seen from such passages as the following: “He who has the true knowledge that <em>Bhagavān</em> has an eternal form and so also, O Poushkara, that He is superior to everyone else-Him does <em>Bhagavān</em> approach”. Therefore in the word <em>Śrīman</em> Nārāyaṇa, we should bear in mind His being the Supreme Reality that is easily accessible and in the word <em>Caraṇau</em>, His having an eternal fom. Even by those who have no clear idea of the essential nature of the Divine Being (that He is <em>jñāna</em> and <em>ānanda</em>) and that He has the qualities mentioned before-even for them the object of meditation should be the divinely auspicious form which is constituted wholly of Śuddha sattva (and not matter), which, in those who have a knowledge of it, removes the contraction of knowledge (due to past <em>karma</em> ) and which suggests Him as the Supreme Reality and His easy accessibility. Owing to its being the principal (meditation ), (<em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> ) speaks of the divinely auspicious form in the <em>Gadya</em> before stating the qualities. Though Tirum_aṅga_i Alwar had a true knowledge of the essential nature of the Divine Being, yet he spoke of himself as one who does not believe in the Supreme Reality (that is <em>jñāna</em> and <em>ānanda</em> ) like atheists who consider the body as the soul, because of his extreme devotion to the eternal form which is delightful even to <em>Iśvara</em> ( who is <em>jñāna</em> and <em>ānanda</em> ). This idea is expressed in the <em>śloka</em>: “ The divinely auspicious form of <em>Bhagavān</em> is more delightful and more wonderful to Him than His own essential Nature (which is <em>jñāna</em> and <em>ānanda</em>)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The divinely auspicious form of the Supreme Ruler is pure and auspicious (subha ) and is a fit object of meditation (<em>āśraya</em> ) as declared in the following passages : - &ldquo;May I see that holy countenance of <em>Viṣṇu</em> with eyes like lotus in the form which He has assumed of His own will and which, when remembered, removes the sins of men ! &quot; &quot; <em>Śrī</em> Rāma fascinates the eyes of men with the beauty (of his form) and their minds with such qualities as generosity.&rdquo; Those who are in the bondage of <em>samsāra</em> may be objects for meditation (<em>āśraya</em>) but there is no parity or auspiciousness in them. The essential nature ( <em>svarūpa</em> ) of <em>Bhagavān</em> is pure and auspicious but it cannot be an object of meditation.</p>
<p>The pure and essential form of the <em>jīva</em> (free from bondage ) cannot come back to <em>samsāra</em>, since it is without the qualities necessary for doing so; but by its nature, it has in it in the potentiality of being associated with such qualities. Therefore it has not the purity and auspiciousness which are opposed to anything that is of the nature of a blemish, nor can it be a fit object of medi tation. When a released soul (<em>mukta</em>) assumes a form, it can become an object of meditation as also eternal sūris (_nitya_s) who have form, but neither of them has the purity and auspiciousness which can release the baddhas from <em>samsāra</em>. Therefore it is only the divinely auspicious form (of the Lord) which has purity and auspiciousness and the fitness of being an object of meditation, which are both necessary to the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em> :</p>
<p>॥ परावरसुखग्राह्यं प्रेमबोधप्रसावकम् । स्वरूपात् स्वामिनो रूपमुपादेयतमं विदुः ॥</p>
<p>It is known that the ( divinely auspicious) form of the Master is of more importance (to the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>) than His essential nature <em>svarūpa</em>, because it is capable of being grasped easily both by the high (like <em>Brahma</em>) and by the low (like ordinary men ) and because it can produce (in those that contemplate it) <em>bhakti</em>  and južne.</p>
<p>In the sentence prescribing <em>śaraṇāgati</em>, namely, &quot; Seek refuge under me alone&quot;, (<em>caramaśloka</em>) also, the Lord who had assumed</p>
<p>a form appeared as the place of refuge. From the _śāstra_s, it is well known that this dividely auspicious form in the five states <em>Para</em>, Vyūha, <em>Vibhava</em>, Antaryāmī or Hārda and <em>Arcā</em> is pure and auspicious and suitable for meditation.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>॥ चित्तालंबनसौकर्यकृपोत्तंभनतादिभिः । उपायत्वमिह स्वामिपादयोरनुसंहितम् ॥</p>
<p>Here (in the <em>Dvaya</em> ) the feet of the Lord should be meditated on as the <em>upāya</em>, because they ure easier of being grasped by the mind for meditation and have such virtues as raising compassion (in Him ).</p>
<p>The servant resorts to the feet (of the Lord) because of their being extreinely appropriate for resort and because as stated in the saying: &ldquo;It is not possible to withstand the seizure of the feet&rdquo;, they are capable of increasing the compassion of the Lord and also because they have in them the power of affording unique enjoyment as stated in the <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;How can a man who has his mind set on Thy lotus feet which are full of nectar ever desire anything else? Will the bee ever seek the worthless Ikshuraka flower, while the lotus is there full of honey?&rdquo; This idea is well-expressed in the following passages :- &ldquo;I am a suppliant at Thy two feet which protect the gods and the asuras alike&rdquo;. &ldquo;Those lotus feet of the Lord which can secure the state of bliss for me - there is no other thing than they, which, in any of my births, can contribute to my (spiritual) welfare.&rdquo; &ldquo;My <em>upāya</em>&rdquo; is in Thy Two feet”, &ldquo;I give up, O Lord, all _upāya_s and also the desire to enjoy the self (in its freed state) and am a suppliant before Thy feet which once measured the universe&rdquo;, &ldquo;He seized the two feet of his brother (<em>Śrī</em> Rāma) firmly&rdquo;, &ldquo;O my child, I caught the two feet (of the Lord) whose soles are red, which are well-set and which are adorned with toes that are beantiful, tender and rosy (in colour) and bowed with my head, “I have sought” the feet as (my) refuge&rdquo;. &ldquo;He who has sought as an <em>upāya</em>, (for protection) the two feet that destroy the sins of those who perform <em>prapatti</em>&rdquo;. and others. Those who followed this tradition (like Nammalvar and Alavandar) said also :-&ldquo;I was firmly set under Thy feet (for protection )&rdquo;; &ldquo;I have no other <em>upāya</em> and no other object of attainment than Thee and aml a suppliant before Thy feet&rdquo;. (So also) those who were proficient in the _sūtra_s (like Parāśara Bhatta ) said, &quot; Hari has a form full of such qualities as fragrance and tenderness. The means that can secure Him for us are His two feet”.</p>
<p>In the word <em>caraṇau</em> (&lsquo;The two feet) the word &lsquo;alone&rsquo; is implicit in the meaning (i.e. the two feet alone) as in “seek refuge under Him alone by all possible means,&quot; &ldquo;Satagopan who resorted to His feet alone as the <em>upāya</em> and as the object of attainment&rdquo; and &ldquo;The feet of our Lord who lies on the serpent (śeṣa) &mdash;His feet are alone our <em>upāya</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been said, by some who are stupid (manda), that the use of the word <em>caraṇau</em> (the two feet - the dual of charana) is against the interpretation that <em>Bhagavān</em> with <em>Śrī</em> as His attri bute is intended (for in that case &rsquo;the four feet&rsquo; should be the words). This is silly because this objection is refuted by the word _Śrī_mat which distinctly and explicitly states at the very beginning of the sentence &quot; with His attribute <em>Śrī</em>&rdquo;. This indication of the attribute &lsquo;<em>Śrī</em>&rsquo; is first heard in the sentence and cannot therefore be annulled by the dual form, namely, the two feet&rsquo; (which comes later in the sentence). The reasoning which says that the plural form &ldquo;many or four-feet&rdquo; should have been used in that case will appear ridiculous to those who are acquainted with literature, for the dual forn is used, because the husband is the principal factor and his spouse is necessarily associated with him. When an emperor has a spouse, no one would dare to say that he has some one else (as a second ruler). So also, here, a serious staternent has been recklessly made without due reflection,</p>
<p>It may be asked:&ndash;“When the omnipotent Lord becomes the <em>upāya</em>, where is the need for this attribute viz. <em>Śrī</em>? If He needs her, it would follow that He is not omnipotent.&quot; The same objection conld be inade against the qualities (of Nārāyaṇa) and the form (<em>vigraha</em>) (of Nārāyaṇa) which are stated in the words Nārāyaṇa and <em>caraṇau</em> respectively. If it is maintained, in accordance with the _pramāṇa_s, that the qualities and the form are His attributes and that as there is a special efficacy appropriate to them as such, the omnipotence (of the Lord) is not thereby annulled, then the same argument will hold good (in the case of <em>Śrī</em> also) becarise (Her being the <em>upāya</em> along with <em>Bhagavān</em>) has been stated by many authorities (pramaņas) and because in the word _Śrī_mat, <em>Śrī</em>&rsquo;s being the attribute is natural owing to her relationship of being the Spouse.</p>
<p>If, in spite of all this, it is held merely (on the ground of the (dual) <em>caraṇau</em> (the two feet) that the association with <em>Śrī</em> is mere Upalakṣaṇa<sup id="fnref:330"><a href="#fn:330" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">330</a></sup> and does not signify that <em>Śrī</em> is also <em>upāya</em>, then the same thing would have to be said about His association with such things as qualities (and form). If it is held that since the word (<em>caraṇau</em>) is employed along with the word Nārāyaṇa stating that they are the <em>upāya</em>, the one who has the qualities and the form which are necessary for being the <em>upāya</em> is the <em>upāya</em>, the same thing can be said also (of <em>Śrī</em>) here. Such being the case, if it is held that in case <em>Śrī</em> is considered an attribute, it would be against (the Lord&rsquo;s) omnipotence, there would be the same irreconcilability with that onnipotence, in expectiog <em>Śrī</em> to be the mediator (interceding on behalf of the <em>jīva</em>),</p>
<p>Upalakṣaṇa: a mere mark, token or sign to indicate Nārāyaṇa who is recognised by that mark. An Upalakṣaṇa is not an essential feature of the object in question,</p>
<p>It is said in Bhattar&rsquo;s _Śrī_gunaratna-kos&rsquo;am :- &ldquo;Though qualities like youth are common to Thee and <em>Bhagavān</em>, you have divided between yourselves for the sake of enjoyment (certain qualities) &ndash; such qualities as there should be in a man - namely, independence of all others, subjugation of enemies and firmness, in <em>Bhagavān</em>&ndash;and such qualities as there should be in a woman - namely, gentleness, existing only for the sake of the husband, compassion and patience, in Thee”. In accordance with that <em>śloka</em>, when the _jīva_s offend <em>Iśvara</em> who stands supreme in power with the characteristics of the masculine natnre, of the nature of the father and of the ruler exercising control and such others, <em>Lakṣmī</em> who has gentleness, affection and the like becomes the mediator interceding on their behalf. If it is said that this intercession as a mediator is subject to the independent will of the Lord, then it may be said without any contradiction by the _pramāṇa_s that <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s being the <em>Śaraṇya</em> or Protector with his attribute <em>Śrī</em> who participates in the performance of (Her husband&rsquo;s ) duties is also due to His independent will.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD ŚARAṆAM</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here  in <em>Dvayam</em>, the word s&rsquo;aranam which has the meanings <em>upāya</em>, abode and protector denotes only upăya&rdquo;. Since in the above <em>śloka</em>, <em>upāya</em> has been pointed out as the special meaning here, it denotes <em>upāya</em>. .</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em></p>
<p>भरन्यासबलादेव स्वयत्नविनिवृत्तये । अत्रोपायान्तरस्थाने रक्षको विनिवेशितः ॥</p>
<p>By the very nature of bhara_nyāsa_ (the surrender of the burden or responsibility of protection ), the Protector or Saviour is here (in <em>Dvaya</em> ) placed in the position of other _upāya_s, in order that the <em>prapanna</em> may refrain from any effort on his own part.</p>
<p>It may be asked :- When the Supreme Ruler is the means or <em>upāya</em> for attaining the fruit of His worship or adoration performed in accordance with the respective ordinances of the _śāstra_s in the case of every adhikarī or competent person, where is the need for His being specially called the <em>upāya</em> here? The answer is :-&ldquo;It is merely to show that the nature of <em>prapatti</em> is such that <em>Iśvara</em> who is endowed with qualities like natural compassion is placed in it (<em>prapatti</em>) in the position of other _upāya_s.</p>
<p>If it be asked, “Since <em>prapatti</em> is adopted in the place of <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> , why should <em>Iśvara</em> be stated to be &quot; In the place of other _upāya_s&rdquo;? The answer is as follows:- “The fruit (of spiritual striving ) is to be attained by <em>prapatti</em> being adopted as an accessory means or aid and by <em>upāsana</em> or meditation or adoration (<em>bhakti</em> ) being adopted as the main or primary) <em>upāya</em>. When there is no <em>upāsana</em> (or <em>bhakti</em> ), that fruit has to be obtained by means of <em>prapatti</em> alone. This becomes possible only because <em>Iśvara</em> is naturally possessed of such qualities as compassion. That is why it is said that <em>Iśvara</em> stands in the case of the man destitute of _upāya_s, in the position of other _upāya_s. The man who is destitute of _upāya_s ordained for the attainment of the desired fruit and cannot bear the burden or responsibility (of adopting those _upāya_s ) places (<em>Iśvara</em>) who stands as the Protector in the position of other _upāya_s saying: &ldquo;May Thou be my <em>upāya</em>!&rdquo; It means  Instead of placing the burden of adopting other _upāya_s on my shoulders (literally, the head) may the granting of all the desired fruits which could be obtained by bearing that burden be solely Thy burden or responsibility, since Thou art capable and compassionate !&rdquo; Separating this aspect (from others, viz., the accessories), <em>nikṣepa</em> or <em>bharanyāsa</em> is called the primary means or <em>aṅgī</em> (and not the accessory means). This includes the man&rsquo;s being without the responsibility for any effort on his own part. It is in view of this separation of bharasamarpanan (from its _aṅga_s or accessories, viz., the prayer that He should not expect one to do anything for oneself, that the word s&rsquo;aranam is used here only to denote <em>upāya</em>. (From this it would follow that the <em>prapanna</em> is care-free thereafter in regard to his protection.)</p>
<p>In some places the prayer to <em>Iśvara</em> to be the <em>upāya</em> and riikshepa or bhara_nyāsa_ are spoken of separately ( as if they were different, though, in reality, they are not different). This should be understood as being due to one of three reasons: (1) The word <em>upāya</em> is (then) used to mean only the prayer for protection without including the prayer that <em>Iśvara</em> should be in the place of other _upāya_s which can be expected of the <em>prapanna</em>. (2) It may be to distinguish <em>bharasamarpaṇam</em> and the like distinctly and separately from the prayer for being the <em>upāya</em> or (3) Since the samarpanam or surrender is of three things viz., <em>svarūpa</em> (essential nature), bhara (responsibility for protection) and phala (or the fruit to be attained), every one of them has to be stated as different from the other two. Therefore none of these can be said to be redundant, (The prayer for <em>Iśvara</em> being the <em>upāya</em> refers to bhara; and the word <em>nikṣepa</em> refers to <em>svarūpa</em>).</p>
<p>This aspect of <em>Iśvara</em> being the <em>upāya</em> should be understood as the peculiar feature of Nyāsa <em>vidyā</em>. (<em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s) <em>jñāna</em>, power, and the like also appear in as much as they are required for this purpose.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD PRAPADYE:</p>
<p>Since verbs meaning &rsquo;to go&rsquo; or &rsquo;to move&rsquo; mean also to have a knowledge of&rsquo; or &rsquo;to know, the root pad in the word prapadye, which means &rsquo;to go&rsquo; means, here the specific knowledge required in this context. The knowledge, here, is the sure knowledge or faith that the Lord will save (us). Since faith which is the most important of the accessories or _aṅga_s (to <em>prapatti</em>) is referred to here, the <em>Sādhyopāya</em> with all its accessories is indicated here. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows:- The preposition pra (in prapadye) discloses the greatness or intensity of the faith which is its excellence. This excellence or intensity of faith would arise only when one bears in mind the mediatorship (of <em>Lakṣmī</em>) and one&rsquo;s relationship with the Lord, the Lord&rsquo;s qualities and the like (form) which are respectively present in the words (_Śrī_mat) and Nārāyaṇa. By this intensity of faith, all doubts arising from the greatness of one&rsquo;s offences will disappear. This intensity of faith is necessary as stated in the <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;The Rākṣasas had no confidence in (the effectiveness of) the <em>Brahma</em> missile (astra ) with which Hanuman was bound. The result was that that missile which would never fail of its purpose became loose immediately. In the same way, if men had no faith in the efficacy of <em>prapatti</em>, it would be the same as if it had not been performed at all. Therefore <em>prapatti</em> gives <em>mokṣa</em> soon to those who have faith in it&rdquo;. The potency of this certainty of belief is well known from the following passages :- &ldquo;If a man has no faith, he can never approach that Supreme <em>Brahman</em>&rdquo;, and “Hari is ever present in all those who have no doubts. The Lord of <em>Lakṣmī</em> (Mādhava ) is never present in those who doubt as a r&rsquo;esult of their reasoning or logic&quot;. If this intense faith is present, doubts will never arise during any inquiry into <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s qualities and the like). Therefore intensity of faith at the first moment (of performing <em>prapatti</em>) which would never permit of later doubts is an accessory or <em>aṅga</em> of <em>prapatti</em>. Even if it is weak, <em>Iśvara</em> who has begun to show His special grace will make it full and perfect&quot;. Has not the Saviour graciously stated: “I will never give up the man who has come to me in the guise of a friend, whatever might happen&rsquo;? Is not His grace of such a nature as is described in the <em>śloka</em>, about such things as even anjali :- &ldquo;If a man has folded his hands in worship to Thy feet at any time and in any manner, it will destroy all his sins at that very instant and lead to the attainment of good things. It will never prove futile&rdquo;. Therefore even weakness of faith will grow into deep and intense faith (in those who have performed <em>prapatti</em> with all its _aṅga_s).</p>
<ul>
<li>On this expression of intense faith stating, &ldquo;I have made up my mind to beg Thee for being my <em>upāya</em>&rdquo;, the prayer (to <em>Iśvara</em> ) to be the <em>upāya</em> may be taken here as having been made and this would be in accordance with the following _pramāṇa_s: &quot; When what a man desires cannot be attained with the help of any one else, a prayer is made, with intense faith, to one who has the required ability (to secure the object desired) that he should be the means or <em>upāya</em>. This prayer is <em>prapatti</em>; it is s&rsquo;aranagati!&rsquo;. &ldquo;The thoughts of praying:&mdash; &ldquo;May Thou alone be my <em>upāya</em>!” this is <em>śaraṇāgati</em>. Let this be done towards <em>Bhagavān</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;Those who say to Hari: “Be Thou my <em>upāya</em>&rdquo;- never approach them”. The <em>aṅga</em> or accessory called &quot; seeking protectorship” is contained within this and is not separate or different from this.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be asked:&ndash;&rdquo; What is the prayer in this first part of <em>Dvaya</em> for? Since in the second part, there is a prayer for the attainment of the desired end and the removal of hindrances there. to, the prayer here cannot be for the same as, in that case, there would be repetition or redundancy. When <em>prapatti</em> is adopted as an <em>aṅga</em> or accessory, the prayer might be said to be for <em>bhakti</em>  as an <em>upāya</em>; but here, since <em>prapatti</em> is adopted as a direct and independent means, there cannot be any <em>upāya</em> which can be acquired and for which a prayer could be made ( what, then, can this prayer be for?)&quot;. The answer to this question is as follows:- &ldquo;The award of the desired fruit which finds a place (in the second part of <em>Dvaya</em> ) is common to all adhikārīs, whatever be the <em>upāya</em> (<em>bhakti</em>  or <em>prapatti</em>) that they adopt. Since <em>prapatti</em> is not an <em>aṅga</em> or accessory for any other <em>upāya</em> in the case of one who is destitute of any other <em>upāya</em> and who makes a surrender of every. thing (<em>svarūpa</em> - bhara . and phala), its superiority (to other _upāya_s ) consists in the Saviour Himself standing in the place of the <em>upāya</em> and granting the fruit or desired end. Therefore what is prayed for here is the point that <em>Iśvara</em> should accept the responsibility of protection (bharasvīkāra ). But it may be asked again :- &quot; Will not this prayer that the Lord should stand as the <em>upāya</em> mean the same as a prayer that He should grant the desired fruit or object withont any other <em>upāya</em> being required as a further condition coming in between? In that case will not the prayer in the second part of <em>Dvaya</em> be redundant!&rdquo; The answer to this question is as follows:- Since in the prayer of the above description (in the second part), what is required is stated separately because it is different in some points from the expectation in the prayer (in the first part), there is no redundancy; [(i.e.) in the prayer for <em>Iśvara</em> being the <em>upāya</em>, there is no expectation of any fruit except that He should be the <em>upāya</em> ; in the prayer in the second part there is expectation of the desired fruit] . It may also be explained thus: though the word signifying prayer (bhaveyam) has to be supplied in order to make the second part a complete sentence, in the first part praying for <em>Iśvara</em> becoming the <em>upāya</em>, the fruit is asked for, but in a general way, while, in the second part, the purport is to specify the nature of that fruit.</p>
<p>The sum and substance of the first and the second parts, when duly determined, will amount to saying this :- &ldquo;I am destitute of all _upāya_s; therefore in order that Thou mayst stand in the place of these upãyas and grant me the specific end that is desired, I surrender the responsibility for the protection of myself as stated ( in the _śāstra_s)&rdquo;. Thus it (the <em>Dvaya</em>) is a surrender of the responsibility (for protection) accompanied by a special prayer. This surrender, too, is the meaning of prapadye which indicates resolution (I resolve). We have (already) proved in many places with the help of _pramāṇa_s and on the authority of traditional practice that the surrender of responsibility with all its accessories is the gist of the _śāstra_s on <em>prapatti</em> (vide chapters 11 and 12 on Parikaravibhāga and Sāṅgaprapadana).</p>
<p>The primary importance of the <em>nikṣepa</em> (surrender) which is stated in another <em>mantra</em> for the performing of <em>prapatti</em> is the same here also, namely: &ldquo;By this <em>mantra</em> alone should a man surrender himself to me. He who has thus surrendered what ought to be surrendered will become one who has done what he ought to do&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The first person singular in prapadye (I resolve) which shows one to be the doer, proves that the way to win the favour of <em>Siddhopāya</em> (<em>Iśvara</em>), who has the gift of <em>mokṣa</em> in His power, is some form of <em>vyāja</em> (<em>bhakti</em>  or <em>prapatti</em>) which can be accomplished by the aspirant to <em>mukti</em> in accordance with the _śāstra_s.</p>
<p>In this (the first part of <em>Dvaya</em>) the specific adhikārī or competept person for the performance and the idea of helplessness (<em>kārpaṇya</em>), which is one of the accessories or <em>aṅga_s of <em>prapatti</em>, are also hinted at as in the following passages:&ndash; I  who have no other <em>upāya</em> and no other Saviour&quot; etc. &ldquo;I am the &ldquo;abode of all offences: I have no means or <em>upāya</em> for saving myself and have nothing else to attain than Thee.&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have &ldquo;not been firmly established in the performance of <em>dharma</em> (i.e. I have not performed <em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em> ;) neither have I realised the essential nature ( <em>svarūpa</em>) of myself (i, e. I have not perfornued <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em> : nor have I devotion to Thy lotus feet lie. I have not performed <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em>&rdquo;. This is elaborated by <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> in the <em>Śaraṇāgati</em> <em>Gadya</em> in the words, &ldquo;Having no other refuge or Saviour&rdquo; and in the little <em>Gadya</em> (<em>Śrī</em> R_aṅga</em> <em>Gadya</em>) in the churņikā, which says, &ldquo;My soul is eternally subject to Thy control and likewise in the cūrṇikā in Vaikuṇṭhagadya where he says, &lsquo;I realise that, in order to attain Him, I have no other means, even in thousands of crores of kalpas (1000 yugas), than seeking His two lotus feet&rdquo;. Arulalapperumal Emperumanar, too, has declared: &ldquo;The man who, owing to his powerlessness, has not the required <em>upāya</em> or means for attaining <em>Bhagavān</em> which is the end desired by him that man should realise with faith that His feet are the <em>upāya</em> for securing his object&rdquo; Since <em>prapatti</em> ordains, as an <em>upāya</em>, the surrender of the responsibility for protection (bharasamarpana) which is adapted to the adhikārī who is destitute of _upāya_s, it goes without saying (from the very logic of the matter) that it does not require the performance of any other action which is too hard (for him) to perform.</p>
<p>Thus in the word prapadye (I resolve to seek ) accompanied by the word saranam (refuge), four accessories may be considered as having been indicated: the faith that (the Lord) will protect, and so also seeking Him as the Saviour, the surrender of the self and (one&rsquo;s) helplessness (<em>kārpaṇya</em>). We have already stated that the word Nārāyaṇa with its adjective (_Śrī_mat) declares such things as <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s being the Master in accordance with such authoritative texts as the following:-&ldquo;All beings, those that move and those that do not move, are the body of <em>Bhagavān</em>. Therefore I should do what is good for them&rdquo;. This determination is the sixth <em>aṅga</em> and &ldquo;The fifth <em>aṅga</em> is the avoidance of what is displeasing to the Master.&rdquo; Therefore His being the Master suggests the determination to do what is agreeable (to Him ) and the avoidance of what is disagreeable (to Him). In another chapter we have stated that these accessories, too, are to be thought of only once for the sake of the <em>upāya</em> (namely : <em>prapatti</em>). The use of the present tense in the verb (prapadye) is, like (the use of present tense in the verb occurring in) the <em>mantra</em> uttered while cutting kus&rsquo;a grass, to indicate the time when the <em>prapatti</em> is performed. (It does not mean, as the present tense sometimes ineans, that it should be done always). The views ( held by some ) that the present tense (in prapadye) shows that the intention is to enjoin the continuous performance of <em>prapatti</em> until the end of the present body, that it enjoins the continuance of faith which is one of the accessories until the fruit is attained and that it shows also the need for the continuance of such things as the determination to do what is agreeable (to the Lord) even after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, as its accessories&ndash;thesc views are opposed to the _pramāṇa_s which lay down (the rule) that this <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) with its accessories should be performed only once.</p>
<p>If they (viz. the accessories described above) continue (even after the performance of <em>prapatti</em> because of the excessive eagerness to attain the object and of their being enjoyable, it does not follow that this continuance is part and parcel of the <em>upāya</em> adopted in the first part (of <em>Dvaya</em>), Therefore the use of the present tense in this sentence (in <em>Dvaya</em>) which states the <em>upāya</em> does not refer to the continuance of uttering the <em>Dvaya</em> for the sake of the enjoyment arising from love which is expressed in <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s <em>Gadya</em> (namely - uttering the <em>Dvaya</em> always with an understanding of its meaning), (The meaning is: as an <em>upāya</em> a single performance or utterance will do; but when ove finds it enjoyable, the <em>Dvaya</em> may be repeatedly uttered).</p>
<p>Thus the first part of <em>Dvaya</em> discloses the Lord&rsquo;s being the Saviour of all, the essential nature or <em>svarūpa</em> of <em>śaraṇāgati</em>, its accessories and the nature of the person qualified for its performance. From this it is evident also that the <em>jīva</em> has no other <em>upāya</em>.</p>
<p>THE SECOND PART OF DVAYA:</p>
<p><em>Śaraṇāgati</em> which has been thus described (in the first part; is capable of securing all desired ends, for it has been stated :&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only so long as <em>prapatti</em> which can remove all sins has not been performed towards Thee, only so long will there be misery caused by the loss of wealth and the apxiety to regain it; only so long will there be the desire to win wealth, only so long will there be no realisation of the self being different from the body; only so long will there be the suffering of <em>samsāra</em>.&rdquo; Further the Saviour is supremely generous; “Is there any other who is so generous as He and who can grant whatever is desired ?&rdquo; He stands ever ready with the determination to grant whatever is desired by the suppliants, for it has been said: &ldquo;If we receive any thing from the Lord, He does not lose anything thereby. He will give us whatever we ask.” (Such being the case) the question arises: &ldquo;What is the object or end for which <em>prapatti</em> should be performed?* The second part of <em>Dvaya</em>, (as if in answer to this question), prays for that object (end or fruit), which would be in keeping with the Saviour who is supremely generous, in keeping with this special <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) which can secure the favour of One who is superior to all others, and in keeping with one&rsquo;s own essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) which will find its sole delight only in being His <em>śeṣa</em>. As expressed in the passage: &ldquo;The only end which I seek is that the Lord should take me as His servant for His own pleasure&rdquo;, the second part prays for this desired end (namely, service to the Lord ), including the removal of all hindrances to it. From this it also follows that the <em>jīva</em> should have no other interest or object.</p>
<p>In this context, the word Nārāyaṇa with the attribute qualifying it (viz. _Śrī_mat) discloses, primarily and in accordance with the _pramāṇa_s, the Lord&rsquo;s being the Master and the like and so also the unsurpassed enjoyability of the Master who has countless qualities and the two _vibhūti_s (glories ) which make Him fit to be the object of attainment.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD _ŚRĪ_MATE (IN THE</p>
<p>SECOND PART OF DVAYA):</p>
<p>Though <em>Bhagavān</em> who is thus endowed with the two vibhūtis (<em>Līlā</em> and <em>Nitya</em>) is the object of attainment, the word _Śrī_mate (with <em>Śrī</em>) is employed here to show that, for the offering of the <em>havis</em> of the self, the intended recipients, are both the Lord and His Spouse. They are (the two) to whom we are <em>śeṣa_s and consequently (the two) to whom our service is due. Primarily they are (therefore) the objects of attainment. This idea is implicit also in the following and other passages :- &quot; <em>Bhagavān</em>, the Lord of the world, is in the glorious world called <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em> with <em>Lakṣmī</em>&rdquo;; &quot; <em>Bhagavān</em> who is seated on the serpent Ādi_śeṣa</em> with his Spouse&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord is seated with <em>Lakṣmī</em> who is (in every way) suited to Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;At the sight of Thee and Thy consort with her shining bracelets standing together (as the Rulers of the world)” “<em>Lakṣmī</em> whose beauty fascinates even Thee &ldquo;, etc.</p>
<p>Though the word <em>Śrī</em> used here has several meanings as stated in the following _śloka_s: &quot; She dispels all blemishes; generates good qualities in those who are in the world; is attained by all at all times and has herself attained the Supreme Object of attainment (<em>Bhagavān</em>)&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s Spouse who has aitained the Lord and is attained by others and who dispels all blemishes and listens to the cry of the distressed &quot; &ndash; (though the word has all these meanings) yet, here, it denotes the person who is entitled to (our) service as it is derived from the verbal root <em>Śrī</em> which means ‘Service&rsquo;.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF NĀRĀYAŅĀYA:</p>
<p>Though the word _Śrī_mate by itself denotes <em>Bhagavān</em> and His Spouse who are entitled to our service, yet the word Narayaņa is employed here to indicate the full and perfect enjoyment (anubhava) of the association of a <em>śeṣa</em> to the <em>śeṣī</em>, and of His qualities and glories (_vibhūti_s ); for this enjoyment ( alone) will generate the kind of love which is essential for all forms of service. Here the dative (or fourth case) which means for Nāriyana (existing for Ilim) refers thereby to service, &lsquo;Existing for Him&rsquo; is in itself an eternal fact (and need not be prayed for). Therefore what is to be prayed for here is service (to Them) preceded by full and perfect enjoyinent as stated in the following _śloka_s and elsewhere : “ Hereafter I should bear in mind the fact of my being His <em>śeṣa</em> and render service to Him: This is the meaning of <em>namas</em>.&rdquo; &quot; Whether you are awake or asleep, I (Lakshmuana ) will perform all kinds of service to You&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since the <em>jīva</em> while performing saraņagati (with this <em>mantra</em>) is praying to the Savionr for what he desires, a word like bhaveyam (may I be) has to be supplied: Śrimate Nārāyaṇāya bhaveyam (May I be for Nārāyaṇa !) Thus, at first, the attainment of the desired end (service to the Lord) is prayed for as being the more important; thereafter, by the word <em>namas</em>, the removal of all hindrances (to salvation and to service) is prayed for.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em> :</p>
<p>अप्राप्तितःपरिहरन्स्वपरैस्स्वरक्षां</p>
<p>तादर्त्थ्यधीपरिहृतस्वपरार्थभावः ।</p>
<p>अन्योपभोगविरहादनघः प्रपन्नो</p>
<p>भुङ्क्ते स्वभोगमखिलं पतिभोगशेषम् ॥</p>
<p>Giving up the idea of his salvation by himself or by others as impossible and giving up the idea of his existing either for himself or for others by the thought that lie exists (only) for the Lord and having become free from all sins by his aversion to all other objects of enjoyment than the Lord), the <em>prapanna</em> enjoys all his bliss as something which is accessory to the Lord&rsquo;s enjoyment.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD NAMAS &ndash;</p>
<p>Here, after the word <em>namas</em>, the verb has to be supplied so that it becomes na mama syām, which means, &ldquo;Let me not be for myself.&rdquo; Or it may be looked upon as na mama kiñcit syāt meaning, &lsquo;Let there be (in me) no notion at all of the sense of &lsquo;mine&rsquo; (mamakāra)&rsquo;, which would be a prayer for the removal of all hindrances or undesirable things, as it asks for the disappearance of the notion of mine&rsquo; in regard to all objects. The objections raised and the answers given thereto in regard to the attainment of the desired end and the disappearance of all undesirable elements in the case of Tiru_mantra_ should be borne in mind here (also).</p>
<p>Though this word <em>namas</em> prays for the removal of all such hindrances as <em>avidyā</em> (ignorance), <em>karma</em> , the impressions and inclinations which have resulted therefrom (vāsanas), the ruchi or tastes and the association with <em>prakṛti</em> or matter, yet it is considered (by some āchāryas) that, in accordance with the <em>śruti</em><sup id="fnref:331"><a href="#fn:331" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">331</a></sup> which gives the etymological interpretation of this word (<em>namas</em>), the purport or ain here (in the second part of <em>Dvaya</em>) is the removal, in the state of attaining full and perfect service in <em>mukti</em>, of the weeds of one&rsquo;s being the doer by one&rsquo;s own will and of one&rsquo;s being the doer for one&rsquo;s own purposes and, likewise, of one&rsquo;s being the enjoyer by one&rsquo;s own will and of being the enjoyer solely for oneself. This weed or wrong notion is likely to arise because, in regard to the enjoyment of the fruit elsewhere (in <em>svarga</em>), the thought is present that the fruit was won by one by one&rsquo;s own actions and is enjoyed by one for oneself. From this it would follow that the man performing <em>prapatti</em> understands that, in regard to the service in the state of <em>mukti</em>, there are no such wrong notions as one&rsquo;s being the doer and the enjoyer by one&rsquo;s owo will and for the sake of oneself-notions which are present in the state of enjoyment of other fruits (like those in <em>svarga</em>). Having understood this, the man performing prapatli makes his prayer in conformity with this knowledge.</p>
<p>The Sruti says: Whatever actions may appear mine are the Lord&rsquo;s, not mine, They do not belong to me; they are the Lord&rsquo;s; I exist for the Lord and not for myself na mama ( not mine; not for me)</p>
<p>Arulalapperumal emperumanar commented on the word <em>namas</em> occurring here by the following <em>śloka</em> :&mdash; &quot; The wise say that <em>namas</em> means the state of being carefree without expecting any help (of being without any responsibility in regard to oneself) _nairapekṣya_m which results from the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s surrendering all his burdens to the Supreme Being.&rdquo; The _nairapekṣya_m referred to in that <em>śloka</em> is being carefree or having no expectation or requirements without the sense of responsibility in regard to one&rsquo;s salvation. From this freedom from responsibility, we should realise that either bharasamarpaņam is suggested here, (since there cannot be the state of being carefree without it) or that the surrender of the bhara to the extent of one&rsquo;s being carefree is intended. If we take the latter part of <em>Dvaya</em> to be &quot; Aham Śrīmate Narāyaņāya&quot; . (I am for <em>Śrīman</em> Nārāyaṇa ) and consider it to be the offering of the self along with the bhara or burden of protection, and that thereafter na mama declares one&rsquo;s having no connection with oneself, as, when an offering is made (to the gods), it is said “This is for Indra and not for me&quot;, if we take it in this forn, it will be extremely appropriate for this interpretation of the whole of <em>Dvaya</em> being a statement of bharasamarpana. In this interpretation the first part of <em>Dvaya</em> is about the file _aṅga_s or accessories, while the second part states the <em>aṅgī</em>, which is <em>prapatti</em>. When the offering or surrender is made saying: &ldquo;I am for Nārāyaṇa&rsquo; as in the s&rsquo;loka &ldquo;I who realise that I am Thy <em>śeṣa</em> surrender myself here and now at Thy two lotus feet&rdquo;. &mdash; (when this surrender is made), it would imply that the responsibility of one&rsquo;s protection and the fruit arising from one&rsquo;s protection are Nārāyaṇa&rsquo;s as stated in the following passages : &ldquo;When the question arises to whom the surrender of the self is made for the sake of salvation or protection, the answer is given &ldquo;To <em>Viṣṇu</em>&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I am Thy  responsibility (bhara) (in regard to protection)&rdquo;. This <em>namas</em> discloses the severance of all connection between a man and his self and what belongs to him and also between himself and his protection and the fruit resulting from it.</p>
<p>The (fourth or ) dative case of Nārāyaṇa and the word <em>namas</em> have, each, its significance, in as much as they indicate respectively the declaration of one&rsquo;s connexion with the Supreme Being and the denial of one&rsquo;s connection with oneself. It may also be that <em>namas</em> denies such things as one&rsquo;s being a doer not subject to the will of the Supreme Being. Even if we take the simple and ordipary meaning of <em>namas</em> as namami (I bow to Nārāyaṇa,&rdquo; it would be in keeping with the meaning &quot; I surrender&rdquo; as the word namāmi l I bow) has been commented upon in _Mantra_rājapada stotra as meaning &lsquo;for the surrender of the self&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Thus in the case of those who consider on the latter part of Duaya as indicating the surrender of the self, the special kind of fruit or end (namely <em>kaiṅkarya</em>) arises of itself (without the need for stating it), as it is in conformity with the surrender of the self and consistent with one&rsquo;s essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>). In the caso of those who interpret on the latter part as indicating the fruit or object of attainment (namely, <em>kaiṅkarya</em>) as explained before, the idea of the surrender of the responsibility for protection should be considered as being present in the first part which treats of the <em>upāya</em> in the verb (prapadye) being taken along with the word saranam (<em>upāya</em>).</p>
<p>THE PURPORT OF DVAYA:</p>
<p>Thus, in <em>Dvaya</em>, in the different words, by the nature of the Words actually used and of the meaning which is implicit (without being actually stated in words), the following principal points as well as what is required for them stand revealed:- (<em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s ) association with the mediator (<em>Lakṣmī</em>), this (association) being eternal, <em>Śrī</em> being included in the upãya along (with <em>Bhagavān</em>), the Saviour being full and perfect in His qualities, the particular form of relationship between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>Iśvara</em>, (that of being the body and the soul respectively and that of being <em>śeṣa</em> and <em>śeṣī</em>), <em>Iśvara</em> having a divine and auspicions form, the <em>śeṣa</em> making his approach to the Lord, in this divine form, how (the divine and auspicious form of the Lord) becomes the <em>upāya</em>; the manner of winning the Lord&rsquo;s grace, its accessories, the adhikārī competent for adopting the <em>upāya</em>; how the end to be attained is the Lord with His attribute <em>Śrī</em>, how the object of attainment (the Lord) is endowed with qualities and _vibhūti_s (glories), how the Lord and <em>Śrī</em> are the recipients entitled to (our) service, the prayer for perforniing this service, the attainment of all forms of service, the removal of all that is undesirable, their utter and complete removal, the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s being the doer subject to the will of the Supreme Being and for His purposes, the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s being the enjoyer (in <em>mokṣa</em>) subject to the Lord&rsquo;s will and by way of his enjoyment being accessory to the Lord&rsquo;s enjoyment. And these are recalled in <em>Dvaya</em> along with two principal things which are intended to be stated, namely, (1) the <em>upāya</em> which is siddha (viz. the Lord with <em>Śrī</em>), the <em>upāya</em> which is sadhya (viz. <em>prapatti</em>) and (2) the object of attainment which is siddha (namely, the Lord with <em>Śrī</em>) and the object of attainment which is sadhya (namely <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service).</p>
<p>Thus in this gem of a <em>mantra</em> (<em>Dvaya</em>), the Supreme Reality (the Lord of <em>Śrī</em>), the special <em>upāya</em> (for attaining it), (namely <em>prapatti</em>) and the desired end or fruit (namely-enjoyment and <em>kaiṅkarya</em>) are taught as in the Sariraka <em>śāstra</em> (<em>Brahma</em> <em>Sūtra_s) (i.e. in the order in which they are treated there). In <em>Dvaya</em> the order of words follows the order in which the <em>upāya</em> and its fruit occur (i.e.) the <em>upāya</em> is stated first and the fruit is stated thereafter (as the former produces the latter). However, as in the <em>mantra</em> (taught) in the Svetās&rsquo;vatara (upanishad) viz. “Desirous of <em>mokṣa</em> I seek Thy protection),&quot; the important point is the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> preceded by a desire for the fruit (aimed at); former (ācharyas) have explained that, following the logical (or psychological order), the sentence stating the fruit (namely, enjoyment and <em>kaiṅkarya</em>) should be thought of first. For is it not a fact that a man would never study the nature of an <em>upāya</em> and adopt it without previously studying the nature of the end to be attained thereby?. So also in the Tiru_mantra</em>, the order of</p>
<p>meditation should be as stated above in regard to the <em>upāya</em>, and the fruit thereof. It is only if he desires the fruit and is (also) competent, that the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> would follow.</p>
<p>The words of learned men such as &ldquo;One shonld seek (the Lord&rsquo;s) protection with (the utterance) of <em>Dvaya</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;The <em>śaraṇāgati</em> which is stated in <em>Dvaya</em> consists in the faith that to attain Nārāyaṇa with <em>Śrī</em>, His two lotus feet are the <em>upāya</em>&rdquo; - (these words) also show that <em>Dvaya</em> reveals the adoption of the <em>upāya</em>.</p>
<p>THE SUMMARY OF THE MEANING OF DVAYA:&ndash;</p>
<p>Although here (in <em>Dvaya</em>), the first part, the words ending with the dative (or fourth) case and the <em>namas</em> - (although) these three are three separate sentences, yet it should be construed as a single sentence with the <em>upāya</em> as the primary purpose. This is how it should be construed):</p>
<p>The sum and substance of <em>Dvaya</em> is this:- &ldquo;At the feet of Nārāyaṇa who is the Lord of all, who is, in everyway and supremely blissful (or enjoyable) and who is inseparable from <em>Lakṣmī</em> and in order that I may obtain the removal of all that is opposed to all kinds of service in all places, at all times and in all states or circumstances and to receive (the privilege of) full and perfect service to T&rsquo;hem, I, who am destitute of _upāya_s, surrender the responsibility of the protection of myself with the accompaniment of the five _aṅga_s or accessories at the feet of Nārāyaṇa, so that I may not have anything to do for such things as the responsibility for protecting myself.</p>

<p>In order to afford salvation to all the beings created with one mind by Himself and <em>Lakṣmī</em> of shining bracelets, He became the son of <em>Vāsudeva</em> so that the beautiful city of Dwaraka might prosper. He was then pleased to be the charioteer of the princes (the Pandavas) and He has become for us the unique <em>dharma</em> (<em>Siddhopāya</em> ) which He, with Tulasi flowers adorning His chest, has Himself declared to us and puts a stop to the game of blind-man&rsquo;s buff which stood in the way of our seeing, enjoying and bearing His feet (in <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em>) on our head.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION TO CARAMA ŚLOKA</p>
<p>This Nārāyaṇa, the Lord of <em>Śrī</em>, who abides (for ever in the ocean of milk has left His serpent-bed and arrived at the city of Madhura.&rdquo; As stated in this <em>śloka</em>, the Supreme Ruler, the Lord of <em>Śrī</em>, incarnated in the beautiful city of Dwaraka in order to protect the good, to destroy the wicked and to establish <em>dharma</em> on a firm footing; He became easily accessible to everyone, and assumed the role of a messenger to the Pandavas who had sought His protection, as stated in the passage : &ldquo;On being thus advised, the sons of Pritha and the twins made namaskarams to <em>Janārdana</em>, O best of men, along with Draupadi.&rdquo; He made Arjuna the warrior in the chariot and acted as his charioteer to do his bidding. This Arjuna realised that the Lord of all had determined to slay his enemies using him as a (mere) instrument, and that the destruction of his kinsmen was certain. He became troubled in mind by inopportune affection and inopportune compassion and by the fear that the slaying of his ācharyas and others, though they appeared (against him) in war-like trim, was a sin. So he wanted to know what was the proper thing for him to do and begged (<em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa) saying, &ldquo;Be pleased to tell me what, you feel sure, is to my lasting benefit. I am your disciple and have sought your protection. Therefore advise me as to what I should do”. In order to dispel his grief, the Lord explained to him the eternal and essential nature of the soul or self (ātman) which is different from the body and the like (the senses etc.) and likewise <em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em> and jnānu <em>yoga</em>, which are, to the man who understands this essential nature, the mediate means for attaining the supreme goal and also <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em> which has been enjoined as the primary and direct means of attaining it, as also all its accessories. Though Arjuna was eager to attain this supreme end quickly, he thought it too hard to perform it (<em>bhakti</em> -<em>yoga</em>) with all its accessories and though he had the knowledge and the ability needed for its adoption, he realised that the nature of this <em>upāya</em> was such that it would secure</p>
<p>the end in view only after a very long period of adoption and after unceasing attention and that the end in view could not be attained quickly, So Arjuna became overwhelmed with despair. Under the guise of teaching Arjuna, the ācārya of the Gitopanishad is graciously pleased, out of His infinite compassion, to explain this most secret <em>upāya</em> (viz. <em>prapatti</em>) in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> which is the conclusion of the teaching and which leaves nothing unsaid. <em>Prapatti</em> which is one of the _upāya_s that be enjoined as optional in the <em>śloka</em>: &ldquo;I can be attained by those who desire to serve me only by <em>bhakti</em>  or by <em>prapatti</em>. There is no other way of attaining ine&rdquo;, is the means alike, of attaining His feet and all other things that are desired, for it has been said, “Only so long as <em>prapatti</em> which extinguishes all sins is not performed, only so long will there be suffering, etc.&rdquo; It can be performed without any accessories other than the determination to do what is agreeable to the Lord and the avoidance of what is adverse to Him and the like. It is easier of performance and can be done in just an instant. Since the Supreme Lord, who is the Saviour, has Himself taught this truth which is well known from the _śruti_s, it has also the sanction of the ācārya (for <em>Bhagavān</em> is Himself the ācārya here). The permission of the ācārya is prescribed in such treatises as <em>Viṣṇutattva</em> as follows: - &ldquo;Giving up all object of desire and the karmas by which they can be secured, <em>Śaraṇāgati</em> with its five _aṅga_s (the _aṅga_s and the <em>aṅgī</em> being six ) should be performed with the permission of the ācārya in accordance with the rules prescribed in the _śāstra_s and with renunciation of the fruits of all actions.”</p>
<p>_SARVADHARMĀN ETC._page526</p>
<p>We have refuted, at considerable length, in Tātparyachandrikā and <em>Nikṣepa</em>-rakshā, the interpretations given of this <em>śloka</em> by such perverse (commentators ) as Sankara. Here we will state the best and most appropriate meanings as established in the tradition of wise men. The first half of this (<em>śloka</em>) enjoins the</p>
<p><em>upāya</em>, the second half is the <em>śeṣa</em> which is subordinate or supplementary to it by way of indication of the end to be attained (by that <em>upāya</em>). Therefore the main purport of this <em>śloka</em> is to prescribe the <em>upāya</em>. <em>Dharma</em> is a means of attaining an object which can be understood solely from the <em>śāstra</em>. The use of the plural form, <em>dharmān</em>, indicates the manifold nature of the _dharma_s enjoined in the <em>Śāstra</em> as the means of attaining the desired objects or ends. The word sarva (all) suggests that (these _dharma_s) have certain accessories or _aṅga_s. There is certainly no impropriety in calling the accessories to <em>dharma</em> by the word <em>dharma</em>. If (on the other hand) we interpret the word sarva (all) as the opposite of &lsquo;one&rsquo;, it would indicate the manifoldness of the _aṅgī_s (the _dharma_s themselves).</p>
<p>Though the word <em>dharma</em> is used without any qualification or restriction, yet what is intended (by the word) here is the various kinds of <em>upāsana</em>, or ineditation prescribed for the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em> in the _śāstra_s with all their accessories (such kinds of meditation as dahara <em>vidyā</em>, sadvidyā and <em>Śāṇḍilyavidyā</em>). The knowledge of <em>Puruṣottama</em> (which is praised highly in the Gitā (Chap. XI) is conclusively shown in (<em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s) Gitābhāṣya and elsewhere as leading merely to the knowledge of the Truth or Reality which is of help to all vidyās or forms of meditation; the knowledge of the truth concerning the avatārs (of <em>Bhagavān</em>) is shown in Ch. IV there as the cause of the adopted upāsanas yielding their fruit quickly, residence in places where there are temples of Nārāyaṇa and the like are also shown to make the _upāsana_s effective by the removal or extinction of those sins which stand in the way of the _upāsana_s bearing fruit. Therefore it is not proper to consider them as direct and primary means of attaining <em>mokṣa</em> and to state that the plural form of <em>dharma</em>, viz, dharmān is used to include these also, (for they are only mediate culises of <em>mokṣa</em> and not direct causes like the _upāsanā_s). This plural form dharmān is significant in as much as it refers to such different and many vidyās, as Śāṇḍilya <em>vidyā</em> and dahara <em>vidyā</em> even without the three mentioned above ((viz) the knowledge of <em>Puruṣottama</em> and of the avatars and residence in holy places , for it has been said  “The vidyās are many, as their names and the like are different;&rdquo; there is no impropriety even if we take the plural to signify the manifoldness of the <em>aṅgī</em>&rsquo;s (forms of meditation) and of the _aṅga_s or their accessories.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF PARITYAJYA (HAVING GIVEN UP). page528</p>
<p>ln the word <em>parityajya</em>, the &lsquo;giving up&rsquo; or abandonment consists in the aversion to other kinds of <em>upāya</em> (than <em>prapatti</em>), which arises from a consideration of one&rsquo;s being destitute of the competency for them, for it has been said, &ldquo;By this &lsquo;<em>prapatti</em> and with only <em>ākiñcanya</em> or one&rsquo;s being without other _upāya_s as a prerequisite etc)&rdquo;. If there is connexion due to desire, the giving up of that desire is certainly tyāga or renunciation.</p>
<p>The preposition pari (before tyaj) is to show the extreme aversion arising from the lack of competence (for other _upāya_s ) at all times and in every form, which the person destitute of _upāya_s has come to realise in himself as expressed in the following passages, “I see no means of crossing (the sea of sainsāra) in all the eternity of time which lies before me,&quot; and &quot; It is &lsquo;only by the lotus feet of the Lord that I shall attain the desired goal. I have no other means of attaining spiritual welfare in any of my births.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aversion in every form&rdquo; means being without the improper desire to perform what is impossible for a man with the thought: “Though I cannot adopt the <em>upāya</em> in full perfection, I will do it to the best of my ability; when that also is too difficult to perform, I will adopt, in the place of the prescribed _aṅga_s, something less difficult or the _upāya_s which will produce the prescribed _upāya_s&quot;,</p>
<p>The object of this anuvāda<sup id="fnref:335"><a href="#fn:335" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">335</a></sup> (statement of what has already occurred) namely sarva dharmān <em>parityajya</em> (which is not a <em>vidhi</em> or injunction) is to indicate the person who is specially competent to adopt <em>prapatti</em>, The preposition <em>pari</em> in <em>parityajya</em> is to indicate the person who is most competent or has full competence. In the sentence:- &ldquo;Having reached this world which is perishable and without pleasure, you should resort to me with devotion,&rdquo; having reached does not state a <em>vidhi</em> or injunction meaning - &ldquo;Reach this world&rdquo;. It only means &lsquo;Being in this world&rsquo; or &lsquo;since you are in this world&rsquo;. So also, here, the words <em>sarvadharmān parityajya</em> do not mean give up all _dharma_s&rsquo;. It should be taken to mean: &ldquo;You that have given up all _dharma_s&rdquo;. Since this usage of having done a thing&rsquo; (past participle) is met with in other senses also, it is not right to say that &lsquo;having given up all _dharma_s&rsquo; or giving up all dharnas is one of the accessories enjoined for <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>What is meant is not that the person should give up but that as he is unable to adopt other _dharma_s, he should seek the Lord as an <em>upāya</em>.</p>
<p>If <em>parityajya</em> (having given up) is to be considered (at all) as enjoining what should be done (<em>vidhi</em>), there is nothing wrong in stating that it enjoins, as in the chapters on <em>Prapatti</em> and elsewhere, the thought of helplessness (kārpaṇya) which is of the nature of such thoughts as being destitute of upãyas. In that interpretation, <em>sarva dharmān parityajya</em> would mean &ldquo;Reflect at first on the state in which you are unfit for the adoption or performance of every form of <em>dharma</em>&rdquo; (in this case it would be a <em>vidhi</em>). This state has been (well) expressed in such passages as the following: &ldquo;l am the abode of all offences (against Thee) and I have no means of saving myself or have I anything else to attain than Thee&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I have not performed <em>dharma</em> with any constancy; I have not realised the nature of the self nor have I <em>bhakti</em>  or devotion to Thy lotus feet&rdquo;. Even this interpretation, which is not the meaning that strikes one immediately and is</p>
<p>therefore a little strained, is better than the meanings given by Sankara and others that what is intended here is such as the giving up of the _dharma_s themselves in their essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>), because it is not out of keeping with any _pramāṇa_s (for in the chapters on <em>prapatti</em>, it is enjoined that the rites and observances of castes and ās&rsquo;ramas should (always) be performed).</p>
<p>When we take partyajya as a <em>vidhi</em> or injunction, it would be appropriate to say that the meaning of sarva dharmān <em>parityajya</em> is - &ldquo;No <em>dharma</em> of any kind need be performed for the sake of <em>prapatti</em>&rdquo;, in the sense that <em>prapatti</em> does not require any of them (as _aṅga_s). In that case, the use of the preposition pari would suggest that even such observances as are stated in &quot; This should be done after performing achamana&quot; and &ldquo;This should be done with bodily purity&rdquo;, which are requisite for securing fitness for all rites in common, are not to be accepted as _aṅga_s for <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, if it is maintained that the giving up of such _dharma_s as <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em>, <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em> and <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em> in their essential forın (<em>svarūpa</em>) is an aṅga or accessory to <em>prapatti</em>, it would follow that <em>prapatti</em> is not in the competence of any one. The abandonment of a <em>dharma</em> can be enjoined only in the case of a person who is capable of performing it. This would be opposed to the thought of helplessness ( kārpaṇya ), which is called an <em>aṅga</em> ( of <em>prapatti</em> ) according to many pramāņas. It would also be opposed to the tradition that <em>prapatti</em> is for those who are destitute of _upāya_s, which is evident from such passages as the following: &ldquo;I am without any _upāya_s and have no other saviour&rdquo;. &ldquo;I was not born into any of the four castes so as to be competent for the performance of <em>dharma</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;I have given up the rites to be performed by a Brahmin who has the mark of worshipping the three fires after ablution&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I am not well established in the performance of <em>dharma</em>, nor have I realised the nature of my self etc.</p>
<p>To state that the <em>jīva</em> (kshetrajna) is eternally incapable of all other _upāya_s, since he is entirely dependent on and subject to the control of <em>Iśvara</em> and (in the same breath) to state that the giving up of these _dharma_s or _upāya_s is enjoined on him is against all s&rsquo;astras and is opposed also to the very words of these writers and their actual practice. (For how can a man give up a <em>dharma</em> which he is not capable of performing? How can a man proceed to perform <em>kaiṅkarya</em>, if he is incapable of it owing to otter dependence and subjection?). It would, therefore, be extremely ridiculous to hold this view. If this view were right, then by the same logic, even the <em>vidhi</em> contained in vraja (seek me etc.) would be impossible of performance.</p>
<p>The statement that the jīvātmā is eternally incapable of all other _upāya_s would only go to confirm the view that <em>parityajya</em> (here, does not enjoin the giving up and) only states what has already occurred (anuvāda) (owing to inability ), which these writers would not like to accept.</p>
<p>(Further) the use of a single set of words in a single sentence cannot mean both the statement of what has occurred owing to inability in the case of the man who is not capable and the injunction to the man who is capable of performance to give it up ( which is another view held by some)</p>
<p>Nor can it be held that the option is given to the same person (adhikārī) who is capable of performing <em>dharma</em> either to perform the <em>dharma</em> or to give it up. This would mean two alternative courses, one of which is difficult and the other light, when there is no difference in the object of attainment. For if the man who is capable of adopting the difficult <em>upāya</em> is enjoined to adopt the lighter or easier <em>upāya</em> by giving up the performance (of what he is capable of ), then no one would ever think of adopting the more difficult <em>upāya</em> and since there is no other way in which the difference in competency could be stated, all the _śāstra_s which enjoin the performance or adoption of the more difficult <em>upāya</em> would carry no weight,</p>
<p>It is also extremely inappropriate to say that, in order to stimulate the adoption of the easier <em>upāya</em>, the difficult <em>upāya</em> is (first) enjoined and then forbidden for performance.</p>
<p>The view that what are not (really) _upāya_s are enjoined as _upāya_s (and are thereafter condemned as unfit for performance) - this view would tend to look upon the _śruti_s and the _smṛti_s as deceptive. Even such things as the essential nature of the Saviour (which we learn only from them) could not (then) be known for certain,</p>
<p>It is true that, in the world, among those that are desirous of wealth, some choose cultivation of the soil and other such difficult operations, while others choose lighter professions like dealing in rubies and other gems; but this option is determined by the differences in capacity or competence among the adhikārīs.</p>
<p>Kooarathalvan&rsquo;s commentary on the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> :-&ldquo;You that suffer (from anxiety) because of the impossibility of adoption of other _upāya_s, give up everything that has been declared as the means of attaining me and seek me as (your) refuge (tor salvation)”&ndash;this commentary, too, means only what has been explained (as the meaning so far) and is not, therefore, opposed to it. (In that commentary &lsquo;giving up&rsquo; states only what has occurred before (anuvāda) or means only &ldquo;without doing it as an <em>aṅga</em> required for <em>prapatti</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is true that, in such cases, as Samāvartana or the conclusion of the <em>Prājāpatyavrata</em>, baths accompanied by certain vratas or observances are prescribed and also (as an alternative) baths without any such vratas (which are easier). But this option is determined by the condition or the circumstances in which the person is situated. If we do not take it in this light, the enjoining of the more difficult alternative would be of no use (for no one would adopt it).</p>
<p>There is another (wrong) view that the adhikārī competent for <em>prapatti</em> is the person who has fullness of knowledge or fullness of faith and that the adhikārī for <em>upāsanā</em> is the person who lacks this fullness of knowledge or fullness of faith. If this view were accepted, it would follow that such men as Vyasa who taught the churama_śloka_ and the like and who, because of their piety, had fullness of knowledge and fullness of faith should be looked upon as incompetent for <em>upāsanā</em>. There is no evidence or pramāņa to prove that when they taught, they had knowledge and faith and having (later) become weak in intelligence and faith adopted <em>upāsanā</em>. There is no evidence in the respective accounts of their lives to show that though they were prapannas (with <em>prapatti</em> as their <em>upāya</em>) they practised <em>upāsanā</em> also for setting an example to the world. Even if this were adınitted to be a fact, the adoption of a <em>dharma</em> which is forbidden to a man for the sake of setting an&rsquo; example to the world would be a sin so far as he is concerned and as the observance or adoption of the <em>dharma</em> is opposed to the man&rsquo;s competence, it would not be a proper example to set the world right. (<em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>) has explained in the Gitā <em>Bhāṣya</em> that loka sangraha consists in a man choosing one of two ways of life (permitted for himself) as being easy of performance by others and beneficial to them, and adopting that way of life as an example to others in order to establish them firmly in it. A sannyāsin adopting the way of life peculiar to the house-holder and forbidden to himself is not setting an example for the sake of the betterment of the world (lokasangraha). This would be only the violation of the commandment (of the Lord). In the same way, the adoption by a <em>prapanna</em> of a <em>dharma</em> forbidden to him, under the misapprehension that it would be a form of <em>kaiṅkarya</em> is also opposed to his competency:</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong in a <em>prapanna</em> performing those rites that are prescribed in the _śāstra_s and that are not required for <em>prapatti</em> with the idea that they are (forms of) <em>kaiṅkarya</em> (service).</p>
<p>If it is maintained that as an <em>aṅga</em> or accessory of <em>prapatti</em>, men should give up all _dharma_s (rites and observances) appropriate to their respective castes (and _āśrama_s) and capable also of being performed by them, it would follow that they would lose the fruit viz, the <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service appropriate to their respective caste, <em>āśrama</em> and the like, in the period after <em>prapatti</em>; (it would also follow) that they should give up also such _dharma_s as non-violence and speaking the truth which are common to all and the showing of reverence to ācharyas and roam about like cattle, beasts and birds.</p>
<p>It may be argued that _dharma_s which are of the nature of refraining (from actions) and which are understood from prohibitory texts (such as do not kill ) are not activities calculated to protect oneself and are therefore not opposed to <em>prapatti</em> and that, owing to this what is intended here is only the giving up of such activities as are positive (pruvritti) (and not mere abstentions from activity). This argument, too, is unsound. <em>Nivṛtti</em>, abstention or renunciation, is also a form of activity arising from one&rsquo;s will or determination, and it too, may occur for the sake of protecting oneself as may be seen in the world and from the Vedas. (Prohibitory texts in the Vedas presume that even abstentions are activities. Refraining from treasonable activities is often for the sake of protection of one&rsquo;s self from the penal code).</p>
<p>If it be held that, on the strength of the injunction (<em>vidhi</em>) contained in <em>parityajya</em>), the <em>prapanna</em> should give up all dhamas whether they be positive activities (<em>pravṛtti</em>) or abstentions from actions (<em>nivṛtti</em>) and that this is the real intention of the śāstras, then it would follow that the ancients who performed <em>prapatti</em> and those who are prapannas today have done and are doing what is against the _Śāstra_s in performing different kinds of <em>kaiṅkarya</em> (<em>pravṛtti</em>) and in performing expiatory rites for offences (committed by them) (for what is forbidden should, on that view, be performed and no expiation would be necessary for it). These men who are propagators of the tradition of <em>prapatti</em> in accordance with the _pramāṇa_s and who are also supremely compassionate could, under no stretch of imagination, be thought of as deluded or deceitful.</p>
<p>It may be argued that this objection would stand only if the giving up of all _dharma_s (rites and observances) is enjoined (on the <em>prapanna</em>) for the rest of his life, and that it would not hold good, if the giving up of all _dharma_s in their essential form (<em>svarūpa</em>) is considered as an <em>aṅga</em> (of <em>prapatti</em>) to be done only at the time of performing <em>prapatti</em> and if their resumption is permitted after that performance. The answer to this argument is as follows:- &quot; There is no need at all to enjoin the giving np of an activity or of an abstention which is not likely to be present at all at that time. If only such activities or _dharma_s in their <em>svarūpa</em> as are likely or possible at the time are enjoined to be given up, it would follow that <em>prapatti</em> should be performed after giving up such things as the following :&ndash; residence in holy places sacred to <em>Bhagavān</em>, the tuft of hair, the sacred thread (yajñopavīta) and the wearing of the mark of the sect (puṇḍra).</p>
<p>Therefore the proper interpretation of the <em>vidhi</em> (if it be taken as <em>vidhi</em>) enjoining the giving up is this: &ldquo;<em>Prapatti</em> does not require, as an <em>aṅga</em> or accessory, any <em>dharma</em> or observance or rite which is required as an <em>aṅga</em> (such as <em>karma</em>) to <em>upāsana</em> (meditation) according to vidyās”.</p>
<p>Even in this view that <em>parityajya</em> indicates a <em>vidhi</em> or injunction to give up, the person competent for <em>prapatti</em> is one who is incapable of other _upāya_s, or one who, though capable of other _upāya_s, is too impatient to endure the delay in attaining the fruit (which the other _upāya_s might entail). If we take this view, it will not be against any of the _pramāṇa_s (viz. those which enjoin the rites of the varṇas and _āśrama_s, and those which enjoin <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em> and the like). Former _ācārya_s did not discuss the point whether or not the giving up of all _dharma_s in their essential forn is an <em>aṅga</em> of <em>prapatti</em>. Their discussions were confined only to the question of which words in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> respectively indicated the qualification necessary for <em>prapatti</em> viz. that of being destitute of other _upāya_s and which words the idea that <em>prapatti</em> did not require (any <em>aṅga</em> or accessory).</p>

<p>Soine_ācārya_s, who were conversant with the requirements of a sentence, thought that the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> speaks first (in <em>parityajya</em>) of the person competent for <em>prapatti</em> (as one who is unable to adopt other _upāya_s) and then declares by the word ‘ekam’ we alone) that <em>prapatti</em> as an <em>upāya</em> does not require anything else as <em>aṅga</em> or accessory. Others said that the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> speaks first of <em>prapatti</em> not requiring anything else as <em>aṅga</em> and then declares who the competent person is for the easier <em>upāya</em> in the word vraja) by the suggestion contained in the word śoka or grief (in mā śuchaH) (for the grief should be the grief due to the man&rsquo;s inability to adopt other _upāya_s). (There was no discussion among these earlier āchāryas of the point whether <em>prapatti</em> enjoined the giving up of all _dharma_s (even such as those ordained for the varṇas and the āśramas). Thus the discussion was confined only to the way in which the words (in the <em>śloka</em>) should be construed, though there was no difference in the meaning as a whole, and the author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> did not stop the discussion. What was (wrongly) imagined as having been the subject of discussion by other people who did not know what had formerly taken place &ndash; that was shown to be without any foundation by such teachers as Vishṇuchitta.</p>
<p>But it may be asked how the difference between those who are competent and those who are not competent (for <em>prapatti</em>) could be justified in the face of such _śloka_s as the following: &ldquo;&lsquo;This is the <em>upāya</em> for those who do not understand; this is also the <em>upāya</em> for those who know well: this is the <em>upāya</em> for those who want to reach (quickly) the shore beyond <em>samsāra</em> and this is the <em>upāya</em> also for those who want (immediately) to render constant service to the Lord&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Hari is the only <em>upāya</em> to those who do not know of other _upāya_s, either with their ignorance or with their knowledge of such qualities of the Lord as His being the Lord (of all), and on account of intensity of <em>bhakti</em> &ldquo;. The answer to this question is as follows:- The ajñānam or ignorance referred to in the word (<em>ajñānāt</em>) in <em>Lakṣmī</em> Tantra and <em>avidyātah</em> in Bhattar&rsquo;s <em>śloka</em> is not the ignorance of such beings as cattle of what is stated in the _śāstra_s. It means only this much, lack of a clear understanding of such forms (of adoration) as _upāsana_s or ignorance, even in regard to <em>prapatti</em>, of subtle niceties or distinctions in it. The word <em>vijānatām</em> in _Lakṣmī_tantram (to those who know) and ‘<em>deve paribṛḍatayā viditayā’</em> (with the knowledge of such qualities of the Lord as His being the Lord of all) refer only to the kind of knowledge which enables one to understand such things as _upāsana_s or the kind of knowledge which enables a man to have a clear understanding of such things as the qualities of the Saviour, which is necessary for <em>prapatti</em>. It does not (certainly) mean a knowledge of all things, in general, for only the knowledge of the Saviour&rsquo;s quality of being the Lord of all is referred to here. Even if a man has this knowledge that is essential (for <em>upāsana</em>), when he is without the ability to adopt that (<em>upāsana</em>), he is one that is destitute of _upāya_s (akinchan) and has competency for <em>prapatti</em>,</p>
<p>Here another objection might be raised, viz.,&rdquo; Even if a man has ( the knowledge and) the ability, he should remain without any endeavour on his own part, knowing as he does, the Saviour&rsquo;s nature, for does not Sītā say:- &ldquo;If <em>Śrī</em> Rāma&rsquo;, who can destroy the hosts of his enemies, discharges his arrows on Lanka and takes me away from here, it will be the appropriate thing for him?&rdquo;. The answer to this is that (Sītā&rsquo;s attitude ) would be an example of the <em>prapanna</em>&rsquo;s later life (not of what he should do or should not do before <em>prapatti</em>). If this is not admitted, all _Śāstra_s which enjoin the adoption of _upāya_s would be meaningless.</p>
<p>Even when a man has both the knowledge of the other <em>upāya</em> (viz. <em>upāsana</em>) and the ability to adopt it, if he is too impatient to brook delay in the attainment (of the end), he may be competent for performing <em>prapatti</em>, if he thinks that only <em>prapatti</em> would secure his object reco, (the quick attainment). This (that even the man who has the knowledge and ability to adopt <em>upāsana</em> may adopt <em>prapatti</em> if he cannot lirook delay) is disclosed in the words: &quot; This is the <em>upāya</em> for those who want to cross the sea of <em>samsāra</em>&rdquo;; &ldquo;for those who want to cross&rsquo;, here, means &ldquo;Those who want to reach the shore beyond <em>samsāra</em> quickly (i.e.) those that desire a quick removal of the hindrances that stand in their way. “This is the <em>upāya</em> for those who desire <em>ānantyam</em>&rdquo; (the perfect enjoyment of the service of <em>Brahman</em>) which is one&rsquo;s due on account of one&rsquo;s essential nature. Here also the meaning is &rsquo;those who desire to have it quickly&rsquo; (i.e. those who cannot brook existence without that enjoyment.)</p>
<p>Having these two in mind, Bhattar says, &ldquo;by the intensity of their <em>bhakti</em>.&rdquo; Here <em>bhakti</em>  does not signify <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em>, but &lsquo;intensity of the love (of the Lord)&rsquo;. Intensity of <em>bhakti</em>  or love means a state of mind in which the man would cease to exist if he could not have quick attainment. Though this is not the <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em> enjoined for some adhikārīs, yet some get that state of mind by the grace of <em>Bhagavān</em> due to righteous acts (in previous births). The man who has this state of mind is also competent for <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore <em>prapatti</em> may be adopted by (1) those who do not know of other _upāya_s and who have a knowledge of what <em>prapatti</em> is in general (without a knowledge of details and distinctions); (2) those who have a clear understanding of <em>prapatti</em> and the other <em>upāya</em> (<em>upāsana</em>) but lack the ability to adopt the latter; (3) those who, though they have both the knowledge and the ability, cannot brook delay (in the attainment of the end) and cannot exist without it. This man who cannot brook delay is also destitute of _upāya_s for attaining the end in his view at the time when he wants it (so he, too, is competent for <em>prapatti</em>). It is in consideration of this circumstance that (Bhattar) wrote:- &quot; who know of no other <em>upāya</em> in the world&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Vyasa and others who held administrative offices (under the Lord) could brook delay and were also capable of the other <em>upāya</em> (i.e.) <em>upāsana</em>. Therefore it is that they adopted <em>upāsana</em> and not because they were wanting in knowledge or in faith. (Those who hold administrative offices must serve their full period before thinking of attainment.)</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S :</p>
<p>अशक्तस्यातिकृच्छ्रेषु दुराशादार्ढ्यशालिनः ।</p>
<p>कस्यचिद्बुद्धिदौर्बल्यं लघुत्यागस्य कारणम् ॥</p>
<p>तत्र प्रपत्त्यनर्हाणामन्यदित्यपि युज्यते ।</p>
<p>व्यासादिषु तु नैवैषा नीतिस्संशयघातिषु ॥</p>
<p>(If it be asked, &ldquo;Why is it said ( in some places) that a man adopts <em>upāsana</em> owing to weakness of intelligence?&rdquo; the answer is as follows):-&rdquo; When a man is incapable of an <em>upāya</em> which is extremely difficult of adoption and yet adopts it because of an obstinate desire, the ignoring of the easy <em>upāya</em> should be considered as being due to weakness of intellect.” Or it is proper also to explain their adoption of the difficult <em>upāya</em> as due to their unfitness for <em>prapatti</em> (owing to their lack of faith in it and the like.) This is not the explanation in the case of Vyasa and others (adopting <em>upāsana</em>), for they remove all the doubts of others (and cannot be considered as wanting in knowledge or faith).</p>
<p>Since in this manner the competency of a man either for <em>upāsana</em> or for <em>prapatti</em> is determined, both the _śāstra_s (those of <em>upāsana</em> and those of <em>prapatti</em>) have their own respective purpose.</p>
<p>The difference between the two adhikāris in regard to the rites and observances of their caste and disrama is only the difference of the purpose for which or the thought with which they are performed. It is true that, in the case of the prapanila, the performance of any rite or observance will prevent the attainment of his eod, because, like the <em>Brahma</em> missile, it would cease to have any effect, if any other rite is performed to attain the same end. But if these rites are performed for their own sake (without the desire for any fruit) or for such things as the glory of <em>Bhagavān</em> or the welfare of Bhāgavatas, there is no impropriety (and <em>prapatti</em> would not lose its efficacy).</p>
<p>But it may be asked by some:-“Even if it is admitted that the giving up of the _dharma_s themselves is not enjoined, it is possible that ‘<em>parityajya</em>’ ( having given up) may mean the giving up of (only) the thought that they are _upāya_s. (The answer to this question is as follows:) &ldquo;In those tests which refer to the activities of the <em>prapanna</em> after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, it may be held rightly that what is ordained is the giving up of the thought that these activities are _upāya_s. But the <em>carama</em>-<em>śloka</em> is a text which enjoins an <em>upāya</em> (before <em>prapatti</em>) and not what should be done after it, and the word <em>parityajya</em> occurs there, Therefore this interpretation would result in the injunction that these _dharma_s in their essential form should be performed as _aṅga_s or accessories to <em>prapatti</em>, but without the thought that they are _upāya_s. If this view were accepted, then, the view that certain things should be performed after <em>prapatti</em> merely for their own sake (without any aim, object or the desire for any fruit) and as mere service (to the Lord) would become untenable. (For they would still be _aṅga_s or accessories and could not be an end in themselves ). Nor could there be, in that case, the absence of any requisite or accessory <em>dharma</em> which is said to be the unique feature of <em>prapatti</em> Thus this <em>upāya</em> would cease to be within the competence of the man destitute of all _upāya_s. This is how it would result. There is no need to enjoin here the giving up of the thought of their being _upāya_s in regard to those _dharma_s that are not _upāya_s. So the performance of those _dharma_s which are _upāya_s without the thought that they are _upāya_s would only be the adherence to such _upāya_s as the old _upāsana_s. If it is maintained that the word <em>parityajya</em> means the giving up of the thought of their being _upāya_s, then there would have been no need to reconcile the conflicting statements about the ordinance concerning abandonment and that about performance by saying that the difference is due to the persons competent for each of them. It is only if the text is held to enjoin the giving up of the _dharma_s themselves, there would arise any such conflict. If it is held that the adoption of <em>karma</em>, <em>jñāna</em> and <em>bhakti</em> , but without the thought that they are _upāya_s is an <em>aṅga</em> to <em>prapatti</em>, there would be no essential difference between the <em>bhakta</em> and the <em>prapanna</em>. The difference would only be nominal.)  the man who has <em>bhakti</em>  as the main and independent means and <em>prapatti</em> as an accessory to it could be called a <em>bhakta</em> and the man who adopts <em>prapatti</em> as the main and independent means and <em>bhakti</em>  as an accessory to it would be called a <em>prapanna</em>, but both would perform the same _dharma_s and there would be no difference in their action.</p>
<p>It may be argued that, in regard to accessory activity, there need not be fullness or perfection of performance and that some short-comings might be allowed therein ; but this argument is not sound. Has it not been stated:-&ldquo;A rite or observance performed for the attainment of a certain fruit will yield the desired fruit, only when all the accessory rites or _aṅga_s are duly performed?&rdquo; (<em>Pūrva Mīmāmsā</em>).</p>

<p>It is only those who have forgotten the episodes<sup id="fnref:336"><a href="#fn:336" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">336</a></sup> of Kakasura and the like that world maintain, as _aṅga_s of <em>prapatti</em>, these _dharma_s without the thought that they are _upāya_s and that the person is himself the doer of the action and its beneficiary (for the doership and the benetit are God&rsquo;s).</p>
<p>Kākāsura performed <em>prapatti</em> (to <em>Śrī</em> Rāma) without any of the rites due to <em>varṇa</em> or <em>āśrama</em>.</p>
<p>We have (also ) heard that, by a single performance alone of <em>prapatti</em> far removed from any other <em>dharma</em>, the ancients obtained at once what they desired.</p>
<p>If it is maintained that the _aṅga_s of <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> which might be presumed as necessary also for <em>prapatti</em> are declared to be not necessary for <em>prapatti</em> and as being no _aṅga_s to it, the potency of the <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>), which is equal in might to the <em>Brahma</em> missile, becomes well established and the rendering of service and the like will also become appropriate.</p>
<p>Therefore the view that here (in <em>parityajya</em>) the giving up of all _dharma_s, (rites, observances and the like) is enjoined (for <em>prapatti</em>) and the view that what is enjoined to be given up is only the thought of their being _upāya_s and the thought that they are _aṅga_s to it &ndash; these views conflict with such _śāstra_s as ordain the observance of the commandments, with the _śāstra_s which state that <em>prapatti</em> does not require anything else, with the traditional observances of former _ācārya_s and with the code of conduct followed by virtuous men in former times who had become prapannas. Thus owing to the objections pointed out so far, the giving up of all _dharma_s is not an <em>aṅga</em> to <em>prapatti</em> ; nor is the performance of these _dharma_s in their essential form an <em>aṅga</em> (without the thought of their being _upāya_s or _aṅga_s to <em>prapatti</em>), because as has been stated before, <em>prapatti</em> does not require the performance of any other <em>dharma</em>. Therefore this injunction or ordinance about ‘giving up&rsquo; (<em>tyāga</em>) has, for its purport, the statement that <em>prapatti</em> does not require any (aid) from any other <em>dharma</em>.</p>
<p>To make this denial, there must be a wrong presumption of something that has to be denied. If it is asked what _dharma_s (rites, observances and the like) are presumed (wrongly) as being requisite and are then stated to be unnecessary (the answer is as follows) - In the vidyās or forms of meditation (upāsanas) enjoined in Vedanta, some of the accessories which appear as _aṅga_s in certain _vidyā_s, such as the rites, duties and observances of the _varṇa_s and the _āśrama_s and also such things as meditation on the route to <em>mokṣa</em> are required also in other _vidyā_s or forms of meditation. So also there may, at first, be a (wrong) presumption that in _nyāsa_vidyā too, these might be required as accessory. To correct this presumption, here (in <em>parityajya</em>), these _dharma_s which might be thought of (wrongly) on the analogy of _upāsana_s as _aṅga_s (to <em>prapatti</em>) are not required for it. This is the right interpretation of the text here.</p>
<p>Though these _dharma_s cannot be considered as accessory aids (to <em>prapatti</em>) as they are stated to be for <em>upāsana</em> in <em>Brahma</em> _Sūtra_s (3.4 -33), yet as stated in another <em>sūtra</em> (3 - 4 - 32), the karmas ordained for the different _āśrama_s have to be performed, as they are enjoined as ordinances or commands; there is nothing to prevent their perfornuance by the <em>prapanna</em> (since commandments have to be obeyed as such (and for no other reason).</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: page543</p>
<p>Therefore, as neither the performance of these _dharma_s nor their giving up is an <em>aṅga</em> to <em>prapatti</em>; to be without the desire to do what is beyond one&rsquo;s ability is a mark of competency (for <em>prapatti</em>). The performance of those duties or rites which are <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> and which are within the range of one&rsquo;s ability takes rank as mere service consisting in the observance of a command,</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>सङ्कल्पमात्रमेवाङ्गं श्रुतमाचरणं पुनः ।</p>
<p>अनङ्गमाज्ञया प्राप्तं न सङ्कल्पनिबन्धनम् ॥</p>
<p>It is only the thought or the will to do what is pleasing to the Lord that is stated (in the _Śāstra_s) as an <em>aṅga</em> of <em>prapatti</em>, The action arising out of that will or thought is not an <em>aṅga</em>. The rites of the varṇa and āśrama are the proper thing to do in virtue of their being the Lord&rsquo;s command and not because it is the consequence of the will or the thought to do what is pleasing to Him,</p>
<p>If so, it may be asked: &ldquo;What is the purpose or object of performing those manifold and great acts of service which cannot be included among the commands to perform <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> <em>karma</em> ?&rdquo; These cannot be included among any of the other _upāya_s for <em>mokṣa</em> (because they are not performed with the object of attaining <em>mokṣa</em>); nor are they _aṅga_s or accessories to <em>prapatti</em>, because it does not require any such _aṅga_s or aids. The person does not perform them because of the fear that the Lord would be offended at their non-performance, nor does he perform them with the desire that they would bring about, by themselves, extinction of his sins or the attainment of such fruits as <em>svarga</em>, cattle, children and the like. Neither does he perform them merely for his own delight just like worldly men playing dice and the like, nor does he perform them to please the Lord having seen, like the freed souls, by actual observation, what would be approved of by Him. If so, why does he perform them, it may be asked. (The answer is as follows) - He proceeds to perform them because it is evident from the _śāstra_s that these acts of service have, for their fruit, the propitiation of the Lord (just like other fruits) As one in whose nature the quality of <em>sattvam</em> predominates, he acquires a taste for pleasing the Lord and follows the light shed by the lamp of the śāstras in trying to give delight to the Lord who stands in varied relationships to him (as father, mother etc.), in the same way as he shows his love to his friends, children and the like.</p>
<p>In this connection some may ask :- &ldquo;In the case of the wise man who has made a complete surrender of all responsibility to the Lord of all, is not the criterion for deciding what should be given up and what taken up, the knowledge of his own essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>?) So he is bound (only) by the knowledge of his own essential nature (to do or not to do this or that); why, then, should he follow the dictates of the _śāstra_s?&rdquo;. This question is improper, for, if it is determined what his essential nature is with the help of the śāstras, then there is no other guide for him than the _śāstra_s, until the time of his attaining <em>mukti</em>, to help him to understand what aims in life he should avoid as also the _upāya_s therefor, and what aims he should have and also the _upāya_s for securing these aims. From the knowledge that he is <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord and the like, it is just possible to know a few things that are appropriate to the <em>śeṣa</em>. The knowledge of one&rsquo;s essential nature cannot indicate, unequivocally, in what manner service should be rendered in order that it may please the <em>śeṣī</em>, and what _upāya_s should be adopted for this service. This being so, if one ignores the _Śāstra_s and renders service with forbidden substances (like opium, say) or even among substances that are permitted, to render service with substances acquired unjustly and thus render service according to one&rsquo;s own sweet will and pleasure in ways opposed to what is enjoined in the śāstras, then there would be no difference between reverential conduct and offence. Then since there is no criterion besides one&rsquo;s own taste, one might think of performing as service all that is considered as forbidden and therefore avoided by seekers after <em>mukti</em>. The author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> has stated (in regard to the offering of food (<em>havis</em>) to Archi):- &quot; Having &ldquo;collected those things which are not prohibited in the _śāstra_s etc.&rdquo; Therefore the proper thing is to render such forms of service as are enjoined in the _Śāstra_s as competent to the person concerned and subject to the dictates of the _śāstra_s. The teaching contained in the <em>śloka</em> :- &ldquo;To know what ought to be done and what ought . not to be done, the only authority that you have is the <em>śāstra</em>. Therefore while you are here, understand the <em>karma</em>  enjoined in the <em>śāstra</em> just as it is” – this teaching is common to all ( whatever their competency). <em>Śrī</em> Alavandar in his Gitarthasangraha says:-&ldquo;Among these ekantins ( who are devoted exclusively to the Lord), the wise man (jnani) is called paramaikanti, one who has supreme devotion to the Lord to the exclusion of all other interests. His being alive is solely dependent on the Lord, To be united with Him is his only delight; to part from Him is his (only ) pain. His mind is always with the Lord. He considers himself as an entity only becanse of his meditating on Him, of visiting holy places (sacred to Him), and of speaking of Him to others, of bowing to Him and uttering his sacred names. His actions are performed with his life-breath, mind, will and the senses all dedicated to Him. He performs all the duties pertaining to him and also practises <em>bhakti</em>  inspired solely by love. He should give up the idea of their being _upāya_s and place the <em>upāya</em> in the Lord without any fear&rdquo;. In these _śloka_s what Alavandar meant by the words &ldquo;inspired solely by love&rdquo; was not that he should ignore the _śāstra_s. His idea was to emphasise the great inspiration arising from his love (of the Lord), whose <em>śeṣa</em> he is, to perform those acts of service which he can understand only from the śāstras, in order to give delight to Him. When these _śloka_s are considered in relation to the man who practises _upāsana_s and the like, its aim is to show that these upāsanas are most pleasing to the person himself, that they are not the direct means of attaining the supreme end, but are the means of winning the favour of the Saviour who is the direct means or <em>upāya</em> for obtaining this end, and that the Lord of all who is pleased by these _upāsana_s stands, as the direct <em>upāya</em> for the attainment of this end. When the _śloka_s are considered in relation to the man who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as the principal and independent means, their aim is to show that, though he performs the ordinances of <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> <em>karma</em> and such other rites just as they are enjoined for <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>, since he does not perform them for the sake of other objects like <em>svarga</em> and <em>mokṣa</em> and perforins them solely for pleasing the Lord, he has not adopted any other <em>upāya</em> (for <em>mokṣa</em> and has no other interests or object. (Their aim is also) to show that, as he is destitute of other _upāya_s, the Lord Himself stands in the place of those _upāya_s and rewards him with the desired fruit.</p>
<p>Those who have not studied Vedanta might ask (in this connection:- Both these adhikārīs (the <em>bhakta</em> and the <em>prapanna</em>) are devoted solely and exclusively to the Lord as stated (in the _śloka_s):-&rdquo; Wise men do not worship <em>Brahma</em>, Rudra and other gods, for the reward that can he given by them is limited,&rdquo; &ldquo;They are &ldquo;my devotees who have no devotion to other deities, who love those that are devoted to me and who seek me alone as their <em>upāya</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;He who has attained the lotus feet of <em>Viṣṇu</em> should not worship other deities.&rdquo; If these two adhikāris should perform the rites and observances of their castes and _āśrama_s as stated (ia Alavandar&rsquo;s _śloka_s! (viz., all the <em>karma</em> s pertaining to them and also <em>bhakti</em> ), would not their supreme and exclusive devotion to the Lord be adversely affected in as much as these rites or _dharma_s are mixed up with (the worship of) such gods as Agoi and lndra?&rdquo; Here, as explained in the <em>Brahma</em> _Sūtra_s (1-2-29), names like Agni may be considered, on the authority of Jaimini, as directly referring to <em>Brahman</em> or <em>Bhagavān</em> for Agni and other such words may be etymologically derived as agram nayati. (He who receives the best part of the offering for Himself) etc. There is no worship or contact with other deities, because they are like the sacred names found in Sahasranama (etymologically applicable to <em>Bhagavān</em>). The author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> has stated in his <em>Nitya</em>:&ndash;&ldquo;Having pleased the gods, the rishis and the Manes with oblations and with the thought that they have <em>Bhagavān</em> as their inner self&rdquo; etc. So it is perfectly in accordance with the _śāstra_s to perform these respective rites meditating that the Supreme Being has the respective deities as His body In &ldquo;Pratardana <em>vidyā</em> and the like we are taught in the _śāstra_s that the Supreme Being may be meditated on (or worshipped) in three forms: (one) in His own divine and essential nature, (two), the Supreme Being as having sentient beings as His attribute (or body), and ( three) the Supreme Being as having non-sentient things as His attribute (or body). Though He is worshipped in these three ways, the worship is really to the Supreme Being and not to His attributes (or bodies) (namely . the sentient and non-sentient beings). In the same way here also, the <em>bhakta</em> or <em>prapanna</em> does not adore the gods, the rishis and the Manes, who are really attributes or bodies of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p>As stated in the following _śloka_s: &ldquo;In all yajnas, it is I that am worshipped and it is also I myself that rewards (those who perforın them) with the fruits thereof,&rdquo; &ldquo;It is Thou alone that assumest the forms of the Pitrs and the gods and receivest the offerings (<em>havis</em>) (made to the gods) and the offerings (kavya) made to the Manes in sraddhas&rdquo; and &ldquo;Those who propitiate the Pitṛs, the gods, the Brahmins and Agni&ndash;they propitiate only <em>Viṣṇu</em> who is the inner self of all things&rdquo;-as stated in these _śloka_s, it is only the Supreme Being, who is the inner self of all, that is the object of adoration to the wise man. Therefore to the man who performs <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service according to the _Śāstra_s with this knowledge, there is no association with other _upāya_s; there is no association for him with other objects or purposes in acquiring the necessary substances for worship and in eating the food offered (to these gods). Similarly there is no association for him with other deities whom, obeying the injunctions (contained in the s&rsquo;astras, he worships the Supreme Being having, for His attributes, sentient beings and non-sentient things. It has been said, “ He who worships as the Supreme Being any deity other thun Nārāyaṇa who dwells in his heart, who controls him and is his Lord and Master&ndash;he is a sinner,&rdquo; &quot; He who considers Nārāyaṇa as being (only) equal to other deities &mdash;- he will stay in hell as long as the sun and the moon last”, and “One should not go near the places where Buddha, Rudra and the like are worshipped and so also near the cremation ground, near a corpse, near a forest and near the capital city of a kingdom.&rdquo; As stated (in these _śloka_s), it would be a sin for a paramaikantin if other deities are looked upon by him as the Supreme Being, if they are considered equal (to Nārāyaṇa) and if he goes to places where other deities are worshipped, when these deities have nothing to do with his <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> rites and observances. Since these deities stand in the position of bodies to the Supreme Being who is the inner self of all and who is the object of adoration in these sites and observances (<em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em>), there is no thought in the mind of the man (with supreme and exclusive devotion to the Lord) of these deities being the Supreme Self, of their being equal to <em>Bhagavān</em>, of their being independent of the Lord, of their being objects of adoration or of their being the dispensers of the fruits of actions. Therefore in the same way as by Prana, Vaisvanara, and the three worlds which are the attributes of the Supreme Being in the _Vidyā_s or meditations called Vaisvanara <em>vidyā</em> and the like. he is not affected, so also his exclusive devotion to the Lord is not (in the least) affected by such attributes as Agni (which are associated with these rites and observances, <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em>).</p>
<p>While proceeding to state the adoration of <em>Bhagavān</em> to be performed by the <em>prapanna</em> in the day and the night, V_aṅgī_puram Nambi has described the _dharma_s of the castes and the _āśrama_s with their respective _mantra_s (in the following passages) :-&rdquo; (The <em>prapanna</em>) should spend his time by performing duly all the rites ordained for the time of the sandhyā, after sipping the water (achamana) with the prescribed _mantra_s; after this he should perform the homa to the sacrificial fires during the Agnihotra rites with the prescribed _mantra_s and with samit (fuel), ghee and other such substances. He should do every <em>karma</em>  at the time prescribed for them in the _śāstra_s&quot;. Then he says: &ldquo;He should &ldquo;perform, without being lazy, all the rites from the bath to <em>Brahma</em> yajna prescribed in the Vedas for his āśrama as fit to be done at noon&rdquo;, He continues : &ldquo;Then he should perform the prescribed yajna to the gods and to the pitṛs (Manes), after which he should eat the food offered to <em>Bhagavān</em> (which act is called <em>anuyāga</em>)&rdquo;. Bhattar and Koorathalvan, too, in their respective _nitya_s, have stated as follows:&ndash; &quot; With the vertical mark (<em>ūrdhvapuṇḍra</em>) on his forehead, (he) should perform the rites ordained in the _śruti_s, and _smṛti_s as far as it lies in his power, with the thought that they form the adoration of the Supreme Being and then offer oblations of water (tarpaṇam)&rdquo;. Peria Jeer (Nanjeer) begins by performing obeisance with the words: &ldquo;I seek the feet of Parāśara Bhattārya&rdquo;. By this he reminds us of the special tradition concerning the homage to be paid to _guru_s and the like. After this, he says “I will now describe the manner in which service should be rendered to the lotus feet of <em>Bhagavān</em> every day by men with exclusive devotion to him (<em>ekāntins</em>)”. He then says &quot; (The Ekāntin) should sprinkle water on himself by uttering the <em>mantra</em> beginning with Āpohi and then sip water (āchamana) with the utterance of the _mantra_s which denote <em>Bhagavān</em>; after this he should offer arghya to the Supreme Being who is in the sphere of the sun and then perform japa, meditating on <em>Bhagavān</em> with the <em>mantra</em> of Gāyatri. After the japa, he should offer praise to <em>Puruṣottama</em>. Oblations of water (tarpana) should then be made to the gods, the rishis and the pitṛs (Manes, who have Narayaṇa as their inner self.&quot; We see also that, in all families which follow the tradition of the author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em>, until the present day, weddings and upanayanas (initiation with the sacred thread) have been performed in accordance with their respective (Gṛhya) sūtras, (Āpastamba and the like) with the respective _mantra_s denoting the respective deities. It is also well-known to all that the great _ācārya_s like Peria Nambi performed yajnas (sacrifices) and the like in accordance with their respective sūtras. Therefore in the case of those who follow the teaching of the author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em>, his disciples and their disciples, it is not proper to perforin any rites (like those of weddings) with the _mantra_s in certain samhitās following the doctrines of the Āgamas (Pāñcharātra)<sup id="fnref:337"><a href="#fn:337" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">337</a></sup> which are prescribed specially (to those who follow them).</p>
<p>Sātvatam : Padmam: Jayākhyam, etc. these are the āgama samhitās.</p>
<p>We have already shown in <em>Śrī</em> Pancharātrarakshā (The Defence of <em>Pāñcarātra</em>) that the <em>Pāñcarātra</em> is of four kinds or systems <em>(Āgama Siddhānta, Mantra Siddhānta, Tantra Siddhānta and Tantrāntara Siddhānta</em>) in accordance with the competency and the like (ability) of the person concerned, that the principle holds good that what is not stated in any one of them should be taken from the others, provided there is no conflict or opposition and that, in all the four kinds of systems of Pāñcha rātra, the direct means or <em>upāya</em> of attaining <em>mokṣa</em> is set forth and that by every one of them there is the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em>, just in the same way as to all the four āśramas there are <em>Brahma</em> Vidyās (<em>bhakti</em>  and <em>prapatti</em>) and that to every one of them there is the possibility of attaining <em>mokṣa</em>. It has also been stated there, at considerable length, that if a person were to perform all <em>karma</em> s or rites with any _mantra_s of his own liking, ignoring what is enjoined in those sustras as the proper thing for each kind or system, he should perform expiatory rites (<em>prāyaścitta</em>) and the like. Therefore until the time of attaining <em>mukti</em>, there is no authority for rendering service or <em>kaiṅkarya</em> (to the Lord) in any manner other than what is ordained in the _śāstra_s as appropriate for each adhikārī.</p>
<p>Hence since even the <em>prapanna</em> is subject to the authority of the sastrus and should perform only such service as is permitted or enjoined by them, the following (heretical) views which are opposed to the scriptures and the traditional observances (of the good) supported by right reason or logic are not to be accepted by those who desire to stand in <em>sattvam</em>. (views such as the following): (1) Both those commands that are enjoined as positive rites or actions and those that forbid certain activities should be violated ; (2) Both those activities and rites that are enjoined and those that are forbidden should be given up. (3) The rites and observances of the variṭas and āśramas are dependent only on the bodies (of Brahmins and the like) and may therefore be given up by the person who has attained a true knowledge of the essential nature of his self (which is different from the body ). (4) They may be performed or may not be performed (5) Even if they are given up, no harm will result except the loss of the Lord&rsquo;s pleasure (6) The only harm that would result in their being given up is the ill.will of society and other such (erroneous) views.</p>
<p>It is true that, as for those in the <em>āśrama</em> of the Sannyasin, to whom certain old rites and observances (of the grihasth_āśrama_) are forbidden and certain new rites and observances enjoined, (so also) for those who are Bhāgavatas, as a consequence of their being snch, certain things are forbidden and certain new things are enjoined. But no <em>karma</em>  or rite which has been ordained as compulsory of performance should (on any account) be given up. For it has been stated :- &ldquo;The man who does not perform the rites pertaining to the sandhyā is always impure and is unfit for the performance of any (other) rite. Whatever other rite or <em>karma</em>  he may perform, he will not obtain the fruit thereof”. As in the differences in the manner of performing the sandhyā meditation or worship that are found in the sūtras and the different <em>Dharma</em> <em>Śāstra_s (Manu, Āpastamba and the like) those differences that are found in the different samhitas of the Lord&rsquo;s <em>śāstra</em> (P_arcā</em>. rātra) and also such differences in the sandhya meditation as are stated in the Itihāsas and the Purāṇas &ndash; these differences should be observed respectively by those who follow these respective _Śāstra_s. Conduct like the following which is enjoined in the _śāstra_s and the Itihasas, Namely, &ldquo;At the time of the parvas, one should pray to the deities for protection&rdquo; and &ldquo;One should bow in front of places where the gods are worshipped &ndash; (conduct like this) is restricted in the case of the man who is supremely and exclusively devoted to <em>Bhagavān</em> (Paramaikantin) owing to the authority of the <em>Śāstra</em> (i,e. the only deity or God that he should pay homage to is <em>Bhagavān</em>). Therefore no <em>śāstra</em> is violated.</p>
<p>Such injunctions as the following :-&ldquo;Therefore the <em>mantra</em> called <em>aṣṭākṣara</em> should be repeated at the time of the sandhya, by pure-minded devotees of mine always in order to purify their selves&rdquo;, and &ldquo;uttering the <em>Dvaya</em> always in this manner with its meaning at heart&rdquo; in the <em>Gadya</em> - these instructions should be carried out without any conflict with the performance of the rites <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em>) which are compulsory of performance and at such times as are left over after their performance, Nārada and others have also stated:-“The japa (namely, the repetition of <em>Aṣṭākṣara</em>) should be performed at such times as do not conflict with the performance of rites ordained in the _śruti_s and the _smṛti_s.&rdquo; V_aṅgī_puram Nambi, too, has said: -&rdquo; Having spent your time in performing the homa in rites like Agnihotra etc&quot; Even in his last days, the author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> stood up with great difficulty and offered the anjali of water at the time of sandhyā. Therefore giving up the rites of the varṇas and the _āśrama_s on the pretext that they are dependent on the upadhi of the body is opposed to such things as the traditional observances of the ancients. If this pretext were sound, since even such special forms of service (in temples) as the weaving of garlands and the lighting of lamps cannot be performed without the upādhi (or conditioning factor) of the body, the senses and the like-even these would have to be given up (by the man who has realised his essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>). If the perforınance of such services is desired, the external purity (āchāra) and the purificatory rites (samskāras) which qualify (a person) for such service, cannot be given up.</p>

<p>To reflect on such things as the caste of devotees merely for the purpose of treating them with disregard will bring ruin; but if it is done only for understanding the restrictions enjoined in the _śāstra_s, there is no harm in it anywhere.</p>
<p>That is the reason why, in the _Śāstra_s, _Dharma_vyadha Tuladhara, Sabari, Vidura and others are described only by their respective castes.</p>
<p>Their conduct, too, as described in the Itihasas, was only in accordance with their castes; if there was any exceptional<sup id="fnref:340"><a href="#fn:340" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">340</a></sup> circumstances (in their lives against the rules of their caste), it was due to the exceptional instructions or regulations. The _dharma_s or rites prescribed for a certain place, a certain period of time, a certain adhikārī and the like should not be adopted at a different place and a different time or by another adhikārī.</p>
<p>Vidura was cremated according to Brahma Medha rites because an aerial voice ordered it.</p>
<p>Some (people) who cannot understand the purport of certain episodes (in the Itihasas and Purāṇas) increase the <em>līlā</em> rasa which <em>Bhagavān</em> enjoys in Kaliyuga. &quot; Daughters-in-law should be treated with regard and properly adorned by their mothers-in-law, their fathers-in-law, their husbands and so also by their brothers-in-law who desire to have varied prosperity. Those houses which are cursed by daughters-in-law on account of their ill treatment will fall into ruin as if pulled down by evil spirits&quot;. In statements like the above, the injunction about treating (the daughter-in-law) with regard has, on account of propriety, to be determined with proper restrictions in each case (the mother-in-law&rsquo;s regard is shown differently from that of the husband or the brother-in-law and so on). So also injunctions regarding the respect to be shown to devotees among mlecchas and the like have to be understood with proper reservations and restrictions.</p>
<p>These reservations and restrictions are established also by the practice of successive generations of men accepted on all hands as wise and virtuous. Therefore the performance of the Lord&rsquo;s service along with the observance of the regulations enjoined for the respective castes and _āśrama_s is not opposed to the state of supreme and exclusive devotion to the Lord (<em>paramaikāntitva</em>).</p>

<p>Even the service rendered directly to the Lord of <em>Lakṣmī</em> is surely divided by good men into two classes : valuable and worthless.</p>
<p>That (service) is declared to be valuable service which is rendered by the man who has done what he ought to do (i.e. the <em>prapanna</em>) with no other aim and for no other purpose (i.e. for its own sake) or for the protection of such persons as _guru_s.</p>
<p>That (service) is declared to be of no value which is rendered for ostentation (or vanity), for injuring others, for preventing others from rendering service or for the sake of some gain.</p>
<p>The Lord of all receives, with His feet, the service rendered by those who have no supreine and exclusive devotion to Him and that done by those who have supreme and exclusive devotion to Him, with His head. This idea is expressed by <em>Bhagavān</em> Veda Vyasa in the following (passages ):&quot; That which is offered to the gods and the _Pitṛ_s (Manes) in accordance with the prescribed rules</p>
<p>reaches the feet of the God of gods. The rites performed by wise men who have supreme and exclusive devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em> - these <em>Bhagavān</em> receives with His head&quot;.</p>
<p>The rites, <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em>, which are performed in this way as commandments of the Lord (<em>ājñā</em>) and those valuable services which are rendered by a man for the pleasure of the Lord as those approved by Him (<em>anujñā</em>) - these have no connection with <em>prapatti</em> and this is declared by the injunction contained in the word <em>parityajya</em> (having given up) (in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> ).</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>अतश्शक्यानि सर्वाणि न प्रपत्त्यर्थमाचरेत् ।</p>
<p>अशक्येषु च सामर्थ्यं न तदर्थं समार्जयेत् ॥</p>
<ol>
<li>Therefore one should not perform, for the sake of <em>prapatti</em>, those things of which one is capable, nor should one acquire, for the sake of <em>prapatti</em>, the ability or skill needed to accomplish what one is incapable of.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to this interpretation ( of the word <em>parityajya</em> in the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em> ), <em>ākiñcanya</em> or being destitute of _upāya_s which confers competence (<em>adhikāra</em>) for <em>prapatti</em> is suggested by the sentence which states &ldquo;Do not grieve&rdquo;. If <em>parityajya</em>, on the other hand, is considered as an anuvāda or expression of what has already occurred (namely, the person being incapable of any <em>upāya</em>), then, the word ‘<em>eka</em>’ (me alone) indicates that among those rites which arise from the Lord&rsquo;s command and those which are approved of by him, there is no connection between such of them as are performed as being within the range of a man&rsquo;s ability and <em>prapatti</em>. In this interpretation, the sentence ma śuchah (Do not grieve) makes clear the qualification (<em>adhikāra</em>) needed for <em>prapatti</em> which has already been expressed (in <em>parityajya</em>) and indicates also the manner in which the <em>prapanna</em> should conduct himself after the performance of <em>prapatti</em> (i.e.) being free from all care or anxiety.</p>
<p>There are some other ways of interpreting the word (<em>parityajya</em>) without treating the injunction regarding &lsquo;giving up&rsquo; as having no authority :</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S :</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>What is asked to be given up may be stated to be the prevention of the vain effort to perform what one is not capable of or the giving up of such vain effort along with the shame or remorse due to one&rsquo;s inability (to do it in full).</li>
</ol>
<p>3 The word tyāga contained in <em>parityajya</em> may also be considered as preventing the continuance of the trivial desire to perform (these rites) like a drowning man catching at a reed or a blade of grass.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>In the <em>Brahma</em> Sūtras, it is declared that any one of the vidyās (thirty two vidyās or forms of meditation described in the Upaniṣads) may be adopted at one&rsquo;s option, as all of them yield the same fruit. By drawing our attention to it, the injunction for <em>tyāga</em> contained in <em>parityajya</em> may also be to suggest that <em>prapatti</em> is like the <em>Brahma</em> missile, which proves ineffective if any other <em>upāya</em> is also adopted:</li>
</ol>
<p>(To sum up :-) The forms of injunction may be such as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To the man who proceeds to adopt what he is not capable of, it says “Don&rsquo;t&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the man who is firmly determined to do what is not in his power, it says, &ldquo;Give up this determination &ldquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a man were to adopt one of the _upāya_s (other than <em>prapatti</em>) which are left open to the option (of the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>), it says to him that, by the principle of the <em>Brahma</em> missile, it would conflict with the effectiveness of <em>prapatti</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore the meanings of the words <em>sarva dharmān parityajya</em> (giving up all _dharma_s) which are approved of by the wise are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) incompetence to do those things that are not within one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>power gives competence for <em>prapatti</em>; and  being destitute of all other _upāya_s is a qualification for <em>prapatti</em>;</p>
<p>(3) the _dharma_s or rites being no accessory or <em>aṅga</em> to <em>prapatti</em>;</p>
<p>(4) the prevention of effort in trying to do what is not possible</p>
<p>for one;</p>
<p>(5) the giving up of the desire to do what is beyond one&rsquo;s ability;</p>
<p>(6) the indication of the principle of the <em>Brahma</em> missile.</p>
<p>The interpretation (which is given by some) that what is asked to be given up is the _dharma_s or rites associated with other deities (than <em>Bhagavān</em>) is not objectionable, but as this applies to both the man who adopts <em>bhakti</em>  or <em>upāsana</em> and the man who adopts <em>prapatti</em>, this interpretation is inappropriate here (in the context especially relating to the <em>prapanna</em> ).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The giving &ldquo;up of _upāya_s&rdquo; stated in such passages as the following :-One should give up the _upāya_s and also the apāyas (those activities that are forbidden )&rdquo; should also be interpreted in the same way.</p>

<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORDS MĀM AND AHAM</p>
<p>IN THE <em>CARAMA</em> <em>ŚLOKA</em>:&ndash; page559</p>
<p>As stated in the context in the Gita, which describes the secret of <em>avatāra</em> or incarnation and that in which <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa” declares Himself as (<em>Puruṣottama</em>), the primary aim of the words <em>mām</em> (me) and <em>aham</em> (I) (in the <em>carama</em> s&rsquo;loka) is to disclose (<em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s) easy accessibility and His absolute independence (and omnipotence) respectively.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S:</p>
<p>अवतारस्य सत्यत्वमजहत्स्वस्वभावता ।</p>
<p>शुद्धसत्वमयत्वञ्च स्वेच्छामात्रनिदानता ॥</p>
<p>धर्मग्लानौ समुदयस्साधुसंरक्षणार्थता ।</p>
<p>इति जन्मरहस्यं यो वेत्ति नास्य पुनर्भवः ॥</p>
<p>He who knows the secret of incarnation to consist in its being real, in the incarnation continuing in its real nature (as <em>Bhagavān</em>) though incarnating in lower forms, in its being constituted of the (transcendental, substance called Śuddhasattvam in its being caused only by <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s own will or desire (and not by <em>karma</em> ); in its occurrence at a time when there is decline of <em>dharma</em> and in its being occasioned for the purpose of protecting the good &ndash; (he who knows all this) will never be born again.</p>
<p>This knowledge of the secret of incarnation is required for the <em>bhakta</em>, who has <em>prapatti</em> as an <em>aṅga</em>, to complete and perfect his <em>upāya</em>. To the man who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as the direct and independent means, it reveals the easy accessibility of the omnipotent and independent Lord. The accessibility and omnipotence which are declared in these two contexts are complementary to each other,</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S :</p>
<p>स्वतन्त्रस्यापि नैव स्यादाश्रयो दुर्लभस्य तु ।</p>
<p>अस्वतन्त्रात्फलन्नस्यात्सुलभादाश्रितादपि ॥</p>
<p>अस्वतन्त्रेन कैङ्कर्यं सिद्ध्येत्स्वैरप्रसङ्गतः ।</p>
<p>दुर्लभे साध्यमप्येतन्न हृद्यं लोकनीतितः ॥</p>
<p>Even if a person is independent and omnipotent, if he is not accessible, no one will seek him (for protection). Even if a person is sought (for protection) on account of his easy accessibility, he cannot award the desired fruit if he is dependent on others.</p>
<p>Towards one who is not independent, there is no possibility of rendering service, as the person rendering service, might think of acting as he pleases; and towards one who is not easily accessible, service might be possible though difficult, but as is seen in the world, it does not confer happiness or pleasure (on the person rendering service),</p>
<p>The Saviour who is both accessible and supreme is not only merely accessible like a blade of grass but exalted (in status and nature). Though exalted and supreme, he is not inaccessible like Mount Meru, but easily accessible. Therefore He is both capable of being sought (for protection) and capable of being attained. In these two words <em>mām</em> and <em>aham</em>, the eagerness with which the universal Saviour and <em>śeṣī</em> is awaiting an opportunity for protecting (the <em>jīva</em> ) is disclosed.</p>
<p><em>Iśvara</em> who thus waits for an occasion or opportunity as stated in the passage :&ndash; &quot; The Lord expects a prayer for protection,&rdquo; is ever favourably inclined saying, &quot; When will these (_jīva_s) pray for my help?&rdquo; This attitude of His is suggested by the word <em>mām</em> (me). The word <em>aham</em> (1) shows His attitude of readiness to confer for His own glory, the desired fruit as quickly as possible saying, “ When shall I take back (and wear) (these _jīva_s) like jewels from which the dirt (<em>prakṛti</em>) has been removed,&quot;</p>
<p>Thus the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> indicates by the words <em>mām</em> and ekam (me alone) the <em>Siddhopāya</em> who does not require anything else than the surrender of responsibility (<em>bharanyāsa</em>) with the prayer for protection performed according to the injunction. And by the words saranam vraja (seek as refuge or <em>upāya</em>) it shows, in the form of an injunction (<em>vidhi</em>) <em>Sādhyopāya</em> (namely, <em>prapatti</em>) which is the means of winning His grace. Since the <em>vidyā</em> called <em>prapatti</em>, which is here enjoined, is ordained as a means of propitiating the Saviour, it becomes an <em>upāya</em> and resembles in that respect <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em>. <em>Iśvara</em> who is propitiated thereby is the direct means or <em>upāya</em> for <em>mokṣa</em>. What has to be understood as a distinguishing feature of this vidyāi (<em>prapatti</em>) is its being an <em>upāya</em> which does not require (any aid or accessory). All the attributes necessary for this purpose are also signified in the words <em>mām</em> and ekam (me alone).</p>
<p>By the word <em>mām</em> (me) which denotes the Saviour whose nature is indicated in such <em>śloka_s as the following: &ldquo;This Nārāyaṇa who has the ocean of milk as His abode has now come to the city of Madhura leaving His bed of Adi_śeṣa</em>&rdquo; by this word ( <em>mām</em>) are disclosed His being the Universal Saviour, His being the universal <em>Śeṣī</em>, His being the Lord of <em>Śrī</em>, His being Nārāyaṇa (the resting place of Naras) which are revealed in Tiru_mantra_ and <em>Dvaya</em>, and so also the qualities which can be inferred from them, namely, omniscience, omnipotence and the like, and, 30 also, such qualities as Ilis being supremely compassionate, His good nature (sauśīlya) and His love which are all the marks of supremacy and accessibility. (&lsquo;The word <em>mām</em> also discloses ), like the word having the dual termination, viz, <em>caraṇau</em> (the two feet) in <em>Dvaya</em>, the divinely auspicious form of Pārthasārathi which suggests both His being the Supreme Being and His easy accessibility and which is our auspicious refuge. Here these four qualities of His, namely, His love, His being the Master, His good nature (sauśīlya) and His accessibility which are stated in such passages as the following :&ndash; &ldquo;O Thou that hast incomparable attributes, Thou that ownest the three worlds, Thou that art my Saviour! Thou that dwellest on Mount Veṅkatam, which is eagerly longed for by hosts of incomparable gods and rishis!&rdquo; - these four qualities are revealed when <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa did not treat Arjuna&rsquo;s misplaced compassion and affection at the beginning with disregard, when He Himself declared : &quot; There is no one higher than I &ldquo;, when He served as charioteer to Arjuna who addressed Him as “O, Krishṇa O Yādava&rdquo; and said &quot; Drive my chariot and station it between the two armies&quot; and when, at Arjuna&rsquo;s request, He revealed to Him His universal form immanent in all things and when later, as soon as he prayed to see His former delightful form as <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa, He stood before him once again as his charioteer. Among the aforesaid qualities of the Saviour, the most important attributes that are essential for the protection of those who seek Him have been briefly set forth in the Bhagavat <em>Śāstra</em>: &ldquo;Though <em>Bhagavān</em> who keeps all under His control is both omniscient and compassionate, He expects a prayer for protection, since He has to conduct the course of the world of <em>samsāra</em>&rdquo; anil in this <em>śloka</em> of the wise āchārya, “In the face of &lsquo;Thy omniscience, omnipotence and compassion, my sins cannot bear fruit.&quot; Among these three qualities, knowledge and might tre required in common for conferring punishment and favour. l&rsquo;he Lord&rsquo;s being the Master serves the purpose both of His deriving the delight of Līlā from man in <em>samsāra</em> and His deriving enjoyment or bhoga in <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em> from the soul that has obtained <em>mukti</em>, So this attribute of Lordship cannot restrain the Lord&rsquo;s jñāna or knowledge and <em>śakti</em> or might so as to operate only in the work of protection. Compassion and its varieties (literally - branches) good nature, love and the like are solely responsible for the conferment of favours. The ancients who appreciated this distinguishing feature of mercy wrote as follows:&ndash;&ldquo;O Thou &ldquo;that art the Lord of <em>Brahma</em>, the god of the gods! I have not the ability to adore Thee or to praise Thee. (Therefore) with compassion alone in Thy heart, bestow Thy grace on me.&rdquo; &ldquo;I relied on Thy compassion alone for protection.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will not believe that I could be saved by anything other than Thy compassion,&rdquo; &ldquo;I look to Thy compassion alone for salvation,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Thou that, in spite of having the glorious <em>Lakṣmī</em>, art so full of compassion as to come and abide permanently in my heart&rdquo;, It is impossible&rdquo; to protect me except with Thy holy compassion,&quot; &ldquo;I will sweep Thy temple (and render such other service) being the recipient of Thy compassion and the compassion of Thy consort who dwells in the lotus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Showing&rdquo; Thy mercy with the exclamation &lsquo;Ha! Ha!!&quot;, &ldquo;Show me only Thy compassion so that I, Thy servant, may realise that I have nothing else to attain than Thee and that I have no other <em>upāya</em> (than Thee ) and so that I may find delight only in rendering service to Thee.&rdquo; &ldquo;O Lord of Hastigiri! Those that are devoted to Thee by their qualities and actions with the knowledge of Thee &ndash; it is Thy compassion which has made them devoted to thee. I consider that only that compassion is a source of strength to me who am destitute of _upāya_s.&rdquo; In these Ways, these ancients looked lipon (the Lord&rsquo;s) compassion by their refuge and considered the relationship of the <em>śeṣī</em> to the <em>śeṣa</em> and other qualities (of the Lord) as the obedient servants of compassion and became solely dependent on the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, Sītā devi also said, in spite of the existence of other qualities: &ldquo;Rāma, the descendant of Kakustha, extended his protection to him (Kakasura), out of compassion, though he deserved the punishment of being killed”.</p>
<p>Since <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> has also written in his <em>Gadya</em> &ldquo;At <sup id="fnref:341"><a href="#fn:341" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">341</a></sup> the time of the death of the body, you will, by my grace alone, become wise and have a vision of me etc.,&rdquo; the primary importance of (the Lord&rsquo;s) compassion is indicated. Facing (Arjuna) with this primary quality so essential for protection and other attributes which are ancillary to it, <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa referred to Himself as <em>mām</em> (me).</p>
<p>Bhagavan&rsquo;s words to Sri Ramanuja</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF EKAM IN THE <em>CARAMA</em> <em>ŚLOKA</em>: page564</p>
<p>(1: While the singular form <em>mām</em>(me) itself indicates the idea of alone&rsquo; (ekam), the further use of the word <em>ekam</em> is, according to some, to disclose that He who is the object of attainment is Himself the means or <em>upāya</em> for that attainment like the (celestial) <em>kalpaka</em> tree giving itself (to those that ask). Thus (these commentators) suggest that the use of <em>ekam</em> after <em>mām</em> is to suggest the identity of the object of attainment and the means of attaining it. This interpretation finds support in the sentence <em>mām ekam eva</em> in a similar context :- &quot; By all means, seek the protection only of me alone who am the inner self of all beings, You will then have no fear of any kind.&rdquo; Since the word eva (only) is already present, it is but proper to seek some other purpose for the existence or use of the word <em>ekam</em> in addition to only. (This purpose is the declaration of the oneness of the means and the end).</p>
<p>(2) As against this, others say that the word ekam which has the following nieanings: &lsquo;chief&rsquo;, &lsquo;something other than&rsquo;, and ‘there is no other than this&rsquo;, is, in this sentence, a mere synonym of &rsquo;no other&rsquo; and means &lsquo;only&rsquo; or &lsquo;alone&rsquo; as in the _śloka_s, “Those who seek me alone (and no other) as their refuge will surmount the insurmountable māyā&quot; and &ldquo;Seek the protection of Him alone (and no other)&rdquo;. In this way they mention that by emphasising the fullness of the qualities of the Saviour, one is made to understand that one cannot adopt an <em>upāya</em> by one&rsquo;s own independence. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows:-&ldquo;As the man adopts, for his own protection, the means ordained for Him by the _śāstra_s for propitiating (the Lord), it is just possible that he might think of himself also as doing something for his protection on an equal footing with the Saviour who is the <em>Siddhopāya</em>. Taking into account this possibility, the word <em>eka</em> denies that there is any <em>upāya</em> other than the Lord to make the _upāya_s two. If it be asked how this denial is made, the answer is as follows: It is true that the <em>jīva</em> is the doer according to the pramāņas, for it is stated: - &ldquo;He is the doer; otherwise the _śāstra_s could have no meaning or purpose&rdquo;. Still this doership of the <em>jīva</em> is dependent on the Supreme Being and is very limited (in its scope) besides being subject to hindrances. Therefore though he adopts the <em>upāya</em>, it is only on account of the Lord&rsquo;s grace as stated in the <em>śloka</em> :&ndash; &quot; Without Thy compassion, O Varada, even the prayer that Thou shouldst be my <em>upāya</em> would not arise from me.&rdquo; When the Lord withholds His help and stimulation, the <em>jīva</em> cannot even stretch out his limbs or bend them. Therefore he practises the <em>upāya</em> revealed by the Lord, with the help of the body and the senses given by Him and with His help and looks up to Him like the chātaka bird for the desired fruit to be given by Him. So it is improper for the intelligent aspirant to <em>mukti</em> to consider himself, as another <em>Siddhopāya</em> equal to the Lord, who is absolutely independent of others and whose activities extend everywhere and can meet with no hindrances or obstacles. This is, according to these commentators, the purport of the word <em>eka.</em> (only He and no other). (3) Following this line of reasoning, they say also that the word <em>eka</em> (one) is used to prevent the consideration of <em>prapatti</em> which is <em>sādhyopāya</em> as being equal to <em>Siddhopāya</em>. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows:- Although like <em>bhakti</em> . <em>yoga</em>, <em>prapatti</em> too, has been enjoined as an endeavour to propiti. ate (the Lord), yet its purpose is merely to allay the displeasure of the Supreme Ruler who has innate compassion and other such qualities. For the direct attainment of the desired fruit, it is only the will of the Lord who has, by His very nature, the ability and the compassion (necessary for protecting the <em>jīva</em>) - it is only His will that is the cause. He accepts the responsibility for protecting the <em>prapanna</em> who is absolutely destitute of _upāya_s and Himself stands in the place of such more difficult _upāya_s as <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em>. He expects only the <em>vyāja</em> (pretext or gesture ) of <em>prapatti</em> accompanied by such things as the will to do what is pleasing to Him. This nyāsa <em>vidyā</em> does not require any ancillary rite or accessory and has this as its distinguishing feature. Therefore in this <em>vidyā</em>, He is the only <em>upāya</em> to be prayed for as stated in the following passages: &ldquo;Śaraṇāgati consists in the thought &ldquo;I pray that Thou alone shouldst be my <em>upāya</em>&rdquo;; &ldquo;I made Him the subject of the thought that the Lord should be my <em>upāya</em>. Even this became possible only by virtue of His compassion.&rdquo; &ldquo;O Lord that mad&rsquo;st me consent and placed me beneath Thy feet I&rdquo; As stated in these passages, to piace the mere <em>vyāja</em> or pretext vis. <em>prapatti</em>, which too was inspired only by Him acting as the <em>upāya</em> to place it on an equal footing with Him is not proper. This is the purport of the word eka (only · no other).</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the fact that <em>Sādhyopāya</em> is a inere pretext or gesture (<em>vyāja</em>) in relation to <em>Siddhopāya</em> and is without any importance, some (writers) exaggerated its insignificance by stating that <em>prapatti</em> consists merely in (1) the knowledge of the relation of the <em>śeṣa</em> to the s&rsquo;eshī (2) the mere knowledge that the Lord is the <em>Siddhopāya</em>, (3) nonresistance (to His grace) (4) mere acceptance or receptivity (5) the attitude of being different from <em>acit</em> or non-sentient matter (6) the activity of the sentient being and (7) serenity of mind (8) an attribute of the adhikārī. From these (exaggerated statements) it is not proper to conclude that any of them is the real meaning of <em>prapatti</em>, for the purport (of these exaggerations) is quite different. All these interpretations are opposed to the positive injunction contained in <em>śaraṇam vraja</em> (seek me as Thy Saviour). They would also lead to too wide an application (atipras_aṅga_). We will explain how:- (1) &amp; (2) If <em>prapatti</em> were to consist only in the knowledge of the relationship of the <em>śeṣa</em> to the <em>śeṣin</em> or in the knowledge that the Lord is <em>Siddhopāya</em>, then since this knowledge would of itself arise from the sentence or text (stating it), there would be no need to state it in the form of an injunction (ordaining &lsquo;know this &ldquo;). If it be said that <em>mokṣa</em> might result from mere knowledge and without doing the thing enjoined in a <em>vidhi</em> or injunction, it would, as explained in <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> and elsewhere (Vedārthasangraha), be opposed to (the spirit of) the injunctions directing one to upāsanas; if it be held that the man who has a knowledge of the truth should thereby acquire a different kind of knowledge called <em>prapatti</em>, then the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of this knowledge should be understood in accordance with the texts or passages ordaining the <em>dharma</em> (ś&rsquo;araṇam vraja), those that describe or define its characteristics (that it can yield fruits not attainable otherwise etc.) and those that prescribe the manner of adopting it (anushṭhāna) (the utterance of the <em>Dvaya</em> and the like). If the statement that <em>prapatti</em> consists only in the acceptance of <em>Siddhopāya</em> were true, it would mean that the man should first know <em>Siddhopāya</em> and then perform the action called &lsquo;surrender of responsibility (<em>bharanyāsa</em>) for which he is competent and that this surrender should be preceded by the prayer enjoined in the vidhis or injunctions, (3) If <em>prapatti</em> were to consist in mere non-resistance (to the Lord&rsquo;s grace), it would mean (a) that it was possible for him to resist <em>Iśvara</em> owing to superior strength. This would imply that <em>Iśvara</em> is not omnipotent or (b) If resistance means resisting the Lord&rsquo;s grace by committing an offence and incurring punishment, it would follow that <em>prapatti</em> is only a means of propitiation (c) If resistance means resisting in means of one&rsquo;s own activity to protect oneself, then since there is no such resistance of the nature of activity in such states as pralaya and <em>suṣupti</em> (dreamless sleep) and so also in the waking stake when the man is capable of action but does not act, <em>Iśvara</em> would have to</p>
<p>award <em>mokṣa</em> to him. (4) If <em>prapatti</em> were to consist in mere acceptance, it would then stand on the same footing as <em>upāsana</em>. There would be no difference between the <em>bhakta</em> and the <em>prapanna</em>. (5) If <em>prapatti</em> were to consist merely in being different from non-sentient things, it would be present even when the man acts against the will of God. This, certainly, could not be the cause of being saved or protected. (6) If <em>prapatti</em> were to consist in the mere activity of the sentient being, not only upāsanas but other activities of the sentient being (like eating, breathing, etc.,) would lie the cause of salvation. There would then be no difference between <em>prapatti</em> and all these activities. If it be said that <em>prapatti</em> is what happens to a man of its own accord, there would then be no need for instructions (upadeśa&rsquo;) concerning it. (7) If it be said that <em>prapatti</em> means serenity of mind without the purpose of obtaining any fruit, then it would vary with different individuals in accordance with their respective tastes. (8) If <em>prapatti</em> were a mere attribute of the adhikāri (and not something to be done), the word vraja would be improper, for it lays down something to be done and there is no reference to any fruit or the desire for it (and the like). So it would not be proper to call <em>prapatti</em> an attribute of the adhikārī<sup id="fnref:342"><a href="#fn:342" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">342</a></sup> . If it were possible to condemn (the performance of) <em>prapatti</em> in these ways, although it is enjoined as something to be performed, it would be equally possible to condemn also upāsanas and the like in the same manner In that case, the attempt to distinguish <em>prapatti</em> from upāsanas and the like (which was the reason for the argument) would fail. If it be said that though this <em>Siddhopāya</em> (<em>Iśvara</em> ) has accepted the responsibility of protecting one and is bent op granting the (desired) fruit, yet the man should consider that this acceptance is unnecessary, <em>prapatti</em> would then be a case of meditating on what is not true (drishti <em>vidhi</em>)<sup id="fnref:343"><a href="#fn:343" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">343</a></sup> (and it would not lead to <em>mokṣa</em> ).</p>
<p>“He who desires svarga should perform Jyotiṣṭoma&rdquo;. In this sentence, the adhikārī is seen to be one who desires a certain fruit, namely Svarga.</p>
<p>Drishti vidhi eg. &ldquo;Imagine the mind to be Brahman and meditate on it&rdquo;. This kind of meditation would not lead to moksha.</p>
<p>If it means the thought that the acceptance by <em>Iśvara</em>, too, is unnecessary, it would be opposed to the idea contained in the words of the Lord <em>śaraṇam vraja</em> (seek me as the Saviour).</p>
<p>Therefore <em>Iśvara</em> is the object of propitiation and He is the <em>Siddhopāya</em> and is of great importance. Both <em>bhakti</em>  and <em>prapatti</em> are ways of propitiation and are _Sādhyopāya_s which are not so important. (The aspirant to <em>mukti</em>) should be firmly established in either of these two, according to his competence.</p>
<p>(4) It has also been stated by some (_ācārya_s) that the word eka is employed to indicate how the Saviour, who has accepted the responsibility, stands alone, requiring nothing else after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, so that there need be no adoption of any of the means (like <em>upāsana</em>) prescribed for the attainment of the desired fruit. This may be explained as follows :&mdash; If a person has performed <em>prapatti</em> as an <em>aṅga</em> and then adopts also upāsanas  and the like as angī, the Saviour becomes the <em>upāya</em> for the fruit desired. In the case of the man who adopts <em>prapatti</em> as a direct and independent means, being destitute of the other pros and impatient of delay, the game <em>Iśvara</em> takes, upon his own qualities, the burden that lies between <em>prapatti</em> and Himself. As stated in the following passages :- &quot; Those who are incapable of bhaktı <em>yoga</em> and seek Thee as <em>upāya</em> they, too, pass beyond <em>samsāra</em> and reach Thy abode, Vaikuṇṭha”, and &ldquo;Thou hast Thyself given Thy feet as the fruit of my attainment and as the <em>upāya</em> for attaining it&rdquo; - as stated here, the Lord himself, who is endowed with the qualities essential for it, stands as the Dispenser of the fruit desired, without requiring any ancillary rite or <em>dharma</em>. Therefore what is stated in the <em>carama</em>.<em>śloka</em> comes to this :- &quot; Bear this in mind and seek Me alone for your salvation&rdquo;. (5) It is said by some that the word <em>eka</em> is used here for the purpose of making it clear that, when <em>prapatti</em> is performed to Him who is perfect in every way, nothing else is required except such as the will to do what is pleasing to the Lord. Therefore the Lord teaches that one should not introduce, into this, ancillary rites such as are required for the vidyās, under the impression that they, too, form _upāya_s for propitiating Him. The Lord&rsquo;s purport (in the <em>śloka</em>) is as follows &ndash;&quot; <em>Prapatti</em> does not require any aids such as are performed either because they are my commands or because their performance is approved of by me. When I become gracious owing to the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, I am bent on granting the desired fruit and stand as the one and only surety for this <em>upāya</em> which is capable of being performed in an instant. In regard to the fruit of this <em>prapatti</em>, nothing else need be performed. I do not require any such aid in regard to my determination to save Thee&quot;. This amounts to saying that, with the exception of such things as the will to do what is pleasing (to the Lord), no other auxiliary causes should be added on in the name of ancillaries to <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>As stated (in the <em>Śaraṇāgati</em> <em>Gadya</em> &quot; Thou that utterest the <em>Dvaya</em> in some manner or other&quot; and in Varadarāja stava. “By the mere words which state <em>prapatti</em>, I long to see Thee - Thee that canst not be attained by <em>bhakti</em> &ldquo;, even though a man has not the clear understanding necessary for the full and perfect performance of <em>prapatti</em>, this <em>upāya</em> will be effective even if it be adopted in a less satisfactory manner. Therefore there is certainly no need to seek ancillary rites or _dharma_s for this <em>upāya</em>.</p>
<p>(It is true that) (in the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>) it is stated :- &quot; Then Rāma,&rdquo; the slayer of his enemies, spread kuśa grass on the beach, had his arm shining like the body of a serpent for his pillow, folded his hands in añjali and lay down facing the east and expecting the arrival of the god of the ocean&quot; and, likewise, in the story of _Brahma_datta in the episode of Saptavyādha, “The king was in great danger and sought with devotion Nārāyaṇa, the chief of the gods, the Saviour and the Ruler over all, as his <em>upāya</em> with concentration of mind and fasting for six nights. The renowned king saw in his contemplation (<em>dhyāna</em>) the Lord Nārāyaṇa&quot; But these ancillary rites that are described in the Rāmāyaṇa and Harivamśa) are not necessary for <em>prapatti</em>. In these two places, what is of importance is the ritual of sitting with the intention of starving onto death and therefore the ancillary actions described there are proper. The same explanation holds good in the case of namaskāra well performed. (There is no <em>prapatti</em> in all these cases). But in <em>prapatti</em>, no other requisites are needed except such as the will to do what is pleasing to the Lord - such as are stated in the chapters on <em>Prapatti</em>. We do not find any ancillary rites except such requisites, at the time, as the will to do what is pleasing. in the following instances of those who performed <em>prapatti</em> with only their being destitute of all _upāya_s for their sole wealth. (a) Draupadi, (b) Damayanti, (c) Rākṣasis, (d) Vibhishana, (e) Kshatrabandbu, (f) Muchukunda, (g) Gajendra, (h) the pāṇḍavas, (i) the gods, (j) Sumukha. (k) Triśanku, (1) Śunaśśepha, (m) Kirāta, (n) kāka, (o) Kapota<sup id="fnref:344"><a href="#fn:344" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">344</a></sup> and the like. We find that, by the instantaneous performance of mere <em>prapatti</em> without any other requisites, the desired fruit was obtained) by each of these that sought protection in the same manner, even in <em>prapatti</em> performed for the sake of <em>mokṣa</em>, there is nothing to prevent the attainment of the fruit at the desired time. This is the purport also of the words <em>mā s&rsquo;uchah</em> (Do not grieve).</p>
<p>(a) to Krishna at the time of the removal of her sari: (b) to the gods at the time of the Swayamvara: (c) Trijata to Sita: d) to Rama: e) to Bhagavan after Narada&rsquo;s advice (f) when the Lord appeared before him; (g) to Bhagavan; h) to Bhagavan (i to Bhagavan; (j) to Upendra in dread of garuda; (k) to Visvamitra; (1) to Visvamitra; (m) to the pigeon; (n) to Rama; (o) to Sibi</p>
<p>If <em>parityajya</em> is interpreted to mean that there is nothing else required for <em>prapatti</em>, this interpretation of the word <em>eka</em> may be considered as confirming or emphasizing this. (It need not therefore be looked upon as redundant). Or the word eka may be considered to have another meaning, namely, the idea of the <em>upāya</em> and the <em>upeya</em> being the same. If the word eka is considered as stating that <em>prapatti</em> does not require anything else, then the word <em>parityajya</em> may be considered as having the other meanings stated before.</p>
<p>If it be asked why the word <em>eka</em> should be used as an adjective of the Saviour, when (properly speaking), it should qualify <em>prapatti</em> (so that it might mean that <em>prapatti</em> alone is necessary without any ancillary _dharma_s), the answer is as follows: The words, <em>mām ekam</em> (me alone) are employed to show that, in the case of the man destitute of other _upāya_s, these ancillary _dharma_s other than <em>prapatti</em> are in no way connected with the Saviour as the means of propitiating Him. (6) It is also stated by some (commentators) that, as in the first half of the <em>śloka</em> we find the words <em>sarva dharmān</em> (all _dharma_s) and in the second half the word <em>sarva pāpebhyo</em> (from all sins), the word <em>eka</em> stands here as the counterpart or counterpoise to the world all. If this be admitted, then the gist of the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> would be:</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em>:</p>
<p>सुदुष्करेण शोचेद्यो येनयेनेष्टहेतुना ।</p>
<p>स स तस्याहमेवेति चरमश्लोकसंग्रहः ॥</p>
<p>If a man is in despair because of his inability to adopt such means or _upāya_s as will yield the respective fruits desired by him, then, I myself (single as I am) will stand for him as the respective means or <em>upāya</em> to enable him to secure that fruit.&quot;</p>
<p>This statement may be explained as follows: &ldquo;Whatever be the object that a man, whoever be may be, wishes to attain and whatever be the means or _upāya_s by which he cannot attain them and likewise, the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em> desired by the aspirant, which cannot be attained by <em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em>, <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em> and <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em>, all these fruits, can, O great sage, be attained by <em>prapatti</em>. The place desired by the aspirant to <em>mukti</em> is that supreme abode from which the man who reaches it never returns&rdquo;. As declared (in the passage cited above), when a man falls into grief because he cannot obtain any one of the fruits desired by him either because of ignorance of the means prescribed in the _śāstra_s for acquiring the respective fruit, or because even while possessing that knowledge, he is unable to adopt the prescribed means, or because, while possessing both (the knowledge and the ability), he is too impatient to wait until the time when the fruit will be attained thereby - (when a man falls into grief in this way) the <em>Carama</em>-<em>śloka</em> declares to him, “ You need not go about in search of these means. I will myself be the only and sole <em>upāya</em> for your attainment of all these fruits, provided I am propitiated by the performance of <em>prapatti</em>. The <em>Carama</em> <em>Śloka</em> says, as it were :- &quot; This single and sovereign medicine will give you all the health which a larger number of other medicines may confer on you. It is enough, if, instead of falling into despair, you take this single medicine. This will cure all the ailments that can be cured by other medicines. After taking this medicine, you can enjoy all pleasures. Therefore you need not fall into despair thinking that you have lost your health and the pleasures.&quot; This is, as it were, the meaning of the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em>.</p>
<p>Though the word <em>eka</em> stands as the counter-part of the word <em>sarva</em> (all) and qualifies the Saviour as He is most important being the Sidhopāya, yet it is tantamount to stating that <em>prapatti</em> alone is enjoined as the single <em>dharma</em> in the place of all other _dharma_s, as in the phrase &quot; by <em>nyāsa</em> alone&quot; From this it follows that even those who desire the three ends (other than <em>mokṣa</em> (viz). (<em>dharma</em>, artha and kāma) may perform prupatti to <em>Bhagavān</em> for securing them. So it is not proper to have any contact with other deities except as they figure as attributes to the Lord in the performance of the <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> rites, as stated in such _śloka_s as the following:-&ldquo;I am propitiating Him from whom, O lndra, you have obtained your position of lordship. I will not adore you. Here is my anjali to you. You may strike me with your thunderbolt or abstain from doing so. I will never adore any one but Govinda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even those who seek other _upāya_s for attaining <em>mokṣa</em> (like <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em>) may perform <em>prapatti</em> in order to get rid of the hindrances in the way (of those _upāya_s). <em>Prapatti</em> is suitable in the case also of those who want to get rid of obstacles to the attainment (of <em>Bhagavān</em> ) viz, sins and this is declared here (in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>) to show that it is capable of securing any fruit that may be desired (by one). The idea that <em>prapatti</em> will destroy the obstacles to the _upāya_s for attainment (namely, sins) is conveyed (by <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>) in his Gitā <em>Bhāṣya</em> in his second interpretation (of the <em>śloka</em>). In the <em>Gadya</em>, he has declared that <em>prapatti</em> will help to get rid of the hindrances to the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em> It does not mean that, in those two places, <em>Śrī</em> Rāmānuja expresses one of these two ideas in disregard of the other. Both passages illustrate the potency of this <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) which cın secure all desired ends. The _praṇava_n (<em>aum</em>) enters into the body of another <em>mantra</em>, viz. <em>namo</em> Nārāyaṇāya as a part thereof and yet is itself an independent <em>mantra</em>. So also this <em>prapatti</em> forms an <em>aṅga</em> to <em>bhakti</em>  in the case of others. This is evident from the authority of the texts. That <em>bhakti</em>  and <em>prapatti</em> stand as alternative _upāya_s determined by the competence of the persons concerned is evident from such passages as the following: &ldquo;I am capable of being attained O, Thou of great wisdom, either by deep <em>bhakti</em>  or by <em>prapatti</em> on the part of those who desire to render service to me, I cannot be attained by any other means &ldquo;.</p>
<p>(There is a well-known <em>śloka</em> which says):- &ldquo;A man attains <em>mokṣa</em> either by right knowledge, or by death in the waters of the G_aṅga_ or by namaskāra well-performed or by <em>bhakti</em> &ldquo;. In such passages those that are direct means of attaining <em>mukti</em> are stated along with others that are not direct but only auxiliary. This is only a way of exaggerating the importance of these indirect means.</p>

<p>Six meanings have (thus) been pointed out by_ācārya_s for the word eka. They are (1) the identity of the object of attainment (<em>Bhagavān</em>) and the means or <em>upāya</em> for that attainment (2) the denial of one&rsquo;s own importance (i. e. of the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s works); (3) <em>prapatti</em> being only a mere pretext or gesture (<em>vyāja</em>). (4) the absence of any relation or connection between <em>prapatti</em> and other _upāya_s; (5) and likewise, the absence of any relation or connection between <em>prapatti</em> and the _aṅga_s or ancillary _dharma_s (<em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em>, etc.) of other _upāya_s (like <em>bhakti</em> ) and (6) <em>prapatti</em> as a single means of securing all desired ends without any distinction whatsoever.</p>
<p>THE SAVIOUR IS BHAGAVAN WITH <em>ŚRĪ</em> AS HIS</p>
<p>ATTRIBUTE: page575</p>
<p>There are some commentators who state that the meaning of the word eka (a single one) declares that the Saviour is only one (namely, <em>Bhagavān</em>) and that <em>Śrī</em> has nothing to do with salvation). But their contention does not stand to reason. Just as qualities and forms qualify the Lord as His attributes, so also <em>Śrī</em> is an attribute of His (inseparable from Him). She is the ruler over all beings and is dear to <em>Bhagavān</em> and is declared in the _śruti_s as sharing in His duties and as ever bent on protecting those that seek her help. Though it is stated (in the Chandogya Upaniṣad and other Vedic texts) that the material cause of the Universe is only one (sat), yet other things that are requisite as material causes are understood as existing as His attributes (viz. <em>cit</em> and <em>acit</em> in their subtle and unmanifested forms) on the authority of the pramāņas. So also in this context, <em>Śrī</em> should be understood, although not distinctly stated. Even when a single form of <em>upāsana</em> or meditation is enjoined, the qualities that are connected with the object of meditation enter also into it. Similarly though a single deity is enjoined as the Saviour to be sought, <em>Śrī</em>, who is His attribute, should also be considered as being associated with Him (in the act of salvation). The <em>Siddhopāya</em> (namely, <em>Bhagavān</em> ) is (of course) single but His qualities remain with Him (though not explicitly stated). In the same way, in the opinion of those who see with the eye of the <em>Śāstra</em>, <em>Lakṣmī</em> (His spouse) is associated inseparably with Him as an attribute, Light and the object emitting light (are inseparable from each other) and when one is mentioned , the other is also presint by association. Likewise when either (<em>Bhagavān</em> or <em>Śrī</em>) is mentioned, the other is also present by virtue of their being always with each other. Sages have declared in the _smṛti_s that she helps (_jīva_s) to cross the sea of <em>samsāra</em> and both of them (<em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Śrī</em>) have themselves spoken to the same effect in such (samhitas) treatises as sātvatam. In <em>Dvaya</em> it is considered appropriate that <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service in the state of attainment (<em>mokṣa</em>) should extend to <em>Śrī</em> (as to <em>Bhagavān</em>) So <em>Śrī</em> is equally connected with Him in both the states, that of the endeavour for attaining <em>mokṣa</em> (the first half of <em>Dvaya</em>) and that after attainment (the second half of it). Therefore, on the authority of many Vedic texts and _Śruti_s which cannot be stated to have some other purport, the single one who is to be sought as the Saviour is the Lord with His attribute <em>Śrī</em> who is His consort.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD SARANAM IN THE</p>
<p><em>CARAMA</em>-<em>ŚLOKA</em>: page576</p>
<p>The meanings that have (already) been given to the word <em>ś&rsquo;araṇam</em> occurring in <em>Dvayam</em> (on p. ) should be borne in mind in regard to the word <em>śaraṇam</em> employed here in the <em>carama</em>-<em>śloka</em>. This prayer for refuge or <em>upāya</em> (saranam though taught to Arjuna, should be considered applicable to all and this is evident from the<sup id="fnref:345"><a href="#fn:345" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">345</a></sup> Svetāsvatara Upaniṣad and from <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s words in the (<em>Śaraṇāgati</em>) <em>Gadya</em>: &ldquo;O Thou that art the Saviour of all beings in the world ignoring the differences that may exist among those that seek Thee&rdquo;. Similarly in such passages as the following :- “Those Brahmins who know the first part of the Veda and those people who understand the meaning of its latter part declare that the Supreme Being, <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa, is the ever-existing <em>dharma</em> or <em>upāya</em> &ldquo;, &quot; The great and eminent Rishis say that Thou art the refuge and the Saviour of those that have sought Thy protection&rdquo;. &ldquo;He is the &ldquo;Yoga (<em>upāya</em>) and the one who leads those who know <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em> to their goal&rdquo;. and &ldquo;<em>Bhagavān</em> whom the wise call the eternal means (<em>upāya</em>) and the goal of attainment&rdquo; &ndash; (in such passages ) also, since there is no limitation of meaning, it has to be understood that the Saviour is for all. The only requisite for seeking Him as the Saviour or Refuge is that the person should be destitute of any other refuge or protector.</p>
<p>VI chapter, 18: Desirous of mukti I seek refuge of HIM who created Brahma before and taught him the Vedas.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD VRAJA: page577</p>
<p>The word vraja also, like the word prapadye (in <em>Dvaya</em> ) enjoins self-surrender with all its auxiliaries. In the word (prapadye in <em>Dvaya</em>), the first person is used, because it is the thought or meditation in the mind of the man who performs <em>prapatti</em>. Here (in the <em>caramaśloka</em>) it is in the second person, since the injunction is addressed to the man (Arjuna) who stands opposite to the Lord (i.e.) <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa saying: &ldquo;I am Thy disciple and (it is only fitting that) Thou shouldst order me to do what is right&rdquo;. Auxiliaries like the will to do what is pleasing to the Lord are also indicated here and may be found suggested in <sup id="fnref:346"><a href="#fn:346" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">346</a></sup> suitable words as in <em>Dvaya</em>, There is a ( well-known) principle which states: “When an action is enjoined in the <em>śāstra</em>, a single performance of it satisfies the requirements of the <em>Śāstra</em>&rdquo;. The <em>upāsana</em> however, is an exception to this general rule because it requires frequent repetition. But <em>prapatti</em> is no such exception (and hence a single performance will quite do ). This statement is confirmed also by such words as the following: -&ldquo;To the man who performs <em>prapatti</em> only once and says &ldquo;I exist for Thee &quot; - to that man I grant freedom from fear from all beings. This is my vow&rdquo;. To the man who performs <em>bharanyāsa</em> (the surrender of responsibility) to the generous and omnipotent (Lord), there is no reason for delay in the attainment except his own desire. Therefore in the case of this <em>nyāsa</em> <em>vidyā</em>, the peculiarity is that it arrests even the consequences of past <em>karma</em> which have already begun to operate (prarabdha <em>karma</em> ).</p>
<p>The will to do what is pleasing and to avoid what is displeasing in ‘mām’; being destitute of all means in ‘parityajya’ and intense faith, and the prayer for protection in ‘śaraṇam vraja’.</p>
<p>In this connection some (commentators) ask &ldquo;An action may be enjoined for performance only by a man who has freedom of will and action, How can an action be enjoined (in the word vraja) for performance by one who has been taught as being absolutely dependent (on the Lord) in the Vedanta and other _śāstra_s treating of the self and in such as the mool <em>mantra</em>? This (question) is the result of an inadequate understanding of what is meant by complete dependence on another the Lord). As determined in vedanta (_śāstra_s), “He (i.e.)the <em>jīva</em> is the doer; otherwise the _śāstra_s which enjoin _dharma_s would have no purpose or meaning&rdquo;, and &quot; The doership (of the <em>jīva</em>) is dependent on the Supreme Self, for the <em>śruti</em> says so&rdquo;. Since the <em>jīva</em> is an agent or doer subject to the will of <em>Bhagavān</em>, there is nothing to prevent an injunction asking him to do something.</p>
<p>Just as non-sentient things (<em>acit</em>) like ether and fire bear the attributes respectively of sound and heat created by <em>Iśvara</em>, the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s absolute dependence on <em>Iśvara</em> consists in bearing this burden of free will (and responsibility) (granted to him by <em>Iśvara</em>). If it be maintained that he has no responsibility at all as a doer or agent, it would be like the heresies (siddhanta) which attribute doership (respectively) to <em>prakṛti</em> and a_vidyā_ (Sankhya and Advaita). If (on the other hand) it be maintained that the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s doership is dependent only on himself (and on nobody else), then since it would resemble the heresy which does not admit the existence of one who is in supreme control of all selves, it would be a form of atheism.  If it is held that the doership which comes from the will of the Lord is merely the state of being the knower, there would be no such thing as a desire for the ends of life (<em>puruṣārtha</em>) and the endeavour to attain them. It it be held that apart from the knowledge and the particular form of knowledge called desire, there is no such thing as effort (or mental activity), it would be impossible to adopt any means for securing objects that are t_aṅgī_ble or int_aṅgī_ble and for rendering service for its own sake . Therefore it has to be admitted that the self has these three (attributes):&ndash;knowledge, desire, and effort (knowing, feeling and willing). Among these (three), desire and effort are only different modifications or states of knowledge and this may be understood from the principle of logical economy <sup id="fnref:347"><a href="#fn:347" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">347</a></sup> adopted by <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> in his Vedārthasangraha.</p>
<p>Logical Economy:  Instead of saying that the fragrance of a flower is known to be or is experienced as agreeable and that this knowledge or experience gives rise to pleasure (or sukha ), we may, as well. say that the agreeable is itself pleasure and is therefore a form or state of knowledge.</p>
<p>The doership or agentship which consists in being the seat (<em>āśraya</em>) of an action (or the place where an action takes place) is a common attribute of both sentient beings and non sentient things (for the latter also move about and undergo changes). But the seat (<em>āśraya</em>) of an effort or endeavour (prayatna) is (an attribute) peculiar to sentient beings. Effort or endeavour (prayatna) is a form of knowledge or will that is the cause of stimulating one to exercise the body (the senses and the like). When one is the seat of mere knowledge and of mere enjoyment (bhoga), there is only the doership which consists in being the seat of such action as is common to sentient beings and non-sentient things.</p>
<p>When a person is stimulated by his will to act in a particular manner, he becomes the seat of endeavour or effort (prayatna) and is a doer of that particular form. It cannot justly be maintained that this form of doership is found only in rendering <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service. Even in this case, the man must have adopted an <em>upāya</em> with a view to attaining the end called the love of the Lord. If all this is admitted, it is only the doership that takes the form of an endeavour or effort which would lead to bondage - it is only this form of doership that should be avoided. If it be asked what that form of doership is, the answer is as follows:- <em>Iśvara</em> has given the <em>jīva</em> such qualities as knowledge and ability and also such things as the senses and the body. He supports the <em>jīva</em> and stimulates him (to action). He enjoys also the fruit of (that) action. When He is thus rendering help (to the <em>jīva</em>), if the latter should consider himself as being different from this and if, even when he considers his position in the right spirit, he adopts an <em>upāya</em> for some (worldly) purpose - the endeavour would lead to bondage. Even <em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em> would certainly lead to bondnge in the case of the man who performs them for securing other ends (than <em>mokṣa</em>). Therefore just like the doership in the state of attainment (<em>mukti</em>) of the man who longs for rendering service to the Lord by virtue of his very nature and with no other purpose, the doership in the state when he adopts an <em>upāya</em> (for the sake of <em>mukti</em> and service) is not improper. The doership of varied forms of service (to the Lord) in the state of attainment (i. e. <em>mukti</em>) results from the self’s own longing (to render service) combined with the varied desires of the Lord (which have no connection with <em>karma</em>). The doership in the state of <em>samsāra</em> is of different kinds corresponding to the conditioning factor (upādhi) in the forms of sattva, rajas and tamas which have been evolved in accordance with the past <em>karma</em>  and by the will of <em>Iśvara</em>. That doership which results from rajas and tamas and so also from that sattva which is the cause of attachment to other interests (than <em>mokṣa</em>) - that doership leads to bondage. That doership (on the other hand) which results from the form of superior <em>sattvam</em> which creates a longing for he attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em> &ndash; that doership leads to <em>mokṣa</em>. In the state of <em>mukti</em>, the doership will have no connection at all with any of these three qualities.</p>
<p>Therefore between the texts which state that the self is not a doer and the texts which state that the self is a doer, there is no conflict, since it is possible to discriminate wherein it has doership and wherein it has no doership. If it be asked how this could be understood, the answer is as follows:- The texts which declare that the self is not a doer or agent have, for their purport, the truth that the doership of the self which is dependent on <em>Iśvara</em> and on the qualities of <em>prakṛti</em> (sattva, rajas and tamas) should not be considered as independent of other (forms). The texts which declare that the self is a doer or agent have, for their purport, the truth that, of the <em>jñāna</em> or knowledge and its particular forms called desire to perform and effort which have come to him in accordance with such things as the desire of <em>Iśvara</em>, the <em>jīva</em> is himself the seat or āsraya. This conclusion has been taught clearly by the <em>Gītācārya</em> Himself in the _śloka_s beginning with the following &ndash;&rdquo; It is ascertained that when a man does any action with his body, speech or mind, there are five causes that contribute to that action, viz, the body, the self, the senses, the vital breath and fifthly Divinity or daivam In that context the Divinity that is called the fifth (cause) is <em>Puruṣottama</em>. When <em>Puruṣottama</em> stimulates the <em>jīva</em> to perform in action, He is called the kārayitā or one who causes that action, He is (also ) called the karta or doer in regard to those actions like the awarding of the fruit ( to the <em>jīva</em>) and the creation of the world. When He does not prevent the sentient being from performing an action, He is said to be indifferent. Since he permits it, He is said to be anumantā (i.e.) one who acquiesces. As <em>Iśvara</em>, sometimes, acts like an expert porter who carries a heavy weight to help an apprentice who can carry only a light burden, He is also said to co-operate (with the <em>jīva</em> ) (sahakārī). In such things as the</p>
<p>creation (of the world), since differences like gods and men are due to the conditioning factor (upādhi) of their respective past <em>karma</em>, <em>Iśvara</em> is declared not to be the doer as stated in the <em>śloka</em>: &ldquo;The four castes were created by me in accordance with such qualities as sattva that are found in _jīva_s and also with their past <em>karma</em> . Though I perform the act of creation, I am not the real cause nor am I tainted by it.&rdquo; Thus from <em>Iśvara</em> who has the common and general doership of all things without exception, the <em>jīva</em> acquires the power to make an effort and act in accordance with his own will. Therefore it is evident that the <em>jīva</em> is fit to be directed to do a thing and the word vraja may justly enjoin the performance of an action.</p>
<p>Since the <em>dharma</em> called <em>śaraṇāgati</em> can rightly be enjoined for performance, just like such things as <em>bhakti</em>, the statement of Tirukkurukai Piran Pillan (the foremost of the disciples of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>) that the good we do for ourselves is like milk that is bought (in the market) and that the good that comes from <em>Iśvara</em> is like mother&rsquo;s milk should be understood to mean that we should remember that <em>bhakti</em>, <em>prapatti</em> and the like result (from the grace of) God and that the <em>jīva</em> is solely dependent (on <em>Iśvara</em>). (It does not mean that we are not right in performing <em>bhakti</em> or <em>prapatti</em> and should leave everything to God.)</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S:</p>
<p>अन्यविश्वाससिद्ध्यर्थं भक्त्युपायविधिं वदन् ।</p>
<p>सर्वशास्त्रेष्वविश्वासमाधत्ते मुखभेदतः ॥</p>
<p>मद्योपहतपात्रस्थतीर्थदृष्टान्तवर्णनम् ।</p>
<p>अहङ्कारान्वये तु स्यात् प्रपत्तावपि भक्तिवत् ॥</p>
<p>He who states that the texts which declare <em>bhakti</em>  to be an <em>upāya</em> are only for the purpose of creating faith in <em>prapatti</em> is undermining faith in every <em>śāstra</em> without directly appearing to do so.</p>
<p><em>Bhakti</em> as an <em>upāya</em> has been compared (by some critics of it) &quot; to water from a sacred river contained in a pitcher but mingled with a drop of liquor&rdquo;. But this comparison or simile would hold good only when egoism is mingled with (<em>bhakti</em> ). The same condemnation would hold good in the case of <em>prapatti</em> also, when it is mingled with egoism or ahankāra.</p>
<p>It is stated by some that Alavandar begs, in the following <em>śloka</em>, forgiveness for having performed <em>prapatti</em> - &ldquo;In consideration* of my grandfather, Nāthamuni, and ignoring what I myself have done, vouchsafe unto me Thy grace.&rdquo; Here Alavandar is not seeking pardon for the <em>prapatti</em> which he performed in accordance with the _Śāstra_s, on the ground that the performance was an offence. He is seeking pardon for any trace af egoism (ahaṅkāra) that might have been present in him and no more than that. If it were for having performed <em>prapatti</em>, he should beg the pardon (of the Lord) for having shown reverence to previous_ācārya_s, for this, too, would be an offence, being an action of his. Thus there would be no end to the making of apologies (anavasthā (i.e.) infinite regress). If it is argued that this second begging of forgiveness is both for itself and for other offences, it might also be argued that the previous performance of <em>prapatti</em> is also begging forgiveness for that action and for previous actions. If these fallacious arguments were adopted, it would follow that the ancients, too, sinned in performing <em>prapatti</em> and that it was not proper to show reverence to them. So the reverence shown in this stotra (by Alavandar) (to his grandfather etc,) at the beginning and at the end is either for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the <em>prapatti</em> done here or for removing any defects in the performance. As in this reverence shown to āchāryas, in <em>prapatti</em> and the like also, the doership that is subject to the will of another (viz <em>Iśvara</em> ) is no fault. There is a (wrong ) view that since the doership of the <em>jīva</em> is subject (to the will of <em>Iśvara</em> ), the self has no real doership and therefore if a man knows this real nature of his (that he is not a doer), none of the forbidden actions that might be performed by him will leave any stain on him. This view finds its refutation (also in what has been said so far.)</p>
<p>In the upanishads, it is stated that the aspirant to <em>mukti</em> should be like a child. Some writers argue from this that he might act just as he pleases (doing even forbidden things). &lsquo;Being like a child&rsquo; means &lsquo;remaining without revealing his &ldquo;greatness&rsquo; and this is established in the sūtra “Without revealing his greatness) for this fits in with the <em>vidyā</em>” (and not behaving in a childish manner.)</p>
<p>(The Gītā says :-)</p>
<p>&ldquo;To those that have not renounced their doership and the fruit of their actions, the fruits of their <em>karma</em>  will (certainly) follow and they will be of three kinds, what is undesirable, what is desirable and what is partly desirable and partly undesirable. These consequences of <em>karma</em> never affect those who have renounced.&rdquo; and &quot; He who, while performing an action, does not think that it is done by him and whose mind has no attachment to the fruits of that action &ndash; . he does not slay any one even though he has slain all those that live in these three worlds&rdquo;&lsquo;These passages do not refer, as shown in Gita_Bhāṣya_ to sins committed deliberately after the renunciation. Otherwise they would conflict with many _śāstra_s. Further the words &ldquo;though he has slain&rdquo; apply to what is done in a righteous war.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT <em>ŚLOKA</em> :</p>
<p>उपभुक्तौषधन्यायादुत्तरापथ्यमर्दनम् ।</p>
<p>अनन्यपरनिर्बाधश्रुतिस्मृतिशतैर्हतम् ॥</p>
<p>The contention that like a potent medicine which is taken now acting like a cure for unwholesome things that may be done in the future, <em>prapatti</em> will destroy any sins that might be committed after its performance - this contention is disproved by hundreds of texts in the _śruti_s and the stritis which are directly applicable to the <em>prapanna</em> and are not sublated by other texts.</p>
<p>In such _śloka_s as the following, Manu and others, too, prescribed the conditions under which transgressions may be permitted: &quot; When there is a real fear that want of food might cause death, if a man eats food obtained from wherever it was possible, he will not be tainted by the sin thereof, in the same way as mire does not stain ether (ākās&rsquo;a)&rdquo; &ldquo;At a time&rdquo; when there is a fear that want of food might cause death, the man that eats the food obtained by him, whatever the source might be, will not be stained by the sin thereof, in the same way as water does not wet the leaf of the lotus.&rdquo; That this rule applies equally to the man who knows or meditates on <em>Brahman</em> is seen stated in the <em>Sūtra</em> which says, &ldquo;At a time when death is feared ( owing to starvation ), the man (the man who meditates on <em>Brahman</em>) may eat any food, whatsoever, for the _śāstra_s say so ” and this is taught there with the help of an illustration<sup id="fnref:348"><a href="#fn:348" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">348</a></sup> . Therefore the view that the self is not a doer and that it is entirely dependent (on <em>Iśvara</em>) and hence will not be stained by any sins committed after <em>prapatti</em> though they are deliberate and that no further <em>prapatti</em> need be performed (for their expiation) - this view is opposed to our siddhanta (<em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s doctrine ).</p>
<p>ILLUSTRATION. Ushasti was a seer and when owing to starvation, he feared he might die, he ate the cooked grain given to him by a man of a low caste. But when this fear did not exist, he refused what was offered to him afterwards viz. water.</p>
<p>In this context some ( commentators) explain the meaning of vraja otherwise ((i.e. that it does not enjoin any action) and state that to the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>, there is no <em>upāya</em> to be adopted except the knowledge of relationship that is learnt from the sāstrās to exist between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>Iśvara</em>. They find support for this view in the following _śloka_s without comprehending their real purport. The <em>śloka_s are:- &ldquo;The self is the property of Bhagavan. He who considers his self as belonging to himself, is a thief of the self. Is there any form of sin that is not committed by him?&rdquo; &quot; Bhagavan controls all beings in the universe from within the sphere of the sun and He is the ruler over all. He is within your heart and if you have no quarrel with him, you need not go (on a pilgrimage) to the G_aṅga</em> or to Kurukṣetra&rdquo; and &ldquo;Remember always that the Lord is the master, that the self or atma is His servant and that this relationship exists always by your very nature.&rdquo; This argument is opposed to the natural and self evident injunction for <em>bhakti</em> , <em>prapatti</em> and the like. Since listening to Vedanta and reflecting on it arise from mere desire, there is no need also to enjoin the knowledge (of relationship) which arises from the s&rsquo;astras. ( There is no need for the <em>Śāstra</em> to enjoin something which a man will do of his own accord). As is well known, it has been established (in <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em>) that if knowledge which need not be enjoined is called the means of attaining <em>mukti</em>, it would be opposed to the injunction ordaining certain things for performance and there would be other objections too; (the injunction made in the _śāstra_s would serve no purpose at all).</p>
<p>If this is admitted, the knowledge of the relationship between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>Iśvara</em> is indirectly helpful to all aspirants to <em>mukti</em>, whatever <em>vidyā</em>  they may adopt. When a man has acquired this knowledge from the <em>śāstra_s, the question then arises “ What is the means or <em>upāya</em> for attaining <em>Bhagavān</em>, the Lord of <em>Śrī</em>, who is our master and who imparts unsurpassed bliss ?&quot; When this question has arisen, the answer is that these means or <em>upāya_s are certain other forms of knowledge (other than the knowledge of relationship) which are enjoined for the purpose in accordance with each man&rsquo;s competence and they are <em>bhakti</em>  and <em>prapatti</em>. Of these, <em>prapatti</em> is the surrender of the responsibility for one&rsquo;s protection along with its auxiliaries as stated in the following passage: &ldquo;When the question  arises : &quot; To whom is this self to be surrendered for protection ? the answer is &ldquo;To <em>Viṣṇu</em> &ldquo;. In order to show that this (<em>prapatti</em>) should be performed with the knowledge of the relationship existing between one&rsquo;s self and <em>Iśvara</em>, it was stated that <em>prapatti</em> is the knowledge of the relationship. (It does not mean that <em>prapatti</em> is merely that knowledge and nothing else). We have already described at great length the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of this <em>prapatti</em>, its auxiliaries and the like (pages</em></em>______).</p>

<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD AHAM (1) IN</p>
<p>THE SECOND HALF OF THE <em>ŚLOKA</em>                  page587</p>
<p>Thus in the first half of the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>, <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa enjoins, for a particular person (adhikārī), the adoption of that <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) which is referred to in the first part of <em>Dvaya</em> and which has (in itself) the potency of all _dharma_s or rites and, at the same time a peculiar and unique potency of its own which none of them possesses (for it can destroy even that <em>karma</em>  which has already begun to operate and yield its consequences). He has explained that this <em>upāya</em> does not require any special or ancillary _dharma_s on the part of the adhikārī and has to be performed only once. In the second half of the <em>śloka</em>, he graciously explains, at length, the fruit to be attained (by adopting this <em>upāya</em>), which is (only) briefly indicated by the word <em>namas</em> in the second part of <em>Dvaya</em>. In the first half of the <em>śloka</em>, <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa stated that which has to be done by the person or adhikārī (seeking <em>mukti</em>). In the second half. He states what He, as the Saviour who has accepted the responsibility of protecting, will perform and comforts the man who has done what he ought to do (i.e.) performed <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>Here from the first person singular, _mokṣa_yiṣyāmi (I) will set Thee free). (from this) itself, the meaning &rsquo;l&rsquo; is evident. So the use of the word <em>aham</em> (I) has the purpose of indicating. by virtue of its meaning, the power of accomplishing what is to others impossible, for this is essential for setting (one) free from all sins. Its purport is this:- &ldquo;I that bound the offender with fetters and that am destitute of equals and superiors am now full of compassion as the result of a <em>vyāja</em> or pretext and am bent on granting him pardon. (When I am thus inclined) there is no one to prevent me. Nor is there any one else who is capable of making him attain freedom (from sins)&rdquo;. This idea is well-known from such passages as the following:&ndash;&quot;<em>Bhagavān</em> <em>Viṣṇu</em> is the giver of <em>mokṣa</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;The _jīva_s have been bound with the bonds of <em>karma</em> by the Supreme Being for His līlā and they can be liberated from these bonds only by Him. No one else is capable of doing so.&rdquo; In this word <em>aham</em> (1), <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s natural compassion is the superior aiding force and the graciousness of the Lord which results from <em>prapatti</em> acts as a subordinate aiding force and His independence and omnipotence, which are irresistible, stand as the foremost and siree ageury to dispel all obstacles. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows.&ndash;. &ldquo;His natural compassion makes Him so gracious as to overlook countless offences in consideration of some slight <em>vyāja</em> or pretext. This graciousness accompanied by compassion makes the Lord&rsquo;s independence and omnipotence operate for the removal of all hindrances that stand in the way of prapannas. &lsquo;Thus <em>Iśvara</em>, who has all the qualities essential for granting freedom from all sins, can act towards that end without requiring any aid. This is the purport of the <em>aham</em> or (I) and it amounts to saying &quot; I myself (without the help of anybody else)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD TWĀ (THEE) :  page588</p>
<p>The word <em>tvā</em> (Thee) means: Thou that hast acquired the power of discrimination (viveka) necessary to understand the (nature of the) three _tattva_s (reals) viz., <em>cit</em>, <em>acit</em> and <em>Iśvara</em>, and hast realised such defects or demerits as triviality and transience which are inherent in such ends of life as wealth and lordship, Thou that art eager to attain the supreme end of life which consists in attaining me, Thou that hast given up all connexion with extremely difficult upăyas which have been taught for that purpose, Thou that hast surrendered the responsibility for protecting to me who is the object of attainment and who is capable of removing all obstacles, Thou that having done what ought to be done, hast nothing else to do towards the attainment of the desired fruit</p>
<p>THE MEANINGS OF SARVA PĀPEBHYO (FROM ALL</p>
<p>SINS) : page589</p>
<p>Having thus referred to the Dispenser of <em>mukti</em> who is capable of putting the <em>jīva</em> in bondage or out of it and also to the aspirant to <em>mukti</em> who is incapable (of any endeavour) and who has surrendered (to the Lord) the responsibility for his protection, the <em>śloka</em> proceeds to speak of the bonds in the word sarvapūpebhyo (from all sins). Sin is the cause of evil and what it is can be understood from the śāstras. Evil means &lsquo;becoming subject to what is disagreeable and losing what is agreeable.&rsquo; Here (in the <em>carama</em> - <em>śloka</em>) sin denotes also acts of merit (puṇya) which lead to enjoyment in <em>samsāra</em> (which includes <em>svarga</em>), for they, too, are to the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>, productive of undesirable fruits. It has been said:-&ldquo;This <em>svarga</em> and other such places are, my child, like hell when compared with the abode of the Supreme Being&rdquo;. Thus to the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>, even such places as <em>svarga</em> are like hell. In the case of the aspirant, therefore, that which leads to <em>svarga</em> is, in no way, different from that which leads to hell. That is why the aspirant to <em>mukti</em> is enjoined to give up those means which lead to <em>dharma</em>, artha (wealth) and kāma (pleasure), in the same way as he is enjoined to give up sinful actions. Indeed the _Śruti_s and the _Smṛti_s declare that good deeds and evil deeds are both to be avoided by the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>, for it is stated &ldquo;Giving up puṇya and papa of which are both of the nature, <em>karma</em> which are hard to give up etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus having denoted, by the word <em>pāpa</em> (sins), both <em>puṇya</em> and <em>pāpa</em>, which are the causes of bondage, the <em>śloka</em> indicates, by the plural of the word <em>pāpa</em> (viz. pāpebhyah), their being countless. If so, it may be asked what purpose is served by the word sarva (all). (The answer is) the word &lsquo;all&rsquo; is used for the purpose of including among the hosts of sins, <em>avidyā</em> or ignorance, the past impressions (vāsanas) which create a liking for adverse things, the taste (ruchi) for evil things and the contact with <em>prakṛti</em> or matter both in its gross state and in its subtle state (in pralaya), for these are the causes of <em>karma</em>  and also the products of <em>karma</em>. (In the <em>Śaraṇāgati</em> <em>Gadya</em>), <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> has, in three clauses _cūrṇika_s, indicated, both explicitly by the words themselves and implicitly from their meaning, those hindrances or obstacles which are referred to in ‘all sins’. The three passages begin with <em>manovākkāyaih</em>&rsquo; (by mind, speech and body).</p>
<p>(A question might arise in this connection):- It is said, “Having administered the affairs entrusted to them by the Lord for a long time and again and again, they reach the end of their <em>karma</em>  and attain <em>mukti</em>, where _jīva_s who were formerly _Brahma_s, Indras, and Rudras, are enjoying bliss in Paramapada (the supreme abode).&rdquo; (So also) it is said: &ldquo;Those that have been appointed (by the Supreme Being) to be administrators should remain here in the world of <em>samsāra</em>) until the expiry of their period of administration&rdquo;. (We find also the following :-) The man who adopts a <em>bhakti</em>  or <em>upāsana</em> as the means will have the benefit of the destruction (the fruits of) such karmas (<em>puṇya</em> and <em>pāpa</em>) as have not begun to yield their consequences at the very beginning of this <em>upāsana</em>; for (it is said) that there will be delay (for their attaining <em>mukti</em>) till the enjoyment is completed of those karmas that have began to operate (prā rabdha). This is applicable even to those who are not administrators. The question may be asked:- &ldquo;If so, what is the meaning of saying that the Lord will pardon also in the case of the <em>prapanna</em>) those <em>karma</em> s which have began to operate and yield their fruits ?&rdquo; The answer is as follows:- “Even in the case of karmas which have begun to bear fruit, if the man who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as the direct and independent <em>upāya</em> considers as evil and undesirable those parts which would lead to another birth or (even) another day&rsquo;s existence and grieves on that account, <em>Iśvara</em> will give him pardon even in respect of all that <em>karma</em>. If the <em>prapanna</em> is so impatient as to feel that he cannot bear to live without the immediate attainment of <em>mokṣa</em>, the lord will, at that very instant, pardon even all that <em>karma</em>  which has begun to bear fruit so that no trace of it may be left over. Therefore there is no reason why one should not pray for pardon even in respect of that <em>karma</em>  which has begun to bear fruit (<em>prārabdha</em>).</p>
<p>(In the _Śaraṇāgatigadya _ Śrī Rāmānuja says:-) &ldquo;Pardon all sins without exception, (sins) past, future, and present - committed by the mind, the speech, or the body.&rdquo; Here past (sins) refer to those committed before <em>prapatti</em> and future (sins) refer to those that might be committed after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>. We do not see any sins committed at the instant of performing <em>prapatti</em>. What, then, is the meaning of present <em>(kriyamāṇa</em>) sins? (The answer is):- By the word &lsquo;present&rsquo; (<em>kriyamāṇa</em>) is meant that which was begun before and which will be completed in future? According to this definition, those sins which were begun before and which require a long time for their completion and thus that might be done on account of negligence or carelessness at the instant of performing <em>prapatti</em> - these are called present (sins) - Future (sins) are those that may begin after <em>prapatti</em>. Among those sins which are committed after <em>prapatti</em> and which may be partly of the present and partly of the future, those which are not committed deliberately will be pardoned by <em>Iśvara</em> and will leave no trace at all (on the self). Those that are committed deliberately can be atoned for by the performance again of <em>prapatti</em>, for it is said:-&ldquo;If an offence be committed, expiation should be made therefor and the expiation to be made is only the performance of <em>prapatti</em> again.&rdquo; When it is said that if <em>Iśvara</em> is bent on granting <em>mokṣa</em>, even deadly sins cannot stand in the way, and that there will be no punishment for sins committed delibe. rately after <em>prapatti</em>, what is meant is not that there is no need for expiation or <em>prāyaścitta</em>, but that if <em>Iśvara</em> is again propitiated by <em>prapatti</em>, (which is the <em>prāyaścitta</em>), <em>mokṣa</em> is sure to follow. It is the result of God&rsquo;s forgiveness that the man is induced to perform expiation by a further <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>It has been said (by some _ācārya_s) that, to <em>Iśvara</em>, the sins or offences of the <em>jīva</em> are (agreeable) like the dirt on the body of a beloved wife and like the slime on the body of the newborn calf to the cow. This only means that even if wicked men should perform <em>prapatti</em>, <em>Iśvara</em> will not forsake them and will bring them round to righteous ways. It does not mean that sins committed deliberately would give delight to <em>Iśvara</em>. If so, the <em>prapanna</em> should have, by all the means in his power, to commit such sins.</p>
<p>Even if offences are committed deliberately owing to the peculiar nature of a man&rsquo;s <em>prakṛti</em>, and even if a further <em>prapatti</em> is not performed (by way of expiation), it is the peculiar characteristic of <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s forgiveness that He sees to it that such prapannas do not go to hell and that He awards them light punishments (sufferings) as (kings do) in the case of their offending sons. Sins lead to sufferings that are seen and that are t_aṅgī_ble and also to sufferings like those in hell. So when it is said that there is no hell for the <em>prapanna</em> as in the following _śloka_s :- “Those who consider <em>Viṣṇu</em>, the bearer of <em>ṣārṅga</em>, as the supreme end of life and who perform <em>prapatti</em> to Him never go to the world of Yama&rdquo; and “Whatever be the family into which they are born, and wherever they may live, those who are ever attached to <em>Vāsudeva</em> never go to hell&quot; when such statements are made to the effect that there is no hell for them, there is nothing in them to deny that they will not have any sufferings in this life itself (like blindness). Logic cannot repudiate explicit statements (made in the <em>śruti</em> and the smṛti). It is idle to say that, even in some of those who have committed offences and who have not repented for them by performing a further <em>prapatti</em>. we do not see such visible sufferings as blindness which are stated to be their punishments. Even in their lives, we may see such sufferings as the following in accordance with the seriousness of their offences :&ndash; many varieties of suffering due to the three well-known causes (the elements of nature, the body and supernatural powers), dullness of the intelligence required for the Lord&rsquo;s service, the diminution of delight and the absence of it in the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em>, the absence of delight in rendering service to <em>Bhagavān</em> and His devotees, offences against the Lord and His devotees, the censure, the boycott and the like by the virtuous, the destruction of their good deeds, the loss of the esteem in which they were formerly held by good men, the suffering done in the frustration of their ambitions and desires, and such other  forms of sorrow. It is well-known from the _śruti_s, the <em>Dharma</em> _śāstra_s of Manu and others and from the Itihasas, Purāṇas and the <em>Pāñcarātra</em> that, for varied kinds of sins of omission and commission, there are varied kinds of visible suffering. Therefore when blindness and the like are taken by way of example, it should be taken only as one instance (and not as an invariable form of suffering). This is evident from the opening words of the sentence which speak of sufferings in the world in general,</p>
<p>It is not possible to argue, with any certainty, that the varied sufferings which come to a man as the fruit of sins committed deliberately after <em>prapatti</em> and which find support in the authority of the texts are due to past <em>karma</em>  which has begun to yield its fruit. These may come as the result of either of the two kinds of <em>karma</em> . That is why good men (_sātvika_s) dread offences that might be committed deliberately. If this were otherwise, it would be opposed to the śāstra which enjoins a further <em>prapatti</em> and to the code of conduct followed by virtuous men and to ancient tradition.</p>
<p>(It is true) Nanjiyar stated that if a man does not feel repentant after committing an offence, he should be considered as without knowledge. But what is meant is that his omission to repent is due to dullness of intelligence and not that the <em>prapatti</em> was not fulfilled. Deliberate offences which would meet with <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s disapproval would not be committed by some men as these result from conditions created by past <em>karma</em> . In the case of some others who commit such offences, repentance and the like put an end to them. Men of hard hearts may not repent at all. Therefore if deliberate offences happen to be committed, the man should repent and perform <em>prapatti</em> again. If he does not, they would lead to light punishments or sufferings in accordance with what is said in the śrutis and the like.</p>

<p>The Lord, whose will is irresistible and who creates, in the minds of those who do not care for him, all their desires and who also frustrates them &ndash; the Lord has turned my mind today froni <em>samsāra</em> or bondage and has placed me beneath His two feet for protection. He has been pleased to forget His wrath caused by my actions in the past prompted by my mind before the performance of <em>prapatti</em> and has appeared already (as avatars and <em>arcā</em>) to grant me <em>mukti</em>. He smiles gently, wondering whether we shall accept His grace today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD _MOKṢA_YIṢYĀMI</p>
<p>(I WILL SET THEE FREE)   page595</p>
<p>The word _mokṣa_yishyami &lsquo;I will set thee free from all sins means &ldquo;I will grant thee release (from the bondage of <em>samsāra</em>) at the time when you want it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It may be asked :&ndash;&quot;(ln another context) the. Lord says, “I will never pardon&quot;. Is it not opposed to what is stated here viz. &ldquo;I will set thee free from all sins?&rdquo;; therefore this should be merely to give a little seeming comfort in words and is not to be taken literally.&quot; The answer to this question is as follows:&ndash;</p>
<p>• There is no conflict between these two statements for they apply to different cases. &ldquo;I will not forgive&rdquo; occurs in the <em>śloka</em> : “Though a man adores me with a hundred lotuses, O Goddess of the earth, whichever  devotee of <em>Viṣṇu</em> touches blood even unawares I will not pardon him. I will never pardon his offence, O Goddess of the Earth, even if he tries to show me a hundred marks of reverent attention (upacāra)&quot;. It only means  &ldquo;I will not forgive the man for such trivial forms of expiation (as the offering of lotuses and external marks of attention). Here in the <em>Caramaśloka</em>, the word <em>mokṣayiṣyami</em> (means “I will forgive all (offences) if the man adopts the particular <em>upāya</em> which is an atonement for all sins.” The intention of the Saviour is expressed indeed in the <em>śloka</em> :&mdash;&ldquo;Be it Vibhīṣaṇa or Rāvaṇa himself, bring him here, O Sugrīva. I will grant him pardon.&rdquo; These words are not seeming-pleasant, for there is no conflict between what is stated (in Varāhapurāṇam) and what is stated in the Gita, as they apply to different situations. If they are to be taken as only seeming-pleasant, all the texts in the _Śāstra_s which enjoin <em>bhakti</em>  and <em>prapatti</em> would be void of authority,</p>
<p>Here “Releasing from sins &quot; means <em>Iśvara</em> giving up His intention to punish the sinner for having violated His commands from beginningless time. By this turning away (of <em>Iśvara</em>) from the thought of punishment, the effects of His punishment, such as <em>avidyā</em> or ignorance, would all cease to exist. <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s turning away from the thought of punishment means His will which takes the form: “By my grace will the man who performs all his duties as for me and as being done by me attain the world that is eternal&rdquo;. The cessation of such things as a_vidyā_ in the <em>jīva</em> means the expansion of intelligence, knowledge, wisdom and such others.</p>
<p>The manner and the order in which the causes of <em>samsāra</em>, which are of the nature of puṇya and papa will disappear are as follows - The hindrances to the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> have disappeared already by their respective causes (such as the performance of the rites and duties of _varṇa_s and _āśrama_s), then the puṇyas and papas done before the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> which are opposed to the attainment (of <em>mukti</em>) will disappear without any trace at the beginning of the adoption of the <em>upāya</em>, provided they are not such as have already begun to yield their fruit (prarabdha). Among sins committed after <em>prapatti</em>, those offences which may be committed without any awareness of them and which are the result of unfavourable conditions of place, time and the like will not in the least taint (the self). Those offences which are committed deliberately when there is no danger of death will cease either by some form of atonement or expiation which is within the man&rsquo;s power or by experiencing the fruit of the <em>karma</em>  which would be of the nature of a light punishment. That portion of the <em>karma</em>  which has begun to yield its fruit to the <em>prapanna</em> that will have to be experienced within the time desired by him (for <em>mukti</em>) will disappear either by the experience or enjoyment of the fruit or by an intervening rite of expiation. That which remains will disappear by the potency of the <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>).</p>
<p>Among those good deeds (puṇya) which are done deliberately with thought both (of <em>mokṣa</em> and of <em>samsāra</em>), such as are not hindrances and such good deeds (puṇya) done before and after the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> by the upasaka as are capable of strengthening his <em>vidyā</em> or Meditation &ndash; these will disappear after having yielded their fruit. Those good deeds (puṇya) done before and after the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> (namely, <em>upāsana</em>) which are of no use to the meditation or <em>vidyā</em> and which have been prevented from yielding their fruit and those good deeds, done before and after, which are useful for the meditation but which have had no occasion to yield their fruit owing to the superior strength of (other) <em>karma</em>  favourable for the meditation and unfavourable for it and which still remain without yielding their fruit - these too, will disappear in the last moments of the man&rsquo;s life. This truth is expressed in the sütra &ldquo;By the same principle, the deeds, too, which are other than sinful will not stain (the self).&rdquo; Those good deeds (which are the cause of rain, food and the like which are necessary for the performance of the <em>vidyā</em>) will cease to exist immediately after the fall of the body&quot;.</p>
<p>Since those good deeds which were performed solely for pleasing the Lord and which were merely of the nature of service have already yielded their fruit, there is no need to speak about their staining the self. Those deeds which were performed by the man for setting an exanıple to the rest of the world (lokasangraha) had to be performed as commands of the Lord. They are of the nature of pure <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service and have already given their fruits. Among them, if any such good deeds were done without the renunciation of egoism (sātvikatyāga) out of carelessness, they, too, would amount to sins as stated in the <em>śloka</em> &ldquo;<em>Tapas</em> is no sin, the study of the <em>Veda</em> is no sin, the rites and duties prescribed for each man are no sins, nor is the earning of money by hard work for their sake a sin. If these very things are done with a wrong intention with the thought, “I am doing this and doing this for myself&rdquo;, they become sinful&quot;. These (sins) will become subject to the release promised in <em>mokṣayiṣyāmi</em>. Those prapattis that were performed for other ends (than <em>mukti</em>) must have already yielded their fruit.</p>
<p>For the sake of the end for which a former <em>prapatti</em> was performed, a second or further <em>prapatti</em> ought not to be performed, as it would be inconsistent with the potency of <em>prapatti</em> and with the intense and great faith with which the first <em>prapatti</em> was performed. If one were to perform more than one <em>prapatti</em> for the sake of a single end in view, it would be like adopting another <em>upāya</em> (and there would be need for atonement).</p>
<p>The disappearance or destruction of past <em>karma</em>  means <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s giving up the thought of awarding the person the fruit thereof. When <em>karma</em>  is said not to stain or taint the self (<em>aśleṣa</em>), it means that the thought of awarding the fruit or consequence of the <em>karma</em>  in the case of those who have sought His protection does not even arise in <em>Iśvara</em>.</p>
<p>If it be asked, “(It is stated in the _śruti_s that the good deeds and the bad deeds of the man who is to obtain <em>mukti</em> will be distributed among his friends and his foes respectively (at the last moment of his life). If good deeds and bad deeds for past karna) are all destroyed in the manner described above, how can this distribution take place ?&quot; The answer is: The distribution among foes and friends will be, respectively, of those evil deeds which are said not to taint and to be destroyed, (<em>aśleṣa</em> and <em>vināśa</em>) and those good deeds (puṇya) which are done deliberately after the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> and which have been prevented from yielding their fruit by stronger <em>karma</em> . (It is said in the _śruti_s) that <em>Iśvara</em> distributes these among the man&rsquo;s friends and foes at the time of his death, Why should <em>Iśvara</em> wait until the time of the man&rsquo;s death for this distribution, when He could as well have done so, at the very beginning when the man adopted the <em>upāya</em> ?&quot; The answers to these questions are as follows: &ldquo;A man may have behaved with favourable intentions towards the devotee at first, but later he may change and behave with evil intentions. In such circumstances the good deeds should not have already been given away to the friend (who has afterwards turned foe). Further the Lord desires to give opportunities to foes who have done evil to the devotee to beg for forgiveness. These are the reasons why <em>Iśvara</em> does not effect the transfer of the good and the bad <em>karma</em>  until the last moments of the devotee.</p>
<p>The good deeds done by a man for the sake of such ends as <em>svarga</em> are, to the aspirant for <em>mukti</em>, of the nature of sins (papa).. Hence such good deeds (of the devotee) will not be transferred to his friend, if the latter is an aspirant for <em>mukti</em>.</p>
<p>It may be asked,  &ldquo;What is the meaning of transferring the <em>karma</em> s performed by one man to some others?&rdquo; The answer is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The punishment or reward which <em>Iśvara</em> intended to award to those who performed these <em>karma</em> s is now transferred to his foes and friends in equal measure,&rdquo; It may be asked, “If punishments and rewards for the karmas performed by one man are to be awarded to some other man or men, would there not be too wide an application (<em>atiprasaṅga</em>) (i.e.) the punishment does not go to the evildoer but to somebody else who has not done evil. It is also against the principle that he who sowed must reap the harvest&rdquo;. The answer is this:- There will be no such unfairness due to too wide an application (<em>atiprasaṅga</em>), because the rewards and punishments are awarded in accordance with the obligations or offences done, respectively, by these friends and foes to the aspirant for <em>mukti</em>. That is why it is nowhere stated that these good deeds and bad deeds are transferred to those who are neither friends nor foes. The word &rsquo;transfer’ is used here in the sense that (their friends and foes) will have fruits similar to those of the karmas said to be transferred. This <em>śruti</em> which speaks of the transfer of good and bad deeds suggests the extreme of pleasure and displeasure that the Lord would feel, if the obligations and offences are done to the_ jñānī_ (the man of wisdom) who is extremely dear to the Lord.</p>
<p>If we take the *[^f1] interpretation given in the <em>śloka</em> (on page __________), <em>sarva pāpebhyah</em> (from all sins) would briefly include, as desired by the man, all hindrances to the attainment of the Lord, all hindrances to the proper adoption of the <em>upāya</em> and also the causes of experiencing disagreeable things.</p>
<p>Here the hindrance to the attainment of the Lord is the Lord&rsquo;s will that the offender shall not enjoy Him. The hindrance to the <em>upāya</em> is the Lord&rsquo;s will that the offender shall not understand Him aright and do what is necessary to propitiate Him. The causes of experiencing disagreeable things consist in the will of God that the man shall experience the consequences or fruits of doing such karmas as displeased Him.</p>
<p>If all punishments are cancelled in the case of the aspirant for <em>mukti</em>, the effects of such punishments, namely, contact with <em>acit</em> and the like will stand cancelled by the Lord&rsquo;s grace which cancelled the punishments. Thereafter since there are no causes, there will be no such effects as disagreeable experiences. This is indicated in the <em>sūtra</em>: &ldquo;The man who has attained  <em>mokṣa</em> will never return to <em>samsāra</em>, for the śrutis say so&rdquo;, These conclusions are within the reach of the knowledge of those very wise men who have studied <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> for a long time along with the traditions of the good.</p>
<p>Thus (the words) &ldquo;I will release thee from all sins&rdquo; speak of the removal of the stream of all hindrances which are of the nature of either causes (the Lord&rsquo;s will to punish) or effects (a_vidyā_ and the like); it means the same thing as saying that the self will (then) have the manifestation (āvirbhāva) of the perfect enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em>. For Bhagavan Śaunaka says:-&ldquo;When the dirt is washed away, the gem shines of itself, but the sheen is not newly produced. In the saine way, when the self casts off its blemishes or faults, <em>jñāna</em> is not newly created in it (for it is already there). When a tank is dug, water and space are not newly created. What is already present is now brought to manifestation. How can a thing which did not exist before arise anew? So by the casting off of evil qualities, good qualities like jnūna shine forth. They are not newly produced, for it has been stated (in the _śāstra_s) that they are eternal qualities of the self&rdquo;. Since the substance called <em>jñāna</em> or knowledge and its inherent power to cover all objects are both eternal, the right word to use is &lsquo;manifestation&rsquo; (i.e.) it is used in its primary sense.</p>
<p>(It is true that) the expansion of <em>jñāna</em> or knowledge to cover all objects, the freedom from pain, sorrow and the like. The will to do what is good and other such things and the forms of service or <em>kaiṅkarya</em> arise anew. Still as their origin depends on the conditional factor (upādhi), namely, the removal of hindrances thereto, the word &lsquo;manifestation&rsquo; (<em>āvirbhāva</em>) is used in such places as the performance of different kinds of service which are natural to myself manifest itself.&quot; This is in order to show that when the hindrances disappear, these services will automatically follow. (In the state of <em>samsāra</em>), the objects (in the Universe) which are all the glorious possessions of <em>Bhagavān</em> appear disagreeable in various ways or (only) slightly agreeable as a result of the conditioning factor (<em>upādhi</em>), namely, <em>karma</em> . In the state of <em>mokṣa</em>, they would all become agreeable (since <em>karma</em>  has disappeared), as agreeableness is their natural quality. Therefore in that state, too, the word &lsquo;manifestation&rsquo; (of agreeableness) may justly be used. Therefore the words &ldquo;I will release thee from all sins&quot;make it evident that the self will have a new state in which all things will manifest their natural agreeableness to it.</p>
<p>If the word <em>ekam</em> means the identity of the <em>upāya</em> and the <em>upeya</em> or the end of attainment (as has already been indicated), this attainment of the desired end is also made plain. Therefore the idea that was expressed clearly in the <em>śloka</em> (Gītā - 18 - 65), namely “Thou wilt come to me&rdquo; may be considered to be stated in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> (also) by the meaning implicit in the word ekam, and by the statement that the hindrances to that attainment are destroyed &mdash;-(I will release thee from all sins). Therefore the <em>carama</em>-<em>śloka</em> cannot be said to supplement or explain what has been stated in the preceding <em>śloka</em>.[^f2] *</p>
<p>Here an objection that has no soundness in it may be raised to this effect:-&ldquo;When it is said &ldquo;I will release thee from all sins&rdquo;, does it follow from those words alone that the release from sins would lead to the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em> stated in &ldquo;Thou wilt reach me?&rdquo; Is it not possible that, with the removal or pardon of all sins, the self may attain the state called <em>kaivalya</em> in which it enjoys only itself without attaining <em>Bhagavān</em> ? That there is a state called <em>kaivalya</em>, has, it is well known, been declared in such treatises as Nāradīya kalpam, where we find the <em>śloka</em> :&ndash; &ldquo;This <em>mantra</em> enables a man to obtain wealth and lordship in this world, <em>svarga</em> and the like in the world beyond, kaivalya (the enjoyment of one&rsquo;s own self) and the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em>&rdquo;. Alavandar also says &quot; To those who desire to have wealth and lordship, the enjoyment of their own self dissociated from the body and, likewise, the performance of <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service at the feet of the Lord etc. etc.&rdquo; He says also (elsewhere):  Without the grace  of <em>Lakṣmī</em>, the beloved consort of the Lord with the lotus eyes, we cannot have the valuable things desired (by men) in <em>samsāra</em>, the enjoyment of the disembodied self (in kaivalya) and the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em>&quot;. In the <em>Gadya</em>, also, is found quoted (the sentence) in Jitante stotra - “Leaving all desired pleasures and the enjoyment of the (disembodied) self, I have reached Thy feet.&quot; This truth is also stated at length in <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s Gitā_Bhāṣya_ and such other writings. Therefore should not the freedom from all sins which results from the statement &ldquo;I will release thee from all sins&rdquo; be considered common to kaivalya and the enjoyment of Bhagavan ?&quot;.</p>
<p>The objection (stated so far) is unsound for the following reasons:- &quot; If all sins have disappeared, there is no reason why the self should be without the experience of <em>Bhagavān</em>, which is its natural and inherent right. Therefore the state of the enjoyment of the mere self (<em>kaivalya</em>) without the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> would not be the goal of attainment then. Hence in that state (<em>kaivalya</em>), (we should understand that) the <em>karma</em> s which produce wealth, and such sufferings as old age and death have disappeared but that the <em>karma</em>  which is a hindrance to the perfect enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> has not yet been destroyed. This state (of kaivalya) is a particular kind of enjoyment which consists in the experience of one&rsquo;s own disembodied self. Of this state it has been said :-&ldquo;lo that experience of the self, the self feels that there is nothing greater than it&rdquo;, and also, “If a man desires! this enjoyment of the (disembodied) self, these three (<em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em>, <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em> and <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em>) will enable him to attain that extreme which is called kaivalya&quot;. As stated (in these _śloka_s), this experience in which there is neither contact with <em>acit</em> or matter nor enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> and which results from the adoption of a particular <em>upāya</em> within the man&rsquo;s ability was called <em>kaivalya</em>, because it is the enjoyment of the mere (kevala) self without association with either <em>acit</em> or <em>Bhagavān</em>. qq604</p>
<p>(In some places) <em>mukti</em> or the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em> is called by the word <em>kaivalya</em> in order to show that all upādhis or conditioning factors have ceased to exist in <em>mukti</em>. So also the word <em>mukti</em> is sometimes employed to denote the experience of the disembodied self as in the <em>śloka</em> &ldquo;O, Lord of Hastigiri,&rdquo; I look upon all the enjoyments of this world, the title of <em>Brahma</em>, the high position of Rudra, and the experience of the disembodied self, which is called <em>mukti</em> - I look upon these as water poured in the soil saturated with salt. I know the bliss of rendering service to Thee&quot;. The word <em>mukti</em> employed here should be explained as in the <em>śloka</em> :- &quot; The man who is free from desire, fear and anger - he is always a <em>mukta</em> (aven here in <em>samsāra</em>). It only means &ldquo;He resembles a <em>mukta</em>&rdquo;. It may be asked &ldquo;Is it (<em>kaivalya</em>) not stated to be freedom from old age, and death ? &quot; The answer is that it is just like calling the gods immortal (amara), (That is : they are not truly immortal.) Compared</p>
<p>with human beings, they may be said to be relatively immortal, for they live much longer. Or it may be explained as stating that <em>kaivalya</em> will lead, in course of time, to <em>mukti</em>. In the same way should be explained the use of the word <em>mukti</em> when it is intended to mean merely the attainment of the same abode or loka as that of <sup id="fnref:349"><a href="#fn:349" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">349</a></sup> the vibhavas or vyuhas and also samipya and sārūpya.</p>
<p>It has been declared that real <em>mukti</em> is different from the others in the (following) <em>śloka</em>:-&ldquo;Some live  in the worlds of <em>Viṣṇu</em>. This is sālokyam (living in the same loka or world as <em>Viṣṇu</em>). Some reach near Him. This is sāmipyam (attaining a place near <em>Viṣṇu</em>). Some others attain a form resembling that of <em>Viṣṇu</em>. This is sārupyam (having a form resembling His). Others still attain sayujyam and it is this which goes by the name <em>mokṣa</em>&rdquo;. The sayujyam referred to here is going to Paramapada and enjoying the same bliss as that of <em>Bhagavān</em> (and this alone is real and true <em>mukti</em>). That the experience of the mere disembodied self is not eternal and that it is not real <em>mokṣa</em> are evident from these _śloka_s :- &ldquo;There are four kinds of people who are mine and who are called my devotees. Among them, those who are exclusively attached to me (ekantins) are the best, for they worship no other deities. To these men who perform their duties and rites without any attachment or desire for their fruit. I am alone the goal. The other three virtuous kinds of bhaktas or devotees are said to be desirous of certain ends. All these (three) are liable to fall (from their high state) but the jnani (who is an <em>ekāntin</em> attains <em>mokṣa</em> &quot; (Again it is said) : &quot; Having  listened to this story, the man who has lost his wealth will become free from the sorrow due to it; the man (jijnasu) who wants to enjoy his disembodied self will attain <em>bhakti</em>  or devotion (to the Lord), the <em>bhakta</em> or devotee will attain <em>mokṣa</em>&rdquo;. This amounts to stating that the jijnasuh spoken of in the Gita, who is desirous of experiencing his self, will, in course of time, become a jnani. It has been said :- “When the attachment to the pleasures of life ceases, the self, which is different from the body and which is happy, will become manifest. Without being caught (in this state) viz, kaivalya, if you want to realise that your essential nature consists in being <em>śeṣa</em> to <em>Bhagavān</em> and in being eternal, get hold of <em>Bhagavān</em> and then give up the pleasures of worldly objects.&rdquo; In this (Tamil verse) the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> is said to be eternal and the experience of the disembodied self, which is distinguished fronı it, is indirectly stated to be not eternal. (It is true that) the experience of the measureless self is described as imperishable or without changes like diminution or increase; - like the statement of the fruit of the rite called <em>cāturmāsya</em> being imperishable; it only means that it will last for a very long time (i.e.) many and many a kalpa (and not that it is eternal). This locality where the self enjoys itself is thus described :&ndash; &quot; The place called the <em>amṛtam</em> of yogis is the place to which those who want to enjoy their own self go.&quot; That this locality is not Paramapada is also evident from another siloka in the very same context: &ldquo;Those who are yogins and who, being ekāntins, are constantly meditating on <em>Brahman</em>, reach that supreme abode which the eternal suris are gazing at. (It is clear from this, that the <em>ekāntin</em> who is desirous of attaining <em>Bhagavān</em> is here stated to go to a place other than that (to which the man who is desirous of enjoying his self would go) and that it is a place gazed at by the suris,</p>
<p>In such treatises as <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> (and Gitā_Bhāṣya_ ) it has been stated that those who meditate on their self with <em>Brahman</em> as its inner self as in Pañcāgni-<em>vidyā</em> and the like pass (after death) along the <em>arcirādi</em> route and attain <em>Brahman</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore to those that meditate on their self according to the <em>Pañcāgni vidyā</em>, there is an intermediate result or experience consisting in the enjoyment of the mere self. However, according to the principle explained in the madhu <em>vidyā</em>, they will ultimately attain <em>Brahman</em>. If, however, the meditation is on the self either as associated with <em>prakṛti</em> or matter or as disembodied or dissociated from matter, whether the self is meditated on in its essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) or as if it were <em>Brahman</em>, &ndash; in all these four cases, as when name (nāma) and the like are meditated on as if they were (<em>Brahman</em>), there is neither the passage along the arcirādi route for the attainment of <em>Brahman</em>. This is declared in the following :&ndash; Bādarāyana is of opinion that the Ativāhikās (escorts) lead those who do not meditate on pratikas (i.e.) parts or aspects (of <em>Brahman</em>). In either of the other alternatives, there is conflict (with the _śruti_s) and also with the principle of tat-kratu. In another context to prove that the being meditated on in that <em>vidyā</em> is (not the <em>jīva</em> (but) the Supreme Being or <em>Brahman</em>, the Sūtrakāra gives this as his reason for saying so: &ldquo;Since the person who meditates according to this <em>vidyā</em> is said to pass along the archirādi route.” This is done in the sūtra “since  mention<sup id="fnref:350"><a href="#fn:350" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">350</a></sup> *  is made of the route meditated on by those who have listened to the Upaniṣads” (i.e.) to those who meditate on <em>Brahman</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore to those who do not attain <em>Brahman</em>, there should not have been the cancellation of all sins spoken of in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>. To those whose sins have been pardoned or cancelled, there is no limitation in regard to the enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em>, Thus since in this <em>śloka</em>, the annulment of all sins is declared, (we have to understand that) even that particular <em>karma</em>  which resulted in the experience of the mere self and which stood as a hindrance to the fall and perfect enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em> is annulled or cancelled. From this it would follow that what is stated in the previous <em>śloka</em> namely, &quot; &lsquo;Thou wilt attain myself” is declared in this <em>śloka</em> also <em>mām eva eṣyasi</em>. &ldquo;Thou wilt attain myself&rdquo; means &ldquo;the full and perfect enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em>&rsquo;. In order that this perfect enjoyment may happen, the archirādi route has to be traversed and a particular region or locality has also to be reached.</p>
<p>It is clear from the _śāstra_s which speak of such things as this route that, from beginningless time, the independent and omnipotent Lord has made it a rule that the full and perfect enjoyment (of Himself) should be granted in this order (namely, the archiridi route, the entrance into the region or locality and then the enjoyment).</p>
<p>Before starting on the archirādi route, when a man understands the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of <em>Brahman</em> with the help of the _śāstra_s and so also when he has a vision of <em>Brahman</em> with the help of <em>yoga</em> and when he reaches such worlds as those of *<sup id="fnref:351"><a href="#fn:351" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">351</a></sup> <em>Vibhava</em>, the vision or realisation which he gets results from some specific good deeds and is dependent on the instruments of knowledge. Therefore this vision will be partial or limited and liable to interruption. But the vision that results in the state of <em>mukti</em> is full and perfect, because there are no factors that limit or diminish the experience nor is it liable to any further interruption or break, As an Overflow (parivāha) of this enjoyment arises the perfect service or <em>kaiṅkarya</em> in which the <em>śeṣī</em> (the Lord) finds delight and this idea is expressed in the <em>śloka</em>: &ldquo;Though you live for a hundred years, I will always be your servant. Therefore give me orders saying . &quot; Do this in this beautiful place.&rdquo; Here all the successive stages of realisation (or fruit) which are stated (by <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> , in the (<em>Śaraṇāgati</em>) <em>Gadya</em> in the sentence with the word pāramarthika are also implicitly suggested in accordance with the _pramāṇa_s.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF ‘MĀ ŚUCHAH’ (DO NOT GRIEVE - DO</p>
<p>NOT DESPAIR)  page609</p>
<p>Thereafter the words,  &ldquo;Do not grieve” reveal the certainty of what has been stated before &ldquo;.</p>
<p>There are some commentators) who hold that &ldquo;Do not grieve&rdquo; enjoins something to be avoided. (According to them ), if, after a man has performed <em>prapatti</em>, he grieved or fell into despair, he would be violating the injunction and the Saviour who is the <em>upāya</em> would become indifferent and leave him to look after himself. The man would thus become liable, in their opinion, to this disadvantage or risk. This view is opposed to their own commentary on the sins committed deliberately after <em>prapatti</em> and on the words &quot; from all sins&rdquo;. It is also opposed to the texts in the śrutis and the _smṛti_s which declare that the Saviour will never forsake the man who has sought His protection. Therefore since all causes for grief or despair have disappeared in the case of the man who has adopted this <em>upāya</em>, it repeats that there is absolutely no cause for despair and aims at confirming the man&rsquo;s faith.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S :&ndash;</p>
<p>बन्धुनाशादयः पूर्वं बहवश्शोकहेतवः ।</p>
<p>तत्तत्समुचितैस्सम्यगुपदेशैरपोदिताः ॥</p>
<p>सुदुष्करत्वाद्धर्माणामपारत्वाद्विरोधिनाम् ।</p>
<p>सिद्धः फलविळंबाच्च शोकोऽद्य विनिवार्यते ॥</p>
<p>Many causes of sorrow (in the case of Arjuna) like those concerning the destruction of relatives have already been removed by appropriate and excellent teaching. Now the sorrow or despair caused by the thought that the <em>dharma</em> or rites enjoined (for <em>mukti</em>) are too difficult to perform, that the hindrances to <em>mukti</em> are insuperable and that the end in view can be attained only after protracted delay - it is this sorrow that is now dispelled.</p>
<p>(The Lord) intends to say: After I have taught you this <em>upāya</em>, which, without being too hard to adopt for the end desired by you, is also capable of annulling all hindrances that stand in the way and is not liable to cause any (undue) delay in the attainment of that aim &ndash; after this has been taught to you, there is no room for despair due to such things is the difficulty of adopting an <em>upāya</em>. If you adopt this <em>upāya</em>, your welfare is my burden or responsibility and I shall myself be interested in looking after it. If I do not protect you, it will be a reproach to me. You are, as it were, muy property or wealth (to look after) and there is no reason why you should grieve&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The grief that is here put an end to is not the old sorrow caused (in Arjuna&rsquo;s mind) by the thought of killing (his) relatives. It is a different kind of grief that has to be consistent with the context. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows :- &ldquo;The rich qualities  that distinguish the nature of the gods lead to <em>mokṣa</em>, the qualities that make for the nature of the Asuras are the causes that lead to bondage&rdquo;. When the two were thus distinguished, Arjuna was grieved at the thought of what he should do if he belonged to the class of Asuras. <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa, who understood this, said to him :- &ldquo;O Pandava! do not grieve. You are born to attain the rich qualities of the gods&rdquo;. Similarly here, when (Arjuna) is extremely desirous of attaining the supreme end, he grieves at the thought that the <em>upāya</em> taught so far has to be adopted for a long time, and is subject to many hindrances, while being extremely difficult of performance even for those who are very careful. At the thought of that <em>upāya</em> and of his own (want of) capacity for adopting it, he grieves, saying to himself &ldquo;How can I succeed in adopting this <em>upāya</em> and secure the end in view?&rdquo; To Arjuna who was in despair (at this thought), <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa shows another <em>upāya</em> which can be only performed in a single instant, which is without any obstacles, and which is (also) easy of performance. By doing so, He makes Arjuna care-free and certain in regard to the attainment of the desired end and then says, “ Do not grieve&rdquo;. So the words should certainly be understood as intended to dispel the despair due to such things as the difficulty of adopting the (former) <em>upāya</em>. (It is only this grief that is here put an end to and no other).</p>
<p>In this Bhagavadgītā, the <em>Gītācārya</em>, at first, imparts a knowledge of the difference between <em>prakṛti</em> (matter, the body) and the soul or self; then He describes <em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em> and <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em> which are indirect means leading to <em>mokṣa</em>; thereafter he teaches <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em> with its _aṅga_s, which has been enjoined as the direct means of attaining <em>mokṣa</em> and says:&ndash; &ldquo;Thus has been taught to you the jñāna which is the most secret of all secrets. Consider all these and then do what you desire to do&rdquo;. Though He perceived the dissatisfaction that passed over Arjuna&rsquo;s face at that instant, <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa did not at once favour him with instructions concerning the easier <em>upāya</em>, for it has been said: &ldquo;The Lord of the world tests the minds of those who are weak of heart&rdquo;. Instead of declaring the final conclusion by saying: &quot; This is the direct means of attaining <em>mokṣa</em> and is supremely good to you. Act in accordance with this.&rdquo; - instead of saying so, he says:-&ldquo;Do whatever you wish to do,&rdquo; as if He were indifferent (and not interested in Arjuna&rsquo;s spiritual welfare) like one who tells a traveller, &quot; This route leads to the land of the Vidarbhas and this other to the land of the Kosalas. (Take whichever you choose)&rdquo;. <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa makes others think that this is the cause of Arjuna&rsquo;s mental depression and enjoys the līlā of instructing him once again in the principal means of attaining <em>mokṣa</em>  viz., <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em>. He begins by stating : &quot; I will teach you again this greatest secret of all &ldquo;, and in two _śloka_s explains to him, conclusively and with deep earnestness, what it is, so that he may remember that it is just what has already been taught. On seeing that Arjuna&rsquo;s depression has become twice as great as before, the Supreme Ruler, who is (now) the Charioteer, feels that Arjuna is now in a state of fitness to receive instruction in regard to the means of attaining <em>mokṣa</em> (viz. <em>prapatti</em>) which is the supreme secret and is, at the same time, extremely easy of adoption. Without the least delay, even without prefacing that <em>upāya</em> with any praise, the Lord immediately teaches him to perform <em>śaraṇāgati</em> towards Himself. Thus acting as the Charioteer also to the chariot of Arjuna&rsquo;s mind, (i.e. to all his aspirations), the Lord dispels all his griefs. That the grief which is here put an end to is therefore different from the old grief (concerning the destruction of his relatives etc.) thus becomes clear after a careful consideration of the context (in which the words occur).</p>
<p>In the first half of this <em>śloka</em>, since (the Lord) says to the man who is destitute of all other _upāya_s, &ldquo;Take refuge under me alone,&rdquo; the man who is incapable (of making any endeavour) surrenders the responsibility of his protection) into the hands of One who has the ability. Further the independent and omnipotent <em>śeṣī</em>, who is compassionate, accepts the responsibility. Therefore (in the first half of the <em>śloka</em>), the <em>prapanna</em> becomes free from all responsibility in regard to his own protection. And since the <em>śeṣī</em>, who is omnipotent and is ever truthful towards those who have sought His protection, has accepted the responsibility and is so gracious as to say .-&ldquo;I will release you from all sins&rdquo;, there is absolutely no likelihood of any evils like hell ensuing in the future. Freedom from fear results from this <em>śloka</em>, as also freedom from all doubt, , because these are the glorious and true words of <em>Śrī</em> *<sup id="fnref:352"><a href="#fn:352" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">352</a></sup> Raṅganātha Himself, who is ever truthful.</p>
<p>Therefore, if one has been told about this special <em>upāya</em> and if one adopts it, one will have no grief or despair, at all, in connection with that <em>upāya</em>.</p>
<p>Here it may be asked :&ndash; From the words “Do not grieve&rdquo;, it is evident that grief ( at one&rsquo;s being without _upāya_s) makes one competent for <em>prapatti</em>; how then could it be stated that fear is also one of the marks of competency for <em>prapatti</em>, as shown in the following <em>śloka</em> :-&ldquo;I dread, O, best of gods, at the sight of this <em>samsāra</em> which fills me with fear, Save me, O Lord of the lotus eyes. I know of no other <em>upāya</em> than Thee &ldquo;, and in the Tamil verse:-“ Embrace this red-hot iron pillar, O, sinner&rdquo;; in dread at these words, I have come and sought Thy feet for protection.” To this question the answer is as follows:- Having realised that the end desired by him has not been so far attained, the man grieves; he is also afraid at the prospect, in future, of formidable obstacles to the end desired by him. Therefore ( he has both grief and fear) In the case of the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>, when either of the two viz., the annulment of what is undesirable and the attainment of what is desired is mentioned, the other also comes (to the mind). In the same way when either of the two marks of competency for <em>prapatti</em>, viz., grief and fear, is mentioned, the other is also taken for granted. In the man who is absolutely without _upāya_s (and is therefore fit for performing <em>prapatti</em>), these two, grief and fear, are excessive. Therefore by way of conclusion, this adhikārī who is overwhelmed with excessive grief is taught the <em>upāya</em> which is appropriate for him, and is thereby made free of all doubt, free from all responsibility (concerning his protection), free from all fear and thus delighted at heart. On this extreme fear, we have already stated as follows :- &quot; The Lord has ???? - the Lord who said: - “ Thou that art afraid of <em>samsāra</em>, come and seek protection from me&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The <em>prapanna</em> who has done what he ought to do (i.e) <em>prapatti</em>, should (continue to) perform the rites and duties (ordained for his <em>varṇa</em> and <em>āśrama</em>) (<em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em>), which are among the _kaiṅkarya_s done by the virtuous : such <em>karma</em>  as is described in the following <em>śloka</em> - &quot; Do that <em>karma</em> which, when performed, does not yield any fruit and which, when omitted, will bring in evil.” This is evident from the passages which are found before and after this <em>śloka</em> and also in this very <em>śloka</em>, where it is said that the omission will cause evil. Therefore since the <em>prapanna</em> has no uncertainty concerning the attainment of the desired end, since he has nothing further to do for the sake of <em>mokṣa</em>, since what he has yet to perform is only the keeping of (the Lord&rsquo;s) commands for their own sake, and since, if offences should be committed (thereafter), they could easily be atoned for by repentance and the like as pointed out in another chapter &ndash; there is no reason why he should not feel delighted at heart. Though this delight is mingled with disgust (nirveda) in the intelligent (<em>prapanna</em>) who is still connected with such unwholesome things as the body, yet the two may exist without any inconsistency as the disgust and the delight are due to different factors respectively.</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;Do not grieve&rdquo; are, themselves, an indication of the cancellation of all causes of grief; even that portion of the <em>karma</em>  which has already begun to operate (prarabdha) and which will cause grief will be cancelled and the man who is so impatient as not to be capable of existing even for a moment longer will attain <em>mokṣa</em>  at that very instant. As stated in the Tamil verse : &ldquo;The Lord is one who, to those that seek His protection, grants <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em> at the time of their death”, we have to believe that all that unexpired part of the <em>karma</em>  which has already begun to operate (prārabdha) will be annulled and that _mokṣa _ will be at the death of this body. Therefore if, in this bodily existence itself, it be felt (by a man) that what remains of this life is an evil, it will also certainly be cancelled by the will of the omnipotent Lord whose grace has been secured by <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>(In this connection it may be asked whether it is not a sin to desire to die immediately after performing <em>prapatti</em>). The answer is as follows:-)</p>
<p>SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_S:</p>
<p>प्रायश्चित्तविशेषेषु सर्वस्वारादिकेषु च ।</p>
<p>नात्महिंसनदोषोऽस्ति तथार्तशरणागतौ ॥</p>
<p>दृप्तस्य तु यथाशास्त्रं चिरं जीवितुमिच्छतः ।</p>
<p>प्राणरक्षणशास्त्रार्थलङ्घनं त्वपराधनम् ॥</p>
<p>In some forms of expiation for sins (prayaschitta) and like. wise, in certain kinds of offering (made in the fire) like <em>sarvasvāra karma</em> , it is not considered a sin if the man gives up life (by casting the body down a precipice or in the fire), So also there is no impropriety in praying for instant death in the <em>śaraṇāgati</em> of the <em>prapanna</em> who cannot bear to continue in <em>samsāra</em> even for a moment (ārta). On the other hand, the <em>prapanna</em> who desires to live a long life (dripta) commits an offence, if he violates the rule in the _śāstra_s which enjoins the protection of one&rsquo;s own life.</p>
<p>In the same way as yogis cast off their bodies in virtue of certain yogas practised by them, there is nothing to prevent the man who, while performing <em>prapatti</em>, longs to die immediately. It cannot be said that such casting off of the body is not permitted to those who are in Kali yuga, like entrance into holy waters for giving up one&rsquo;s life there. In fact the <em>ārtaprapanna</em> who prays for immediate death is one who saves his self sooner than all others.</p>
<p>Prapannas are spoken of as belonging to two classes ārtas and driptas on account of the difference in the intensity of the grief felt by them respectively, (It should not, therefore, be thought that the latter viz., the dripta has no grief. The <em>dṛptaprapanna</em> is one who grieves at the thought of another janma and believes that he will some day or other attain <em>mokṣa</em> and has the patience to wait until the end of this existence. The word dripta is here used not in (the usual) sense of one who has arrogance or pride, which is a quality opposed to the virtues of the soul and leads one to treat good men with disesteem. The word _ārtaprapanna _is used here to denote the man who, in this life, looks upon even <em>Brahma</em>&rsquo;s position of lordship as an obstacle to the perfect enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em>, who feels that his present association with the body is unbearable as with a raging fire, and who, therefore, cannot endure existence even for a single moment after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>. He is, therefore, like one who prays, &quot; Be pleased  to make my body and my life-breath perish.&rdquo; He is not the ārta referred to in the Gitā (7.16) &ldquo;<em>ārto, jijñāsuh, arthārthī,</em> etc.,&rdquo; where ārta means &ldquo;one who prays for the recovery of his lost wealth or lordship &quot;</p>
<p>There are some who are of opinion that, in <em>Śrī</em> Rāma’s words:. &quot; Whether the man is an ārta (who cannot bear delay in the attainment of the desired end) or a dṛpta ( who has no such impatience), the man who seeks refuge should (always ) be protected&rdquo;, there is <em>ativāda</em> or exaggeration in that even the dripta who is proud or arrogant is stated to be worthy of protection. Whatever that may be, there is no room for dispute in regard to this passage where <em>mokṣa</em>  is promised to the man who grieves for the evils of <em>samsāra</em> but can bear to live till the end of this life and then attain <em>mokṣa</em>, for he is not one who is proud or arrogant.</p>
<p>The use of the future tense in _mokṣa_yishyāmi (I will release you) is not inappropriate in the case of the ārta who prays for immediate release from the body, for the end desired is to come after the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> and the word is used at the time when the <em>upāya</em> is taught (i.e. before the adoption of the <em>upāya</em>),</p>
<p>• These classifications into ārtas and driptas arise on account of differences in the intensity of the Lord&rsquo;s grace which are due to the differences in the good deeds performed by them before.</p>
<p>Such statements as are made in the _śloka_s &ndash; &quot; The man who has performed <em>prapatti</em> after learning the truth experiences, in this life, the consequences of his prārabdha <em>karma</em>  alone (i.e.) that <em>karma</em>  which has begun to yield its fruit in this life, and there after attains <em>mokṣa</em>&quot; - such statements do not apply to the ārta. (<em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>) has described what the <em>dṛptaprapanna</em> should do after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, in his <em>Gadya</em>, in the passages beginning with:-“ You will be free from all trace of suffering or hindrance caused by the body, the elements (earth, water, fire, etc.,) or the gods &ldquo;and ending with &ldquo;Be free from all uncertainty in regard to knowledge concerning me and the vision and the attainment  of myself&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The freedom from grief that is stated here (in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>) has no limiting factors. Therefore the causes of all forms of grief are stated here to be annulled for the man who has a knowledge of this <em>upāya</em> and adopts it. By the teaching given here, mere knowledge (of the <em>upāya</em>) may exist without its adoption, but it would be of no use at all as stated in the <em>śloka</em>. &ldquo;The song does not regulate (the actions of) the man though he may sing it very often. Creatures behave in accordance with their past impressions (vāsana) like the bird <sup id="fnref:353"><a href="#fn:353" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">353</a></sup> *Kulinga&rsquo;, which, though it utters the words <em>mā sāhasam kuru</em>, (Do not behave rashly), continues to behave rashly&rdquo;. So in this <em>śloka</em>, it is implied that annulment of grief would be the fruit of a combination of both knowledge and action.</p>
<p>Therefore, here, all grief or despair that might arise in regard to the adoption of the <em>upāya</em>, whether before its adoption or after it, or in the middle of it - all this grief is here (said to be) annulled,</p>
<p>If it be asked how, the answer is as follows; Despair may arise in many forms ;- (1) in regard to one&rsquo;s competency for the <em>upāya</em>, (2) in regard to (the potency of) the <em>upāya</em> itself, (3) in regard to the things that the <em>prapanna</em> should do after <em>prapatti</em>, and so also (4) in regard to the end to be attained including the full and perfect service or <em>kaiṅkarya</em> to be rendered. (1) Among them, this <em>dharma</em> called <em>śaraṇāgati</em>, which is to be adopted, is not confined to any particular family (<em>jāti</em>) caste or āśrama. Provided there are the desire for attaining the end in view and faith in the <em>upāya</em> which is the means for that attainment and such things as knowledge of one&rsquo;s being destitute (of other _upāya_s), there is no reason why any one should despair at the thought that he may not be competent (to adopt the <em>upāya</em>).</p>
<p>(2) The <em>(sādhya) upāya (prapatti)</em> is capable of being performed or adopted in a single instant with all its accessories, it is easy of performance; it does not need to be repeated; it does not take long to bear fruit; its accessories are not difficult; it is capable of yielding the desired fruit just at the time when it is desired; therefore to the man who is destitute (of other _upāya_s ) and who is afraid of delay (in attaining the desired end), there is no reason for despair at all thinking that he may have to adopt other _upāya_s like <em>bhakti</em> , which have to be practised for a long time with all accessories thereof, which are difficult of performance even to those who are very careful and whose accessories are also equally difficult to accomplish and which yield the desired fruit only after a long time,</p>
<p>The Saviour who is propitiated by this easier <em>upāya</em> and who is to grant the desired end is easily accessible to all, inspires confidence, is supremely compassionate and is independent and omnipotent without subjection to any one else). Therefore there is no reason why one should despair at the thought of the <em>Siddhopāya</em> (the Lord).</p>
<p>(3) After the performance of this <em>upāya</em>, none of the good deeds that may be done by a man either by say of keeping the commands (of the Lord) or winning His approval is an auxiliary or <em>aṅga</em> for <em>prapatti</em>. Therefore even if, owing to adverse circumstances of place and time, !here are shortcomings in their performance, there is no reason for grief or despair at the thought that these shortcomings might adversely affect the accessories (for they are not its accessories ).</p>
<p>If, in dread of certain sins due to prārabdha <em>karma</em>  which render a man absolutely unfit for all <em>karma</em>  like a piece of burnt cloth, by causing a man to offend the great devotees (of God) deliberately, if, in such cases, the man desires at the time of the first <em>prapatti</em> that his actions after <em>prapatti</em> should be free from all such offence or if he performs a later <em>prapatti</em> for avoiding these offences - if he does these, there is no reason for grief.or sorrow at the thought that offences may happen to be committed in future. Even if, at the time of the first <em>prapatti</em>, one has not prayed for a later life free of all offence, in case offences are committed deliberately, the Saviour of those that have no (other) refuge who stated, &ldquo;I will never forsake the man who comes to me in the guise of a friend&rdquo; will create repentance in his mind, and induce him to perform expiation or prayaschitta which (in this case) is a further <em>prapatti</em>. If the man is too stubborn to feel repentant, (the Lord) will cause sufferings by way of punishment and thus prevent him from committing further offences. Thus before the time when the attainment of the desired end is prayed for the expiation will be over, Therefore the <em>prapanna</em> need not feel grieved at the thought that great sufferings like those of hell would come to him as a result of deliberate offences committed by him which flash like lightning and disappear quickly.</p>
<p>(4) Since the <em>ārtaprapanna</em> will have the desired end at the very time of performning <em>prapatti</em>, there is no reason why he should feel grieved at the thought thar the body which resembles hell would continue, (for the body has been thus described):- &quot; If a man is fond of his body constituted of flesh, blood, pus, foecal matter, urine, muscle, fat and bone &ndash; then he should be fond also</p>
<p>of hell&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As for the <em>dṛptaprapanna</em> :</p>
<p>All rites or _dharma_s of renunciation such as <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em> will never be in vain as stated in the <em>śloka</em> :&ndash; &ldquo;The beginning that has been made in this <em>karma</em> -<em>yoga</em> will never prove futile. There is no harm in its being left incomplete; even a fraction of it saves a man from the great fear of <em>samsāra</em>&rdquo; &quot; The foundation that is laid is, as it were, a foundation of stone and especially with regard to the man who has performed <em>śaraṇāgati</em>, it has been stated: &ldquo;I will never forsake him. Further the dripta <em>prapanna</em> is certain of attaining what he desired, though it is delayed until the time specified by him. So the dripta <em>prapanna</em> has no reason to feel grieved at the thought that the good deed in the form of <em>prapatti</em> might be counteracted by certain evil deeds which might be thought capable of doing so, as has been said in the <em>śloka</em> “ A yajna &ldquo;&ldquo;performed by one loses its effect by untruthfulness, tapas perishes by arrogance, age becomes diminished by contemptuous talk of Brahmins and gifts of charity lose their virtue by their revelation.” since he has prayed for <em>mokṣa</em> at the end of this life, he has no reason to feel grieved at the thought that, owing to certain prarabdha <em>karma</em>  ( which has begun to yield its fruit), he might have to take another birth.</p>
<p>Since he is a <em>prapanna</em> for no other object (than <em>mokṣa</em>). all his sins which might act as obstacles will be absolved; therefore he hus no reason to grieve that the supreme end desired by him would suffer delay owing to such hindrances as the enjoyment of his mere disembodied self.</p>
<p>The Lord intends to say :- “You have become the recipient of my grace which can cancel the causes of all forms of grief. So if, hereafter, you should entertain grief or despair, it would be as foolish as when you had no grief or despair before performing <em>prapatti</em>, while being subject to punishment by me. This grief or despair is not in keeping with the peculiar potency of this <em>upāya</em>,</p>
<p>with my glory as <em>Siddhopāya</em> who has accepted the responsibility of protecting you and with your state as one who has done what he ought to do by the surrender of all responsibilities to me.&rdquo; In their last moments_ācārya_s teach their good disciples the purport given above of this last sentence,<em>’ mā śucah</em>’ &ldquo;Do not grieve&rdquo;, which is the quintessence of the <em>carama</em>-<em>śloka</em> (the last <em>śloka</em> ),</p>
<p>Among the words of this <em>śloka</em> (<em>caramaśloka</em>) are expressed explicitly by the words themselves or suggested implicitly by their meaning, the following ideas concerning this <em>upāya</em> :(1) the person who is competent for it, the preliminary condition of being destitute (of all other _upāya_s), the needlessness, for it, of any auxiliary rites which are too difficult to perform, the inappropriateness of trying to perform actions which are beyond one&rsquo;s power, the futility of obstinately attempting to do what is impossible (for one) this <em>upāya</em> being such as will not tolerate (the adoption of any other <em>upāya</em>); (2) the Saviour who alone can be of use to the aspirant for <em>mukti</em>, the Saviour&rsquo;s being perfect and full in such qualities as accessibility and good nature; the Saviour being the teacher of what is most salutary (<em>hita</em>); the end of attainment (viz, the Lord) being Himself the means of attainment; His being capable of acting in all matters without being hindered (by any one) and without the aid of any one else ; His expecting a mere pretext (or <em>vyāja</em>) for protecting (one): His not requiring the intervention of any other <em>upāya</em>: His being capable of being propitiated without any other auxiliary rites: His being the Saviour who can grant whatever fruit is desired; His intolerance of the acceptance of any other protector; His being ever in the company of <em>Śrī</em> (or <em>Lakṣmī</em>); His capacity for being placed in the position of other _upāya_s; His readiness to accept the responsibility or burden (of protecting one); (3) the <em>Sādhyopāya</em> which is of the nature of the surrender of responsibility; its ancillaries; its being within the competency of every one; its requiring to be perforined only once; its being easy of performance; its capacity to bear fruit without delay its being potent enough to annul prarabdhakarma ; (4) the man who performs <em>prapatti</em> being a doer or agent subject to the Supreme Self; his being subject to the authority of the s&rsquo;astras; (5) The Saviour&rsquo;s supreme compassion; His being ever gracious; His independence and freedom from subservience to any one else ; His being irresistible; His not requiring any other aid, His waiting for a pretext (to protect the <em>jīva</em>); (6) the <em>prapanna</em> being one who has done what he onght to do; the absence, on his part, of any need to do anything else (than <em>prapatti</em>) in regard to the <em>upāya</em> adopted by him or the fruit expected from it; his being extremely dear to <em>Bhagavān</em>; (7) the many obstacles ( to <em>mukti</em>) past, present and future; and the varied nature of the different groups of obstacles, their being capable of annulment by the mere will of <em>Iśvara</em>, the time of this annulment being dependent on the will of the <em>prapanna</em>: the nature of the annulment of these obstacles; (8) the manifestation of one&rsquo;s real and essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>), which is different from the mere enjoyment of one&rsquo;s dis-embodied self : the full and perfect enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> ; service of all kinds; freedom from coming back (to <em>samsāra</em>); (9) the manifold causes of grief or despair before (the performance of <em>prapatti</em>), the freedom from such grief or despair after (its performance); freedom from all uncertainty, at all times of reflection; freedom from grief, freedom from fear, a peculiar delight, biding the time when the body will perish and the delight in the performance of service free froin offence; these are the principal ideas (suggested) along with other things required for them.</p>
<p>A SUMMARY OF THE MEANING OF THE</p>
<p><em>CARAMA</em> <em>ŚLOKA</em>:&ndash;  page622</p>
<p>*This is the sum and substance of the meaning of the <em>śloka</em> :</p>
<p>&quot; Your knowledge is limited; your ability is insignificant; your life is short and you are also impatient of delay. Therefore do not go about seeking other _upāya_s which you cannot (fully) understand, which you cannot easily adopt and which can bear fruit only after much delay. Realise that I who am easy of access to all, who am the Saviour of all the worlds, and who am endowed with all the attributes essential for a Saviour, am the only <em>upāya</em> and perform the surrender of the responsibility of protecting your self to me with its five aṅgas. When you have adopted this <em>upāya</em>, you will have done what you ought to do, you will become my ward and be extremely dear to me. Supremely compassionate and gracious, independent and omnipotent, I will, myself, by my mere will and without any other aid, and for the fulfilment of iny own purposes, free you from the manifold, endless, and insurmountable groups of obstacles without leaving any trace of them. I will enable you to have enjoyments similar to mine own, since you will enjoy myself and all that belongs to me. I will find delight in making you render all forms of service in all places, at all times and in all circumstances — service which will be of the nature of the overflow of the full and perfect enjoyment (of myself). You have absolutely no cause for grief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This path (<em>prapatti</em>) has been disclosed (to us) by_ācārya_s who resorted to that unique <em>dharma</em> (<em>Siddhopāya</em>) which can grant all (desired objects) and which is ever accompanied by <em>Śrī</em> and who (by so doing) became free from (all) grief.</p>

<p>Giving up those _dharma_s which have to be performed with extreme care, we were convinced that the true refuge for us is the feet of that Gopala which are fragrant with tulasi and we resorted to them at once. By the gracious and fascinating words of that Supreme Person, we have become free from ignorance so that the <em>karma</em>  which has been separated from us can never follow us.</p>

<p>There are some (acharyas) who have understood the noble and charming <em>śloka</em> uttered by Hari which is like the gem koustubha taken out of the ocean of Vyasa&rsquo;s Veda (<em>Mahābhārata</em>).

<p>The noble_ācārya_, who longs to attain the primaeval and heavenly abode of <em>Viṣṇu</em>, lights up the imperishable lamp of spiritual tradition (sampradaya) in some deserving disciple who has been tested in various and well-known ways and found fit (to receive the light). (He lights up this lamp) with true affection (sneha) when the disciple is in a state of mind (daśā) free from unworthy qualities (guṇa) like a well-tested and weil-burnished vessel with oil (sneha) poured into it and with a wick (daśā) made of pure threads (guṇa)<sup id="fnref:354"><a href="#fn:354" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">354</a></sup> .</p>

<p>TO WHOM SHOULD) THE ĀCĀRYA IMPART</p>
<p>SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE :&ndash; page625</p>
<p>It has been said :&ndash; &ldquo;Thou art the Father of this world consisting of things that move about and things that do not move. Thou art also its <em>guru</em>; therefore, Thou art the greatest of those who deserve to be worshipped.&rdquo; and again. &quot; We request permission of all (those who are assembled here) to show our reverence to <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa wlo deserves, in virtue of the perfection of all his (good) qualities, the foremost tokens of reverence, and who is (at the same time) the <em>ācārya</em>, the father, the <em>guru</em> and one fit to be honoured.&quot; As stated in these <em>śloka_s, the Lord of all is the Supreme_ācārya</em>. From Him has come down to us the spiritual</p>
<p>tradition of noble acaryas. The (true) acarya collects together the meanings of the three great secrets (_mantra_s) whose delightful flavour cannot, like the milk of the lioness, be appreciated by strangers. He makes a brief summary of them and then meditates on them. (Ilow and to whom, after doing so, he should teach these truths as described in the following _śloka_s :). &ldquo;He who guards this meaning from those who are unworthy and imparts it to those who are worthy he is fit to be honoured by me.&rdquo; &quot; This (the Bhagavad Gitā) is not to be taught to those who have not performed tapas. It should never be taught to the man who has no devotion or <em>bhakti</em> and who does not show eagerness to learn it. It should never be imparted to the man who hates me. He who teaches this greatest of secrets to my devotees will show <em>parābhakti</em>  or deep devotion to me and will attain me. There is no doubt of this.&quot; &ldquo;This great <em>śāstra</em> should not be taught to men who are not constantly repeating the Vedas. This <em>śāstra</em> will impart wisdom to the man who is eager to learn it and bows devoutly to the <em>guru</em> for attaining wisdom. This should not be imparted to the man who is ever in the habit of telling lies; (it should not be imparted) to deceitful men, to eunuchs, to men that are mentally perverse, to those who are so conceited as to think that they are learned) when they tre not truly so, and to those who cause affliction to others. I will tell you of the man who deserves to be taught (this <em>śāstra</em>). Listen. It should be taught to the man who has faith, who is virtuous, who never indulges in vilifying others, who can understand sound reasoning and who is capable of grasping what is taught. (It should be taught) to the man who performs the rites and duties (ordained for him) and who endures the inconveniences and discomforts arising from their performance, to the man who is intent on doing what is good to the world and who desires to live in solitude. (It should be taught) to the man who delights in the injunctions of the _śāstra_s, who dreads vain argumentation and who has learnt much from acaryas.. It should be</p>
<p>taught to the man who is grateful for the help rendered to him, who considers patience and compassion as desirable virtues and who looks upon all eternal souls as resembling himself. Wise men declare that this śāstra should not be taught to those who have not these virtues. When the <em>śāstra</em> is imparted to the unworthy, it will not bring good to the teacher for that very reason. Even if this earth is filled with gems and offered (to one), one should not, O king, impart this <em>śāstra</em> to the man who has not subjected himself to discipline. This noble sõstra may certainly be taught to the man who has subdued his senses. You need not be, in the least, afraid, O Karala. You have been taught this <em>śāstra</em> treating of the Supreme <em>Brahman</em>. You have been taught the Supreme <em>Brahman</em> that has no beginning, no middle and no end, that is free from sorrow and that is most holy.&rdquo; &ldquo;If a fit  disciple cannot be found, the man who is fit to teach this <em>vidyā</em> may (even) die with his <em>vidyā</em> or learning. It should, on no account, even at the time of great adversity, be sown in a desert&rdquo;. &ldquo;Ignorant&rsquo; men who consider themselves learned and hypocrites who pretend to observe <em>dharma</em> while they are really doing a_dharma_ - these men under the disguise of the virtuous harass (good) men who practise <em>dharma</em>. He who has skill in performing well such actions as would lead to <em>mokṣa</em> but who, elsewhere, follows the ways of the world &ndash; he is looked down upon as a <em>guru</em> of a low type. Many are the men who are foolish; the man with a clear intelligence may occasionally be found somewhere and only one among many. He is a man with all virtuous mind who will never allow his intelligence to be clouded by men that are silly. Trust should never be placed in any man; this is a matter for careful consideration, especially, in Kali yuga. Great sinners confound the intellects of the weak-minded with perverse reasons spouted forth like a downpour of rain. One should guard <em>dharma</em> from the unfit and perform <em>dharma</em>. Never teach any. thing to one who does not beg for it. Even when asked, secret meanings or the mysteries of religion and the true doctrine should not be revealed (lightly). To him who has sought one, with true devotion, who has constant faith in the _śāstra_s, who is pure and is prepared to learn in accordance with the rules &ndash; to him one should teach everything. The man who teaches the _śāstra_s to the unworthy for winning the respect of others, for wealth, for being honoured by others and for getting rid of the suffering (caused by poverty ) - that man strays from the right path. (You) may sow the seed in a desert, give (your) daughter in marriage to a eunuch and give a garland of flowers to a monkey; but (you) should never impart (instruction) in the <em>śāstra</em> to one who is unworthy&rdquo;. &ldquo;This great <em>mantra</em> should not be taught to an atheist, to one who is insincere, or who is not devout, to one who delights in harassing others and to a miser. This <em>mantra</em> is not fit to be taught to such as these. It should be taught by the ācārya to the man who is sincere, to one who has devotion to his <em>guru</em>, to the man who has devotion to <em>Viṣṇu</em> and who is intent on doing good to all beings. These two things should be borne well in mind.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thus have I uttered words which are like a garland to the Lord and words that would delight His servants, for the sake of the enjoyment of the Lord which is sweet as ambrosia&rdquo;. &ldquo;Here have I taught deep truths in the form of verses each of which begins with the last word of the previous verse (<em>antādi</em>). Considering their great value, receive them without casting them among the unworthy&rdquo;. As stated in such treatises as the above, viz., Sātvata, Bhagavad Gitā, the discourse between Vasiṣṭa and Karala, Śāṇḍilya <em>Smṛti</em> and Satyaki tantra, the ancient _ācārya_s would teach only to those who had such qualities as goodness and faith and who would therefore be approved of by the Saviour. (They would teach these truths) only to those who were of the nature of the gods (Devas) as described in the following _śloka_s :- &ldquo;These are the qualities, O, Bharata, which enrich man with a nature similar to that of the gods :- fearlessness, a mind free from the taint of rajas and tamas, meditation on the essential nature of the self, charitableness, subjugation of the senses, the performance of yajnas or sacrifice, the study of ones Veda, austerities like fasting, being the same in thought, word and deed, refraining from doing evil to others, speaking that truth which will be wholesome to other beings, freedom from anger, giving up what is productive of evil to oneself, control of the mind, refraining from tale-bearing, compassion to all creatures, freedom from desires, accessibility to the good, shamefulness at the thought of doing what is wicked, serenity of mind even when the objects of sense pleasure are very near, never yielding to the vicious, forbearance even when injured by others, mental courage in continuing to do one&rsquo;s duties even in times of great adversity, the purity (of body and mind) that is necessary for the performance of such rites as are enjoined in the <em>śāstra</em>, freedom from treachery and freedom from.conceit.&rdquo; So also, it has been said; &ldquo;Creation  is of two kinds &ndash; the god-like and <em>āsuric</em>. The god like are, by nature, always full of devotion to <em>Viṣṇu</em>. The āsuric are the very opposite of this.&rdquo; Those men with a nature like that of the gods would be tested by (our)_ācārya_s for ascertaining their real character as stated in the following _śloka_s: &ldquo;The disciple&rdquo; shonld be tested in varions ways for a period of one year, or half of it, or (at least) three months and he should be tanght with compassion and withont any thought of gain and the like&quot;, and &ldquo;If a man has come by chance from a distant land with a mind full of the love of the Lord, he should be taught what he desires withont any prolonged tests&rdquo;. (Having ascertained his fitness), the ācārya would reveal (spiritual truths) in such a manner that six ears could not hear them (i.e. that it could be heard only by the <em>śiṣya</em>&rsquo;s two ears and the <em>guru</em>&rsquo;s two ears and no other) and only to a disciple who had no desires and was content with what he had in regard to other things and who was keenly desirous only of learning the s&rsquo;astras._ācārya_s of olden days would guard these secrets from asuric natures which are different and which have, as their possessions, such attributes as the following:&ndash; Performing  <em>dharma</em> for the sake of praise, delight in the enjoyment of sense-pleasures which make one indifferent to the knowledge of what is good and what is evil, irrational arrogance, anger, harshness of speech and folly&quot;. They would keep the s&rsquo;astra hidden like a wealthy man who would (guard) a cherished treasure and see to its proper use:</p>
<p>THE NATURE OF THE TEACHING : page630</p>
<p>They would teach their śiṣyas such truths as the following:</p>
<p>(1) Tattva. “There is a self or ātmā which is eternal and different from the body and the senses. Besides these two viz., the sentient beings and non-sentient things, there is a Supreme Self who dwells within all of them as their ruler and who is the <em>śeṣī</em> (for whom they exist). Other than this Supreme Self there is no one, either oneself or others, that can protect the self&quot;. (2) Hita : They will also teach the means (<em>hita</em>) by which the end can be trained, in the following words to be uttered by the śiṣya &ldquo;From beginningless time, I have been in <em>samsāra</em> subject to the cycle of births and deaths. In order that I may not have such sufferings as dwelling within the embryo, I pray that Thou shouldst grant me Thy holy feet and save me.&rdquo; (With these words) and with the utterance of <em>Dvaya</em> , preceded by obeisance to the succession of _guru_s, taught graciously by the _ācārya_s, the _ <em>, should be taught to seek the feet of Nārāyaṇa and <em>Śrī</em> and surrender his self and whatever is his, as also the burdens or responsibilities connected with them, when the good acarya has thus introduced the <em>śiṣya</em> to the Lord, the <em>śiṣya</em> should be made to feel assured that the Lord would never, thereafter, forsake him so that he may live the rest of his life here in the spirit of good will to every one and free from all offence and his later life may become the prelude <em>to</em> <em>mokṣa</em>. Thus he would teach the śiṣya what he should do after the surrender of responsibility (bhara_nyāsa</em>) in as brief á manner as would suit the aptitude of the śiṣya.</p>

In these words our spiritual teachers whose sole wealth was their compassion gave us, of their own accord, as a heritage, the (spiritual) wealth divided into three classes (viz, tativa, <em>hita</em>, <em>puruṣārtha</em>), when we had surrendered ourselves to them.</p>
<p>All these words of mine on the three secrets (<em>mantra_s) found in the earlier and later chapters) are in accordance with the spiritual tradition of Vedānta Udayana, otherwise called, Madappalli āchān, (the preceptor in charge of the kitchen), (who propagated the truths of Vedanta like Udayana commenting on Tarka_śāstra</em>). Kidambi Appullar made me learn these words like a parrot, just as he had learnt them from his own ācharya (his father). (Therefore ) these words are those that illumined his mind owing to the compassion of the Lord and that were guarded by him without forgetfulness and taught to me without any error.</p>

The _śāstra_s declare that the <em>śiṣya</em> should behave in this way) merely in order that he may not be looked upon with contempt by (those who are in) the two vibhūtis (i,e.) this world, the <em>līlā</em> <em>vibhūti</em> and the region of eternal glory (<em>nitya</em> <em>vibhūti</em>) and by the Lord who has these (two) _vibhūti_s. (They give this advice) in order that the (śiṣya) may not resemble such men as Hiranya and Ravana who did evil to Prahlāda and Vibhishana for giving the wholesome advice. It has been stated:- &ldquo;The man who steals learning ( by listening to the <em>ācārya</em> without his permission and in hiding, the man who does evil to his <em>guru</em>, and the man who speaks ill of the Vedas and of the Lord who rules over all these men, the śrutis declare, should be punished at once&rdquo;. So when the <em>śiṣya</em> is asked to behave properly to the <em>guru</em>, it is not to say that, by doing so, he will make due requital or recompense (for what the <em>guru</em> has done to him), but that he would then avoid the evil consequences for himself (referred to above).</p>
<p>It is said: &ldquo;The <em>śiṣya</em> should surrender his body, his property and his life-breath to his <em>guru</em>&rdquo;, and likewise it is said, “The <em>śiṣya</em> should give his <em>guru</em> as dakshina the whole of his wealth or one half of it or one fourth of it. If he is unable to do so, he should give whatever he can.&quot; These _śloka_s state only some of the duties of the <em>śiṣya</em> like prostration (namaskars) and salutation (abhivadana). They do not consider this gift as a requital or recompense to the ācārya, who does not expect any such return and imparts instruction merely as a matter of duty; for it is said: “The <em>guru</em> should teach out of compassion and without any desire (for profit)&quot;.</p>
<p>When it is stated in the Vedantas that the <em>śiṣya</em> should behave towards the <em>guru</em> as towards <em>Bhagavān</em> (Himself) and should have as devoted an affection to the <em>guru</em> as to the Lord, when it is said, “The <em>śiṣya</em> should never misbehave either with the mind or with the speech or with the body and should behave towards him as if he is not different or separate from himself&quot; and further, “The śiṣya should adore the ācārya as he does <em>Bhagavān</em> &ldquo;&ndash;when writers like Śāṇḍilya and Apastamba say so, they do not prescribe the offer of a fee or recompense. They give the advice merely in order that the śiṣya who has the <em>śāstra</em> for his eyes may not become blind of vision with eyes wide open, and in order that he, poor from his birth onward, may not lose this (blissful) experience which resembles the (blissful) experience of <em>Bhagavān</em>. That all this is no fee or recompense (to the <em>guru</em>) has been declared by Śāṇḍilya <em>Bhagavān</em> in the following <em>śloka</em> : “Even the gods cannot make a recompense for the gift of the knowledge of God. The śiṣya should (therefore) give whatever lies in his power to the ācārya who has given him (this) instruction.&rdquo; When it is said &quot; whatever lies in his power&quot;, it means that it should be given as an outlet for his affection and regard. The śiṣya should, on no account, consider himself as having thereby recompensed his <em>guru</em>.</p>
<p>THE DUTIES OF THE ŚIṢYA : page634</p>
<p>The <em>śiṣya</em>, who is thus without any means of recompensing (his <em>guru</em>), should consider it his duty to behave as follows:&ndash; He should not let the instructions imparted to him become useless like water kept in a skull, by actions and observances opposed to them; for it has been said : - “Water kept in a skull and milk preserved in a water-skin made of dog&rsquo;s leather becoine worthless owing to the impurity of the containers. So also does the <em>śāstra</em> taught to one who misbehaves. The <em>śiṣya</em> should not make mere learning an end in itself, for it is said: “That <em>Śāstra</em> which, having been earnt from the ācārya, does not lead to non-attachment (to worldly things), to the performance of <em>dharma</em> or to serenity of mind that <em>śāstra</em>, however beautiful in its diction and style, is as useless to the man as the cawing of a crow. He should not eat the vomit, as it were, by making the <em>śāstra</em> which comes out of his mouth the means of his livelihood. He should not make the <em>śāstra</em> the prostitute&rsquo;s adornment, the sandal paste (chandana) made only for sale, the bag of parched rice emptied in a thoroughfare, or the garland of flowers in the monkey&rsquo;s hands, for it has been said in ridicule :- Learned men who study their subjects carefully, again and again, owing to their greed for money make their learning useful to others like prostitutes adorning their persons again and again to serve (the lusts of) others.&quot;</p>
<p>Learning approached the Brahmin and said, I am your wealth; guard me with care; do not give me away to those who have no liking (for me). If you guard me in this manner I shall become very powerful&quot;. As desired in those words, learning should not be betrayed into the hands of those who already clasp hate and the like in their hands.</p>
<p>The <em>śiṣya</em> should clearly realise that he cannot make any recompense to the ācārya who has enabled him, though born blind, to become fit for the assembly of the immortals that are free from ignorance and error. As taught in the <em>śloka</em>: “ The man who worships <em>Bhagavān</em> alone (the <em>ekāntin</em>) should, while speaking of himself, call himself the follower of <em>Viṣṇu</em>. He should never refer to himself by his village, or his family, for, to him, Bhagavan is everything&quot;. Superior to this is the state (described by Viswamitra while addressing Dasaratha ): - &quot; This is indeed befitting one who was born of a noble race and who always calls himself Vasiṣṭa&rsquo;s disciple. No one else would call himself so, O Best of Kings”. The śiṣya should realise that the Saviour [<em>Śrī</em> Rāma] Himself was born in such a family and adopted this form of referring to himself and should adopt it in his own life saying :&ndash;&ldquo;You have reformed me froin wickedness. What requital can I make to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE IMPARTING OF INSTRUCTION SHOULD BE PRECEDED BY MEDITATION OF THE SUCCESSION OF _GURU_S: page636</p>
<p>When the śiṣya hands over the great wealth of the truths contained in the gist of the three mysteries (<em>mantra_s) thus acquired by him(from his_ācārya</em>) to one who, as pointed out in an earlier chapter, has been found fit for it, he should impart instruction first on the succession of_ācārya_s and reveal also his gratitude (to them) and the sacredness of those truths. As an example are quoted the words of the _Brahma_rishi <em>Śrī</em> Parāśara to <em>Bhagavān</em> Maitreya:&ndash; &quot; <em>Brahma</em>, born of the lotus, the grandfather of all, first gave instruction to great sages like Daksha at their request, In that same way was the instruction imparted by them to King Purukutsa on the banks of the Narbada. He handed it over to Sarasvata and by Sarasvata was it imparted to me&quot;. When the</p>
<p>man who imparts instruction in the mysteries of the science of the soul is without a tradition and teaches (merely) on the strength of his own reading of the books or of what he overheard from (a hiding place) behind a wall, he will, like one who wears stolen jewels. be ever in dread of those that see him. Moreover it may even become sinful, for it has been said :- &ldquo;The <em>mantra</em> which is learnt by mere chance by one in hiding, under some pretext or from books &ndash; that <em>mantra</em> will be of no avail; on the other hand, it may even cause evil&rdquo;. Even when a man has learnt from a <em>guru</em> and then teaches, if he should learn and teach against the regulations enjoined for it, he would create disgust in the minds of onlookers like one who wears jewels made from the money given to him along with Kala<sup id="fnref:357"><a href="#fn:357" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">357</a></sup> *</p>
<p>Kala : When a man is dangerously ill and longs for recovery. he has the figure of a man (Kalapurusha) made with gingelly seeds, decks it with jewels and gives it to a poor man along with money. To receive such a gift is looked upon as a disgusting thing.</p>
<p>(These regulations) may be seen in the following _śloka_s &quot; Bow to the <em>guru</em>, ask for explanations, render service to him and then learn the essential nature of the self&quot;.</p>
<p>It is said also, &ldquo;Maitreya prostrated (pranipatya) before Parāśara and made salutations to hiin (abhivadya)&rdquo;. As stated in the <em>śloka</em> :-&ldquo;He who imparts instruction in violation of the regulations and he who learns violating the regulations — of these two, one will die or will come to hate the other&rdquo; as stated here, it may even have evil consequences. Even when the man has learnt according to the regulations and then teaches, if he should not render the praise to his <em>guru</em>, his <em>śiṣya</em> may suspect that the truths revealed by him may have no basis (or authority) like parasitic plants growing (on the branches of trees) and treat them with disregard. This omission of giving due praise to one&rsquo;s <em>guru</em> before one&rsquo;s <em>śiṣya</em> is included as one among the thirty-two kinds of offences. It has been stated: “ The wise man should reveal (the greatness of) his <em>guru</em> and guard the <em>mantra</em> with great care.</p>
<p>By the omission to reveal (the former) and the omission to guard (the latter) respectively, a person&rsquo;s wealth and term of life suffer diminution&quot;. (By this omission), the wealth of enjoying Bhagavan with clarity of knowledge and the state of mind which consists in the thought of one being a <em>śeṣa</em>, which is the cause of the soul or self becoming and continuing as an entity - these two will suffer decline. If, while revealing the greatness of his <em>guru</em>, a man should contradict the teaching imparted to him by the <em>guru</em> in the _śāstra_s, he would be called a deceiver and become also a sinner, for it is said: &ldquo;He who &ldquo;teaches astronomy, law, the <em>śāstra</em> of expiatory rites and the science of medicine against the spirit of the respective _śāstra_s is called a _Brahma_ghātaka&rdquo; or one who has committed the sin of killing a Brahmin &ldquo;.</p>
<p>If a man should fail to impart instruction to a worthy <em>śiṣya</em> at the appropriate time, he would be called a miser and incur also the sin of violating the Lord&rsquo;s command contained in the <em>śloka</em> : “One should cast off one&rsquo;s body after imparting one&rsquo;s knowledge of the self to a worthy śiṣya. A man should not die without iniparting to a worthy śiṣya that knowledge which is the cause of the world&rsquo;s being (or which is the cause of the world&rsquo;s knowledge)&rdquo;. Therefore when the king&rsquo;s torch-bearer is commanded by the king to go on a certain mission, he would hand over the torch in his hand to some one who is found fit for it and then start (on his mission). When a man imparts instruction in a similar manner to a pupil who is apt for it, he should first reveal (the greatness of) his <em>guru</em> and then teach the truths taught to him. Even when, owing to some (favourable) circumstances, he has received divine vision and divine auditions and learnt truths with their help, he should express the truth in the following words: - &ldquo;I learnt this owing to the grace of my great_ācārya_. I am not stating what I learnt by my own cleverness&rdquo; This is what (Sañjaya), for example, says : &ldquo;By the graces of Vyasa did I hear, directly, this great Yoga_śāstra_, which <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa, who has wisdom and other attributes taught in person&rdquo;. If he should say so, the truths that he teaches would be held in high esteem. He would (also) then be esteemed as a grateful <em>śiṣya</em> by sātvikas. As one who spoke the truth, he would be regarded by the Upaniṣads and by the Person revealed in the Upaniṣads as an authority having the same validity as they themselves are. His_ācārya_ too, would feel gratified to find that, in this grateful and diligent śiṣya, his labours have borne fruit.</p>

When a worthy <em>śiṣya</em> having the necessary virtues has been found, he instructs him in the spiritual tradition and gleans, for his own observances, all that is good in the conduct and observances of great men and becomes worthy (himself) of the appreciation of the hosts of the eternal sūris.</p>
<p>TOPICS TREATED OF SO FAR page640</p>
<p>Here (in this treatise), we have set forth, just as we learnt them ourselves and just as we believe them to be true in our heart of hearts, without giving room to any ignorance, doubt or misconception, the following topics of knowledge in accordance with what is sanctioned by the śrutis, the _smṛti_s, the _sūtra_s and the ancient tradition and in accordance also with right reason: (1) How the <em>jīva_tma whose essential nature is such that he is fit to enjoy the bliss of Bhagavan just like the suris - how he has lost this fitness from beginningless time, how later he acquires the spirit of detachment (vairāgya) in some measure, how he comes in contact with a worthy_ācārya</em> from whom he begins to learn the truths and the means of attaining the ends desired by him; (2) how among the _pramāṇa_s or valid sources of knowledge, the three secrets or mysteries (_mantra_s), are of the greatest importance; (3) how, among the meanings revealed in these (_mantra_s), such things as the relationship of soul and body that exists between the Supreme Ruler and those which are ruled over by Him are the central and most essential doctrines to be learnt (4) how the five subjects of knowledge (artha. panchaka) including that relationship which have been summarised by our ancient_ācārya_s are contained in the three great secrets or mysteries (_mantra_s) (5) what the chief aim is of those who, among these five subjects of knowledge, devote themselves to a classification and study of the three _tattva_s or Reals (6) how among these three Reals or _tattva_s, <em>Iśvara</em>, who is described in the _sātvika śāstra_s is the Lord with His spouse <em>Śrī</em> (viz. Nārāyaṇa).(7) how the man who has clearly learnt these subjects becomes eager for <em>mukti</em> and seeks the _upāya_s for <em>mukti</em> (8) the classification of those who are competent to adopt the different _upāya_s, (9) the classification of _upāya_s suitable for the competency of different individuals (10) how, among the _upāya_s, the man who wants to adopt <em>prapatti</em> as a direct and independent <em>upāya</em> should have certain characteristics or marks of competence (11) the classification of accessories enjoined as appropriate for this _upāya_s which has to le performed only once (12) the nature of this important duty called the surrender of the burden or responsibility (concerning the self) with its accessories, to be performed by the man (13) how the man that has performed this <em>prapatti</em> with its _aṅga_s has done what he ought to do, in as much as he has surrendered the responsibility to one who is the Universal Saviour (14) the signs or marks by which a man could realise that this state has been attained by him (15) how, if he is not so impatient as to pray for inmediate release (by death), he should, for the rest of his life, render service (to <em>Bhagavān</em> and His devotees) as befitting one whose essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) is that of a <em>śeṣa</em> (16) how the service to <em>Bhagavān</em> extends as far as service to His devotees (17) how this service should be rendered in accordance with the regulations prescribed in the _śāstra_s, since what is against the liking of the Master, who is the Ruler, cannot be called service (at all) (18) the ways in which or the means by which the man who has entered on his career of service in accordance with the _śāstra_s could avoid offences from being committed in future and expiate or atone for those committed in the past, (19) how the fit place for the residence of the man who is to render faultless service in times free froin danger or serious adversity is the place where there are temples sacred to the Lord and which are (therefore) resorted to by His devotees. (20) how, to the man who has been living such a life, the soul&rsquo;s departure from the gross body may take place, by the peculiar will of the Saviour, in any place and at any time irrespective of their being usually considered worthy or unworthy (21) how the self that has started (from the body) proceeds, like a prince invited by his father to his installation as heir-apparent, in full glory to travel along the arcirādi route to Paramapada, (22) how after reaching there, the self will have the full and perfect enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> which will include also free and voluntary service or <em>kaiṅkarya</em> and which is the supreme state of Lordship reserved for the <em>mukta</em> (23) the <em>Siddhopāya</em> which is the most important of what are to be known (24) the <em>sādhyopāya</em> which is the most important of those things that are to be performed (25) and (26) the ways in which misconceptions arising frou impure food, from association (with undesirable persons) as also from the character of the yuga and the like should be removed, misconceptions in regard to the potency of this <em>upāya</em> in relation to the man who has adopted it, misconceptions which describe its potency as higher or lower than what is stated in the _śāstra_s (27, 28 &amp; 29 ) the construction and interpretation of the words and the sentences in the three secrets or mysteries (_mantra_s) which enable a man to meditate on all these points, (30) the regulations in regard to the imparting of instruction and the refraining from it, which have to be kept in mind by the ācārya who has to propagate a knowledge of the spiritual tradition concerning these truths in accordance with the _śāstra_s and (31) the duties expected of the <em>śiṣya</em> who, on account of his inability to recompense his āchārya adequately has to remain eternally indebted to him &mdash;</p>
<p>THE GOOD RESULTS THAT WILL FOLLOW FROM</p>
<p>A STUDY OF THIS TREATISE:</p>
<p>The śiṣya should, at first, approach the good_ācārya_ in the proper manner and beg of him in these words : &ldquo;I am your pupil and have sought you (for guidance). (Therefore) command me as to what I should do&rdquo;. He should listen (to the ācārya&rsquo;s discourse) with reverence and close attention and should also glean with care the advice which would supplement (what is taught by the ācārya) as stated in the following <em>śloka</em> :- “One should observe the wise words of great men and their virtuous ways of life and glean from them whatever is required for oneself, in the same way as some live on the grain gleaned in the fields. He should try to have a clear understanding of what is taught therein by repeated study.</p>
<p>It has been said: &ldquo;The <em>dharma</em> followed by the good is too subtle, O monkey, to be easily understood&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is no end to arguments. The Vedas are diverse; the rishis from whose words truth could be ascertained are many. The truth regarding <em>dharma</em> is hid (as it were) in a cave,&rdquo; and also, &quot; <em>Dharma</em>&rsquo; is more subtle than the sharp edge of a razor. Who is there competent to declare what it is ? &quot; Thus where even sages have to tread with the greatest care, we have to follow what is stated in the following _śloka_s :- &ldquo;The way that is followed by great men is the way (to be followed by others)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Whatever is said, even in sport, by Brahmins seated in the chariot of the <em>dharma</em> _śāstra_s and armed with the sword of the Vedas &ndash;(Whatever is said by them) is considered as supreme <em>dharma</em>&rdquo;. Therefore to walk along the path followed by the ancient_ācārya_s who depended solely on the _śruti_s and the _smṛti_s and cleared the way so that it may be free from hindrances - to walk along this way is not improper for us. To those who walk along this path, there will be no such painful anxieties as those feit by great sages when they said :- &ldquo;There is no rest house, no staff for support, no food (on the route) and no one to guide us. It is the path which leads to hell and is too dark to walk along. How will you</p>
<p>traverse it alone ?&rdquo; and “The path leading to the house of Yama where there is no water for quenching the thirst, no staff for support, no shade to sit under, no house or lodge to rest in and which produces prolonged suffering.&rdquo; To one who follows the track of great men, there would be no such painful paths. They need not be tossed about to and fro like cotton cleaned of its seeds, combed, and carded before being spun and go up and come down, like the bucket in a picotah[‍?] , along the path of smoke (<em>dhūmādi</em> route)<sup id="fnref:358"><a href="#fn:358" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">358</a></sup> described in the Pañcāgni <em>vidyā</em> in the sixth chapter of Chāndogya upaniṣad,</p>
<p>Going up to <em>svarga</em> and coming down to this world of <em>samsāra</em> after the fruits of good deeds have been enjoyed there and repeating this process.</p>
<p>It has been said :&ndash; &ldquo;O. Lord,&rsquo; Thou playest, as with balls, with creatures bound by the strings of <em>karma</em>  and going up and coming down&rdquo;. To the man who follows the ways of great men, the state when he is thus a toy for the sport of <em>Bhagavān</em> will soon pass away. He will then go along a path which is superior to the paths followed by others to attain high ends (like <em>svarga</em>), because it will lead to an end or goal greater than all others and will never result in a return to <em>samsāra</em>. It has been said:- &ldquo;I know&rsquo; that the path which will be trodden by the man who has exclusive devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em> is far superior to others&rdquo; and likewise, “He, ( the <em>jīva</em> ) starts from the body by an excellent path, which is so cool as to remove the sufferings of <em>samsāra</em>.&quot; and further, &ldquo;to those &ldquo;who have practised <em>yoga</em>, (all) sufferings will cease and they will then journey by the <em>Deva yāna</em> route,&rdquo; This excellent path will terminate in the region (Paramapada) described in the following <em>śloka_s &ndash; &quot; It is a &lsquo;splendid region on reaching which the self will become (itself), (i. e.) free from a_vidyā</em> and consequently from suffering,&rdquo; &quot; The abode of the Supreme Being, <em>Viṣṇu</em>, shines far more than the sun or the fire.</p>
<p>It is so dazzlingly bright that even the gods and asuras cannot gaze at it,&quot; “Those great souls who have completed their practice of <em>yoga</em> and have become free from ignorance and illusion reach that region from which there is no return to this world of <em>samsāra</em>.&quot; &ldquo;When compared with the region where the Supreme Being abides, this <em>svarga</em> and other worlds are, my child, like bells&rdquo;. This path (Devayāna) will terminate in Paramapada which is declared in the <em>śruti_s also as the ultimate terminus of the route leading away from <em>samsāra</em>. The self (that takes that path) will have, for its supporting staff, the grace of <em>Bhagavān</em>, and will have, for the victuals of its journey, the delight in the thought that it will (soon) attain the supreme end of life. As stated in the <em>Brahma</em>-sūtras &ldquo;&rsquo; He will start&rdquo; from there by the opening of the vein (nāḍi) indicated and lighted by the Lord who dwells within the heart&quot; and take the arcirādi route along which, in the respective regions of the gods, he would be greeted and welcomed with honours befitting emperors by the respective deities thereof with auspicious lamps and pitchers full of water (<em>pūrṇakumbha</em>) and attended by their followers. They will escort the self on its path and those deities to whom the man made offerings in the world of <em>karma</em>  before will (now) pay tributes to his self. The self then passes into regions which are beyond their range and attains a supreme perfection which would make it difficult for it to be distinguished from the eternal sūris when it enters their assembly. The self will then reach under the two feet of the Supreme „Ruler and His consort who are resting on a couch in Paramapada, the like of which has been described in the Mahābhārata and the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> in connection with the avatars as their manner of being seated:  Then he saw <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa seated on a throne made of gold and adorned with gems and looking like a blue cloud resting on Mount Meru. His form was radiant and adorned with ornaments of unsurpassed brilliance; he was dressed in a raiment of gold and shone like a blue gem set in gold; on his chest shone the gem kaustubha and He was like a mountain lighted up by the sun and had a crown on His head. Such was His appearance that, in all the three worlds, there could be found no one to be set in comparison with him?&quot; and “Su_mantra</em>, the charioteer, saw <em>Śrī</em> Rāma seated like Kubera on a throne made of gold and having a beautiful coverlet. His body was covered with the paste of sandal red like the blood of the boar, pure, fragrant and of superior quality. Sītā was standing by him with a <em>cāmara</em> in her hand, like the star Chitra near the moon, His splendour is like that of the sun. Su_mantra_, who knew the etiquette (suited to courts), bowed with respect to the invincible <em>Śrī</em> Rāma who ever gave what was asked of him.&quot; (Having reached the feet of the Supreme Being, the self will receive the privilege of rendering all kinds of service suited to all places, all times and all circumstances and be forever blissful as prayed for in the verse :- “We should render, so constantly and without intermission, service to the Lord - such service as will be most appropriate to all times, to all places and to all occasions&quot;.</p>
<p>Thus (both) in the state of endeavour (<em>upāya</em>) and in the state of attainment, the holy feet of Nārāyaṇa, the Lord of <em>Śrī</em>, are our support.</p>

<p>The feet of <em>Śrī</em> Raṅganātha, ever true to their devotees can never be given up; they were once awake to the danger from a mighty wheel (the forın taken by an asura) and hy touching it they made it break into pieces): on another occasion, they crawled on all fours and caused the two Maruda trees which grew close to each other to fall down; on the occasion of His searching (for butter) in the pots h_aṅgī_ng from above, they stood indistinguishable from the mortar to which they were bound (by Yasoda), (On a later day), they gladly consented to go on the mission assigned to them by the virtuous _Dharma_putra; they came to Brindavan to bring about the destruction of the wicked asuras; while gently stroked by the hand of <em>Lakṣmī</em>, they became red like the petals of the lotus; they were favourable to the devotion shown by the great sages who wanted freedom from the bondage of births; they rested in a wonderful vimana (having a resemblance to praṇava), which was an object of worship to kings of the race of Manu; they shone in the chariot of the righteous Arjuna during the great war; they were inflamed with wrath when they danced on the cruel hoods of the serpent, Kaliya, and made them break down; they rested in a region (Paramapada) that could not be (even) imagined by the six systems of philosophical thought; they became the subjects of praise in the tongue of the Alvar (Nammalvar), who was the glory of the beautiful city of Kurugai; they had, for ornaments, the fragrant flowers of Tulasi; they showed their glory by graciously transforming the fallen piece of charcoal into a child (Parikshit); they chased the armies of the asuras to their destruction.</p>

<p>Imbibe the nectar of spiritual tradition which has come down from the Udayana of Vedanta (Kidambi Achan)<sup id="fnref:359"><a href="#fn:359" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">359</a></sup> which is fragrant with the odours streaming forth from the kitchen of the prince of sannyasins (<em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>) and fit to be enjoyed by the assembly of learned men (also gods).</p>
<p>Kidambi Achan, the disciple of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>, was in charge of the kitchen during his <em>ācārya</em>&rsquo;s life-time</p>

<p>Of what avail is anger towards those Vedic scholars who teach the knowledge which they have of the truths, and the way of casting off illusions and errors, as also the nature of the self (as the <em>śeṣa</em> of the Lord), the unique compassion of the Lord shown to those who are destitute of _upāya_s, and the carefree state arising from holding on to the Lord as a refuge as taught in the three mysteries (_mantra_s)? We have spoken (thus far) to those who can appreciate excellence.</p>

<p>Our youth has been spent in the enjoyment resulting from repetitions of the words of that prince of Sannyasins (<em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>). Our days have been lived in happiness by casting off the hell of depending on any others (than the Lord); the arrogance of those who are perverse has also been annihilated for the satisfaction of good men; and for the rest of our life, we shall be earnestly and constantly looking up to the realisation of the vow of compassion taken by that divine couple for the fulfilment of whose purposes alone we exist.</p>

<p>These thirty-two Tamil verses, which, when recited, are like nectar to the ears (that hear them), which explain clearly, the truths that lie deep within the four Vedas the like of which cannot be seen elsewhere and which became possible only owing to the compassion of those_ācārya_s who delight, of their own accord, to impart instruction to śiṣyas, when they find in them integrity of character and freedom from faults like envy &mdash;- these thirty-two verses form an ornament to this treatise by virtue of these three qualities viz., their beautiful diction, their wealth of ideas and their fitness for being sung.</p>

<p>There will be found someone (or other) who has faith in religion, who is keen of intellect and (at the same time) free from envy, whose mind has become pure by following the righteous tradition of good men, whose aim is to attain the highest goal, who is not afraid of conventional judgments and who would look upon wealth and worldly success as if they were mere trash - He will certainly follow the virtuous path (which is described in this treatise) and which will never become obsolete.</p>

<p>Those who have faith in the truths revealed in the Vedas, who have keepness of intellect, who would never think of speaking in depreciation of real merit, whose minds have become pure by the training which they have received from their _guru_s, who have lofty aims, who, being firm of mind, would never swerve from the right path owing to the fear of perverted judgements and who would never care for what is worthless &ndash; these men will enter the righteous path which will never become obsolete and which has been indicated by our pure-minded _ācārya_s who had inore forbearance than even the Earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our _ācārya_s will say :&ndash; &ldquo;This is the right path&rdquo; and will look upon (this treatise) as being delicious like nectar; they can show how the pleasures of the senses are mean and are different from the righteous way (that is described in this treatise). Owing to their desire that the path indicated here should prevail, they will overlook any mistakes of ours that may be found (in the book). We have, by the grace of our _ācārya_s, accepted this as the proper way.</p>

<p>I was so ignorant that I did not know even that eight and two make ten<sup id="fnref:360"><a href="#fn:360" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">360</a></sup> * ; Our Madhava who is eager to bestow on us Paramapada, which is most difficult of access, has taught me (through the ācāryas) the <em>mantra</em> of eight syllables and the other two _mantra_s (<em>Dvaya</em> and <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em>). By His brilliant and noble speech saying: &ldquo;I will see to the absolution of all your sids; Do not be afraid &ldquo;-By these words I have attained the state of staunch faith,</p>
<p>it may mean also &lsquo;I did not know the <em>Dvaya</em> (the two) nor did I know the <em>aṣṭākṣara</em> (the eight )</p>

<p>These states of mind in regard to one&rsquo;s essential nature, the _upāya_s and the end to be attained (which are explained in this treatise) and which are understood only with effort by even those who are in Paramapada are indeed possible of attainment even here in this world of <em>samsāra</em>. This treatise, though decried by perverse minds bent (only) on finding faults, will be found sweet by the Supreme Ruler whose lotus-like feet overflow with honey.</p>

The part played by me is none other than this. Whether this treatise is accepted as worthy or rejected as unworthy, my clear mind, ( men of critical minds, will feel neither elated nor depressed in the least.</p>
