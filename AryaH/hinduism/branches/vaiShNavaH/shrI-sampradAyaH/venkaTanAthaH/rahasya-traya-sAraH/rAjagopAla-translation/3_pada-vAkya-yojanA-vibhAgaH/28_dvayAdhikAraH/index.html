  <p>(28) THE CHAPTER ON THE DVAYA SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>This mantra (Dvaya) which is used for performing s&rsquo;arana. gati to the Lord of Padma ( Lakshmi) is of the nature of the dawn coming after the dark night of samsāra; for having caused it to be heard by Bhagavan, &amp; mso is in the position of one who has done his duty; having repeated it frequently, he is in the position of one who has attained his goal.</p>
<p>The particular upāya (viz. prapatti) which was stated as being indicated directly and explicitly by the middle word of Tiru mantra (namo) or by implication ia its meaning and the goal of attainment ( purushūrtha ) viz. service to the Lord which is indicated in the third word (Nārāyaṇāya) are shown clearly and distinctly in Duaya. This mantra is revealed in kattavalli separa. tely, in two parts (with other passages coming in between ) and is enjoined as fit to be meditated on with the two parts together. It is also explained in such treatises as Sri Prasna Samhita in Pancharātra with details about the number of syllables in it (the aumber of letters, sentences, their order etc ). Therefore it is a tantrika mantra based on the strutiThe statement of some that it is a sentence given by ancient acharyas means only this much: that it should be held in great esteein because it was taught by the ancient achüryas or that Bhagavan who is the Supreme Acharya enjoined it in the Bhagavat Sāstra, (Pūrcharātra). Those who desire to know may find its rishi (its beejam etc.) as for the Moolamantra and the like in accordance with such treatises as the Mantrasastra and the Science of Gramınar (vyākarana).</p>
<p>THE REASON FOR ITS BEING CALLED DVAYA:</p>
<p>This mantra is called Duaya (the Two) because it treats of two points, the upiya and the upeya (the means and the goal of attainment, which are implicit in two slokas (of the Ramayana ), Damely, &ldquo;He (&lsquo;Lakshmana) fell at the two feet of bis brother 1. Ramayana : Ayodya kanda: 31-2</p>

<p>THE NAME DVAYA</p>

<p>and said in the presence of Sita, &ldquo;Thou shalt enjoy thyself with Sita on the slopes of the mountains. Whether thou art awake or asleep, I (Lakshmana) will rooder every form of service to Thee&rdquo; The man who is not for any other upāya or for any other end or object (in view) has full competence for the adoption of this mantra.</p>
<p>Some (achūryas) say that this mantra is called Duaya (The Two), because it indicates (1) the soliciting (vārana) of a Saviour and (2) the surrender of the responsibility (bharasamarpaņam), both in one The same is the reason for the word Dvaya being employed in respeet of such other mantras as &ldquo;Srimad Narayana Swamin&rdquo;. To this mantra also, such things as the adoration of The guru which are prescribed in the following slokas in regard to another mantra concerning prapatti are applicable : &ldquo;After prostrating before the guru, this sacred mantra (literally: the king of mantrasi should be learnt. The guru is, hinuself, the supreme Biabuan; the guru is himself the great upaya; the guru is lim-elf the great vidyā or form of meditation; the guru is hiuisell the sacred siddhopāya, the guru is himself moksha, the guru is hin self the great wealth of jnāna or koowledge and bhakti because he initiates (one) into the mantra, the guru is most venerable. This mantra does not require any suitability or any auspicious position of the stars for its initiation por any purity attainable from baths in holy waters. Nor does it require for its successful initiation any japam, homam, daily repetition and the like. First one should prostrate in full before the guru three times and touch his feet with one&rsquo;s head and receive the mantra like a poor man expecting a hidden treasure. Having thus received the mantra, one should seek refuge under me. By this mantra alone should ope surrender one&rsquo;s self to me. He who has done so be. comes one who bas done what one ought to do &ldquo;.</p>

</ol>
<p>It is learnt from the Sastras (Katavalli and the like) that a single utterance of this mantra by a believer preceded by a know ledge of its meaning as a whyle will secure salvation. The potency of this mantra as distinguished from that of other mantras has been described as follows (by Sri Rawanoja):- &ldquo;In whatever mannere you atter the Dvaya *tc.&rdquo; It bas been said: &ldquo;The man by whom the nane of Bhagavan is uttered even ancong. ciously is freed from all sins as &amp; forest with a lion in it from animals that are afraid of lions &ldquo;, and (so also), &ldquo;The extent of potency that Thy game, O Hari, has in condoping sins exceeds even that of sins that can (ever) be committed by a man who eats dog&rsquo;s flash (i. e, a chandāla,&rdquo;. If, in such passages, the potency of a mere utterance of the Lord&rsquo;s Dane is praised in very high terms, what is said in such treatises as the s&rsquo;ruti about even a single utterance of this great mantra which reveals, in full, the Redeemer, the surrender of the self to Hi&rsquo;n and the fruit to be obtained there. from can be easily realised by the force of pramāas. The reason of this potency may be understood from the pranūlas and from tradition or sampradaya. It is not proper to argne about these subjects wbich are of the nature of mystic doctrines. We can only place faith in them on the strength of what is stated in the s&rsquo;astras. Io such treatises as the Mahabhiirata. it is said: - &ldquo;dignments? based on reason are of no avail in regard to divine and o:her myse teries. The man who desires his happiness should have implicit faith in them like one who is deaf and who is blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The self-surrender which is the prirport of this mantra bas been praised in such slokas is the folluwing and in other contexts : &ldquo;A man shold surrender to Brahman his true and natural self free from all limiting conditivos like aviya. This is bhakti yoga and the karma yoga which is necessary for it. Other things are vain talk.&rdquo; Instead of &lsquo;Other things are yaio tulk&rdquo; there is</p>

<p>another reading of the sloka which would mean “This is (real) knowledge and what is to be acquired with the help of knowledge.&rdquo; Though this sloka bas, for its purport, the surrender of the self, the surrender of the responsibility or burden of protection which is described here is contained within it. Other mantras which are mentioned in such treatises as Vyāsasmriti and in Svetas&rsquo;vatara upanishad like, “Aman should remember that he is the body of the spotless and resplendent Vishnu and with an eager longing for Him, who is the object of attainment, and without any desire for other ends, (he) should surrender his self to Vishnu uttering the mantra &ldquo;Tad Vishnoh&rdquo; - Done of those other mantras reveals the Redeemer, the act of seeking His protection and the fruit arising from it so clearly (as this Dvaya) Even in the Tiru. mantra these three are stated (only) with extreme conciseness. Therefore this Dvaya which reveals, in full, the object of attain. ment and the ineans of attainment is the most important of all mantras dealing with prapatti.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THIS MANTRA</p>
<p>The s&rsquo;aranāgati gadya is a commentary on Draya :</p>
<p>(Sri Rainanuja) has in his gūdy« (prose treatise) given the meaning of this mantra as known from sruti, smriti, Itihāsas Puranas, Blugavat Süstra and the like and in accordance with the traditional order of interpretation of great acharyas :&ndash; It is as follows:-The purport of the word Srimat (in Duaya) is explained in these words in the gadya);-&rdquo; (Lakshmi) whose essential Dature (svarīpa) and whose form rūpa are such as can be held in esteem by Bhagavan and as are in conformity with the nature of) Bhagavan Narayana &ldquo;. In the words beginniog with &ldquo;opposed to everything of the nature of blemish&rdquo; (in the gadya), (Sri Ramanuja) has described at length Bhagavan&rsquo;s essential nature (svarūpa), His foron (ripa ), and His attributes and glories (ribhūtis). So the meaning of the word Narayana has been commented upon (in</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Vyasa Smriti.424 CHAPTER</li>
</ol>
<p>them.) In the commentary on the word &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo;, Lakshmi who has been already stated in Srimat is once again made to appear in the midst of His glories (vibhūtis) in the word Sri. vallabha in the gadya in order to explain her role as mediator (between the jiva and her Spouse). Then Sri Ramapuja takes for comment the words Sriman Nārāyana employed in the sentences treating of the goal and the means of attaining it. The person competent for prapatti indicated by the first person singular in the word prapadye (I seek Him for refuge) is explained in the words (in the gadya) which mean &ldquo;I seek the refuge of Thy two lotus feet&rdquo; explain the words charanau (feet) and saranam (refuge) and 80 also the verb (in Dvaya). Later Sri Ramanuja indicates distinctly the word Dvaya which is commented upon.</p>
<p>It may be asked: &ldquo;Why should (he) dwell at such length without specifying the word Draya either in the beginning or at the end, but only here?&rdquo; The answer is as follows:- Here in regard to the upāya and the upeya or what is to be attained thereby, the most important is Narayana with Sri (Lakshmi). Therefore the word Narayana with its attribute Sri which occurs in two places rip Dvaya) has been already commented upon. So in order to show that along with the sādhyopāya (namely prapatti)) which is indicated by this mantra, the principal upāya and the principal object of attainment have been commented upon, the word Dvaya is here inserted (i.e.) to mean that the Duaya has been, for the most part, explained. Then in the slokas which begin with &lsquo;pitaran mataram&rdquo; and in certaio sentences taken form Jitantü, and Bhagavad Gita and other passages which express the same idea, Sri Ramapaja shows that the resulting meaning of the Dvaya is the adoption of the upāya (prapatti) without any other object and with no other upāya in one&rsquo;s view or power, and the form of prayer for pardon with the thought of the Saviour&rsquo;s nature preceding it. Tbereafter following the order indicated by the meaning (and not by the actual order of words in the sentence), Sri Ramanuja explains the prayer in the word namas for the removal of (all)</p>
<p>DVAYA AND SARAŅĀGATI</p>

<p>he pointe attainmhakti) thaiya), Phiase) in the which</p>
<p>hindrances. After this, he explains the supreme aim of life which is indicated by the suffix of the dative (or fourth case) in the words wbich end in the fourth case (Narāyānāya), which includes such aims as superior bhakti (parabhakti) that precede the attainment of the supreme aim (the attainment of Bhagavan and His kain. karya). Then he points out how Bhagavan is so full of compas. sion (as shown also in the second half of the Charamasloka,) as to vouchsafe success both in regard to this life and in regard to what is to follow thereafter. (This he does) by the words stated to have been spoken by Bhagavan. Therefore all that is stated by (Ramanuja) in the (Saraṇāgati) gadya is intended to be conveyed by the Dvaya. This is indicated also by the words in the gadya) which mean “attering the Draya in this manner with an understanding of its meaning etc&rdquo;.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKAS</p>
<p>The Acharyas of old have declared that the statement in such writings as the Gadya that superior bhakti para-bhakti) and the like (li, e. parajnana and parama bhaktı) have, for their result, kuinkarya describes what occurs in the state of mukti. Since what follows later in order namely, the direct vision of the Lord (ara. jnana) and the eager desire for the uninterrupted enjoyment of Bhagavan are preceded by the eager longing to do so, they are said to result from para.bhakti.</p>
<p>At the time of departare from the body, the grace of the Lord who dwells in the heart (of the jival grants to those who have performed prapatti that spiritual ripeness which wonld enable them to have a vision of the Lord. When the seed of a plant is soaked in the oil of ankola (azhinjil), it produces sprouts, leaves, flowers, fruits and the like in a few instants. So also, in just a few instants, the grace of the Lord enables the self to attain that spiritual perfection which would inake possible parabhakti, parajnana and paramabhakti. This state of perfection or ripeness which is referred to in the gadra is as appropriate as what is taught in such</p>
<p>426 CA APTER</p>
<p>treatises as the Sātvata concerning the special religious observances (vrata) for attaining moksha - for instance, that the minds of men rendered impure by stains caused by the wicked senses become pure at the time of their death, as a result of their residence in a place where there is a temple dedicated to Narayana. Such (great souls) as Nammalvar, Nathamuni and others enjoyed the Lord even before their death, owing to some special grace of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p>Nammalvar has, in the following passages and elsewhere, stated the meaning of Dvaya: - &ldquo;Meditate to soon on the feet of Narayana and His consort and acquire &amp; new life&rdquo; (here the words up to and acquire express the upaya stated in the first part of Dvaya and what follows indicates the meaning of the second part); “The&rdquo; man that has sought the feet of Bhagavan black as the raincloud and who has thereby attained new life&quot; and &ldquo;O Thou on&rdquo; whose chest abides Laksbmi because she cannot endure Beparation from Tbee even for an instant, etc&quot;.</p>
<p>THE DETAILED INTERPRETATION OF DVAYA:</p>
<p>The meaning of Sriman:</p>
<p>The word Sriman Nārayana which stands first in Duaya refers to the Supreme Reality (parutattva) which is the refoge of every one. The determination of the person of the Supreme Reality is well known to be arrived at in the s&rsquo;rutis by reason of His being the Lord of Sri and by the word &lsquo;Narayana.&rsquo; The word Srimat in the first part of Dvaya) is to show that, when Nara yapa becomes the Redeemer, Hei: with His attribute (Lakshui). Arulalapperumal L&rsquo;oberumanar states :- &quot; Refore understanding the sabstantive which bas attributes, the attributes bave to be understood. Thefore to understand Hari who has Lakshmi for His attribute, the attribute, &lsquo;Lakshmi&rsquo;, has (first) to be under stood.&quot; That this (Lakshmi) is an attribute both in the first part 10.

<p>(of the Dvaya) and in the second bas already been explained in the chapter Siddhopāya s&rsquo;odhana as also the principle that when the upāya has an attribute, there will be no duality of the upāya. (See page : 250).</p>
<p>The meaning of Sri:- In the Bhagavat sastras (Pancha. rātra), the word Sri has been etymologically interpreted in six ways: (1) srīyate (is resorted to); (2) srayate (resorts to); (3) srnoti (listens); (4) srāvayati (makes listen); (5) srniti (removes); (6) srinati (makes ripe). The other words that are required to make the megning clear have to be understood from what is appropriate (in the context) and on the strength of pramānas. (1) &amp; (2) Sriyate and Srayate :- Among them when we take the word to mean that She (Lakshmi) is resorted to by those who desire spiritual re-birth and that she resorts to the Supreme Ruler of all in order to give them spiritual rebirth, we may take the following sloka (for authority):- &ldquo;When Thy** beloved Lord is displeased with a man who has committed serious offences in order, like a father, to reform him, Thou, O mother, sayest to Him, &quot; What is this? Is there any man in the world who has no faults?&rdquo; and persuadest Him by suitable devices to accept the offender by making Him forget (vismārya) his offences. Therefore art Thou our mother.&quot; As stated in this sloka, she helps to mitigate the anger of the Supreme Ruler who wields the rod of punishment for the sake of promoting the welfare of the offender. Thus she sees to it that the Lord&rsquo;s patural compassion becomes the cause of the man&rsquo;s ( spiritual) rebirth. The word Sri, in this interpretation, would describe her greatness as &amp; mediator (who intercedes on bebalf of the jiva) owing to her excessive love which is that of a mother. The word vismārya, which means &lsquo;by making him forget&rsquo; has, for its purport, as in the word avignāta (in avignāta A sahasrāms&rsquo;u), which literally means (not knowing), the removal of the thought of punishing&quot; entertained by the omniscient Iswara. The same is the meaning of the word &lsquo;fascinated in the</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Sri Gunaratnakosam 52 13 A. Vishnu Sabasranamam</li>
</ol>
<p>428 CA APTER</p>
<p>passage, &ldquo;He who is fascinated by the &ldquo;charms of Lakshmi, the lotus-born etc&rdquo; The word &lsquo;mediator (purushakira) means &ldquo;another intelligent being who is sought as a means or upāya for securing the favour of an intelligent being who can satisfy the wants of one&rdquo;. This mediator or purushakāra&rsquo; is the mediate (as distinguished from the direct) cause for the attainment of the (desired) fruit.</p>
<p>We have already pointed out in Niksheparaksha, as an autho. rity, that by (her) very nature, by the practice (of the wise), by what we see in worldly affairs and by the words of gurus, and so also by the sruti and smriti, dependence on an interceding) mediator is established (as a rule to be followed). &ldquo;By Her very nature&rdquo; means &ldquo;By her nature in which there is no admixture of the anger arising from mental strength characteristic of a father and in which love (as for a child) resulting froma motherly feelings becomes over-whelming.&rdquo; It is her nature (always) to say: &ldquo;There is no one who does not connit an offence&rdquo;; &ldquo;Who will get angry, best of monkeys, with these Rakshasis who are under the authority of a king and being servants, render service to him?&rdquo; &ldquo;I</p>
<p>cannot endure (to see) the sufferings of these servants of Ravana and therefore I pardon their offences&rdquo;. Her being the Lord&rsquo;s favourite is also such that, if she should intercede (on our bebalf), the Lord cannot refuse. Since her very nature is such, it cannot be said that, to secure her help, the intercession of some one else will be needed and so on ad infinitum. As (an instance of) the practice of the wise, it is well-known from the Purinas, that, when Brahma and others were afraid to approach the Lord on seeing His wiath against Flis enemy, Hiranya, which arose owing to His intense love for Prahlada, they approached the Sapreme Ruler, who was then in the form of Nrisimha, with Lakshmi as their leader (mediator) and praised Him.

<p>such contexts as the following:- &quot; The renowned&rdquo; Lakshmana thus spoke to $ītā end the noble-minded Rama.&quot; &ldquo;Lakshmana, the descendent of Raghu, seized the two feet of his brother, Sri Rama, and said these words, in the presence of Sita.&rdquo; Io worldly affairs, too, this may be seen in kings pardoping the servants of the zenapa as a result of even slight propitiation though their offences are great. This idea is also the purport of the siloka:-&ldquo;O Mother Lakshmi ! We who find our sole delight in rendering service to Thee and have only that as our aim, approach the Lord, look at Him and delight in serving Him, here and elsewhere, with the idea that He is Thy Spouse, in the same way as the people of Mithila looked upon Sri Rama as the bridegroom and the beloved husband of Sita&rdquo;. The words of gurus are such passages as that of Nam malvar who says :-&ldquo;O Thou&rdquo; on whose chest abides Lakshmi, who says she cannot endure separation from Thee even for an instant&quot;. Texts may also be seen in support of this in the srutis which are in the form of Sri Sriktas. The Smritis based on these are the words of Sounaka and others -such as the following :- &ldquo;The mana who begs for the attainment of Bhagavan, who is the purport of all words, should, of necessity, seek the protection also of Lakshmi. It is not enough to perform prapatti to the Lord alone&rdquo;. Since it is evident from many pramāṇas that Lakshmi plays the role of a mediator interceding at the feet of the Lord, it is but proper to understand it (in this way) in this context. Thus she is resorted to as a mediator and as the attribute of Siddhopāya.</p>
<p>As stated in the following selokas ;- &ldquo;O Lakshmi, ** with &amp; countenance as delightful as the moon! When we consider Bhagavan and Thee separately, (we see) that the essential nature (svarūpa) of Bhagavan and His being the Supreme Ruler over all are the outcome of the superiority resulting from His being associ. ated with Thee. Therefore Thou art that aspect of His which declares Thy Lord as being such and such.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou art, O 18. Ramayana : Ayodhyakandam 31 - 2 21. Tiruvoymozhi : 6 - 10 - 10. 19.

<p>Lakshmills, the property of Bhagavan solely by Thine own will. Though His greatness (and superiority) result from Thee, they are not dependent on any one else for the reason given above. A gem is precious because of its radiance; still it should not be considered as having no worth (in itself). Its natural value does not diminish and is not dependent on anything else &ldquo;,-(as stated in these slokas) she is attached to Bhagavan (the Siddhopāya) like rays to the sun and the like, contributing to His splendour.</p>
<p>When we take the etymological meaning to be that she is to be reverenced by all, while she (herself) reveres the Supreme Ruler over all, she is the lady entitled to the service of all (of 1s). She is herself of the nature of a sesha to the Lord as stated in: “ Thy belovedsø Spouse is Bhagavan who is called Purnshottama&rdquo; and in the sloka : &ldquo;All things, those that move and those that do not move, are, O Goddess that rulest over Srirangam, for Thy Tila. The eternal siiris who are said to be constantly looking at the region of eternal enjoyment (bhoga) namely, Vaikunta, were appointed to be Thy servants. By Thy compassion alone are we among those who are protected. Thy s&rsquo;eshi is Bhagavan; all the rest are subject to Thy grace&rdquo;. W&rsquo;hen the (etymological) meaning of the word Sri is taken to be as stated in the sloka : “The whole world depends on Lakshmi for support&rdquo; that all things depend upon Her for protectiod and that she is attached to all things, that aspect of the Lord of Sri which is declared by such words as Narayana (Vishnu and Vasudeva ) is declared also of Vishnu&rsquo;s consort. The author on Sri Bhashya, too, has said Baghavati Sri in the same way as He says Bhagavan Nārüyana in that context; (i. e.) he calls for Bhagavari to show that She has the same distinction as Her Spouse.</p>
<p>(3) &amp; (4) When the (etymological) ineaning (of Sri) is taken to be, &lsquo;Sbe listens&rsquo; (srìoti) and She makes listen (srīvajati) it would mean: &ldquo;When we who have offended (against the Lord)</p>

<p>pray to Her that she should persuade Him to be accessible to us on our approaching His feet for protection, she listens to the cry of suffering of those who have sought Her is a refuge and pleads (to the Lord) on our bebalf god helps to mitigate our suffering. The words which (literally) state her activity (really) aim at stating Her role as a mediator. Having heard from Him these words : &ldquo;Those who32A seek my two feet as their sole upaya or refuge - I myself take them, O, my beloved! out of samsāra&rdquo;, and also &ldquo;Compassions is a supreme virtue&rdquo;, she wonld, when the proper occasion arises, say, like the female pigeon to the male pigeon in the siloka :&ndash; &ldquo;Listen, my beloved #husband, with attention to what I am going to say for your good. He who has sought refuge under you should be protected even if it be at the cost of your life&rdquo;. It may also be considered to have the following meanings : Having heard from the Supreme Ruler that He is ever bent on the advancement of the world&rsquo;s welfare, she would offer her advice to be listened to even by her enemies as in the passage : &quot; If you should desire to save your abode (viz. Lanka) and to avoid a horrible death, it would be in your interest to obtain the friendship ot Sri Rama, who is the best of men &ldquo;..</p>
<p>(5) &quot; When the etymological meaning (of Sri) is taken to be that she removes all faults (srnati), it wonld mean that she removes all hindrances in the way of those who have adopted the upaya (nanely prapatti), such as karma, and this idea is brought out in the following passages :- &ldquo;In all siddhiintas (systems of reli vious thonght) and in the Vedanta, it has been declared that when Bhagavan affords protection, He does it always with Lakshmi, who is the very embodiment of compassion, by His side&rdquo;, and so also, &ldquo;Lakshmise who resides in the ever fragrant lotus destroys all the (past) karma of jīvas&rdquo;.</p>

<p>432 CHAPTER</p>
<p>(6) In the etymological interpretation, &ldquo;She makes the world ripe by her qualities” (srnāti), the root (Sri) would mean that, by her attributes like compassion, she enables those who have sought her protection to become ripe enough to have the qualities necessary for rendering service to the Lord. This idea is brought out in the passage: &ldquo;Havings Thy grace and the grace of Thy Consort who abides in the lotus, I will sweep the floor of Thy temple&rdquo;. Bearing in mind all these excellences (of Lakshmi) stated in all these interpretations, Alavandar wrote: &quot; Thy Dame too is Sri. How can we bave the fitness to praise Thee?&rdquo; Bhattar, too, had in mind ber being unconditionally gracious and said :- &quot; Bhagavan&rdquo; is ever gracious because of His association with Thee. Thy graciousness is not dne to any cause or condition. It exists of its own accord, for art Thou not Sri ?&rdquo; Among these meanings those that are appropriate to Bhagavan&rsquo;s being the upāja</p>
<p>· should be borne in mind in regard to the first part (of Dvaya), while those that are appropriate to Bhagavan&rsquo;s being the object of attainment should be borne in mind in regard to the second part (of Dvaya ).</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>In the surrender of such as one&rsquo;s essential Dature (and the burden of protection etc.), the Master is well known, to those who sce with the eye of the s&rsquo;rutis, as the upāya or means and as one to whom the surrender is made. He is also the upeya (the object of attainment).</p>
<p>Though the word Sriman means in general &lsquo;one who is 288ociated with Sri, yet here, as a consequence of the pramānas (i.e.) Sruti which says (Lakshmi is His Spouse) it means the husband or Sponse of Sri.</p>

Since He is called the Spouse of Her who is resorted to for protection and who is (also ) the world&rsquo;s mother, His being the Supreme Being and His easy accessibility are both indicated (thereby). Though Sri is included in the word (Nārā) (io Nara yana), she is taken here separately in order to show that there is a difference between her and other things (included in Nārā) (in that she has omnipresence and other such qualities). She is shown as an attribute (of the Lord) (in the word Sriman) in order to bring out the idea of her existence solely for Her Spouse, in accor. dance with the pramūnas (i. e. of Her own will and that of Her Lord ).</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE SUFFIX MATUP (IN SRIMAN):</p>
<p>Though sustixes&quot; like matup have (all) the following mean ings :- &lsquo;excess&rsquo; &lsquo;censure&rsquo; praise&rsquo; &lsquo;eternal connection&rsquo;.</p>
<p>superiority (over others)&rsquo;, &lsquo;association&rsquo;, and &lsquo;the statement of mere existence&rsquo;, yet here, by special usage, it indicates &lsquo;eternal connection&rsquo; wbich is well-known from the pramānas. This eternal connection between Bhagavan and Sri is indeed such that even when He assumed the form of a Brahmacharin (in Vamana. vatara), He is said to bave concealed, with the deer-skin, His Spouse, abiding in His chest&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The two objections that have been raised by some in this context are not sound: The first objection is that the suffix matug is not employed when, of two things that are put in grammatical apposition or co-ordination (sāmānīdhikaranya), one is insepar* able from the other and cannot exist without the other. For instance, when we say “Brahman is Ānauda, Brohman and Ananda (bliss ) are in grammatical apposition or co-ordination with each other. Since anandam or bvliss is an inseparable attribute of Brahman, matup is not added to it as a safix. But when we</p>
<ol start="42">
<li>Vartika: 5.2-14434 LA</li>
</ol>
<p>OF APTER</p>
<p>say, &lsquo;the man having a stick (dandi)&rsquo;, the suffix matup comes after danda (stick), because the stick can be separated from the man and can exist without the man. So the objector says that since the suffix occurs in Sriman, Srī should be coosidered as separable from Narayaoa ( as in Dandi) which is pat in apposition with it.</p>
<p>The second objection is as follows:-“If Sri is separable from Narayana and can exist where He is not (as during Sita&rsquo;s separation from Sri Rama) the two words Sri and the word meaning Bhaga. van should not be put jo apposition or co-ordination without the suffix, but we do find them in grammatical apposition or co-ordi pation when Sri Krishna says :-&ldquo;Among women, I am the deity of fame, Sri (Lakshmi) and Vāk (Saraswati)&rdquo; and also in the sentence :-&ldquo;Bhagavan is“ Lakshmi who abides in the lotus &ldquo;.</p>
<p>These (two) objections are unsound for the following reasons - The existence of the suffix does not, by itself, determine whether there is inseparable connection or no. For example: By the principle enunciated in Brahma Stitras 2 - 3.29, &quot; The jiva is called jnāna because the attribute jnana or knowledge is an essen tial and distinctive quality of the jiva, in the same way as Brahman is called Ananda (bliss), because Ananda is an essential and distinctive quality of Brahman.&rdquo; Here there is inseparable connec tion between the jiva and jnana and the two are put in apposition with each other, whereas usage such as the jiva is one having jnāna (Jnanavān) is also frequently found. That is, though there is inseparable coopection between the jiva and jnāna, the suffix matup is attached to jnana, as in dandi, where the connec. tion is separable. It is clear from this that the existence or non-existence of the suffix matup does not, of itself, afford evidence about the separability or inseparability of connection.</p>
<p>(NOTE: . Sriman, jnanavan, dandi have also the suffis malup though in different variations).</p>

<p>MEANING OF SRIMAN</p>
<p>435</p>
<p>When it is said, for instance, &quot; The king himself is all the subjects&rdquo;, where there is no suffix matup after the word lokāh (subjects) in the appositional use, it cannot be stated that there is inseparable connection between the king and his subjects and that the latter cannot exist without him, for the meaning of the sen. tence is something entirely different (from separability or insepara bility of connection). So the proper thing to do is to under. stand the nature of the connection with the help of other pramānas which bring it out clearly (and not merely by the existence or non-existence of the suffix matup).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here (in regard to Lakshmi&rsquo;s inseparable connection with Bhagavan), since the pramāṇas declare eternal connection (bet ween them), both in the state when they are sought as upaya and in the state when the fruit (of the adoption of the upāya) is enjoyed and since in this mantra (Dvaya), this idea of inseparable connection needs to be stressed, the matup indicates that the two stand inseparably connected, both in the first part of Dvaya and in the second part and this conclusion is arrived at on the strength of such pramūnas as the following :- “ Lakshmana,&rdquo; the descen dant of Raghu, seized the two feet of Sri Rama firmly and said these words in the presence of Sita&quot;, and &quot; Yon willA enjoy your self in the company of Sitā on the slopes of the mountains and whether you are awake or asleep, I will render every form of service to you&quot;. (The first passage describes their inseparability in the state of upāya and the second in the state of the attainment of the fruit, namely, the rendering of service to them (kainkarya). Napinalvar, too, realised in his mind this inseparability in the following passages :&ndash; 0, Thou, on whose&quot; chest resides Lakshmi, whose home is the lotus, because she cannot endure separation from</p>
<p>Thee for an instant !, &quot; While Lakshmi&quot; with her beautiful brace. lets and Thou stand together, I see that the supreme end of exist ence is to enjoy &lsquo;Thee and render service to Thee like the eternal</p>

This realisation (of inseparable connection between Bhagavan and Sri, is essential for seeking the Lord&rsquo;s protection without any misgivings or hesitation and whenever we desire it,</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD NĀRĀYANA AND</p>
<p>THE QUALITIES DISCLOSED IN IT ;</p>
<p>Even the intercession of the mediator which appears as a requisite is effective (only because of the relationship between Nārāyana and the jiva and because of His qualities wbich are disclosed in the word Nārāyana. (i.e. It is because Narayana is intimately associated with the jīvas and has certain great qualities that Lakshmi&rsquo;s intercession proves effective). This may be seen in the passage: &quot; Bhagavan may&rsquo;s even say:&quot; &ldquo;My devotees will never commit offences, Even if they offend, it is only for my glory ( to bring out my unique forgiveness&rdquo; ).</p>
<p>It may be asked whether it is not enough to say Sriman (and not Sriman Narayana) as the word Şrimān by itself has been declared to be one of the names of Bhagavan in the sloka :&ndash; Sridharah: Srīkarah: Sreyah: Sriman, Lokatrayasrayah and elsewhere. The answer is as follows: &ldquo;The word Sriman is here used as an adjective qualifying Narayana, because the word Nārāyana is required here (in Duaya ) in the first part in order to enable us to bear in mind the special qualities (indicated by that word) which are adapted for His being the spāya and, in the second part, in order to show that Narayana, the Seshi, who has both kinds of vibhiti, is the object of attainment.</p>

<p>MEANING OF NĀRĀYANA</p>
<p>437</p>
<p>Though the word &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; used here (in Dvaya) has, for its purport, all the qualities which were etymologically derived from the word in the chapter on the moolamantra, yet, since in the first part (of Dvaya) the aim of the word &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; is to show His beiog the refuge, the following are the principal among the qualities to be borne in mind : affection (like that of a cow for the calf), that of being the Swāmin or Master, good nature, easy accessibility, omniscience, omnipotence, irresistible will or purpose, supreme compassion, gratitude, firmness, perfection or fulness, supreme generosity and the like. These qualities have been briefly told in such passages as the following:- &ldquo;O, Thou so that art full of matchless qualities, that ownest the three worlds, O, Thou, that art my Saviour and that dwellest on the mountain Tiruvengadam which is longed for by hosts of gods and rishis! (Soulabhya)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Of these vātsālya or affection is the tenderness which accepts a man for protection ignoring his offences, as in the sloka : &ldquo;I will Devero ignore one who comes to me like a friend, even if there be faults in him. This will not be censured by the good &ldquo;. It is (a quality) needed for not avoiding Him on account of one&rsquo;s offences. Swimitva or the attribute of being the master is the special kind of association existing between Bhagavan and the jiva, wbich is dis closed in the pranava and the like. This is necessary to inspire con fidence that He will protect (us) for His owo glory. Sausīlya, or good nature, is shown in His intimate companionship with such people of low birth as buntsmen, monkeys and cow-herds in spite of His superiority to all beings. This (quality) is necessary for inspiring confidence which would not make one despair saying : &quot; Where is He who is the Master of all and who is armed with the discus and where am I&rdquo;? but which wonld encourage one to expect Him to render even sucb service as driving the chariot and conveying a message. Soulabhya or easy accessibility consists in &lsquo;His being within the range of the eyes of all men&rsquo; even though</p>

<p>He is beyond the reach of even such great yogis as Sanaka and Sapandana. This (qualiiy) is necessary in order that we may not give up the longing for Him owing to a notion that He is too difficult of approach. Omniscience consists in His seeing all things, as stated in such slokas as the following: &ldquo;There is nothing in any of the three worlds that is not known to Thee&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I bow to *Bhagavan who, by His very nature, sees all things at the same time&rdquo;. This is necessary for the thought that there is nothing unknown to Him among the good things to be given to those who have sought His protection and among the hindrances to be re moved from them. Omnipotence consists in the ability to accon. plish what cannot be accomplished (by others). This is necessary to give us the assurance that, though we are now in samsiiru (or bondage of births and deaths ), He can make us enter the assembly of the eternal siiris, Satyasankalpatva means that His will or purpose can never be thwarted even by Himself. This is necessary for the confidence that we shonld have that the words: “I will release you from all sins&rdquo;, will never prove futile. Supreme compassion is the desire to remove the suffering of others withont any thought of one&rsquo;s own interests. This is necessary for the knowledge that He will pardon on some pretext (vyāja) even those who have committed innumerable offences, as in the slokas : &ldquo;I will never give up the man who seeks me in the manner of a friend, even though he has faults&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Fetch bim, O Sugriva, best of monkeys, whether he be Vibhishana or even Ravana himself. I promise security to him&rdquo;. Gratitude consists in looking upon even trivial acts of kindness with the greatest regard, as if they were supreme deeds of helpfulness and never forgetting them. (lostances of this) may be seen in such slokas as the following: &ldquo;Since Sri Ramak is large-hearted, he does not remember even hundreds of offences committed by others against him. He delights (on the other hand) on even a single act of help :&rsquo;, and &ldquo;That cry** 54: Ramayana: Yuddhakanda 17-35. 58. Ramayana : Ayodhyakanda: 1-11 55. Nyaya Tatvam.</p>

<p>for help uttered aloud by Droupadi even from a distance calling me &ldquo;Govinda!”-that cry is never away from my mind like a debt that has increased with the interest accumulated on it&rdquo;. This quality makes one say to oneself: “If He sees anything of worth done by me within the limits of my ability, He will never forsake ine&rdquo;. Firnidess is the quality of persistence in protecting sup pliants. This is necessary to inspire the faith that He will never forsake us, even though others who are very intimate with Him try to dissuade Him, as (when Sri Rama said):-&ldquo;I will never SIA give up the man who comes to me in the manner of a friend&rdquo;. Pari foirnatvan (perfection or fullness) consists in (His) having all objects that üre desired or desirable. This is necessary to make us endeavour to serve Him in the way that is within our limited power, with the knowledge that is what we offer to him (upahüra), He will consider only the fervour of emotion or feeling and not measure its worth or value. This may be seen in the following words (of the Lord): &ldquo;Though what is offered to me by ruy levotees is atornic, it appears very great to me owiog to their love. What is offered to me by those wanting in devotion, however great it might be, never gives me delight&rdquo;. &quot; Whatever is given to me with love, be it only such trivial things as a leaf, a flower, a fruit or even (mere) water, I eat it, because it is given with devo tion by one who is devout”. Supreme generosity is the liberality in making gifts which makes a person feel that he has not done enough, even when he has given all that he possesses without any Ghonght of the slightness of the endeavour on the part of the person liepehted, the greatness of the benefit conferred or the unworthiness of the beneficiary. This is a quality which induces men like *Dudhibhands and others to ask with importunity for the great bent fits of spiritual life even for those who are connected with thew, Thus such qualities in the Redeemer as are useful for</p>

<p>seeking His protection and the manner in which they are useful should be borne in mind.</p>
<p>In the state of practising the vidyās or forms of meditation (prescribed in the s&rsquo;rutis), only certain qualities (of Brahman) pertaining to that vidya are ineditated upon. Still in the state of enjoyinent of the fruit of the meditition, the object of enjoyment is Brahman with all his qualities. In the case of the word occurring in the second part of Dvaya, though all qualities may be present, since the aim is to attain Na ayana with such qualities as are essential for our service to Hira whicb arise from His essential nature and from His qualities, the most inportant qualities to be understood are His being the Seshi and IIis being capable of afford ing (perfect) bliss.</p>
<p>In another chapter (in chapter 11 Parikara vibhiige), we bave (already) stated that here (in the word Nirnayam in 1112 first part of Dvaya) the determination to do what is agreeable and the avoidance of what is adverse are inílicated on account of the relationsbip (of master and servant) implied in it.</p>
<p>There are some (achüryas) who take Sriman Vurug&rsquo;ara charunau as a single compound word. There are others who take it as three separate words Sriman!, Narayana!, Churuan anil supply the word tava (Thy) between Narayana and curatau. In this interpretation, they have in mind such passages as “ 62 Do not approach those who say these words&rsquo;. &ldquo;O) Thou with eyes like the lotus, 0 Vasudeva, O Vishnu&hellip; &hellip;be Thou my pupu&rdquo;. ** May 62A Thou Thyself be my upiipu!&rdquo; and the Tamil verse: &ldquo;O) Thou“ on whose chest resides lakshmi who dwells in the lotus &lsquo;O Thou, my ludeener, I seek Thy feet as my upcrzre having no other upaya and no other object of attainment&rdquo;, &ldquo;() Sriman Narayana, my Master&rdquo; and other such mantras and also Saran gati gadya which is an elaboration of Dvaya.

<p>MEANING OF CHARANAU</p>

<p>instances Bhagavan is addressed in the vocative case and the prayer in the gadyu seeking Flis protection follows). So also the first part of Dvaya is interpreted thus :- &lsquo;O Thou with Lakshmi for Thy Spouse, O Narayana, I seek Thy feet for refuge,&rsquo; (understanding the word Thy (tava)). Thrs, whether we take it as a single com pound word or as threc separate words, there is no difference in the inander in which the attribute (adjective) Sri and the substan tive Narayana stand in relation to each other in the first part of Dvaya and in the second.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF CHARAŅAU.</p>
<p>The word Chararau means not merely &lsquo;the two feet&rsquo; but by implication, the divinely auspicions form (of the Lord), (which is not of matter or prakriti). That the Tord of Sri is the Supreme Deity superior to everyone else and that He is in association with an eternal form are most important among things that should be known. This quay be seen from such pissages as the following: “He who has the true knowledge that Bhagavan has an eternal form and so also, O Puusbkara, that He is superior to everyone else-Hiin does Bhagavan approach”. Therefore in the word Sriman Narūpalu, we should bear in mind His being the Supreme Reality that is easily accessible and in the word Charanau, His having an eternal forin. Even by those who have no clear idea of the essential nature of the Divine Being (that He is jnana and ananda) and that He has the qualities mentioned before-even for then the object of meditation should be the divinely auspicious fornt which is constituted wholly of suddha sattva (and not matter), wbich, in those who have a kaowledge of it, removes the contraction of knowledge (due to past karma) and wbich suggests Ilim as the Supreme Reality and His easy accessibility. Owing to its being the principal (meditation ), (Sri Ramapuja ) speaks of the divinely auspicious form in the Gadya before stating the qualities. Though Tirumangai Alwar had a true knowledge of the essential nature of the Divine Being, yet he spoke of bimself as one who</p>
<ol start="65">
<li>Poushkara Samhita :</li>
</ol>
<p>442 CA APTEK</p>
<p>does not believe in the Supreme Reality (that is jnana and ananda ) like atheists who consider the body as the soul, because of his extreme devotion to the eternal form wbich is delightful even to Iswara ( who is jnana and ananda ). This idea is expressed in the sloka: “ The divinelye auspicious form of Bbagavan is more delightful and more wonderful to Him than His own essential Dature (which is jnana and ananda)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The divinely auspicious form of the Supreme Ruler is pure and auspicious (subha ) and is a fit object of meditation (asraya ) as declared in the following passages : - &ldquo;May I see that holy countenance of Vishnu with eyes like lotus in the form which He has assumed of His own will and which, when remembered, removes the sids of men ! &quot; &quot; Sri Rama fascinates the eyes of men with the beauty (of his form) and their minds with such qualities as generosity.&rdquo; Those who are in the bondage of sansāra may be objects for meditation (ūsraya) but there is no parity or auspiciousness in them. The essential nature ( svarūpu ) of Bhagavan is pure and auspicious but it cannot be an object of meditation.</p>
<p>The pure and essential form of the jīva (free from bondage ) cannot come back to samsara, since it is without the qualities necessary for doing so; but by its nature, it has in it in the poten tiality of being associated with such qualities. Therefore it has not the purity and auspiciousness which are opposed to anything that is of the nature of a blemish, nor can it be a fit object of medi tation. When a released soul (mukta) assumes a form, it can become an object of meditation as also eternal sūris (nityas) who have form, but neither of them has the purity and auspiciousness which can release the baddhas from samsāra. Therefore it is only the divinely auspicious fornı (of the Lord) which has purity and auspiciousness and the fitness of being an object of meditation, which are both necessary to the aspirant to mukti.</p>

<p>In the sentence prescribing saraṇāgati, namely, &quot; Seek refuge under me alone&quot;, (charamasloka) also, the Lord who had assumed</p>

<p>is against the interpretation that Bhagavan with Sr as His attri bute is intended (for in that case &lsquo;the four feet&rsquo; should be the words). This is silly because this oljection is refuted by the word Srimat which distinctly and explicitly states at the very beginning of the sentence &quot; with His attribute Sri&rdquo;. This indication of the attribute &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; is first heard in the sentence and cannot therefore be annulled by the dual form, namely, the two feet&rsquo; (wbich comes later in the sentence). The reasoning which says that the plural form &ldquo;many or four-feet&rdquo; should have been used in that case will appear ridiculous to those who are acquainted with liter. ature, for the dnal forni is used, because the husband is the principal factor and his sponse is necessarily associated with him. When an emperor has a spouse, no one would dare to say that he has some one else (as a second rnler). So also, here, a serious staternent has been recklessly made without due reflection,</p>
<p>the upüya, where is the need for this attribute viz. Sri? If He needs her, it would follow that He is not omnipotent.&quot; The same objection conld be inade against the qualities (of Narayana) and the form (vigral) (of Narayana) which are stated in the words Varā gana and chura(114 respectively. If it is maintained, in accordance with the pramiais, that the qnalities and the form are lfis attributes and that as there is a special efficacy appropriate to them as such, the omnipotence (of the Lord) is not thereby annulled, then the sanie argument will hold good (in the case of Sri also) becarise (ller being the upaya along with Bhagavan) has been stated by many authorities (pramiiņas) and because in the word Srimat, Sri&rsquo;s being the attribute is natural owing to her rela. tropship of being the Spouse.</p>
<p>If, in spite of all this, it is beld nerely (on the ground of the (dual) charaṇau (the two feet) that the association with Sri is mere *Upalakshana and does not signify that Sri is also upāya,</p>
<p>*NOTE: Upalakshana: a mere mark, token or sign to indicate Narayana who is recognised by that mark. An Upalak shana is not an essential feature of the object in question,</p>
<p>446 CHAPTER</p>
<p>then the same thing would bave to be said abont His association with such things as qualities (and form). If it is held that since the word (charaṇau) is employed along with the word Nārāyana stating that they are the repaya, the one who has the qualities and the form which are necessary for being the upaya is the upaya, the same thing can be said also (of Sri) here. Such being the case, if it is held that in case Sri is considered an attribute, it wouli be against (the Lord&rsquo;s) omnipotence, there would be the same irreconcilability with that onnipotence, in expectiog Sri to be the pediator (interceding on behalf of the jiva),</p>
<p>It is said in Bhattar&rsquo;s Srigunaratna-kos&rsquo;anı :- &ldquo;Though qualities like youth are common to Thee and Bhagavan, you have divided between yourselves for the sake of enjoyment (certain qualities) &ndash; such qualities as there should be in a man - namely, independence of all others, anbjugation of enemies and firmness, in Bhagavan&ndash;and such qualities as there should be in a woman - namely, gentleness, existing only for the sake of the husband, compassion and patience, in Thee”. Jo accordance with that s-loka, when the jivas offend Iswara who stands snpreme in power with the characteristics of the masculine natnre, of the nature of the father and of the ruler exercising control and such others, Lakshmi who has gentleness, affection and the like becomes the inediator interceding on their behalf. If it is said that this inter cession as a mediator is subject to the independent will of the Lord, then it may be said without any contradiction by the pramūnas that Iswara&rsquo;s being the Sarası or Protector with his attribute Sri who participates in the performance of (Her husband&rsquo;s ) duties is also due to His indepeulent will.</p>

<p>MEANING OF SARANAM</p>
<p>447</p>
<p>the above sloka, upāya has been pointed out as the special meaning here, it denotes upnya. .</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA</p>
<p>By the very nature of bharanyasa (the surrender of the burden or responsibility of protection ), the Protector or Saviour is here (in Duaya ) placed in the position of other upayas, in order that the prapanna may refrain from any effort on his own part.</p>
<p>It may be asked :- When the Supreme Ruler is the means or upaya for attaining the fruit of His worship or adoration performed in accordance with the respective ordinances of the sastras in the case of every adhikūrī or competent person, where is the need for His being specially called the upaya here? The answer is :-&ldquo;It is merely to show that the nature of prapatti is such that Iswara who is endowed with qualities like natural compassion is placed in it (prapatti) in the position of other upüyas.</p>
<p>If it be asked, “Since prapatti is adopted in the place of bhaktiyoga, why should Iswara be stated to be &quot; In the place of other upayas&rdquo;? The answer is as follows:- “The fruit (of spiritual striving ) is to be attained by prapatti being adopted as an accessory means or aid and by upāsana or meditation or adoration (bhakti) being adopted as the main or primary) upāya. When there is no rpüsana (or bhakti), that fruit has to be obtained by means of prapatti alone. This becomes possible only because Iswara is naturally possessed of such qualities as compassion. That is why it is said that Igwara stands in the case of the man destitute of repayas, in the position of other upüyas. The man who is desi&rsquo;nte of upūrus ordained for the attainment of the desired fruit and cannot bear the burden or responsibility (of adopting those upāyas ) places (Iswara) who stands as the Protector in the position of other upāyas saying: &ldquo;May Thou be my upaya!&rdquo; It means ** Iostead of placing the burden of adopting other upāyas on my shoulders (literally, the bead) may the granting of all the desired</p>
<p>448 CHAPTER</p>
<p>fruits wbich could be obtained by bearing that burden be solely Thy burden or responsibility, since Thou art capable and con passionate !&rdquo; Separating this aspect (from others, viz., the acces sories), nikshepa or bharanyāsa is called the primary means or angi (and not the accessory means). This includes the man&rsquo;s being without the responsibility for any effort on his own part. It is in view of this separation of bharasamarpanan (from its angas or accessories, viz., the prayer that He should not expect one to do anything for oneself, that the word s&rsquo;aranam is used here only to denote upiya. (From this it would follow that the prepanna is care-free thereafter io regard to bis protection.)</p>
<p>In some places the prayer to Iswara to be the upüya and riikshepa or bharanyasa are spoken of separately ( as if they were different, though, in reality, they are not different). This should be understood as being due to one of three reasons: (1) The word upaya is (then) used to mean only the prayer for protection without including the prayer that Iswara should be in the place of other upayas which can be expected of the prapanna. (2) It may be to distinguish bharasamarpanan and the like distinctly and separately from the prayer for being the upaya or (3) Since the samarpanam or surrender is of three things viz., starīipa (essential nature), bhara (responsibility for protec tion) and phala (or the fruit to be attained), every one of them has to be stated as different from the other two. Therefore none of these can be said to be redundant, (The prayer for Iswara being the upüya refers to bhara; and the word nikshepa refers to svarīpa).</p>
<p>This aspect of Iswara being the upūsu should be understood as the peculiar feature of Nyāsa vidya. (Iswara&rsquo;s) jnana, power, and the like also appear in as much as they are required for this purpose.</p>

<p>MEANING OF PRAPADYE</p>
<p>449</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD PRAPADYE:</p>
<p>Since verbs meaning &lsquo;to go&rsquo; or &lsquo;to move&rsquo; mean also to have a knowledge of&rsquo; or &lsquo;to know, the root pad in the word prapadye, which means &lsquo;to go&rsquo; means, here the specific know ledge required in this context. The knowledge, here, is the sure koowledge or faith that the Lord will save (116). Since faith which is the most important of the accessories or angas (to prapatti) is referred to here, the sādhyopāya with all its accessories is indicated here. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows:- The preposi. tion prat (in prapadye) discloses the greatness or intensity of the faith which is its excellence. This excellence or intensity of faith would arise only when one bears in mind the medi atorship (of Lakshmi) and ope&rsquo;s relationship with the Lord, the Lord&rsquo;s qualities and the like (form) which are respectively present in the words (Srimat) and Nārāyana. By this intensity of faith, all doubts arising from the greatness of one&rsquo;s offences will disappear. This intensity of faith is necessary as stated in the sloka : &ldquo;The Rakshasasea had no confidence in (the effectiveness of) the Brabma missile (astra ) with wbich Hanuman was bound. The result was that that missile wbich would never fail of its purpose became loose immediately. In the same way, if men had no faith in the efficacy of prapatti, it would be the same as if it had not been performed at all. Therefore prapatti gives mokshu soon to those who have faith in it&rdquo;. The potency of this certainty of belief is well known from the following paseages :- &ldquo;If a man“, has no faith, he can never approach that Supreme Brahman&rdquo;, and “Hari is everal present in all those who bave no doubts. The Lord of Taksbmi (Madhava ) is never present in those who doubt as a l&rsquo;esult of their reasoning or logic&quot;. If this intense faith is present, doubts will never arise during any inquiry into Bhagavan&rsquo;s qua lilies and the like). Therefore intensity of faith at the first moment (of performing prapatti) which would never permit of later doubts is an accessory or anga of prapatti. Even if it is</p>

<p>weak, Iswara wbo has begun to show His special grace will make it full and perfect&quot;. Has not the Saviour graciously stated: “I will never gives np the man who has come to me in the gnise of a friend, whatever might happen&rsquo;? Is not His yrace of such a nature as is described in the sloka, about such things as even anjali :- &ldquo;If a manas has folded his hands in worship to Thy feet at any time and in any manner, it will destroy all his sips at that very instant and lead to the attainment of good things. It will never prove futile&rdquo;. Therefore even weakness of faith will grow into deep and intense faith (in those who have performed prapatti with all its angas).</p>
<ul>
<li>On this expression of intense faith stating, &ldquo;I have made up my mind to beg Thee for being my upaya&rdquo;, the prayer (to Iswara ) to be the upüya may be takto here as having been made and this wonld be in accordance witb the following pramānas: &quot; When what a mano desires cannot be attained with the help of any one else, a prayer is made, with intense faith, to one who has the required ability (to secure the object desired) that he shoald be the means or upaya. This prayer is prapatti; it is s&rsquo;aranagati!&rsquo;. &ldquo;The thoughts of praying:&mdash; &ldquo;May Thou alone be my upāya!” this is saranagati. Let this be done towards Bhagavan&rdquo;, &ldquo;Those who say to Hari: “Be Thou my upuga&rdquo;- never approach them”. The anga or accessory called &quot; seeking protectorship” is contained within this and is not separate or different from this.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be asked:&ndash;&rdquo; What is the prayer in this first part of Dvaya for? Since in the second part, there is a prayer for the attainment of the desired end and the removal of bindrances there. to, the prayer here cannot be for the same as, in that case, there would be repetition or redundancy. When prapatti is adopted as an anga or accessory, the prayer might be said to be for bhakti as an upāya; but here, since prapatti is adopted as a direct and inde</p>

<p>pendent means, there cannot be any upāya which can be acquired and for which a prayer could be made ( what, then, can this prayer be for?)&quot;. The answer to this question is as follows:- &ldquo;The award of the desired fruit which finds a place in the second part of Dvaya ) is common to all adhikūris, whatever be the upāya (bhakti or prapatti) that they adopt. Since prapatti is not an aniga or accessory for any other rpüya in the case of one who is destitute of any other upiiga and who makes a surrender of every. thing (svarīpa - bhara . and phala), its superiority (to other upāyas ) consists in the Saviour Himself standing in the place of the upāya and granting the fruit or desired end. Therefore what is prayed for here is the point that Iswara should accept the res ponsibility of protection (bharasvīkāra ). But it may be asked ngain :- &quot; Will not this prayer that the Lord should stand as the upaya mean the same as &amp; prayer that He should grant the desired fruit or object withont any other upaya being required as a further condition coming in between? In that case will not the prayer in the second part of Dvaya be redundant!&rdquo; The answer to this question is as follows:- Since in the prayer of the above description (in the second part), what is required is stated separately because it is different in some points froin the expectation in the prayer (in the first part), there is no redundancy: [li.e.) in the prayer for Iswara being the upiya, there is no expectation of any fruit except that He should be the upaya ; in the prayer in the second part there is expectation of the desired fruit). It may also be explained thuis: though the word signifying prayer (bhaveyam) has to be supplied in order to make the second part a complete sentence, in the first part praying for Iswara becoming the upāya, the fruit is asked for, but in a general way, while, in the second part, the parport is tu specify the nature of that fruit.</p>
<p>The sum and substance of the first and the second parts, when duly determined, will amount to saying this :- &ldquo;I am destitute of all upāyas; therefore in order that Thou mayst stand in the place of these upã yas and grant me the specific end that is desired, I surrender the responsibility for the protection of myself as stated</p>
<p>452 CHAPTER</p>
<p>( in the sastras)&rdquo;. Thus it (the Dvaya) is a surrender of the 1esponsibility (for protection) accompanied by &amp; special prayer</p>
<p>This surrender, too, is the meaning of prapadye which indicates resolution (I resolve). We have (already) proved in many pla res with the help of pramūnas and on the authority of traditional practice that the surrender of responsibility with all its accessories is the giet of the sāstras on prapatti (vide chapters 11 and 12 on Parikaravibhāga and Sāngaprapadanu).</p>
<p>The primary importance of the nikshepa (surrender) which is stated in another inantra for the performing of praputti is the same here also, namely: &ldquo;By this &ldquo;mantra alone should a man surrender himself to ine. Ile who has thus surrendered what ought to be surrendered will become one who has done what he ought to do&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The first person singular in prapadye (I resolve) which shows one to be the doer, proves that the way to win the favour of Siddhopūya (Iswara), who has the gift of moksha in His power, is some form of vyīja (bhakti or prapatti) which can be accom plished by the aspirant to mukti in accordance with the sāstras.</p>
<p>In this (the first part of Dvaa) the specific adhikari or competept person for the performance and the idea of helplessness (kārpanya), which is one of the accessories or angas of prapatti, are also hinted at as in the following passages &ldquo;] who 90Ahave no other upāya and no other Saviour&rdquo; etc. &ldquo;I am the &ldquo;abode of all offences: I have no means or upaya for saving myself and have nothing else to attain than Thee.&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have &ldquo;not been firmly established in the performance of dharma (i.e. I have not per formed karma yoga ;) neither have I realised the essential nature ( svarūpa) of myself (i, e. I have not perfornued jnana yoga : nor have I devotion to Thy lotus feet lie. I bave not performed</p>

<p>MEANING OF PRAPADYE</p>

<p>bhakti yoga&rdquo;. This is elaborated by Sri Ramanuja in the Sarana gati gadya in the words, &ldquo;Having no other refuge or Suviour&rdquo; and in the little gadya (Sri Ranga Gadya) in the churņikā, which says, &ldquo;My sonl is eternally subject to Thy control&rdquo; and likewise in the churrika in Vaikuntagadya where he says, &lsquo;I realise that, in order to attain Hindi, I have no other meads, even in thousands of crores of kalpas (1000 yugas), than seeking His two lotus feet&rdquo;. Aralalapperumal Eroperumanar, too, has declared: &ldquo;The &ldquo;man who, owing to his powerlesspess, has not the required upāya or ineans for attaining Bhagavan which is the end desired by him that man should realise with faith that His feet are the upāja for securing Ais object&rdquo; Since prapatti ordains, as an upüya, the surrender of the responsibility for protection (bhara. samarpana) which is adapted to the adhikhüri who is destitute of upyas, it goes without saying (froin the very logic of the matter) that it does not require the performance of any other action which is too hard (for him) to perform.</p>
<p>Thus in the word prapadye (I resolve to seek ) accompanied by the word saranan (refuge), four accessories may be considered as having been indicated: the faith that (the Lord) will protect, alod so also seeking Him as the Saviour, the surrender of the self and (one&rsquo;s) helplessness (kārpanya). We have already stated that the word Narayana with its adjective (Srimat) declares such things as Bhagavan&rsquo;s being the Master in accordance with such agthoritative texts as the following:-&ldquo;All beings,** those that move and those that do not move, are the body of Bhagavan. Therefore I should do what is good for them&rdquo;. This determination is the sixth anga and &ldquo;The fifth Ranga is the avoidance of what is displeusing to the Master.&rdquo; Therefore His being the Master sng. gests the determination to do what is agreeable (to Hin ) and the avoidance of what is disagreeable (to Him). In another chapter we have stated that these accessories, too, are to be thought of only once for the sale of the upāya (namely : prapatti). The use of</p>
<ol start="93">
<li>Ahirbudhnya Samhita : 52-23 94. Abirbudhoya Samhita: 52-21464 CHAPTER</li>
</ol>
<p>the present tense in the verb (prapadye) is, like (the use of present tense in the verb occurring in) the mantra uttered while cutting kus&rsquo;a grass, to indicate the time when the prapatti is performed. (It does not mean, as the present tense sometimes ineans, that it should be done always). The views ( held by some ) that the present tense (in prapadye) sbows that the intention is to enjoin the continuous performance of prapatti until the end of the present body, that it enjoins the continuance of faith which is one of the accessories until the fruit is attained and that it shows also the need for the continuance of such things as the determination to do what is agreeable (to the Lord) even after the performance of prapatti, as its accessories&ndash;thesc views are opposed to the pramūras which lay down (the rule) that this upāya (prapatti) with its accessories should be perforwed only once.</p>
<p>If they (viz. the accessories described above) continue (even after the performance of prapatti because of the excessive eager ness to attain the object and of their being enjoyable, it does not follow that this continuance is part and parcel of the upāya adopted in the first part (of Dvaya), Therefore the use of the present tense in this sentence (in Dvaya) which states the upāya does not refer to the continuance of uttering the Dvaya for the sake of the enjoyment arising from love which is expressed in Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s gadya (namely - uttering the Dvaya always with an understand ing of its meaning), (The meaning is: as an upaya a single performance or utterance will do; but when ove finds it enjoyable, the Dvaya may be repeatedly attered).</p>
<p>Thus the first part of Donja discloses the Lord&rsquo;s being the Saviour of all, the essential nature or svarība of sarani gati, ita accessories and the nature of the person qualified for its perform.. ance. From this it is evident also that the jira has no other upaya.</p>

<p>SECOND PART OF DVAYA</p>
<p>455</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oply &ldquo;so long as prapatti which can remove all sins has not been performed towards Thee, only so long will there be raisery caused by the loss of wealth and the apxiety to regain it; only so long will there be the desire to win wealth, only so long will there be no realisation of the self being different from the body; oply so long will there be the suffering of sansāra.&rdquo; Further the Saviour is supremely generous; “Is there *any other who is so generous as He and who can grant whatever is desired ?&rdquo; He stands ever ready with the deterioination to grant whatever is desired by the suppliants, for it has been said: &ldquo;If we receive any thing from the Lord, He does not lose anything thereby. He will give us whatever we ask.” (Such being the case) the question arises: &ldquo;What is the object or end for which prapatti should be performed?* The second part of Dvaya, (as if in answer to this question), prays for that object (end or fruit), which would be in keeping with the Saviour who is supremely generons, in keeping with this special upaya (prapatti) which can secure the favour of One who is superior to all others, and in keeping with one&rsquo;s owa essential nature (svarīpa) which will find its sole delight only in being His s&rsquo;esha. As expressed in the passage: &ldquo;The only end which I seek is that the Lord should take me as His servant for Ifis own pleasure&rdquo;, the second part prays for this desired end (namely, service to the Lord ), including the removal of all lipdrances to it. From this it also follows that the jiva should have no other interest or object.</p>
<p>In this context, the word Nāiriyamır with the attribute qualify ing it (viz. Srimat) discloses, primarily and in accordance with the praninas, the Lord&rsquo;s being the Master and the like and so also the unsurpassed enjoyability of the Master who has countless qualities and the two vibhutis (glories ) which make Him fit to be the object of attaioinent.</p>

<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD SRIMATE (IN THE</p>
<p>SECOND PART OF DVAYA):</p>
<p>Though Bhagavan who is thus endowed with the two vibhūtis (Lilū and Nitya) is the object of attainment, the word Srimate (with Sri) is employed here to show that, for the offering of the havis of the self, the intended recipients, are both the Lord and His Spouse. They are (the two) to whom we are s&rsquo;eshas and consequently (the two) to whom our service is due. Primarily they are (therefore) the objects of attainment. This idea is implicit also in the following and other passages :- &quot; Bhagavan, the Lord of the world, is in the glorious world called Vaikunta with Lakshini&rdquo;; &quot; Bhagavan who is seated on the serpent Ādisesha with his Sponse&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord is seated with Lakshmi who is (in every way) suited to Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;At the loa sight of Thee and Thy consort with her shining bracelets standing together (as the Rulers of the world)” “Lakshmi whose beauty fascinates even Thee &ldquo;, etu.</p>
<p>Though the word Sri used here has several meanings as stated in the following slokas: &quot; She dispels104 all blemishes; generates good qualities in those who are in the world; is attained by all at all times and has herself attained the Supreme Object of attaio ment (Bhagavan)&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s Spouse who&rsquo;s has aitained the Lord and is attained by others and who dispels all blemishes and listens to the cry of the distressed &quot; &ndash; (though the word has all these meanings) yet, here, it denotes the person who is entitled to (our) service as it is derived from the verbal root Sri which means *Service&rsquo;.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF NĀRĀYAŅĀYA:</p>
<p>Though the word Srimate by itself denotes Bhagavan and IIis Spouse wbo are entitled to our service, yet the word Nürayaņa is employed here to indicate the full and perfect -njoyment (unu 99. Lainga puranam:</p>

<p>bhaval of the association of a sesha to the s&rsquo;eshi, and of His qualities and glories (vibhītis ); for this enjoyment ( alone) will generate the kind of love which is essential for all fornus of service. Here the dative (or fourth case) which means for Nāriyana (existing for Ilim) refers thereby to service, &lsquo;Existing for Him&rsquo; is in itself an eternal fact (and need not be prayed for). Therefore what is to be prayed for here is service (to Them) preceded by full and per fect enjoyinent as stated in the following slokas and elsewhere : “ flereafter I should bear in mind the fact of iny being His s&rsquo;esha and render service to Him: This is the ineaning of namas.&rdquo; &quot; Whether you are awake or asleep, I (Lakshmuana ) will perform all kinds of service to You&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since the jivu while performing suraņagati (with this mantra) is praying to the Savionr for what he desires, a word like bhaveyan (may I be) has to be sapp&rsquo;ied: Srimale Noiriyani ya bhaveyam (May I be for Narayana !) Thus, at first, the attainment of the desired end (service to the Lord) is prayed for as being the nuore important; thereafter, by the word nous, the removal of all bind. rances (to salvation and to service) is prayed for.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA :</p>
<p>Giving up the idea of his salvation by himself or by others as impossible and giving up the idea of his existing either for bimself or for others by the thought that lie exists (only) for the Lord and having become free from all sins by his aversion to all other objects of enjoyment than the Lord), the prapanna enjoys all bis bliss as something which is accessory to the Lord&rsquo;s enjoyment.</p>

The objec. tions raised and the answers given thereto in regard to the attain. ment of the desired end and the disappearance of all undesirable elements in the case of Tirumantra should be borne in mind here (also).</p>
<p>Though this word namas prays for the removal of all such hindrances as avidyā (ignorance), karma, the impressions and inclinations which have resulted therefrom (vāsanas), the ruchi or tastes and the association with prakriti or watter, yet it is consi. dered (by sowe jicharyas) that, in accordance with the sruti* which gives the etymological interpretation of this word (namas), the purport or ain bere (in the second part of Dvaya) is the l&rsquo;emoval, in the state of attaining full and perfect service in nukti, of the weeds of one&rsquo;s being the doer by one&rsquo;s own will and of one&rsquo;s being the doer for one&rsquo;s own purpo-es apd, like. wise, of one&rsquo;s being the enjoyer by one&rsquo;s own will and of being the enjoyer solely for oneself. This weed or wrong notion is likely to arise because, in regard to the enjoyment of the fruit elsewhere (in svarga), the thought is present that the fruit was won by one by one&rsquo;s own actions and is enjoyed by one for oneself. From this it would follow that the (man performing prapatti understands that, in regard to the service in the state of mukti, there are no such wrong notions as one&rsquo;s being the doer and the enjoyer by one&rsquo;s owo will and for the sake of oneself-notions which are present in the state of enjoyment of other fruits (like those in svarga). Having understood this, the man performing prapatli makes his prayer in conformity with this knowledge.</p>
<p>Arulalapperumalemperumanar commented on the word namas occurring here by the following sloka :&mdash; &quot; The wise say</p>

<p>that itamas means the state of being carefree without expecting any help (of being without any responsibility in regard to oneself) nairapekshyam wbich results from the jiva&rsquo;s surrendering all bis burdens to the Supreme Being.&rdquo; The nairapekshyam referred to in that sloka is being carefree or baving no expectation or requirements without the sense of responsibility in regard to one&rsquo;s salvation. From this freedom from responsibility, we should realise that either bharasantarpaņam is suggested bere, (since there cannot be the state of being carefree without it) or that the surrender of the bhara to the extent of one&rsquo;s being carefree is intended. If we take the latter part of Dvaya to be &quot; Aham Srimate, Narüyaņāya&rdquo; . (I am for Sriman Narayana ) and consider it to be the offering of the self along with the bhara or burden of protection, and that thereafter na mama declares one&rsquo;s having no connection with oneself, as, when an offering is made (to the gods), it is said “This is for Indra and not for me&rdquo;, if we take it in this forn, it will be extremely appropriate for this inter pretation of the whole of Duaya being a statement of bhara - samartana. In this interpretation the first part of Dvaya is about the file angus or accessories, while the second part states the angi, which is prapatti. When the offering or surrender is made saying: &ldquo;I am for Narayana' as in the s&rsquo;loka &ldquo;I who l&amp;realise that I am Thy s&rsquo;esha surrender myself here and now at Thy two lotus feet&rdquo;. &mdash; (when this surrender is made), it would imply that the responsibility of one&rsquo;s protection and the fruit arising from one&rsquo;s protection are Narayana&rsquo;s as stated in the following passages : &ldquo;When the 109 question arises to whom the surrender of the self is made for the sake of salvation or protection, the answer is given &ldquo;To Vishnu&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I am Thy 110 responsibility (bhara) (in regard to protection)&rdquo;. This namas discloses the severance of all connec tion between a man and his self and what belongs to bim and also between himself and his protection and the fruit resulting from it.</p>

<p>460 CHAPTER</p>
<p>The (fourth or ) dative case of Narayana and the word namas have, each, its significance, in as minch as they indicate respectively the declaration of one&rsquo;s connexion with the Supreme Being and the denial of one&rsquo;s connection with oneself. It may also be that namas denies such things as one&rsquo;s being a doer not subject to the will of) the Supreme Being. Even if we take the simple and ordipary meaning of namas as namimi (I bow to Narayana,&rdquo; it would be in keeping with the meaning &quot; I surender&rdquo; as the word namāmi l I bow) has been commented upon in llantrarijupada.</p>
<p>stotra as meaning &lsquo;for the surrender of the self&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Thus in the case of those who consider on the latter part of Duapa as indicating the surrender of the self, the special kind of fruit or end (namely kainkarya) arises of itself (without the need for stating it), as it is in conformity with the surrender of the self and consistent with one&rsquo;s essential nature (svariipa). In the caso of those who interpret on the latter part as indicating the fruit or object of attainment (namely, kainkaryal as explained before, the idea of the surrender of the responsibility for protection should be considered as being present in the first part which treats of the upaya in the verb (prapadge) being taken along with the word saranam (upaya).</p>
<p>THE PURPORT OF DVAYA:</p>
<p>lbus, in Dviyat, in the different words, by the nature of the Words actually used and of the nieaning which is implicit (without being actually stated in words, the following principal points as well as wbat is required for then stand revealed:- (Iswara&rsquo;s ) association with the mediator Takshini), this (association) being eternal, Sri being incinded in the upãyu along (with Bhagavad), the Saviour being full and perfect in His qualities, the particular forn of relationship between the jira and Iswara, (that of being the body and the socl respectively and that of being s&rsquo;esha and s&rsquo;eshi), Iswara having a divide and auspicions form, the s&rsquo;esha making his approach to the Lord, in this divine ion), how (the</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>· PURPORT OF DVAYA</p>
<p>461</p>
<p>divide and auspicious form of the Lord) becomes the upuya; the manner of winning the Lord&rsquo;s grace, its accessories, the adhikari competent for adopting the upaya; how the end to be attained is the Lord with His attribute Sri, how the object of attainment (the Lord) is endowed with qualities and vibhitis (glories), how the Lord and Sri are the recipients entitled to (our) service, the prayer for perforniing this service, the attainment of all forms of service, the removal of all that is undesirable, their utter and complete removal, the jiva&rsquo;s being the doer subject to the will of the Supreme Being and for His purposes, the jiva&rsquo;s being the enjoyer (in moksha) subject to the Lord&rsquo;s will and by way of his enjoyinent beicg accessory to the Lord&rsquo;s enjoyment. And these aro recalled in Dvara along with two principal things which are intended to be stated, namely, (1) the repūva which is siddha (viz. the Lord with Sri), the upāya which is sidhnya (viz. prapatti) and (2) the object of attainment which is siddha (namely, the Lord with Sri) and the object of attainment which is sūdhya (namely kainkarya or service).</p>
<p>Thus in this gem of a mantra (Dvaya), the Supreme Reality (the Lord of Sri), the special upaya (for attaining it), (namely prapatti) and the desired end or fruit (namely-enjoyment and kainkarya) are taught as in the Suriraka sāstra (Brahma Sutras) (ie, in the order in which they are treated there). In Dvaya the order of words follows the order in wbich the upāya and its fruit occur (i.c.) the upāya is stated first and the fruit is stated thereafter (as the former produces the latter). However, as in the mantra (taught) in the Svetās&rsquo;vatara (upanishad) viz. “Desir ons of moksha I seek Thy protection),&quot; the important point is the adoption of the upaya preceded by a desire for the fruit (aimed at); former (ācharyas) have explained that, following the logical (or psychological order), the sentence stating the fruit (namely, enjoyment and kainkarya) should be thought of first. For is it not a fact that a man would never study the nature of an upaya and adopt it without previously studying the nature of the end to be attained thereby?. So also in the Tirumantra, the order of</p>
<p>462 CHAPTER</p>
<p>meditation should be as stated above in regard to the upüya, and the fruit thereof. It is only if he desires the fruit and is (also) competent, that the adoption of the upaya would follow.</p>
<p>The words of learned med such as &ldquo;One sbonld seek (the Lord&rsquo;s) protection with (the utterance) of Dvaya&rdquo; and &ldquo;The saravāgati which is stated in Dvaya consists in the faith that to attain Narayana with Sri, His two lotus feet are the upaya&rdquo; - (these words) also show that Dvaya reveals the adoption of the upāya.</p>
<p>THE SUMSIARY OF THE MEANING OF DVAYA:&ndash;</p>
<p>Although here (in Dvaya), the first part, the words ending with the dative (or fourth) case and the namas - (althongh) these three are three separate sentences, yet it should be construed as a single sentence with the upaya as the primary purpose. This is how it should be construed):</p>
<p>The sum and substance of Duaya is this:- &ldquo;At the feet of Narayana who is the Lord of all, who is, in everyway and supremely blissful (or enjoyable) and who is inseparable from Lakshmi and in order that I may obtain the removal of all that is opposed to all kinds of service in all places, at all times and in all states or circumstances and to receive (the privilege of) full and perfect service to T&rsquo;hem, I, who ana destitute of upayas, surrender the responsibility of the protection of myself with the accompaniment of the five angas or accessories at the feet of Narayana, so that I may not have anything to do fui such things as the responsibility for protecting myself.</p>

<p>who had won over the Lord by (their) prapatti and who were overpowered solely by their compassion (to teach it to others).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>This (mantra) is understood as consisting of eight words (if Sriman Nārāyana charanau should be taken as three separate words ;) of six words (if that componnd word is taken as a single word); and as a single sentence with five words where the predicate is important.</li>
</ol>
<p>(NOTE: With five words: (1) Prapadye; (2) saranam: (3) Srimun Narayana charanau (4) Srinate Narayanaya; (5) namah according to Saras vadini.)</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>This uniqne mantra (or this mantra consisting of a single sentence) called Dvaya has three members (sentences); it can help secure the fourth end of life (namely - moksha); it gives a clear idea of the five things that ought to be known; it explains the upāya with six ungas (prapatti); its potency or greatness is similar to that of the seven oceans; it explains the meaning of azshtrikshura, the mantra with eight letters, and it produces here (in this world?) in Sriranga, in the minds of wise men* (Like Sri Ramanujal the ninth rasa, namely, (Santa or spiritual serenity).</li>
</ol>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>We have thus explained how, by uttering, in combination, the two parts of Dvaya which are reed separately in the s&rsquo;ruti, one can seek, as refuge or upirya, the two feet of the Lord of Sri who, out of compassion, is bent on helping us and who is prepared to pardon us; one can thus attain the Lord of the lotus.born Lakshmi and in the region of bliss attain faultless service to the Lord) along with the full and perfect enjoyment of the Lord.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>There is no sāstra superior to Vedanta; there is no higher Truth or Reality than the slayer of Madhu (Narayana); there is</p>
<p>NOTE *: There is a reference here to Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s gadya.464 CHAPTER</p>
<p>nothing more holy of resort than His devotees; there is no better dwelling place than those places that are agreeable to them; there is no better means of preserving health than the quality of satte (or eating sātvic food); there is no other way of acquiring wisdom than devotion to the wise; there is no bliss greater than moksha ; similarly there is no better ineans of obtaining spiritual welfare (moksha) than the utterance of Derya.</p>
