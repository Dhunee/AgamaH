(10) THE CHAPTER ON FITNESS FOR PRAPATTI. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Fitness (for Bhakti or Prapatti) consists in a combination of desire (for the fruits of a course of action and of ability which is threefold. This fitness of man is differentiated as consisting in conditions prescribed for the yoga of eight angas or auxiliaries (bhakti yoga) and for the yoga of six angas or auxiliaries (pra. patti). That Bhagavan is the refuge or Saviour of all has been declared in the sruti and confirmed in the Smr̥tis In adopting this righteous path viz., prapatti, there is competence for all as in the matter of speaking the truth and such other injunctions as are ordained in the Vedas (for all men , without any difference of caste or ūsrama). 

(Those who are not of the three higher castes are probibited from the performance of certain rites and duties ordained in the srutis, but this probibition does not apply to such injunctions 88 "speak the truth ", and " look upon your mother as divine" eto. which are also ordained in the Vedas. So also prapatti, though prescribed in the Vedas, is open to all castes ). 

THE MEANING OF COMPETENCY OR ADHIKARA: 

It is necessary that one should know the special qualifications and the like required in a person who intends to adopt nyasa vidya (prapatti) without any desire for the other upāyas in the quest for the goal that is desired. Competency (adhikara ) consists in 

NOTE 1: Ability which is threefold - The ability to understand the meaning of sastras: the ability to perform what is ordained in them and the competence as laid down in the sastras according to caste, qualities and the like. 

NOTE 2:- Bhakti Yoga: Bhakti Yoga is called the ashtanga yoga, because its eight angas are yama, niyama, etc. Praparti is called shadanga yoga, because its six angas are such as anukulya saṅkalpa, prathikulya var ianam, mahavisvasam, akinchanyam, etc., to be described later,112 CHAPTER 

the attribute of desiring the end on the part of the person who adopts an upāya for the sake of a certain desired result and also ability to adopt it. Ability means the capacity to understand the meaning of the sāstras and the capacity to perform what is ordained therein and, likewise, fitness or competency in accord. ance with what is prescribed in the sāstras, such as, caste, quality and the like (āchāra - samskāra). This competency exists al ready (before the adoption of the upāya). To the man who has this competency, what is stated to be th: object to be obtained by the means, is the desired result or fruit. Upaya is the means prescribed or ordained for securing that fruit or result. The person who has become desirous of mukti (mumukṣu) and who adopts the special upūya for mokṣa called direct and independent prapatti should have, in common with the upāsıkı ( who has adopted bhakti), a knowledge obtained from the süstras of such things as the relationship (between Jivātnī and Paramitma as that between the body and the soul) and he should have in addi. tion, the special qualifications of akinchanya and ananyagatitva ; ākinchanya means the absence (in a person) of the ability for other upāyas. Ananyagatitvam means an aversion to all other interests (than vokṣa) and a turning away from all other refuge than Bhagavan. The latter is implicit in the former, namely, aversion to all other interests. This may be seen from such passages as the following :-"Wise 'inen never worship Brahma, Rudra and others who are called gods, for the boons that they could grant are limited." 

If, without an eager and impatient desire for immediate miokṣa, & person who wants euch things as the continuance of the body (or the continuance of the worship of archūvatūru) adopts prapatti for the sake of mokṣa, his mukti will be delayed in proportion to these other interests,

FITNESS FOR PRAPATTI 

113 

ĀKINCHANYA AND ANANYAGATITVA: Ākinchanya and Ananyagatitva are conditioned by the ignor ance of and inability to adopt other upāyas on the part of the person adopting this means, as also his inability to endure delay in attaining mukti. His turning away from other saviours than Bhagavan is conditioned by bis conviction of the absolate depend ence on Bhagavan alone, which is common to himself and to others (including other deities than the Lord), as is stated in the śloka : “ Just as, O 'Bharata, tips of grass are entirely subject to (the force of the wind, even so are all beings subject to the sway of the Lord ", and it is conditioned also by his aver sion to other interests than mukti, 

THE PRAMANAS IN SUPPORT : The nature of the specific competency for prapatti is evident from the following authoritative passages and from spiritual tradi tion : "Having been abandoned by his own father (Indra), the gods and the great sages, be, (i.e.) Kakasura, wandered about the three worlds and finally took refuge under Rāma alone", "I am the abode of all trapegressions; I have no means or upāya to save myself and I have pothing else to attain besides Thee"; "I seek" the refuge of Thy feet, O Saranya (Saviour): I have po other upāya and nothing else to attain than I'bee": "\*Finding that there is no npüya for leaping over samsara even in all the endless future, etc." : "I'who am aware that there is no upāya for me in all the thousands of crores of kalpas other than performing prapatti at Tby two lotus-like feet", and, “I who have no other refuge and no other saviour etc." 

PRAPATTI IS OPEN TO ALL: If such qualifications exist, prapatti is certainly open to all as an upāya, since there are no restrictions to it such 88 caste. 2. Mahābhārata: Udyoga Parva: 30-29 6. Sriranga Gadyam 3. Rāmayana: Sundarakanda: 38-33 7. Vaikuṇṭha Gadyam 4. Ahirbudhnya Samhita: 37-30

114 TAMIL VERSB: 

The devotees of the Lord ( Acharyas) have themselves under stood and bave made us (also ) understond the eternal Lord who is the origin of all things and who is anxious to save us, being fall of the might of mercy, so that all persons from the Brabmin to the Chandala and especially those who feel niost the sufferings of samsāra may, in their helplessness and without seeking any other saviour or any other fruit, approach Him and seek refuge under Him. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

(1) Inability to adopt such upāyas as Bhakti yoga, (2) ignor ance of the required knowledge; (3) prohibition by the sāstras of the adoption of such means and (4) ipability to endure any delay in attaining mukti :- these four, occuring either singly\* or in combinations of two, three or four, by virtue of adrishta (re sulting from meritorious deeds performed in the past) are qualifications of varied kinds for the performance of direct and independent prapatti to the Lord of Lakṣmī and good men resort to it with these qualifications and free from all doubt for the attainment of mukti. 

NOTE:— \* Those who have only one of these four are of four classes, those who have any two of them are of six, those who have any three are of four and those whonbinave all the four form one.
