  <p>(8) THE CHAPTER ON THE CLASSIFICATION</p>
<p>OF QUALIFIED PERSONS.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>Even though the desire for moksha is the same, a distinction arises among those who practise the vidyās or forms of meditation prescribed in the s&rsquo;rutis, &amp;s a result of their respective qualifications or competence in regard to such vidyās as Madhuvidyā, Sadvidya and so on. In the same way, &amp; distinction arises between the adoption of prapatti and other vidyās (which are of the nature of bhakti or devout meditation), as a result of an unseen power or destiny depending on past karma which brooks no questioning.</p>
<p>(NOTE:Some aspirants for moksha are qualified for madhu vidya and others for sadvidya as a result of their respective competence or special forms of aspiration. So also some are qualified for prapatti, while others are for bhakti.)</p>
<p>TWO KINDS OF ADHIKARIS:</p>
<p>Among those who thus resort to the practice of the dharmas of renunciation 48 &amp; means for the attainment of the supreme goal of life (namely moksha), there are two classes of qualified persons : those who adopt prapatti as the sole and direct means and those to whomh prapatti is auxiliary to the chief means, viz., bhakti. Both these are prapannas, ode adopting prapatti as an indepen dent means and the other adopting it as anga to bhakti. Both of them are also called bhaktas, because bhakti is the phala or fruit for one and sādhana or means for the other,</p>
<p>NOTE: phala bhakti means bhakti which ariscs as the fruit of prapatti, whereas sadhana bhakti is bhakti which leads to moksha.</p>
<p>Just 48, according to the passage, &quot; Ablation is prescribed in seven forma&quot;, (1) the utterance of a mantra ; (2) the mental process; (3) celestial ablution ; (4) ablution by air and so on, are held as different and equally effective kinds of ablution in regard to those who are qualified for those respective forms, the forms known as</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>&ldquo;&hellip; CLASSIFICATION OF ADHIKARIS:</li>
</ol>
<p>Uktinishta (by one&rsquo;s utterance) and acharya nishta :(that done&rdquo; by the acharya on one&rsquo;s behalf) and varieties of prapatti. UKTINISHTĀ:</p>
<p>Of these, that done by one&rsquo;s utterance (uktinishta) is as follows: Those who have no clear knowledge of auxiliaries (anga), such as the determination to do wbat is agreeable (to the Lord), but who possess the qualification of knowing that, without, the Lord, they have no other means (a kinchanya) and who have. also the faith (viswāsa) that He will grant salvation if prayed to - they pronounce, before the Saviour, the sentence taught to them by their acharyas, wbich will be considered by the Lord as equivalent to perfect prapatti; they say: &ldquo;May my salvation be Thy burden or responsibility !?&rdquo; They are like the ignorant children of feudatory princes who seek the protection of the emperor by repeating the words taught to them by their parses. If a little boy who does not understand the meaning of words and sentences says, once, &quot; Madam, give me food as alms&quot;, it meets: with immediate and favourable response in the houses of good men wbo are well.to do. In the same way, it has been said, The Lord, whose wealth Deyer suffers any diminution, however much He may give, will also grant whatever is prayed for&quot;. Since He is supremely rich and generous, even this utterance or ukti will never be fruitless. In the case of those who are ignorant and who depend entirely on this utterance, the compassion of the Lord, who is the refuge of all, cannot ignore even this mere atterance (as it cannot digest it); for it has been said, “Whatever may be the manner or form, you have attered the Duaya Mantra. Therefore your redemption is my responsibility.&quot; This trath has been stated by those who are well versed in the Sastras) in such slokas as the following: &ldquo;Though* I am a sinner, it will not become Thee, who art the Lord of all, to neglect me when I atter the words stating that I seek Thy refuge.&rdquo; &ldquo;This &lsquo;speech of mide expressing the thought that I seek refuge upder Thee is not attered 1. Tiruvoymozhi: 3.9, 3.</p>

<p>with all my mind and with all my heart. I can be saved only if even this were utterance will secure Tby compassion.&rdquo; &ldquo;I longti to see Thee by merely uttering the words of prapatti - Thee who caust not be attained by bhakti.&rdquo; The state of one who performs prapatti by utterance (ukti), and that of one who depends solely on the acharya have both been described in the same sloka as follows:- &ldquo;I have been made Thy responsibility by my acharyas who follow the way of dharma. I have also (myself) uttered the word seeking refuge. Taking this into consideration, 0, Lord of Srirangam, make me Thy burdep or responsibility&rdquo; The word api (also) in the sloka indicates that any one of the two will soffice. ACHARYANISHȚĀ ;</p>
<p>Of the two, the one who depends solely on the acharya is included in the acharya&rsquo;s own pradatti as part of it, for it bas been laid down in Sandilya Smriti and other treatises as follows: “He should also state thus: “This is Amy son, my servant, my disciple (who is to be saved)&quot;. It has been said: “There may be doubts concerning (the redemption of) those that serve Achyata, but there is absolutely no doubt about the (redemption) of those who delight in the service of His devotees&quot;. So, in the case of those who depend solely on the acharya, there is no doubt at all concerning the fruition of prapatti, by the principle of &ldquo;How much more, then&rdquo; (kaimutika nyāya).</p>
<p>Mudali Andan said: &ldquo;When &amp; lion leaps from one bill to another, the little creatures (like hugs and lice) on his body are also taken over from that bill to the other. So also when the author of Sri Bhashya performed prapatti (the surrender of his responsibility or bhara), we &ldquo;too bave been saved (by that act) 4A. Varadarajastava: 92</p>
<p>SA. Sandilya Smriti: 3.75 5. Sri Rangarajastava: 2 - 102</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Sandilya Smriti: 1.95 NOTE: This is interpreted in two different ways by the southern school of Visishtadvaitins and the northern school. The former bold that since Sri Ramanuja bas already performed praparti, even bis followers of a later day who acknowledge him as their acharya will benefit by it and they need not perform praparti; the latter hold, on the other hand, that only those who were his sishyas then would benefit by it.</li>

<p>CLASSIFICATION OF ADHIKARIS</p>

<p>owing to our intimate connexion with him.&rdquo; We, too, have expressed this idea in Nyasa Tilāka as follows:- &quot; The blind man walks on being led by one who is not blind; the lame man is taken (across the stream) by the boatman, being placed within the boat; the children of the king&rsquo;s servants enjoy the pleasures (of the palace), although they do not know the king. So also my acharya, who is compassionate, is capable of making me attain Thee, O Lord of Srirangam&rdquo;. It comes to this that the Lord of all will not be gracious enough to grant us the supreme goal of existence, unless prapatti is performed in some manner or other and by some one or other.</p>
<p>The favour of Bhagavatas, residence in holy places and the like are not direct and independent means for attaining moksha. (It is true that we find such pissages as the following in the Sastras):-&ldquo;Whether it be a beast&rsquo;or &amp; man or &amp; bird - those who are held by Bhagavatas as their owo will go to the supreme abode of Vishnu for that very reason&rdquo;. “We, who live in your territories, should be protected by you, for you are our king, O ruler · of men, whether you are io the town or in the forests&quot;, &ldquo;All the beings in Ayodhya which contained (many) good regions - whether they were beings that moved or beings that could not move - he enabled them (all) to acquire nobility of nature&rdquo;. The nobility was that of feeling delight in the company of Sri Rama and grief in separation from him. &ldquo;The lo strength that lies in living in places where Thou hast temples is the strength that enables &amp; man to attain moksha&rdquo;. (From these passages, it might appear, at first sight, that the favour of Bhagavatas or God&rsquo;s devotees and the fact of living in places belonging to the Lord would lead of themselves to the supreme goal.) But even here there is always some coonexion with either prapatti by one&rsquo;s owa utterance or prapatti through the acharya or bhakti or prapatti</p>

<p>98 CA APTER</p>
<p>wbich existed before or bhakti or prapatti wbich followed. It may he asked how this could be. (The answer is as follows:-) They will lead to bhakti or prapatti. In the case of one who has already adopted bhakti or upāsanā, they will promote the further development of the upaya or means. In the case of one who has performed prapatti as an independent means, they will promote the eagerness for service while in this world. It is in this way they render help.</p>
<p>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BHAKTI AND PRAPATTI</p>
<p>IN SECURING THE GOAL: Among these, he who has adopted prapatti as the means to bhakti is capable, like Vyasa and others, of other means or upāyas than prapatti and is therefore not absolutely helpless (akinchana ). Since he can bear delay (in attaining moksha), he is not averse to other interests (in life). He will attain moksha only at the expiry of the karma which has already begun to yield fruit (prārabdha), when he will have the intense thought of the last moment before death. Since the primary upaya or means (angi) wbich he has chosen is upăsana or bhakti, he attains the fruit thereof, namely, moksha, when it is performed fully and in accordance with the rules and injunctions prescribed for it. On the other hand, prapatti adopted as the primary or direct means (angi) is open to all adhikaris, is capable of averting all hindrances (to moksha), can further the attainment of all that is desired, is easy of performance, has to be performed only once, can bring about the fulfilment (of what is aimed at ) quickly and will not countedance any opposition or obstacle. Like the missile, Brabinastra, it will not tolerate the adoption of any other means or upāya for attaining the fruit. The man who has resorted to prapatti as the direct and independent means will have no hindrances at all in the way of his attaining the perfect enjoyment (of the bliss of Bhagavan). Therefore from the moment of the performance of prapatti, there is nothing in the way of his attaining moksha but bis own desire to live till the death</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION OF ADHIKARIS.</p>
<p>of this body so that he may enjoy such things as the rendering of service with this body to the images of the Lord (archa) to which he has an attachment. So his moksha has to await only the death of this body and will consist in the rendering, in Vaikunta, of perfect and full service which has begun even here in the performance of service limited by the conditions of place, time and the nature of bodily life (svarūpa ). The state of the prapanna who is prepared to continue in this world till the dissolution of the body is referred to in passages like the following: &ldquo;What is there&rdquo; wrong in us who go about here having already won the grace of being permitted tc serve Thee &quot; &ldquo;Leaving this bliss of &ldquo;uttering Thy names, I do not want even the bliss of going to Paramapada and ruling over it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can&rsquo; I indeed give up the hare and go in pursuit of the crow !&rdquo; (That is it would be foolish to give up hare&rsquo;s flesh wbich is excellent as food and go after crow&rsquo;s flesh. So also the service of the image here in temples is superior even to the bliss of serving the Lord in Parama. pada). “My deep love to Thee, &ldquo;O King, is always staunch. So also my devotion to Thee, O valiant Sire, is always firnı. Nowhere else can my mind turn&rdquo;. (In these words Hanuman expresses his love and devotion to Sri Rama and states that this love and devotion are greater towards Rama than even to the Lord of Paramapada).</p>
<p>*Since the Supreme Ruler is the giver of all things, and since prapatti at His feet is capable of yielding all kinds of fruit, it becomes the means of securing whatever fruit is desired rer. pectively by these two (bhakta and prapanna ). The Sāstras say, &ldquo;Ask any boon that you want, when I am in the range of one&rsquo;s vision, all (good) things will follow.&rdquo; &ldquo;O Thou that hast 11. Tiruvoymozhi: 8-10-4</p>

<p>(said by the Lord to Dhruva) 13. Tirumangai Alwar: Siriya Tirumadal: 16. Visbnu Purana 1 - 12 - 79 14. Ramayana : Uttara Kanda: 40-15</p>
<p>(said by Dhruva to the Lord) NOTE: The sentence means that the direct&rsquo; prapanna gets moksha which he desires and the prapanna who performs prapatti for the sake of bhakti gets bhakti which he desires, for prapatti can secure whatever is desired.</p>

<p>created all the worlds! Is there anything that is difficult to obtain, when Thou art pleased ? &quot; &quot; When&rdquo; He is graciously disposed, is there any thing here that cannot be obtained ? &quot; &quot; What is there in this world or in the world above, O Dalbhya, that cannot be accomplished by those men whose minds are directed towards Vishnu ?&rdquo;. &ldquo;The fruit is from Him. It stands to reason &ldquo;. (Brahma Sutras 3 - 2 - 37). Bhakti or upasana is the means of securing the four kinds of objects that may be desired in accord. ance with one&rsquo;s aim as stated in the Bhagavad Gitā (7 - 16). &ldquo;Four types of men who have performed meritorious deeds wor. sbip me. He who has lost his wealth and is anxious to recover it, he who wants to have a vision of his own self (ātmā) and to enjoy it (ātmānubhava ), he who wants to acquire wealth anew, and he who is &amp; Jnāni, who desires to be for ever with the Lord and practises bhakti for attaining Him.&rdquo; Similarly bave not the great rishis declared that prapatti is also the means of attaining the four kinds of objects or aims as is stated in the sloka : &ldquo;Only so long as one does not perform prapatti to Thee that canst destroy all sins, will there be the anxiety to recover lost wealth, only so long will there be the desire to acquire new wealth, oply so long will there be the absence of the enjoyment of one&rsquo;s self as something different from the body; only so long will there be the sorrow of samsāra&rdquo;. From the words &quot; that destroyest all sins” and the repetition of &ldquo;only so long&rdquo; repeated in every case with great consideration, it is made clear that the fruit which is desired by the man will all become his, in accordance with his desire and at the very time when he desires to have it. It is in consideration of this superior efficacy of praputti that it is stated (in Lakshmi Tantra 17 - 62) 29 follows:-&rdquo; Those who practise Jnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga With &amp; pure mind and those who perform karma which would discipline the soul in renunciation are not worth even one tep-millionth part of the man who has</p>

<p>CLASSIFICATION OF ADHIKARIS.</p>

<p>performed prapatti. The difference in the kinds of service done here (in this life) by the prapanna is due to the difference in the desire of the prapanna apd that difference in the desire is due to the difference in the meritorious deeds of the past which have began to operate in this life (Prārabdha karma ). There will be no difference at all in the bliss that will be attained after casting off the last body.</p>
<p>THE BLISS IN MOKSHA IS THE SAME FOR BOTH.</p>
<p>Entire dependence on the Lord is uniformly the same for all. For it is stated in Vishnu Tatuam :-&ldquo;Having understood his absolute dependence on the Supreme Person, he gets rid of the bondage due to past karma, attains peerless independence and enjoys bliss with him.&rdquo; It has been declared (by the Bhashyakara in the chapter on the Goal (Chapter IV of the Brahma Sutras) that this independence which is said to be acquired in the final stage of attainment (i.e.) moksha is * fitness to render every kind of service to the Lord without being subject to past karma.</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>Those who desire to attain the bliss of Bhagavad realise that the supreme aim of life is moksha and that there are two upāyas or means attaining it, one prolonged and the other quick which depend on their luck. They adopt one of these two upayas and find that, for getting rid of the hindrances caused by past karma, there is no other way than seeking the feet of Mukunda for refuge,</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>Mukunda does not vouchsafe His abode to any one other than the prapanna. The prapanna is of two kinds, Damely, he who adopts prapatti as the sole and independent means and he who adopts prabatti as the auxiliary means to bhākti or upasana and this difference is due to difference in the fruition of their good</p>
<p>• Brahma Sutras : 4-4-8102 deeds. He who adopts prapatti as an auxiliary to bhakti will attain moksha after much delay caused by the need to expiate past karma (in one or several bodies), but will have the happiness of devout worship in this world for a long time. He to whom prapatti is the sole and independent means will attain moksha quickly (i.e.) at the end of this life itself, but bis happiness of serving the Lord in this world will be limited and of short duration.</p>
