<p>(1) THE GOD OF THE <em>MANTRA</em>:</p>
<p>Of us who, with a knowledge of its meaning, are meditating on the <em>mantra</em> taught to us by our ācharya which consist of the <em>praṇava</em> (<em>aum</em>) at the beginning with the word <em>namas</em> (<em>namo</em>) and then the word Nārāyanāya revealed in the Vedas - of us who are not competent to adopt other _upāya_s and the responsibility of redeeming whose souls has been accepted by our Lord, May He dispel very soon all those obstacles (past <em>karma</em> ) which stand in the way of our enjoying the imperial bliss of service to Him!.</p>
<p>(2) THE SEER WHO REVEALED THE <em>MANTRA</em>:</p>
<p>कल्याणमावहतु कार्तयुगं स्वधर्मं प्रख्यापयन् प्रणिहितेषु नरादिकेषु ।<br>
आद्यं कमप्यधिगतो रथमष्टचक्रं बन्धुस्सतां बदरिकाश्रमतापसो नः ॥ ६०॥</p>
<p>May that great seer dwelling in the hermitage of Badarika ( Nārāyaṇa ), the friend of (all ) good men, who occupies a certain chariot called <em>Mūlamantra</em> with (its eight syllables as ) its eight wheels and who instructs his reverent pupils, Nara and others (Nārada  and the like) in the <em>dharma</em> concerning himself which is characteristic of Krita Yuga - may that great seer confer (His) blessing on us !</p>
<p>(3) THE <em>MANTRA</em>:</p>
<p>यदन्तस्थमशेषेण वाङ्मयं वेदवैदिकं ।<br>
तस्मै व्यापकमुख्याय मन्त्राय महते नमः ॥ ६१ ॥</p>
<p>Let us adore that great <em>mantra</em>, the most important of the  <em>vyāpaka</em> _mantra_s<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> , within which lies embedded the gist of all the revealed truths found in the _śruti_s and the _smṛti_s without any exception.</p>
<p>(4) THE DISCIPLE WHO HAS BEEN INITIATED INTO THE MEANING OF THE <em>MANTRA</em> BY THE GRACE OF THE <em>GURU</em>:</p>
<p>इह मूलमन्त्रसंवृतमर्थमशेषेण कश्चिदनुभवति ।<br>
स्फटिकतलनिहितनिधिमिव देशिकदत्तेन चक्षुषा जन्तुः ॥ ६२ ॥</p>
<p>Here a being who has been blessed by his <em>guru</em> with vision sees all the meaning concealed within the <em>mūlamantra</em>, without any exception, as if it is a treasure placed underneath a plate made of crystal.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>THE PURPORT OF THE THREE _MANTRA_S AND THEIR</p>
<p>RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER:</p>
<p>So far we have explained the most essential truths which every sātvika should remember and established them on a firm basis (of authority (<em>pramāṇa</em>) and argument). We will now proceed to show in what ways, in the three great mysteries (_mantra_s) which reveal all these (truths), the words and the sentences should be construed (in order that their meanings may be properly understood).</p>
<p>Among them, the first, namely, Tiru_mantra_ (<em>aṣṭākṣara</em>) helps us to understand such things as our essential nature, (<em>svarūpa</em>) which finds true happiness only in being the <em>śeṣa</em> of the Supreme Being. By that (revelation), it creates a longing for the Supreme Goal of attainment preceded by the removal of all obstacles thereto and also a feeling of urgency (tvarā) (in regard to that attainment) whereby the competency for the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) becomes perfected. <em>Dvaya</em> reveals clearly the manner in which this particular <em>upāya</em> should be adopted by this adhikārī with an antecedent longing for the fruit thereof. The <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> enjoins (as a <em>vidhi</em>) the adoption of this <em>upāya</em>. Though it is possible to find all these truths in each of these three _mantra_s by itself, from the words themselves and from the sense</p>
<p>suggested by them (ārtha ), yet each of these three has a primary aim (which is different from that of the others). In the Tiru <em>mantra</em>, the first syllable ( a ) in the first word ( <em>aum</em>) expresses, in a concise form, the Supreme Reality who is the Protector or Saviour; in the middle word (<em>namas</em> ) (<em>namo</em>) and the third word (Nārāyanāya ) are to be understood respectively the <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) and the Upeya (the end or goal, viz., service to Nārāyaṇa ); what is stated briefly (in the Tiru_mantra_) is made clear in <em>Dvaya</em>. (1) The word prapadye in <em>Dvaya</em> indicates the particular kind of adhikāri (namely, one who is destitute of other _upāya_s - <em>akiñcana</em>) by the first person singular and (2) the needlessness of other _upāya_s, is inferred from the sense, and (so also) (3) the disappearance of the hindrances to the goal is implicit in the last word <em>namas</em>, The <em>Carama</em>-<em>śloka</em> explains distinctly these (three things), (that are only hinted at in the <em>Dvaya</em> ). These three (_mantra_s) are to us (men destitute of other _upāya_s), maintenance, nourishment and enjoyment (of the fruit), being, respectively, the causes of knowledge (<em>jñāna</em> ), practice or adoption (anushtāna ) and the end or fruit (of our endeavour.)</p>
<p>It has been said: &ldquo;The God, Nārāyaṇa, who is perfect in the possession of the six attributes is certainly in the form of <em>aṣṭākṣara</em> in the mouths of those who utter the <em>mantra</em>,&rdquo; So, from the tongue of the <em>ācārya</em>, it dispels the darkness (ignorance) in the cave of the disciple&rsquo;s heart and makes him realise his pure and essential nature, which finds bliss only in being the <em>śeṣa</em> of the Supreme Being. Since it gives (in this manner) real (spiritual) existence to him, the Tiru_mantra_ is his maintenance (dhāraka). The <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> is the cause of his advancement in the particular kind of knowledge which would enable him to adopt the final <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>). It is the final word as a precept or instruction concerning the <em>upāya</em>, omitting nothing that should be learnt. Therefore the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em> is his nourishment (poṣaka). <em>Dvaya</em> is the cause of the attainment of the Supreme Goal of existence by a single utterance of it and enables a person by constant meditation to feel that he has attained his object. Therefore <em>Dvaya</em> is an object of enjoyment (bhogya).</p>
<p>THE PRIMARY IMPORTANCE OF TIRU_MANTRA_:</p>
<p>Among these three <em>mantra_s), in regard to Tiru_mantra</em>, the seer, (rishi), the metre (chandas) the god revealed by it, (devata), the germ (<em>bīja</em>), the potency (<em>śakti</em>), the colour (<em>varṇa</em>), the application (viniyoga), the locality (sthāna) and nyāsa should be learnt from the respective kalpas and traditions (sampradaya). The greatness and glory of Tiru_mantra_ are well known froin Upaniṣads like Atharvana and Kaṭha, from s&rsquo;astras like that of Manu, and from various kalpas like Nārāyanātmaka Hairaṇyagarbha kalpa, Nāradīya kalpa and Bodhāyanīya kalpa.</p>
<p>It has been said :-&ldquo;Of &ldquo;all _mantra_s, the _mantra_s treating of <em>Bhagavān</em> are the highest. Of the countless _mantra_s treating of <em>Bhagavān</em>, the three vyāpaka _mantra_s are the highest, so also the eternal <em>mūlamantra</em> is the highest of all _mantra_s ; of all secrets, this is the supreme secret; of all things that purify, this is the most purificatory&rdquo;. So it is the highest among the three vyāpaka _mantra_s; it is the essence of all the Vedas; it is capable of removing all evil influences; it is the means of obtaining all the objects desired by men; it helps in the adoption of all _upāya_s; it can be uttered by all castes, either in its Vedic form (with <em>aum</em>) or in its tantric form (without the <em>aum</em>), in accordance with their respective competence; it reveals, in no uncertain terms, all the reals (_tattva_s), both those that are pervaded by <em>Bhagavān</em> and that which pervades all (viz the Supreme Self); it does not require the help or aid of any other <em>mantra</em> and is common to all the forms of <em>Bhagavān</em> (like <em>Śrī</em> Rāma, <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa and so on)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> . Owing to these reasons, all _ācārya_s delight in it. The Alvars, too, sing its praise with delight in the following passages &ndash; &quot; Having learnt Thy holy <em>mantra</em> with eight syllables&rdquo;, &ldquo;Those who have been initiated by the <em>ācārya</em> into the <em>mantra</em> with eight syllables and utter it with the proper <em>niṣṭhā</em> are capable of ruling over <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em>&rdquo;, &quot; Those who constantly delight in the <em>mantra</em> with eight syllables and utter it become capable of ruling over <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;You were devotees that sang the name of the Lord saying &ldquo;Namo Nārāyanāya&rdquo; so that country and town might understand&rdquo; and &ldquo;By uttering the holy name Namo Nārāyaṇāya in the proper way (i.e.) without seeking any material gain&rdquo; etc, etc. The seers (rishis) too, have declared as follows:- &ldquo;Many were the great seers like Sanaka who attained the abode of <em>Viṣṇu</em> by uttering the <em>Aṣṭākṣara</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;Just&rsquo; as among the deities there is no one superior to Nārāyaṇa, there is, among the _mantra_s, no <em>mantra</em> superior to the <em>Aṣṭākṣara</em>&rdquo;; &ldquo;Raising my hand and swearing that it is true, I declare this to you! O my children and my disciples, listen. There is no <em>mantra</em> superior to the <em>mantra</em> of eight syllables. Adore <em>Bhagavān</em> with it always. Show your devotion to Him with it, and worship Him with it. Those who show their devotion to Him by looking upon this <em>mantra</em> as supreme will never perish (i. e. will not be in <em>Samsāra</em>.)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sitting, or lying down, or standing anywhere, we have adopted only the <em>mantra</em>, Namo Nārāyanāya as our <em>upāya</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Supreme Ruler had this <em>mantra</em> taught to Puṇḍarīka by Nārada ; he received it as his supreme good; and as stated in the <em>śloka</em> ; &quot; Puṇḍarīka &ldquo;whose mind was ever bent on <em>dharma</em> understood that, of all things to be attained, Nārāyaṇa was the highest and attained <em>mukti</em> by uttering the <em>mantra</em> with eight syllables : Namo Nārāyaṇāya&rdquo;. He practised this <em>mantra</em> and</p>
<p>obtained release from <em>samsāra</em>. The supreme Ruler, Himself, initiated Tirum_aṅga_i Alvar into this <em>mantra</em>,</p>
<p>IT MAY BE UTTERED BY ALL WITH THE OMISSION OF</p>
<p>THE PRAŅAVA AND THE SUFFIX OF THE</p>
<p>FOURTH CASE AT THE END:</p>
<p>When this <em>mantra</em> is taken without the <em>praṇava</em> (at the beginning) and the dative suffix at the end of Nārāyaṇa (i. e.) (as Namo Nārāyaṇa), every one is competent to utter it. This may be seen from the Varāha purāna in the context of the sanctity of Kaiśika Dvādaśī, where it is said : &quot; (Nampaduvan), who was of the caste that eat dog&rsquo;s flesh, came back after pronouncing the words: Namo Nārāyaņa&quot;. It may also be evident from the following Tamil verses: “When the name of <em>Bhagavān</em> is uttered, one should say Namo Nārāyaṇa &ldquo;, &quot; Having obtained this excellent garland called Namo Nārāyaṇa etc&rdquo; and &quot; there is certainly a tongue in the mouth and there is certainly also the <em>mantra</em> called Namo Nāraņa&quot; which should be uttered at a single breath&quot;.</p>
<p>To Brahmins and the like (Kṣatriyas), the <em>mantra</em> consists of eight syllables including the <em>praṇava</em> just as it occurs in the Veda. It has been stated: &ldquo;Karma<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> is said, in the ocean of nectar called <em>Pāñcarātra</em>, to be of three kinds: to Brahmins <em>karma</em>  is Vaidic (i.e.) to be performed with Vedic _mantra_s; to Kshatrias, <em>karma</em>  is both Vaidic and tantric; to Vaiśyas and Śūdras <em>karma</em>  is tantric; or <em>karma</em>  may be tantric to all. Aṣṭākṣara, (the <em>mantra</em> with eight syllables), <em>Dvādaśākṣara</em> (the <em>mantra</em> with twelve syllables <em>Namo Bhagavate Vāsudevāya</em> with the <em>praṇava</em> at the beginning) and the <em>Ṣaḍakṣara</em> (the <em>mantra</em> with six syllables, <em>Namo Viṣṇave</em> with the <em>praṇava</em> at the beginning) - these are the principal _mantra_s of <em>Viṣṇu</em> whose splendour is beyond all measure. These _mantra_s with the <em>praṇava</em> ( at the beginning) are Vaidika _mantra_s; without the <em>praṇava</em> they are Tântric _mantra_s. To women and Śūdras the utterance of the <em>Mūlamantra</em> should be without the dative suffix (of the word Nārāyaṇa). So also there is, for them, no svara, no <em>praṇava</em> nor _aṅga_nyāsa or other rules. To them the utterance of the mere <em>mantra</em> (without <em>praṇava</em> ) is enjoined.&rdquo; In accordance with this, it has been stated further: &ldquo;The syllable a in the latter part of the word Nārāyaṇa (i.e.) ayana denotes <em>Viṣṇu</em>. If the nasal sound of the vowel m (anuswāra) at the end of the word ayanam be added to it, it becomes am and this &lsquo;a with the m becomes the germ (<em>bīja</em>) of mūlamantra. By this addition, the <em>mantra</em> comes to consist of eight letters.</p>
<p>Even without the <em>praṇava</em>, these adhikārīs (women and Śūdras) obtain the same fruit or goal and this may be seen from the following <em>śloka</em> - &ldquo;Of what use are many _mantra_s for the purpose of the fruit desired? Of what use are many vratas (ascetic observances )? The <em>mantra</em>, Namo Nārāyanāya, confers all the boons that may be desired&rdquo;. The a in am which has been prescribed as a substitute for praṇava (<em>aum</em>) should be considered as having, in brief, all the meaning contained in <em>praṇava</em>, because the syllable a being the first letter is stated (in the <em>śāstra</em>) to denote everything in a concise form. The meaning of the syllable u in the praňava, namely, &lsquo;only&rsquo; is inferred from the meaning. The ideas of knowership and the like contained in the third letter of <em>praṇava</em>, namely m should be understood as being present in the base of the second syllable of <em>namas</em> (or <em>namo</em>), namely m.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF PRAŅAVA AND ITS POTENCY:</p>
<p>When the <em>praṇava</em> is used as an independent <em>mantra</em> by itself, it may be pronounced in a single unit or instant of time (mātra), or two units of time, or three or three and a half units of time and its meanings vary in accordance with these units of time to denote either <em>Brahman</em> as effect ( kārya ) or <em>Brahman</em> as cause ( kāraṇa): (i. e.) when it is pronounced in a single unit of time, it means <em>Brahman</em> with the earth as His body; when in two units, it means, <em>Brahman</em> with the antariksha (the middle air or sky) as His body: when in three units, it means <em>Brahman</em> with the world of <em>svarga</em> as His body; when in three and a half units of time, it denotes <em>Brahman</em> the Pure and the ultimate cause (of every thing). In some _śāstra_s it is said that, when the <em>praṇava</em> begins any of the three vyāpaka _mantra_s, it should be considered as a single syllable (without any parts as a-u- m) and as denoting then the Supreme Self.</p>
<p><em>Praṇava</em> or the Veda consistiog of three letters, existed at the beginning, and the three Vedas, Rik, Yajus, and Sāman were within it (in a, u and m respectively). It should be kept as a secret. It is a Veda with three letters and is different from the other Vedas. He who knows the <em>praṇava</em> is a Vedavit (one who knows the Veda or the three Vedas).&rdquo; The greatness and glory of <em>praṇava</em> are well known from such passages as the above. In the nyāsa_vidyā_, the <em>praṇava</em> is an independent <em>mantra</em> and refers to the surrender of the self, for it has been said: “The <em>havis</em> or offering called the self should be taken with the <em>mantra</em> beginning <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> vasuranya and offered in the eternal fire called Acyuta with the <em>mantra</em> called <em>praṇava</em>&quot;. For the same reason some construe it even here as denoting surrender. Others construe that the <em>praṇava</em> should be considered in the Tiru_mantra_ only as helping to realise one&rsquo;s being <em>śeṣa</em> (to the Lord), since primarily it gives knowledge of the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of the <em>jīva</em> being <em>śeṣa</em>, If so, it contributes a qualification or element of competence for the <em>upāya</em> (viz. praying for protection).</p>
<p>It has been said :-&ldquo;By a knowledge of <em>Iśvara</em>, the devont <em>jīva</em> attains supreme purity&rdquo;. When we consider <em>praṇava</em> as giving only a knowledge of the <em>śeṣī</em> (<em>Bhagavān</em>), &lsquo;supreme purity&rsquo; would mean that it removes the unfitness of the <em>jīva</em> for the adoption of the <em>upāya</em>. When we consider <em>praṇava</em> as indicating a kpowledge of the <em>upāya</em>, namely, <em>Bhagavān</em>, (and not the knowledge of the seshi), &lsquo;supreme purity&rsquo; would mean <em>mokṣa</em>. <em>Bhagavān</em> Śāṇḍilya explained, as follows, the way in which the meaning of <em>praṇava</em> should be considered:- &ldquo;This Supreme Being is of such and such a nature and the <em>jīva</em> is of such and such a nature. Yoga is said to be a knowledge of the relationship between the two (that <em>Iśvara</em> is the seshi and the <em>jīva</em> the <em>śeṣa</em> )&rdquo;. This meaning has been elaborated as follows:-&ldquo;the a (in*<em>praṇava</em>) is <em>Viṣṇu</em> who creates, sustains and destroys the world, the m (in it) means the <em>jīva</em>, who exists for the fulfiment of the purposes of <em>Viṣṇu</em>. The u (in it) indicates that this relationship between the two can exist only between them (and no others). So <em>praṇava</em> which consists of three letters and is the essence of the (three) Vedas reveals this meaning.&rdquo; The Tamil verse which says, &ldquo;I am the &ldquo;servant of <em>Bhagavān</em>, the Lord of Tirukkannapuram; how am I entitled to be the servant of anyone else ?&rdquo; - this Tamil verse also explains the meaning of <em>praṇava</em>. The _śrut_is and the _smṛti_s describe the three letters of <em>praṇava</em> as the essence of the three Vedas.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF A IN <em>PRAṆAVA</em>:</p>
<p>That these letters have these meanings will be seen from the following passage in Vamana purāna : -&lsquo;By the first letter a in the <em>praṇava</em>, which is one of the members or limbs of the <em>mantra</em> with eight letters, <em>Bhagavān</em>, who is the support of everything, is denoted; the letter a is the origin of all words and <em>Brahman</em> is the origin of all things denoted by these words.</p>
<p>Therefore a denotes <em>Bhagavān</em>. He is denoted by that letter. This relationship between the letter a and <em>Bhagavān</em> is seen from the meaning to be appropriate.&rdquo; <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> stated in the Vedārthasangraha that by the first letter (of <em>praṇava</em>) which is the origin of all words is denoted Nārāyaṇa who is the origin of all things denoted by these words. From this it follows that Bhaga van is the material and the instrumental cause of the whole world and that, as may be inferred from this, He is both omniscient and omnipotent and has other such qualities. &ldquo;a means  negation (No) and when masculine denotes <em>Viṣṇu</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;The letter a denotes <em>Viṣṇu</em>&rdquo;; &quot; By using the letter a, which is the first name of Nārāyaṇa, what (an excellent) benedictory prayer has been made !&quot; All this is evident from the Nighantus and the usage of scholars.</p>
<p>When this a denotes the Supreme Ruler, it is derived, according to the science of grammar, from the verbal root ava which means to protect, to please etc., (the termination va is dropped) and the word that results refers to one who is a protector and so on (one who pleases). Though this root has many meanings, its best-known meaning is to protect; further it is this meaning which is required here (in connection with the <em>mantra</em> &lsquo;<em>aum</em>&rsquo;); besides there is no authoritative etymological explanation that it should be considered as having many meanings; so the first meaning given (in grammar), namely, to protect is the direct and primary meaning of the word and the other meanings, when required, should be considered as suggested (lukshaņā) by the primary meaning. This is the appropriate way of explaining and the ācāryas have commented on it only in this way as meaning the Protector or Saviour. As the meaning &lsquo;protector&rsquo; is not restricted by any limiting adjunct, the protectorship extends to all. The manner of protection varies with the objects of protection as shown by the pramāņas (sources of knowledge). Since the protection is not stated to be based on any reason or condition, it might appear to be unconditioned (nirupādhika) but <em>Iśvara</em>, who is omnipotent and independent, expects some <em>vyāja</em> or action prescribed by His will to be performed by the <em>jīva</em>, which would serve as a justification for conferring <em>mokṣa</em> and the like on those who are in <em>samsāra</em>. Towards the _nitya_s ( the eternal süris) and those who have already attained <em>mukti</em>, the protection is full and complete by way of maintaining what is already present and this is the result of <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s natural and unconditioned mercy. But this natural mercy (karunya) is restrained in the case of those in <em>samsāra</em> by the condition (upādhi) of the need for punishment which has arisen by beginningless offence when actions which are displeasing to Him have occurred. <em>Prapatti</em> and other _vyāja_s have been prescribed in the _Śāstra_s only for removing this condition which acts as a restraining force (on the Lord&rsquo;s (mercy).</p>

</details>
<p>The fact of being the Master makes it appropriate that He should proteot; <em>prapatti</em> and the like are (only) secondary helps.The primary reason (for protecting) is the Omnipresent Lord&rsquo;s mercy which is not dependent upon anything else.</p>
<p>As stated in the <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;In all siddhāntas and in Vedanta, it is declared that the Lord protects with His consort <em>Lakṣmī</em>, ever by His side, for she is the very embodiment of mercy&rdquo;, the Lord who has determined to grant redemption to all is ever ready (to do so) with His consort. The relationship with His spouse for the purpose of protection, which is evident from the pramāņas is derived (not explicitly from the words but) by inference from the purpose (of protection) which is evident from the <em>pramāṇa_s. Whenever <em>Bhagavān</em> is referred to, <em>Lakṣmī</em> should also be considered as referred to, for it results from the principle:- &ldquo;If two things are enjoined as necessary, wherever one of them is mentioned, the other should also be considered as indicated” (Sanniyogasiṣṭanyāya). Thus the ācāryas, too, have said, “Since Thou(<em>Lakṣmī</em>) art ever inseparably connected with Thy Lord, even the Veda does not mention Thee separately.&rdquo; In all vidyās or forms of meditation (prescribed in the Upaniṣads) all qualities and attributes of <em>Brahman</em> which define His Nature are to be meditated upon (even though only one or two of them are actually mentioned in the particular <em>Vidyā</em>). Similarly this attribute, Namely, <em>Lakṣmī</em>, who is the most important of all attributes should also be borne in mind. It is this attribute (<em>Lakṣmī</em>) which rules out other deities, (for they are not related to <em>Lakṣmī</em> in that way) and defines <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s essential nature which is not dependent upon anything else, as having an excellence which surpasses everything else, His essential nature, form and glories, which do not arise from any other source, acquire even greater splendour from the essential nature, form and glories of <em>Lakṣmī</em>, who is His attribute, and shine thereby. This may be seen in the simile; &ldquo;like radiance which cannot be separated from the sun.&rdquo; And this has been declared by the great sages who understood the nature and person of the Supreme Deity. So also in the word Nārāyaṇa in Tiru_mantra</em>, Nārāyaṇa&rsquo;s relationship to His consort should be borne in mind. This relationship to the spouse is distinctly and explicitly stated in the <em>Dvaya</em> (_Śrī_mat - with <em>Śrī</em>). In <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s elaboration of the <em>Dvaya</em> in his <em>Gadya</em><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> , it is true that, among the nārās in the words beginning with <em>Bhagavān</em> Nārāyaṇa (Nārānām + ayanam) <em>Lakṣmī</em> is included among the nāras by commentators. (From this it might be argued that she is also a <em>jīva</em> like other nāras). But this inclusion is only to indicate Her dependence on Her Lord and Nāras means etymologically only “those who are related to Nara&quot; without the specification of the form of relationship. So from that, it should not be inferred that <em>Lakṣmī</em> is also a <em>jīva</em>.</p>
<p>Here the first letter a is in the dative or fourth case singular, the (usual) dative singular suffix has been dropped. The reasons for holding that the a is in the dative singular (when no case - suffix is seen ) are as follows: (1) In the place which enjoins the surrender of the self to the Supreme Self (i.e.) the Taittirīya Upaniṣad, the <em>praṇava</em> is prescribed as the <em>mantra</em> (for doing so); (so it should mean &rsquo;to the Supreme Self (dative)&rsquo;, (2) the <em>mantra</em> should reveal the nature of the action to be performed, (3) the self to be surrendered is seen in the third letter (m) (in <em>aum</em>) and the Supreme Brahman for whom it is surrendered is seen in the base (<em>prakṛti</em>, viz. a) of the first letter; (4) the person to whom the surrender is made and the object which is surrendered should not be in the same case. Therefore the a (which is the first letter) should be considered to be in the case (i.e.) (dative) suited to the word indicating the person to whom the surrender is made. The view of perverse interpreters (Advaitins) that a and the m (in <em>aum</em> are in the same case (nominative or first case ) and indicate the identity in the essential nature of the <em>jīva</em> and the Supreme Self is opposed to many <em>pramāṇa_s (like pratyaksha and sabda); besides it would not fit in with the natural and obvious meaning of the word <em>namo</em> (<em>namas</em>) and the dative of the word Nārāyaṇa (i.e.) Nārāyaṇāya which are uttered along with the <em>praṇava</em>, This is obvious also from the text twhich distinguishes <em>praṇava</em> as the bow, the self as the arrow, <em>Brahman</em> as the target and the act of surrender as the hitting of the target (the arrow and the target cannot be identical). In the <em>praṇava</em> in Tiru_mantra</em>, when the intention is the surrender of responsibility (<em>bharasamarpaṇam</em>), the dative or fourth case should be considered to have the same meaning as the dative in the <em>praṇava</em> considered as an independent <em>mantra</em> (i.e.) the person to whom the surrender is made. When the <em>praṇava</em> is interpreted as indicating the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of the self which consists in existing solely for the Supreme Self (i.e.) in being <em>śeṣa</em>, the dative signifies &lsquo;having another&rsquo;s interests alone as one&rsquo;s interests&rsquo;. Therefore it reveals the relationship of <em>śeṣa</em> and <em>śeṣī</em> which exists between the <em>jīva</em> and the Paramātmā. We should then bear in mind that we are unconditional _śeṣa_s (nirupādhika <em>śeṣa</em>) to the Supreme Self, who is the unconditional seshi (nirupādhika seshi).</p>
<p>When the Lord who is the Supreme Ruler says, “You are my <em>śeṣa</em>&quot; and pursues him, the <em>jīva</em>, owing to his egoism, tries to wriggle out saying, “ I exist only for myself.&quot; Therefore the thought that we are _śeṣa_s to the Supreme Ruler will give (spiritual) existence to the <em>jīva</em>, who is otherwise, as it were, (spiritually) non-existent. To indicate the importance of this thought that we are _śeṣa_s), the relationship to the <em>śeṣī</em> (for a) is declared even before the mention of the <em>śeṣa</em> (namely m the <em>jīva</em>).</p>

<p>When the relationship of our being _śeṣa_s to the Supreme Being is well established in the mind, the other requisities (for spiritual life) such as self-control and serenity (sama and dama) follow easily as being necessary to it. When that thought is not established in the mind, all the rest serve no purpose and are, as it were, non-existent.</p>
<p>When <em>Iśvara</em> is the <em>śeṣī</em> of all, He is always (to be thought of as) with His Consort, for it has been said, “The two kinds of glory (<em>nityavibhūti</em> and <em>līlā</em> - <em>vibhūti</em>) are <em>śeṣa</em> to me and to her, O <em>Brahma</em> and this is declared in the Vedanta and in my _śāstra_s (Pancharātra āgamas).&quot; So also it is said &ldquo;Being seshi is single and it rests with two (<em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Lakṣmī</em>).” In the Agnisho miya sacrifice, the deity (to whom the <em>havis</em> or offering is made) is not Agni alone not Soma alone; the deity of the sacrifice (which is single) is Agni and Soma. So also in this offering of the self, the deity to whom the offering is intended is both (<em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Lakṣmī</em>). In order to reveal this, it was said “Being <em>śeṣī</em> is single and it rests with two&rdquo;. When we consider the <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> text<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>in the Kaṭha <em>śruti</em>, it becomes clear from the words themselves that the self is <em>śeṣa</em> to both. To be <em>śeṣa</em> is to serve the purposes of another without the primary desire to gain something for oneself.</p>
<p>The author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> has explained it as follows:-“ He is the <em>śeṣa</em> whose essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) has, for its sole interest, the promotion of the glory or excellence of another; the other is the <em>śeṣī</em>.&quot; The genitive dual case ending which is indicated by the Kaṭha <em>śruti</em> (their servant) is elliptical. The genitive or sixth case, which ordinarily indicates relationship in general, extends here to the special relationship of being <em>śeṣa</em> to <em>śeṣī</em> which is understood from the _pramāṇa_s. Or it may be considered that in order to make clear the relationship of existing only for them&rsquo;, (viz. <em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Lakṣmī</em>), the dative dual termination is present, though in ellipsis. If we take this view, the <em>śruti</em> which says &ldquo;the servant of both&rdquo; explains the meaning of the elliptical dative dual.</p>
<p>If we take this interpretation that the u refers to <em>Lakṣmī</em> and that the self is <em>śeṣa</em> to both (<em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Lakṣmī</em>) the ‘only’ formerly stated to be the meaning of u (in a u m) is not given by the word itself but is suggested by the context. It comes to this that this self (the <em>jīva</em>) is the unconditioned <em>śeṣa</em> to both <em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Lakṣmī</em> and to no other.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF U IN  AUM :</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, we take the middle letter u to mean &lsquo;only&rsquo; in accordance with Vedic usage, the meaning &lsquo;only&rsquo; is to prevent the doubts concerning the relationship of being <em>śeṣa</em> extending to any other (deity) unconditionally and this is done by the word itself (and is not merely suggested by the context). Since it declares that the relationship of being <em>śeṣa</em> to other deities than <em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Lakṣmī</em> does not pertain to one&rsquo;s essential nature, it follows that contact with other deities should not exist to the man who has a knowledge of the nature of his self, and this avoidance of contact extends even to the devotees of other deities. In the chapter on the Ultimate Object in Life, we have already stated that, since being <em>śeṣa</em> to Bhāgavatas is pleasing to the Lord, it does not constitute the offence of being <em>śeṣa</em> to others.</p>
<p>Thus if by the force of the word itself (namely u), we get the meaning that the relationship of being <em>śeṣa</em> is ruled out in the case of others, it is also evident that the idea of the relationship not existing (towards the Lord) is also ruled out, (since there is no limitation of time (i.e.) the self is always <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord and is never non-<em>śeṣa</em> to Him). By this ruling out of the non-existence of the relationship of <em>śeṣa</em>, the substance (dravya) called the sentient being&rsquo; is seen to be an attribute incapable of being separated from <em>Iśvara</em> (at any time or place) and is therefore shown to be his body, in the same way as non-septient matter is His body.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF M IN AUM:</p>
<p>The third letter m (in <em>aum</em>) denotes, primarily, the <em>jīva</em> but means also by implication (Upalakṣaṇa) all other things which are <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord. That this (m) denotes the <em>jīvātmā</em> may be understood from the following: (1) The letter m which denotes the <em>jīva</em> should be used to perform vyāpaka <em>nyāsa</em> (i.e. ) to perform <em>nyāsa</em> in one&rsquo;s body as if it pervades the whole body&quot;: (2) The five groups of consonants (in the Sanskrit alphabet) each containing five letters beginning with k (क) and ending with m(म) denote the twentyfive _tattva_s or reals as stated in the Tattvasagarasamhita and the like. The Supreme Ruler is always within these reals as their Inner Self” and (3) “The five* letters in the Ka (F) group denote the five elements (bhutani), those in the Cha (च) group denote the five senses of action (karmendriyās); those in the ta (ट) group denote the five senses of knowledge (jnanendriyas), those in the ta (त) group denote the five tanmatras (like smell) the pa (प) denotes the mind, the pha (फi) ahaṅkāra, ba (ब) denotes mahat and bha (भ) <em>prakṛti</em>. The _jīva_tma is denoted by the letter m and he is the twentyfifth <em>tattva</em> or real.&quot;</p>
<p>From these it is evident that the jivātma is different (both) from the twenty-four reals which have the defects of inertness and non-sentience and from the twenty-sixth Real, (namely, <em>Iśvara</em>) who is the (ultimate) cause of everything, the Saviour of all and the seshi of all and who is indicated by the first letter (in <em>aum</em>),</p>
<p>In the Tiru_mantra_, the words, and Nāra (in Nārāyaṇa), refer only to the attributes, namely, the <em>jīva</em> (and matter) as determinate words ( Niṣkarṣaka words)<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> and do not refer to the Supreme Self within the <em>jīva</em> (and matter).</p>
<p>If we examine the grammatical form of this letter (m), it is found to have been derived from the root mana meaning &rsquo;to know&rsquo; and other such roots (mas - meaning &lsquo;measure &lsquo;) and it denotes the jīvātmā who is atomic and who is of the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of <em>jñāna</em> and (at the same time) possessed of the attribute, <em>jñāna</em>. This is in accordance with the <em>Brahma</em> <em>Sūtra</em> (2-3-19), which says &quot; The jīvātmā is a knower (i.e.) he possesses the attribute &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; (and is not merely <em>jñāna</em> or knowledge as the Advaitins contend) and this is from the śruti itself&quot;.</p>
<p>Though the <em>jīvātmā</em> is said to be, in general terms, of the essential nature of knowledge, yet since this essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) is known from the _pramāṇa_s (sabda and the like) to be agreeable and pleasing, it is also of the essential nature of <em>ānanda</em> or bliss which is a specific form of knowledge.</p>
<p>When the _jīva_tma is said to be possessed of the attribute, knowledge, since the _pramāṇa_s declare him to be possessed of knowledge without any restrictive word, it should be understood that in the state of <em>mukti</em>, his knowledge is all-pervasive and got limited by conditions (or upadhi) and without any restriction or limit.</p>
<p>When we consider this natural and pure form of the jivātma, it will appear that it is free from the inertness and other such defects of nonsentient things and so also from such things as pain, suffering etc., which are found in <em>samsāra</em>. Hence in the essential nature and the attributes (<em>svarūpa</em> and <em>dharma</em>) of the jivātmā, there is also spotlessness or freedom from all impurity or defect (nirmalatva). The seeker after salvation should meditate that the jīvātmā is absolutely pure and has its enjoyment only in being <em>śeṣa</em> to the Supreme Being and this may be seen from the <em>Brahma</em> <em>Sūtra</em> (3-3-52) which says: &ldquo;No, only the state (of the jivātmā) that differs from the state of <em>samsāra</em> (should be meditated upon), for that is the state which will ensue (in <em>mokṣa</em>) as in the contemplation of <em>Brahman</em> as He is &ldquo;.</p>
<p>To the <em>prapanna</em>, the meditation on the fruit of attainment in <em>mukti</em> is useful in creating a desire for that fruit. The forms of meditation (concerning the form of the self) are different in accordance with the difference in the fruits desired and this is evident from the eighth chapter of the Gita and <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> and other such treatises.</p>
<p>Since the _pramāṇa_s declare a plurality (or very large number) of souls, this third letter m (in <em>aum</em>), used in the singular, denotes the <em>jāti</em> or genus (and not a single individual), as in the <em>Brahma</em> <em>Sūtra</em> (2-3.18) which says. The soul (or self) is not (generated) for (so says) the <em>Śruti</em>.&rsquo; (Here the word &rsquo; soul&rsquo; denotes the genus and therefore it really means &rsquo; souls&rsquo; (or self&rsquo;s).</p>
<p>Though it is stated here that all souls are _śeṣa_s to <em>Bhagavān</em> in general terms as in: &ndash;&ldquo;All souls are the servants of the Supreme Self by their very nature&rdquo; &ndash; yet since the individual is also included in the all souls,&rsquo; it follows that for that reason, every one should realise that he is also the servant of the Lord.</p>
<p>Here the knowledge of being a <em>śeṣa</em>, the abandonment of the conceit of one&rsquo;s independence (of the Lord), the adoption of the particular <em>upāya</em> (namely, <em>prapatti</em>) and the prayer for the fruit to be attained, namely, the service of a <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord have all to arise in the individual; therefore the individual is the principal (figure). So some _ācārya_s say that the word <em>aham</em> (I) should be taken as understood and as being the substantive to which the m (which means the <em>jīva</em>) is the adjective &ldquo;I who am a <em>jīva</em>&rdquo;. In that case, as stated also in _śloka_s which elaborate the <em>praṇava</em>, &ldquo;Whatever is mine and I myself are Thine, O Lord, Madhava! I am well aware of this &ldquo;; since attributes always follow the principal (or the substantive), the qualities and attributes are also intended by implication (Upalakṣaṇa), (2) Other _ācārya_s hold that the third letter itself (m) shows the <em>aham</em> (or I) by dropping, in the word (asmat=I) of the first part as and the latter part at and retaining only the consonant m in the middle, in accordance with Vedic usage. In <em>Nyāsa</em> <em>vidyā</em> (as described in the Taittiriya upanishad) which enjoins the offering of the self as an oblation to the Supreme Being, the <em>praṇava</em> is called the <em>mantra</em> (for it). In order that the action to be performed may be made clear, the actual words indicating the Supreme Self and the individual self should be expressed and not remain merely implicit. Since according to the <em>pramāṇa_s, the first letter (a) denotes the person to whom the surrender is made and the middle letter (u) has some other meaning (either only or <em>Lakṣmī</em>), by the law of what remains (pāriseshya) the third letter (m) should indicate the oblation, namely, the individual self that is to be offered. Therefore it is appropriate to hold that this (third) letter should mean <em>aham</em> (or I). Therefore it is that Bhattar commented on the <em>praṇava</em> in Tiru_mantra</em> as follows:- &ldquo;I exist only as the property for <em>Bhagavān</em> who is indicated by the letter a&rdquo;.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF NAMAS OR NAMO IN TIRU_MANTRA_:</p>
<p>So also the ma in <em>namas</em> (<em>namo</em>) denotes the individual self in any one of the three ways indicated before (1) 25th <em>tattva</em> (2) the knowing self and (3) short for <em>aham</em>. This ma is in the genitive or sixth case ending, and the na (which precedes it) means negation &rsquo;no&rsquo; or &rsquo;not&rsquo;. So it is equivalent to na mama (not mine). The negation na (not) is placed first to indicate its greater importance as in the sentence drishtā Sītā (seen was Sītā). The genitive case in ma is a mark of relationship in general (sambandha sāmanya) and implies (here) the particular form of relationship (that of a <em>śeṣa</em> to the <em>śeṣī</em>). It is with this idea indeed that Bhattar said, &quot; I do not then exist for myself.” The idea contained in this <em>namas</em> which has the same purport as the ‘only’ of the middle letter u in <em>praṇava</em>&ndash;for all sentences should be considered as expressive of exclusive affirmation (avadharana) - this idea is of the greatest importance, and it is said in such _śloka_s as the following:- &quot; The cause of <em>samsāra</em> (bondage) is the two letters mama (mine) and the cause of attaining the eternal <em>Brahman</em> is the sentence having three letters na mama (I am) not mine).&rdquo; The idea of the following <em>śloka</em> has also the same porport as this <em>namas</em>:-&ldquo;All that is crooked is the cause of <em>samsāra</em>; all that is straight is the cause that effects the attainment of <em>Brahman</em>&rdquo;. (Here the idea that we exist for _Bhagavān_i is straight and the idea that we exist for ourselves is crooked.)</p>
<p>If it is asked “What is it that is not mine (na mama)?&rdquo;, the answer is found supplied by the context (anush_aṅga_) viz., the third letter in <em>praṇava</em> and is as follows :</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not belong to myself&rdquo;. In the chapter on <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> anush_aṅga_(The Context) it is evident that the meaning indicated by the context (anush_aṅga_) is more appropriate than the meaning arrived at by the insertion of a new word (adhyāhara).- Here na mama <em>aham</em> &ldquo;I am not mine&rdquo; specifies that I am not mine. As the middle letter (in <em>praṇava</em> ) namely only, has already stated that I exist only for <em>Iśvara</em>, which negates _śeṣa_tva to others, this specification in <em>namas</em> indicates that in others oneself is also included. By the principle illustrated in  go-balīvarda<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
<p>(The specification is to show the negation of oneself in special as not having been included in the ‘others&rsquo; stated in the middle letter).</p>
<p>Aham na mama (&ldquo;I am not mine&rdquo;) is the sentence in <em>namas</em>. From this it becoms clear that even one&rsquo;s <em>svarūpa</em> (essential nature) does not belong to oneself. Since attributes and qualities always follow the principal or substantive, it is tantamount to saying, specially, that one is not the unconditioned master of anything (belonging to one). This is the purpose of the specification,</p>
<p>If we do not take the word <em>aham</em> from the context (anush_aṅga_) and accept the interpretation given above, it would mean that the general misapprehension that certain things (for example, our body and our qualities) really belong to us will be taken away from one&rsquo;s self.</p>
<p>Thus <em>namas</em> dispels one&rsquo;s conceit (abhimāna) about oneself and about those which appear to be one&rsquo;s by stating that they do not belong to one and the root causes of <em>samsāra</em>, namely the notions of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;mine&rsquo; which are false, are thereby removed. The conceit (ahamkāra) which is thus removed is a form of illusory knowledge. The word ahamkāra is used also to mean one of the twenty-four reals (tattvas), but that ahamkāra is not capable of being removed by mere intelligence. It persists with the <em>jīva</em> until its separation from the subtle body (sīkshma <em>śarīra</em>). Though this connection with the non-sentient <em>tattva</em> (real) called ahankāra continues to exist, its effects in the form of the disease of conceit (abhimana) and the like which are illusory are cured by medicine in the forın of discrimination (viveka) resulting from such things as the mūlamantra.</p>
<p>Since, from the middle letter of <em>praṇava</em>, the notion that one is <em>śeṣa</em> to any other than the Lord is got rid of, there is no need to state separately that one is not <em>śeṣa</em> to oneself. Therefore the purport may also be to show that the person to whom certain things appear to be <em>śeṣa</em> and who appears to be <em>śeṣī</em> is not the unconditioned master or <em>śeṣī</em> of any of these things. All those things that are <em>śeṣa</em> to the <em>jīva</em> (like his body, his attributes, his wealth etc.) are indeed those that were given to him for His own purposes by the Supreme: Ruler, who is the <em>śeṣī</em> of all.</p>
<p>Those qualities and the like of the _jīva_s which are eternal have become theirs by the eternal will of <em>Iśvara</em>. The transitory bodies and the like which are theirs in the impure state (<em>samsāra</em>) and in the pure state (after <em>mukti</em> when they might take bodies for some purpose or other)&ndash;these result from the transitory will of <em>Iśvara</em> as the effect of past <em>karma</em>  (in the case of the former) and without any relation to <em>karma</em> (in the case of the latter).</p>
<p>The <em>praṇava</em> states that the <em>jīva</em> is <em>śeṣa</em> to none other (than <em>Bhagavān</em>). So it becomes evident that he is not <em>śeṣa</em> even to himself as he is other than <em>Bhagavān</em>; it follows from this that, in the same way as he is <em>śeṣa</em> to nobody else (than <em>Bhagavān</em>), no other thing is unconditionally <em>śeṣa</em> to him. This does not appear in the <em>praṇava</em>. Therefore this may be the purport of the <em>namas</em> that the <em>jīva</em> is in no way independent (i.e.) that he has no svatantryam). In that case, taking from the context (anush_aṅga_) the m in <em>praṇava</em>, it would give the meaning &ldquo;I am not capable of maintaining or looking after myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is also possible to understaod (adhyāhara), the word svatantrya (independence) after na mama. It would then read na mama svātantryam (I have no independence). The absence of independence in the case of the sentient being is the inability to act independently (of the Lord) (i.e.) without His help. This is because, though in the state of bondage and in the state of release, he acts in accordance with his own mind, he can act only with such things as the senses given by <em>Iśvara</em> and by His stimulation and with His help.</p>
<p>The protectorship of all, indicated by the base (<em>prakṛti</em>) (viz) a in the first letter of <em>praṇava</em>, ensues, in the case of those who adopt an <em>upāya</em>, only by stimulating them to the adoption of any one of the _upāya_s. Though the <em>jīva</em> adopts the <em>upāya</em>, since his activity is dependent on the Lord and since the one who affords protection by granting the fruit (of the <em>upāya</em>) is the Supreme Ruler who is gracious, it is only His protectorship of all indicated in the base of the first letter (of <em>praṇava</em>) that is confirmed by this <em>namas</em>. Similarly <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s being the unconditional <em>śeṣī</em> of all which is stated by the dative case (fourth case) of the first letter a in the <em>praṇava</em> (where the case ending has been dropped) &ndash; this is confirmed by the interpretation suggested before, which denies unconditioned seshitvam to the <em>jīva</em>. As declared in the <em>Brahma</em> <em>Sūtra</em> (2-3-40), “The doership of the <em>jīva</em> is due to the Supreme Being as stated in the <em>Śruti</em> &ldquo;, the independence that the <em>jīva</em> seems to possess is granted to him in the execution of His own purposes by the Supreme Being who is the unconditioned <em>śeṣī</em> of all. The <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s being seshi to other things is also due to its being given to him by the unconditioned seshi for the fulfilment of His own purposes. To sum up</p>

<p>The Lord of <em>Śrī</em> is (alone) independent in all things and is (alune) the Master (of all) without being dependent on any one else. Independence without any dependence for help on others and mastership belong to no one else.</p>
<p>This gist of the <em>praṇava</em> and of the <em>namas</em> has been taught to us by (our) üchāryas, in order that we may have the competence (for <em>prapatti</em>), namely, such as having the Lord alone as our refuge.</p>
<p>In ordinary life, being master over others and being inde pendent of others are considered desirable, and being a servant and being dependent on others are considered undesirable. This is merely due to past <em>karma</em>  as a conditioning factor (upādhi). But here (in spiritual life), being a servant (of the Lord) and being dependent (on the Lord) are agreeable to those who have a know ledge of the truth, for they are appropriate and natural to our <em>svarūpa</em> (essential nature), as stated in such passages as the following: &ldquo;We are all, by  nature, His servants&rdquo;. Thus it becomes evident that the <em>jīva</em> exists solely for another (<em>Iśvara</em>) and is entirely dependent on Him. So the <em>jīva</em> may rightly be employed to do what is pleasing to the <em>śeṣī</em>, who alone is independent (and omnipotent). Therefore it follows that the <em>jīva</em> should be <em>śeṣa</em> (and render service) to His devotees, as stated.( in the Tamil verse) ;-&rdquo; The Lord who is absolutely pure, has made me the servant of His servants&rdquo;. If the Lord who is the <em>śeṣī</em>, and who is independent (and all powerful) is pleased to make us _śeṣa_s to His good devotees, it cannot be called improper or inappropriate; nor can it be avoided (or resisted). Since He is <em>śeṣī</em>, He has a right to employ us in whatever He desires, and since He is all powerful, He can enforce it. This idea may also be seen in the (Tamil) verse :- &ldquo;I will never&rdquo; associate with those who think that there is any deity other than Thee. But gladly do I accept (the privilege of) being servant to Thy devotees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Being <em>śeṣa</em> to His devotees results to the Supreme Ruler from His own desire; but to us, it is a consequence of our being dependent on Him. (Sometimes) even to us, it may come as a consequence of our own desire, for to one who appreciates the worth of (virtuous) qualities, a desire to serve may arise towards those who are great by their virtues. Thus service may be done owing to an appreciation of (noble) qualities, like the service of Lakṣmaṇa to <em>Śrī</em> Rāma. The omnipotent Lord has Himself said. &ldquo;I [<em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s words] render service to those who are my kinsmen by virtue of my being independent. I give one half (of what I have) to my kinsfolk and enjoy the other half. I forgive also harsh words (employed) by them towards me &ldquo;. Thus by virtue of these words of His, He has willed that we should be _śeṣa_s to Himself and to His devotees. It has already been shown (in the chapter on the extreme limit of the ultimate goal of life) that the service rendered as _śeṣa_s by the devotees to one another is due to the will of the omni-potent Lord and is appropriate in different ways (in exalting others and in being exalted by them).</p>
<p>Since the <em>jīva</em> who is thus (<em>akiñcana</em>) destitute (of any <em>upāya_s) has to receive the desired object from the independent <em>śeṣī</em> in accordance with His will, the prayer for protection (saranavaranam) which is explicitly stated in <em>Dvaya</em> and the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em> for winning His favour is necessary and it is here implicit, in <em>namas</em> of the Tiru_mantra</em>. Since the surrender of the self and the prayer for protection are inseparable, the word which denotes either denotes also the other and is intended to express both. The word <em>namas</em> is itself (often) employed to stand for the prayer for protection, as may be seen from the following _śloka_s: &ldquo;The deity with eyes broad like lotuses that was seen by me before - He has now become (incarnate as) your relative viz. <em>Janārdana</em>, the tiger among men&rdquo;. &ldquo;Madhava&rdquo; is both the father and the mother of the whole world. Seek His protection, O best among men, for He is capable of protecting (you).&rdquo; &quot; When Markandeya gave them this advice, the three sons of Kunti and the twins, O best of the Bharatas, made namaskāra to <em>Janārdana</em> along with Droupadi &ldquo;, so also in the episode of Damayanti (we find the following); &ldquo;She considered that the time had come to seek refuge of the gods. So she made namaskara with (all) her speech and (all) her mind.&rdquo; (Since <em>namas</em> has been used to signify the prayer for protection ), it indicates that the responsibility for protecting oneself is not of the <em>jīva</em> (na mama bharah), where the word bharah (the burden of responsibility) is understood. Thus its purport may also be the surrender of responsibility. That the word <em>namas</em> indicates the surrender of self (atna samarpanam) is also wellknown from the following _śloka_s : &ldquo;Of all yajnas which&rsquo;s are performed with samit and such like as an aid, the man who has surrendered his self (ātma samarpana) to <em>Bhagavān</em> with the word <em>namas</em> is said to have performed the best Yajna,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I bow to <em>Bhagavān</em>, for <em>namas</em> (bowing) or atma samarpaņam to Him enables a man to get rid of his suffering and enjoy whatever he wants &ldquo;.</p>
<p>That the word <em>namas</em> has these meanings, viz., “I do not belong to myself; nor is any activity of mine <em>śeṣa</em> to me; all these are <em>śeṣa</em> only to <em>Bhagavān</em>,&rdquo; is stated in the section on the namaskāra in Nirukti.</p>
<p>THE THREE MEANINGS OF NAMAS:</p>
<p>Sthula, Sukshma and <em>Para</em> :</p>
<p>Ahirbhudnya (Siva) commented on the word <em>namas</em> as having three different meanings : a gross meaning (sthūlārtha) a subtle meaning (suīkshmārtha), and a supreme meaning (para), in the following _śloka_s :</p>
<p>I. STHULĀRTHA :</p>
<p>(8) The act of an intelligent man bowing his body, of his own accord, before another who is higher (without expecting any gain fron it) is called <em>namas</em>. In the _śāstra_s, all sentient beings are spoken of as belonging to two classes, the higher (Jyāyān), and the lower (ajyāyān). There is no one other than these. The primary meaning of the higher being&rsquo; is He who has superior excellence both in time and (place) and in attributes. <em>Bhagavān</em> is present at all times and in all places and possesses also qualities that are beyond (all) measure. So He alone is the higher (Jyāyan). All sentient beings other than He are lower (ajyāyān). The relation between these two, the higher and the lower, is that He is the <em>śeṣī</em> and the others (who are lower) are _śeṣa_s (to Him). The higher is only One; all the rest are lower and the relation between these two consists in this, that He is bowed to and that the others bow to Him. He who is bowed to is called the higher and the <em>śeṣī</em>; the others who are _śeṣa_s are said to be those who bow ( to him). The relation between them and Him is not on account of any gain (expected by them); this relation between the higher and the lower is due to their nature, when the sentient being bows to the Higher Person without expecting any gain and with a certain feeling; that feeling is called nanana ( bowing) (b) Namanam (bowing ) consists in the thought: &ldquo;<em>Bhagavān</em> is always my seshī and I am always his <em>śeṣa</em>,&rdquo; for it is this thought that is the cause of the bowing (of the body). This bowing makes <em>Bhagavān</em> bend in favour to the man who bows (i.c.) it makes <em>Bhagavān</em> grant to the man who bows whatever is desired by him. This is certain. <em>Bhagavān</em>, who is higher, observes the bowing of the man who is lower and bends (is inclined) (to do him grace). Since it makes <em>Bhagavān</em> bend in favour, this action is called <em>namas</em>: (c) Uttering the word <em>namas</em> with speech, having this <em>namas</em> in mind and bowing with the body&ndash;this is <em>namas</em> in its perfection (<em>śaraṇāgati</em>) and what is different from it in being defective in one or other of the three aspects is called defective <em>namas</em>. This is perfect <em>prapatti</em> (as <em>aṅgī</em>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you its accessories or _aṅga_s in their perfection : Listen. &ldquo;The <em>prapatti</em> that I perform to <em>Bhagavān</em>, the Supreme Being, is itself my eternal fruit. I desire no other fruit.&rdquo; To have this (thought) is the best of accessories (_aṅga_s). The desire for (other) fruit or gain is opposed to this <em>aṅga</em>. <em>Ākiñcanya</em> or being destitute is the condition of being without the knowledge or the ability to perform <em>bhakti</em> . This state of destitution is due to false notions (vāsanas) that have been persisting in the mind from beginningless time and to the man&rsquo;s being by nature without independence. It is due also to the mind being covered by the impurities of desire and hatred (rāga and dvesha). The external manifestation of this teeling of helplessness is called kārparyam and it is the second <em>aṅga</em>. The thought that one is independent and could act of one&rsquo;s own accord is opposed to this. The third <em>aṅga</em> is the thought that, though <em>Bhagavān</em> is the Supreme Being, He is merciful to all creatures and is ever bent on showing His grace to them. This is called mahavis&rsquo;vāsa or intense faith and the thought that <em>Bhagavān</em> will reward or pupish according to one&rsquo;s <em>karma</em>  and will (therefore) be indifferent towards one-this thought is opposed to intense faith. The fourth <em>aṅga</em> is the thought that <em>Bhagavān</em> is all-powerful and can protect us and the prayer (resulting from it) for protection. This would arise if we give up the thought that <em>Bhagavān</em>, though merciful, is wanting in the ability to protect us. The obstacle to this <em>aṅga</em> is the thought that He would be indifferent to us as He is without the quality of goodness. The fifth <em>aṅga</em> is called the avoidance of what is disagreeable (to <em>Bhagavān</em>). It consists in avoiding actions which would be against the will of the Master, The obstacle to this is doiog what is for bidden in the śāstras. The sixth <em>aṅga</em> is the determination to do good to all creatures in as much as all creatures-both those that move and those that do not move&ndash;are His body. Doing what is harmful to them is opposed to this. Thus have I explained to you namana (or s&rsquo;aranāgati) which consists of the _aṅga_s and the upāngas<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> which mean avoiding what is opposed to them. This is the gross (<em>sthūla</em>) meaniog of the word <em>namas</em>.</p>
<p>II. THE SUBTLE MEANING - SUKSHMĀRTHA:</p>
<p>Learn (now) the subtle meaning - (sukshmārtha). Whenever the sentient being considers himself and what is connected with him as his own, the two letters ma, and ma in mama (mine) signify the notion of mine&rsquo; or <em>mamakāra</em>. The thought regarding oneself and those things that are connected with one that one is independent and that these things belong to oneself - this thought has arisen from the false notion which has grown in strength owing to wrong impressions (vāsanas) which are from time immemorial (beginningless ). This notion can be countered by the right thought viz., me na (These are not mine). The meaning of me na is, “I am not independent. I am not <em>śeṣa</em> to myself (but to God). (My) body and other things are not mine; they are _śeṣa_s to the Supreme Being.&rdquo; By this right understanding, those false thoughts that they belong to oneself disappear, Owing to those false thoughts that have arisen from false impressions (vāsanas ), which are from time immemorial (anadi) and which have grown in strength by notions opposed to the true nature of things, (we think as follows ):- &ldquo;I am independent: these things are mine.&rdquo; This thought is got rid of by the word <em>namas</em> uttered by the man performing <em>prapatti</em> with the right understanding that <em>Bhagavān</em> (<em>Viṣṇu</em>) is the inner self or soul of all. Thus has the subtle meaning been explained,</p>
<p>III. THE SUPREME MEANING: (parārtha):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen now to the supreme meaning (para), which is different (from what has been said before). The syllable na indicates the <em>upāya</em> (or endeavour): ma indicates that it is principal or all - important and the visarga (final aspirate) vis., S (in <em>namas</em>) means <em>Bhagavān</em>. This is the meaning obtained from that word (<em>namas</em>):-&ldquo;In order to attain <em>Bhagavān</em>, who is eternal and who is the highest ruler, who is omnipotent and is called <em>Puruṣottama</em> - (in order to attain Him), <em>Bhagavān</em> is Himself the principal means called namana, Thus have I explained to you the three meanings of <em>namas</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo; Since, in the above, it is stated that only the Sapreme <em>śeṣī</em> should be bowed to or sought as refuge, it is evident and appropriate that the Being to whom <em>namas</em> is due is the Supreme <em>śeṣī</em>. In order to make it clear who this Supreme Seshī is, the specific name (<em>Bhagavān</em>) is given. In one of the _śloka_s quoted before,it is said, &ldquo;Doing what is forbidden by the _śāstra_s is opposed to this (avoiding what is disagreeable to Him)&rdquo;, and so also &ldquo;Doing evil to other creatures is opposed to this doing what is pleasing to Him). The gist of these sentences is that, if at the time of performing <em>prapatti</em>, there occurs an act which is deliberate and is disagreeable (to the Lord), there are absent the determination to do what is pleasing (to Him) and also such things as the abstinence in thought from doing what is disagreeable (to Him). If, after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, the man deliberately does what is disagreeable (to Him), he acts in a manner which is opposed to the command of <em>Bhagavān</em>, whom he sought with eagerness (while performing <em>prapatti</em>).</p>
<p>In the _śloka_s cited above, the gross meaning (sthūlārtha) is that which appears obvious from etymological derivation according to grammar. The subtle meaning (sūkshmārtha) is that which appears from interpretation based on the similarity of syllables on the strength of Nirukta. The supreme meaning (parārtha) is that which is explained in the secret _śāstra_s (i.e.) _śāstra_s which comment on the meaning of the secret _mantra_s with the help of the conventions regarding the meaning of letters. (In the _śloka_s cited above), in the first (sthulartha) interpretation, the behaviour which is inherent by nature to the <em>śeṣa</em> (namely, namana) and the structure or constitution of <em>Sādhyopāya</em> with its _aṅga_s, are explained. Then, in the second, they clarify the <em>svarūpa</em> of the <em>jīva</em>, as this is essential to the aspirant to <em>mukti</em> who adopts the <em>upāya</em>, namely, that he has no unconditional independence. Then in the third (i.e.) para, the _śloka_s indicate the nature of <em>Siddhopāya</em> (<em>Bhagavān</em>), who can be won by the adoption of the particular <em>Sādhyopāya</em> and who is also the object to be attained. It may also be understood as stating that surrender (of self) is more important&rsquo; than all other _upāya_s. All these are to be understood in their proper places where the ten different interpretations are given later on.</p>

<p>All the _mantra_s that are combined with the word <em>namas</em> with its various meanings as stated above become operative _mantra_s to be einployed while surrendering one&rsquo;s self. The ma in <em>praṇava</em> and in the <em>namas</em> lead to the consideration of one&rsquo;s self either by reference to the <em>Jīva</em> as a genus (<em>Jāti</em>) including one, or by reference to &lsquo;I&rsquo; directly which is like catching hold of the horns (i.e.) (by pointing to what is essential and all-important). Since the consideration that has been pointed out in regard to one, applies equally to others as well, there is no question of any one being the Saviour of any other. Therefore since all creatures are dependent (on another) in the matter of protecting themselves and protecting others, protectorship not dependent on others is vested only in the Lord of Kamala (<em>Lakṣmī</em>)</p>
<p>THE WORD NĀRĀYAṆA IN TIRU_MANTRA_:</p>
<p>The word Nārāyaṇa here (in Tiru_mantra_) explains (in full), by its conventional usage and by its etymology, the unconditional Saviour who appears in the first letter (of the <em>praṇava</em>) as the Protector of all and as the <em>śeṣī</em> of all. His grace is to be obtained by means of the <em>sādhyopāya</em> called <em>śaraṇāgati</em> (seeking protection or refuge of the Lord), whicb is seen either implicitly or explicitly in the word <em>namas</em>. He is to be the recipient of the service rendered by the <em>prapanna</em>, which is implicit in the dative (fourth) case ( of the word Nārāyaṇa) (i.e.) Narāyaṇāya.</p>
<p>Explanation or elaboration is the clarification of what has been briefly stated before in another manner, so that there may be no ignorance, doubt or misconception (about its meaning). This explanation may be seen wherever it occurs [(i.e.) the meaning hinted at in the first letter a (of <em>praṇava</em>) is explained in the word Nārāyaṇa and the meaning of m in <em>praṇava</em> is explained in the word Nara and so on] .</p>
<p>This word, Nārāyaṇa, which is of great help in showing clearly the two _tattva_s, namely, the <em>śeṣa</em> and the <em>śeṣī</em> finds the first place, in the _Viṣṇu_gāyatri and in the Tirunarayaniyam, where certain names are commented upon before other vyāpaka names of <em>Bhagavān</em>.</p>
<p>[ 053:-_Viṣṇu_gayatri: Nārāyaṇaya vidmahe; Vasudevaya dhimahi, Tanno _Viṣṇu_h prachodayat,]</p>
<p>(Nārāyaṇa, <em>Vāsudeva</em> and <em>Viṣṇu</em> are called <em>vyāpaka</em> names because their etymology indicates that the one referred to by them is present everywhere).</p>
<p>In the Nārāyaṇānuvāka which aims at determining the person of the Supreme Deity, who is the object of meditation in all vidyās, the word Nārāyaṇa is repeated many times, thus showing great regard, for the purpose of declaring that <em>Brahma</em>, Siva and others, who might, on first thought, be considered as the Supreme Deity, on the strength of the presence of their names in. the _vidyā_s are only the vibhūtis (or glorious possessions) of Nārāyaṇa just like the universe (which attests His glory). This it does by stating them in *grammatical co-ordination or apposition with Nārāyaṇa (sāmānādhikaraṇyam)<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> .</p>
<p>It declares that even these, (<em>Brahma</em>, Siva and others) are included in the meaning of Nāra (the first part of the compound) and that Nārāyaṇa is their resting place or refuge.</p>
<p>The potency of this name is well-known from the following passages: &ldquo;Those who are afraid of <em>samsāra</em> and who suffer from terrible diseases are relieved of their sufferings by merely uttering the word Nārāyaṇa, and attain happiness”. “The man in whose mouth is the auspicious word, Nārāyaṇa, is followed by Nārāyaṇa even as the calf is followed by the cow.&rdquo; &quot; The word Nārāyaṇa is always available. Oar speech is within our control. Notwithstanding this, the <em>jīva_s fall into the darkest hell by not uttering the word&rdquo;: &quot; The name, Nārāyaṇa, confers (on the man who utters it) good birth in a Vaishnavite family: it confers also wealth.” “The mother  who gives the name, Nārāyaṇa, to her son will never go to hell.&rdquo; In the Nāradīya kalpa it is said: &quot; Even those who utter the mere word, Nārāyaṇa, are relieved of their diseases, of their dangers, of their fears and of their sorrows. There is no doubt of this.&rdquo; In another purāņa it is stated that if the number of vowels and consonants (in the word, Nārāyaṇa ) be taken separately into account, it will (be seen to) resemble Tiru_mantra</em> in having eight letters and may be treated as such.</p>
<p>The compound word Nārāyaṇa may be split up into its two component parts thus: Nārāh ayanam yasya (He to whom Nārās are the resting place ) and Nārāņām ayanam (the resting place of Nārās). The word Nārās is here determinate in meaning and denotes only the nārās (sentient beings and non-sentient things) and does not refer also to the Lord who is their inter self. Therefore the two words are not in grammatical apposition. Nammalvar distinctly showed the meanings of these two ways of combining the two parts of the word (samāsa) in the following two passages by using the word at the end and at the beginning respectively. &ldquo;He who has, as His _śeṣa_s,&rdquo; countless _jīva_s with knowledge and bliss as their attributes and with self-luminousness as their nature and also His own noble qualities&ndash;that Nārāyaṇa,&rdquo; and &quot; Nārāyaṇa&rdquo; is the Lord of all the seven worlds&quot;. In this are implicit (<em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s) possessing the two kinds of attributes, namely, freedom from defects and possession of all auspicious and noble qualities and, likewise, His possession of the two vibhūtis (glories), namely <em>Līlā</em> <em>Vibhūti</em> (this (material) Universe) with all the sentient and nonsentient beings in it) and <em>Nitya</em> <em>Vibhūti</em>, (the transcendental region of eternal glory with all that it contains). It should be borne in mind that this nārās includes the queen, the ornaments, the weapons, the attendants, the furniture and the like, the door-keepers, the retinue and such others.</p>

<p>In the word Nārāyaṇa, are contained all the attributes (of <em>Brahman</em>) which are established in the four chapters) of the Sarīraka <em>Śāstra</em>:(<em>Brahma</em> sūtras), namely, His being the cause of the Universe, the irrefutability of the proposition that He is the cause, His being the <em>upāya</em> for the attainment of <em>mukti</em> and His being the object of attainment (in <em>mukti</em>). All this has been explained by Bhattar in His <em>Nitya</em> in the words beginning with &ldquo;Knowledge, bliss, purity and the like.”</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF NĀRĀS:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I created the waters, which are called nārās, and lay within them. Therefore am I called Nārāyaṇa.&rdquo; &ldquo;The waters are called Nārās because they were born of Nara (i. e. <em>Bhagavān</em>). They were at first His abode. Therefore is He called Nārāyaṇa.&rdquo; In these two _śloka_s, the waters refer by implication (Upalakṣaṇa) to the other sattvas (reals) as well. This is evident from such passages as the following :- &ldquo;The sattvas or reals had all their origin from Nara. Therefore are they known as Nāras. To Him they are the abode, therefore is He considered to be Nārāyaṇa.&rdquo; In this interpretation of the word as a grammatical compound Bahuvrihi samāsa ( Nārah ayanan yasya), it is stated that the _tattva_s had their origin from Nara and are therefore called nāras. From this it follows that, as stated in Mahopanishad and elsewhere, Nārāyaṇa is the cause of all (things and beings ) including <em>Brahma</em> and Isana ( Siva) in every way (i. e. the material cause and the instrumental cause). The word ayana (resting place ) is derived in this way:-‘I yate iti&rsquo; ayanam. That which is pervaded is ayana (the passive voice being used for deriving the word). This declares that He pervades all, as they are all pervaded by him and that in order that He may do so, He has unparallelled subtleness (sukshmatva). Ayana may be derived also in another way: Iyate asmin iti : (That in which it is), in which case it would mean that in which everything rests. The word Nārāyaṇa may be considered also as a compound of the tatpurusha type (tatpurusha samāsa), in which case it would be split into Narāņam and. ayanaın (the abode of Nārās ). It is true that the compound word should then be in the neuter gender Nārāyaṇam, but by the authority of nirukti, the masculine form Nārāyaṇah is not improper. The _pramāṇa_s are the following :-&ldquo;He is also called Nārāyaṇa, for He is the resting place or abode of Narās&rdquo;. &ldquo;The multitude of all _jīva_s is called Nārās. Since <em>Bhagavān</em> is to be attained by them and is also the <em>upāya</em> for attaining Him, He is called Nara yana&rdquo;. &ldquo;Nāra is so called because it means the multitude of _jīva_s which are indicated by the word nara. I am the goal to be attained by them; I am also the <em>upāya</em> for that attainment. Therefore am I called Nārāyaṇa by the seers.&rdquo; &ldquo;The wise call the multitude of _jīva_s by the name Nāra. He is called Nārāyaṇa because He is their ayana (abode or resting place). Therefore those who are thoroughly conversant with the Vedas and the Vedanta declare Him to be the kinsman, the mother, the father, the <em>guru</em> and the abode or resting place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE DERIVATION OF THE WORD NARA:</p>
<p>The verbal root ‘in’ means &rsquo;to perish&rsquo;; so ra (in nara) denotes non-sentient things (i.e.) matter which perishes (i. e.) changes its essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>). Nara therefore, denotes those that do not perish or change their essential nature (i.e.) chetanas (sentient beings, using the na samāsa on the analogy of words like Naga - which means .mountain&rsquo;, for it does not (na) go</p>
<p>or move (ga) and naika, na-eka &quot; not one&rdquo; (1. c.) many&rsquo;. So Nara means sentient beings only; nāra means the multitude of naras. Their ayanam (abode or resting place) is Nārāyaṇa. This declares that He who has under His control the three kinds of chetanas or sentient beings (the bound, the released and the eternal) and also nonsentient things, their essential nature (or existence) their sustenance, and their activity&ndash;He is, to the three kinds of multitudinous souls (the bound, the released and the eternal) who are denoted by the word nara, the Dispenser of what they desire. It says also that since He is blissful, He is, of his own accord, the <em>upeya</em> (i. e.) the object of attainment and is also the support or resting place (<em>ādhāra</em>), for it is said, “ Thus has it been explained how the three worlds have <em>Viṣṇu</em> as the <em>ādhāra</em> (resting place or abode)” and “He has entered into the three lokas, viz. the non-sentient, the sentient and the released souls and supports thern without undergoing any change.&quot;</p>
<p>How these meanings are traceable in the word ayana will now be explained :- The word ayana may be derived from the verbal root in (which means to go), in three ways: (1) īyate anena iti ayana). Ayana is that by which or with which one goes, where it refers to the instrument (karana) or aid. ( When derived in this way) <em>Iśvara</em> becomes the <em>upāya</em> or means (2) iyate asau iti ayana) &ldquo;That which is reached. In this derivation <em>Iśvara</em> becomes the <em>upeya</em> or object that is reached or attained: (3) īyato asmin iti ayana): &ldquo;that in which it rests.&rdquo; In this derivation <em>Iśvara</em> becomes the support or ādhāra on which everything reste. Ayana may also be derived from the verbal root ay, which means &ldquo;to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is evident that <em>Iśvara</em> has in Him the qualities necessary for being the <em>upāya</em>, the <em>upeya</em> and the like, viz., easy accessibility (saulabhyam) and being supreme (paratvam). When ayana means &lsquo;abode&rsquo;, if we take Nārāyaṇa to be a bahuvrihi compound ( Nārāh Ayanam Yasya) (He whose abode is Nārās ), it is considered to indicate that Nārāyaṇa pervades all things and beings within them (i, e.) that He is immanent within them. If we take Nārāyaṇa to be a tatpurusha compound (Nārāņam ayanam: the abode of Nārās, the (compound) word indicates that He pervades them froin without (they being within Him) (i.e.) that He is transcendent. These two are declared in the śrutis (i.e.) in Nārāyaṇānuvakam) Immanence (or antarvyāpti) means being present inseparably connected with other things and beings in such a way that it cannot be said that He is not present where they are: Transcendence (bahirvyapti) means being present also in places where they are not present. Such things as Time ( Kāla) are omnipresent (vibhu). So it should not be stated that <em>Iśvara</em> is outside of them. When it is said &ldquo;Nārāyaṇa who is smaller (aiyiin) than all the smallest: the meaning of the word (aṇu is not &lsquo;of small size&rsquo; but subtle&rsquo;. So the passage really means: “Nārāyaṇa who is subtler than all the subtle things &ldquo;. It means that owing to His being subtle nothing can prevent Him from being within them,</p>
<p>In the <em>śruti</em> ( which says “ He is smaller than the grain called s&rsquo;yāmāka), the purport is that He is of the size of the object within Which He is present (i.e.) of the measure of the upādhi or conditioning factor, and this is distinctly stated in the <em>Brahma</em> sūtras and their commentary (<em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya_m). Being full and complete in every object, on the part of One who is both immanent and transcendent, means that that aspect or phase of His which is within any one upadhi or conditioning factor is capable of (creating, sustaining and destroying) and doing such other things to all things and beings. It does not mean that His essential nature is all contained (and exhausted) within any one object (to the exclusion of all others). If we understand it in that sense, it would be opposed to His transcendence. If we explain this by saying that <em>Iśvara</em> has the power of bringing together those which cannot be brought together (aghatitaghatanā <em>śakti</em>), it would be acceptance of the position of other systems (like Bhaskara&rsquo;s and Yadava prakasa&rsquo;s), which maintain the possibility of bringing together things which are opposed to each other (Bhaskara and Yađava prakasa say that difference and non-difference can coexist). Here in Tiru_mantra</em>, when the Supreme Ruler of all is indicated by the first letter (of <em>praṇava</em>), the base nara of the word Nāras and the word ayana, all these words are purposely used to indicate His being the Protector and His being the ultimate  cause (in a), His being eternal and His being the netă (guide) (in the word nara) and His being the resting place or support and the inner self in the word (ayana) in different ways. (It should not be thought that these three mean the same thing and that two of them are therefore redundant).</p>
<p>If it be asked: &ldquo;While the <em>Cetana</em> or sentient being is already indicated by the third letter of <em>praṇava</em> (m), why should it be mentioned again in the word Nara (in Nārāyaṇa)&rdquo;. The answer is as follows: &ldquo;I do not exist without Thee, (my support); Thou dost not exist without me, (for I bring out Thy character:) &quot; &ldquo;Rāma&rsquo;s younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa), and Lakṣmaṇa&rsquo;s elder brother&rdquo;. (In the two passages mentioned above, there is apparent repetition, but it is not a fault since it serves a definite purpose). (In the first passage ), the first part of the sentence emphasises the importance of the <em>śeṣī</em> and the second emphasises the importance of the <em>śeṣa</em>; so also (in the secodd. passage ) Rāma&rsquo;s importance is hinted at in <em>Rāmānuja</em> (Rāma&rsquo;s younger brother) and Lakṣmaṇa&rsquo;s importance is hinted at in Lakṣmaṇapurvaja (Lakṣmaṇa&rsquo;s elder brother): Thus each is characterised by the other. In the <em>praṇava</em>, the <em>śeṣī</em>&rsquo;s inportance is prominent as in the chariot of Arjuna ( where Arjuna is prominent and <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa is not, being only the charioteer ); in the word Nārāyaṇa, the <em>śeṣī</em>&rsquo;s importance is prominent as in the Rasamandala (the Rasakrida described in the Bhāgavatam), where <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa is all-important and the Gopis not so.</p>
<p>Even in the <em>praṇava</em>, though verbally the <em>jīva</em> is prominent, the prominence, so far as the purport is considered, is of the Protector or Saviour.</p>
<p>The <em>jīva</em> who appears in the <em>praṇava</em> as of the form (ākāra) of <em>jñāna</em>, both in his essential nature and in his attribute, and also as being atomic (aņu), is described in the word Nara as eternal (without change or deterioration.) Further since Narāh means &rsquo;the multitude of naras&rsquo;, it makes clear the fact of the _jīva_s being different from one another. If (on the other hand) we take the word Nārah to mean those who have their origin from Nara (<em>Bhagavān</em> ), it indicates that the _jīva_s have <em>Brahman</em> for their cause (in so-far as their embodiment is concerned). Owing to these additional meanings appearing in the word (Nārāyaṇa), the two words serve a purpose ( and are not redundant).</p>
<p>(When the word Nārāyaṇa is taken as a bahuvrihi compound which can be split into Nārāh ayanam yasya), the word ayana is in grammatical co-ordination with Nārāh. By the word ayana, such ideas as their (nārāh) being pervaded by <em>Bhagavān</em> are to be understood. The meaning of the śruti  that in regard to many chetanas who are eternal, one <em>Cetana</em> who is eternal is the cause of their attaining the desired objects&ndash;this meaning may also be seen here.</p>
<p>It is true that the <em>jīva</em> is, according to the _pramāṇa_s, eternal. When he was described before as taking his origin from <em>Brahman</em>, what was meant was that, in respect of his body which is his attribute, the origin was from <em>Brahman</em> (but not his essential nature, which is eternal.)</p>
<p>The other interpretations which are given in kalpas like Narayanatmaka are also similar to these.</p>
<p>In the <em>śloka</em> :&ndash; “Both sentient beings and non-sentient things which are all different from <em>Viṣṇu</em> are called Nāram. He who has nāram as His ayanam (abode or resting place) is Nārāyaṇa&rdquo; (in the light of this <em>śloka</em>) what was stated before (in Padmottaram), viz., Nārāh is the collection of all persons&rdquo; should be taken in a wider sense (Upalakṣaṇa) to include also the collection of all _tattva_s (non-sentient included). Because even non-sentient matter is not perishable in its essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) and also owing to the continuity (pravāha) of the different states (avasthās) into which it changes, (even) non. sentient matter is eternal. Nārāh means therefore by implication (Upalakṣaṇa) all the _tattva_s which are eternal and which are denoted by the word Nara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nara means also Nārāyaṇa for the following reasons : (1) While pervading all (beings and things), He (i. e.) Nārāyaṇa is na ra (one who does not change or deteriorate), for He is not tainted by the faults or impurities in them and by the sufferings which might be caused by them; (2) the verbal root nr means &quot; to lead&rdquo;: He who leads (souls) is Nara : (3) In the Sahasra nāma, Jahnu, Nārāyaṇa and Nara are said to be the names of <em>Bhagavān</em> : (4) In the passage, &ldquo;The waters are the sons of Nara, the word Nara indicates only Nārāyaṇa and this is evident from the sentence in Vyasa_smṛti_ :&ndash; &ldquo;The waters took their origin from Nārāyaṇa and they alone became afterwards His ayana or resting place&rdquo;. So the eternal and Supreme Ruler who leads all (to Himself ) is called by the name Nara.</p>
<p>In the <em>Ahirbudhnyasamhitā</em> (we find the following _śloka_s : “Those that are related to nara are nārāh. That nara is <em>Puruṣottama</em>. It is He that confers knowledge on those that have sought His protection. It is He that dispels all (their) ignorance. Wherever He may be, He does not updergo any change. Hence He is called Nara, because He is always the same (na ra), Sentient beings and non-sentient things that are related to Him are His _śeṣa_s. They are supported by Him, controlled by Him and created by Him. He has entered into them for supporting them. Therefore are they called Nārāh (because they are sup ported, created and controlled by Nara). He controls all nārās; that is, by being within them, He pervades them in order to do such things as sustaining them. The nārāk are helpful (to us) in ander standing Him, for, by their existence is His existence understood. He is the ayana or abode of nārās and they are always His abode. To souls that are nārāh, He is the supreme end to be attained and also the means or <em>upāya</em> of attaining Him &ldquo;. This interpretation makes it clear that those attributes which define the essential nature of the Supreme Being such as(satyam, jñānam and ānandam) and the qualities or attributes of the essential nature so defined, such as compassion, His activities and the specific forms assumed by Him and likewise the three kinds of sentient beings, (the bound, the released and the eternal) and all non-sentient things — all these are meant by the word nārāh. From all this it may be inferred that He has the attribute of being the support of all except Himself. Hence it declares also that He stands by Himself and in Himself (alone). From this, the delusion maintained by men of perverted vision (Advaitins) that Purusho tama, who pervades, supports, controls and masters them and the nārās who are related to Him are identical in their essential nature-this delusion will disappear, since it is evident that He is the soul of all and that He has such glories as that of being denoted by all words.</p>
<p>The word nara (meaning . &lsquo;one who does not change&rsquo;) brings out the meaning of the clarificatory texts in the <em>śruti</em> (where Brahman is declared to be satyamn, the Real that is un ch_aṅgī_ng). The word nāra which means those things which have their origin in Nara as declared in the passage : &ldquo;Those reals or _tattva_s that are born of Nara are called nārāh”-this word brings out the meaning of the śruti that declares <em>Brahman</em> to be the ultimate cause of all; the word ayana brings out the meaning of the texts prescribing forms of meditation or worship (as leading to the attainment of ends desired by men).</p>
<p>Such texts as those in the Subālopanishad declare that the Supreme Being who is the inner self of all and who has all kinds of kinship (to us) is Nārāyaṇa. (By this declaration) these passages state that the Supreme Being is no other deity than Nārāyaṇa.</p>
<p>Those who are relatives in the world became relatives (to us) by the will of <em>Bhagavān</em>. “O, Best of  deities, Thou art my mother. Thou art my father: Thou art my kinsman: Thou art my <em>guru</em> : Thou art my learning: Thou art my wealth. So Thou art by all &ldquo;, The Lord is my master who is my benefactor, He is my father, ny kinsman, my king.&rdquo; &quot; Thou art the world&rsquo;s father, its mother, its beloved son, its affectionate friend, its wellwisher and its <em>guru</em> : Thou art the goal to be attained and also the <em>upāya</em> or means by which it is to be attained. I am Thine, I am sustained by Thee. I am Thy servant. I am one who considers Thee as the highest benefit. I am one who has performed <em>prapatti</em> to Thee. Therefore the burden of protecting me is Thine&rdquo;. The Supreme Ruler is thas one who is the unconditioned relative in every form. If He is pleased (with us), there will be no one who will be opposed to us, for it has been said :&ndash; &ldquo;He from whose favour all these people will become favourable (to us)&ndash;that Rāma is now soliciting the favour of Sugrīva, the best of monkeys&rdquo;, and &ldquo;When Keśava,&rdquo; the best of deities, who loves His devotees, is pleased, (with a man), his mind becomes clear thereby and all creatures&ndash;those that move and those that do not move become favourable to him. “When <em>Bhagavān</em> who is the God of all gods and who controls even <em>Brahma</em> is gracious, all the three worlds become favourable&rdquo;. “<em>Iśvara</em> is, by His very nature, &ldquo;the well-wisher of all creatures &ldquo;. If He is (at any time) differently disposed, it is due to the upādhi or circumstance of the <em>cetana</em> (or sentient being) having disobeyed His command. Even that disposition (of <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s) will change (and become favourable) by some little gesture or consideration (<em>vyāja</em>). Have they not</p>
<p>declared: &ldquo;Even after approaching <em>Śrī</em> Raṅganātha who is so mad as always to take pity on His servants, why do we still continue to be afflicted by <em>samsāra</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE DATIVE (FOURTH) CASE OF</p>
<p>THE WORD NĀRĀYAṆA (i.e.) NĀRĀYAŅĀYA:</p>
<p>We will now set forth the meanings of the fourth case such as &quot; for the sake of some one&rdquo; which will correspond with the meaning of the sentences to be shown hereafter :</p>
<p>Considered in the obvious and ordinary way, it may be thought that the fourth case is used because of the word <em>namas</em> (which governs the fourth case (according to grawmar). In that view there is nothing noteworthy in the use of the dative case. This is the part of the Tiru_mantra_ which is the cause of the attainment of the fruit (desired), for it has been said: “That part of the <em>mantra</em> (<em>mūlamantra</em>). which remains after the sixth letter counting from <em>namas</em> (i.e.) a and which is after the fifteenth letter counting the consonants of the alphabet beginning with ka (i.e.) na, and leaving the consonantal part of ṇa that part which remains after the ì in Nārāyanāya, (i. e.) āya, is called the potent part of that <em>mantra</em>.&rsquo; This part is concerned with the attainment of the fruit. According to some interpretations, the prayer for the attainment of the fruit is found here. There is no difference of opinion in regard to the statement that the meanings of a word differ in accordance with the purpose, the context, the mark or sign, the propriety, the locality and the time of its use and not by the were word as such. One of the meanings of the fourth case that are accepted is sampradūna (ie) to make the word indicate the person to whom a thing is given and who thereby becomes its seshin. Here in the fourth case Nārāyaṇāya in Tiru_mantra_, it is true that what does not belong to <em>Iśvara</em> is not given to Him, for the <em>jīva</em> is always Nārāyaṇa&rsquo;s <em>śeṣa</em> and belongs to Him. So it might be thought that the sampradana which is indicated by the fourth case does not apply here. But in as much as the <em>jīva</em> offers to <em>Iśvara</em> what already belongs to Him for protection by Himself, it may be held that the fourth case indicates sampradana and Ahirbudbnya (Siva) commented in this manner on the dative or fourth case in the Vyāpaka _Mantra_s :</p>
<p>&ldquo;The surrender or offer of the self which is shown to be subordinate or <em>śeṣa</em> is indicated by the fourth case in such words as <em>Viṣṇu</em> (i.e. Namo followed by <em>Viṣṇu</em>). When the qnestion is asked: &ldquo;To whom is this self which is subordinate offered or surrendered for the sake of protection &ldquo;, the answer is &quot; to <em>Viṣṇu</em>&rdquo;. Thus Vishou is indicated by the fourth case&rdquo;. This is a commentary also on the fourth case in words like Nārāyaṇa as the <em>śloka</em> says &lsquo;in such words as <em>Viṣṇu</em>&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In this Tiru_mantra_, the meanings of the seven sacred letters beginping from na have been separately stated in the <em>mantra</em>. _smṛti_s and these meanings have been summarised as follows by some  _ācārya_s in passages like the following :- &ldquo;The meaning of na is looking after the welfare of all, helping to incline the wind (of the <em>jīva</em>) towards Paramapada and destroying those unworthy qualities of the self which are opposed to it. Since the letter ma signifies doing what is good to those who have sought (Him), helping to expand their attributive <em>jñāna</em> (knowledge), and securing for them the respect of others : these are said to be its meanings by those that know. The letter ‘na’ signifies giving up scepticism, rendering service always to <em>Bhagavān</em> and doing the work of the ācārya which consists in leading the <em>śiṣya</em> to Parumapada. These benefits will, in the opinion of those that know the <em>mantra</em>, accrue to those that meditate on this letter. Those that meditate on the letter rā will acquire the love of the Lord, give up the love of those that sre other than the Lord and protect the kingdom (from evils). By the letter ya, wise men acquire the eagerness to adopt the Yoga necessary for attaining <em>Bhagavān</em> and also its fruit.</p>
<p>From the letter ’ņā’ one acquires the desire to praise the Lord and the command of language necessary for praising Him. The letter ‘ya’ causes dread in (the minds) of Yakshas, Rākṣasas, Vethala, and goblins (bhūtas). Those that know the _mantra_s have thus described the function of the different letters &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Thus Tiru_mantra_ which has been rendered free from the stain arising from perverse controversialists with the help of a careful study of the interpretations derived from grammar, nirukta and the like - will, like a mirror, reveal clearly the essential nature of the Supreme Being, and also whatever is difficult to see in regard to one&rsquo;s own essential nature.</p>
<p>THE ATTRIBUTES OF _BHAGAVĀN _ TO BE MEDITATED</p>
<p>UPON WITH REFERENCE TO TIRU_MANTRA_:</p>
<p>When we reflect in accordance with the _pramāṇa_s, on the essential nature of the Supreme Being, who is the deity indicated by this (<em>mantra</em>) in all the forms which are explicitly stated and which are also implicit in this <em>mantra</em>, we should reflect on the following qualities of His in principal and on other excellent traits connected with them:- such qualities as His being the protector : His protectorship being the result of His very nature: His protectorship extending to all, the many ways of His protection, correspondiog to the nature of the thing to be protected, His being the protector at all times, His being the protector in all places, His protection being of all kinds, His protection being directed by His own interest, the omniscience so essential for a protector, His omnipotence, the protection being irrevocable by any except His own will, the irresistibility by others of His protection, His supreme mercy, His expecting an occasion for protection, His requiring from the <em>jīva</em> just a pretext or <em>vyāja</em> for extending His protection, His accessibility to all those who have sought His help.

<p>(Thus) here in Tiru_mantra_, the Lord is to be reflected upon by good men in a concise form (in the letter a) as the consort of <em>Śrī</em> (<em>Lakṣmī</em>) and as the Saviour:(in the dative or the fourth case whose affix has been dropped) as the <em>śeṣī</em>, and as destitute of equals and superiors : in the word <em>namas</em> ) as the <em>upāya</em> or means of attaining Him: (in the word Nārāyaṇa) as the in-dwelling Self of all, (and in the fourth case of that word) as the object of atlainment and as the Person to whom service is due.</p>
<p>THE QUALITIES OF THE JIVĀTMĀ:</p>
<p>In the same way, when the <em>jīva_tma who is to attain the Supreme Being, which is the object of his attaioment, reflects on himself with the help of the Tiru_mantra</em>, he should note the following principal qualities of his own, which are indicated explicitly by the words themselves and which lie implicit in their meaning and other qualities connected with them, which are all accepted on the authority of the pramāṇ as : &lsquo;That he has to be redeemed by <em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Śrī</em> (<em>Lakṣmī</em>), that he cannot be saved by any one else, that he has one who will protect him in all places, at all times, and in every manner, that he has a Saviour who has noble qualities, that he has one (<em>Lakṣmī</em>) to recommend</p>
<p>him (to the Lord&rsquo;s mercy), that he is the servant of the Lord and (His consort) <em>Lakṣmī</em>, that he is their eternal servant, that he is their unconditional servant, that he is not entitled to be the servant of anyone else, that, in his essential nature, the self is <em>jñāna</em> (knowledge), that it is bliss, that it is self-luminous, that the self shines to itself, that the self is denoted by the word &lsquo;I&rsquo;, that the self is atomic (anu), that it is subtle (sukshma), that it cannot be cut (burnt and so on), that the self or soul is different from the twenty four _tattva_s or reals, that (in its essential nature) the self is pure, that it is different from <em>Iśvara</em>, that the self is a knower (having kaowledge as its attribute), that the <em>jīva</em> has, by nature, the capacity to enjoy all things as agreeable, that he is competent to desire the supreme end of life, that he is fit to be commanded (by the Supreme Being), that he is fit to render service, that be has in him the power to have a direct perception of all things, that he is entitled to have unsurpassed bliss, that he is a doer who can act subject to the will of the Supreme Being, that he is a master (of certain things) under certain conditions or upādhis, that he is the <em>śeṣa</em> of the devotees of the Lord, that he is their servant, that he is destitute of _upāya_s other than the Lord, that he is steeped in such things as <em>avidyā</em>, that his knowledge is capable of expansion with the help of (suitable) instruments (karana) and the like, that be is beset by the fears due to <em>samsāra</em>, that be should look forward to the removal of <em>avidyā</em> and the like, that he is destitute of any means (of attaining the end), that he has such things as the good-will of <em>Iśvara</em>, that he should seek and obtain a good <em>ācārya</em>, that he is competent to adopt <em>sādhyopāya</em> (<em>bhakti</em>  or <em>prapatti</em>), that he should stand firm in the <em>upāya</em>, that he has great potency, that he may be called an object of creation, destruction and the like in virtue of his having the body as an attribute, but that the self is imperishable, that the self is one among many, that the selves are countless, that the selt is pervaded by <em>Iśvara</em> (who is its in-dwelling Self), that he is subject to the control of <em>Iśvara</em>, that he is supported by <em>Iśvara</em>, and that as a consequence of these, the self is the body of <em>Iśvara</em> that the <em>jīva</em> is the cause of the sportive delight</p>
<p>(lilā rasa) of <em>Iśvara</em>, that he is entitled to be the instrument for the Lord&rsquo;s enjoyment (bhoga) (in <em>Nityavibhūti</em>), that his passage to his goal depends on <em>Iśvara</em>, that the attainment of that goal depends on <em>Iśvara</em>, that he should seek neither worldly prosperity nor kaivalya, that he should eagerly long for the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em>, that he should become free from all <em>avidyā</em>, that the self would manifest itself in its essential nature, that the self is capable of visualising everything (in the state of <em>mukti</em>), that his sole enjoyment should consist in the experience of <em>Bhagavān</em> in every form, that he is capable of having unsurpassed bliss, that his being an enjoyer is (only) for the enjoyment ot of <em>Bhagavān</em>, that the self (in its realised state) can take any form and the like at will, that its will is irresistible, that the self will have perfect resemblance to the Lord except in regard to those uncommon qualities or attributes that define His essential nature, that the sell&rsquo;s delight is in rendering every kind of service to <em>Bhagavān</em> and that the self will never return to <em>samsāra</em> (after attaining <em>mukti</em>).

<p>In the three words of this (Tiru_mantra_), we should reflect, in brief, on our being entitled to be the <em>śeṣa</em>, of no one other than the Lord, that we have no other <em>upāya</em> than the Lord, and that we have no other end to attain than the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus the Tiru_mantra_ has ( as stated in Nāradiyakalpam) everything that a man ought to know. From it one can understand the essential nature of <em>cit</em> (sentient beings ) <em>acit</em> (non-sentient matter) and <em>Iśvara</em>, as well as the differences among the <em>jīva_s themselves. The Tiru_mantra</em> also teaches the unconditional differences between the <em>jīva</em> (the individual self) and the Supreme Sell, as, the former is <em>śeṣa</em> and the latter <em>śeṣī</em>. It determines Also the person of the Supreme Deity who is both the material and the instrumental cause of the whole universe. Therefore even those who live in the same locality as those that meditate on the Tiru_mantra_ in this manner will never have delusions such as.the following :- &quot; There is no <em>Iśvara</em> or God&rdquo;; &ldquo;<em>Iśvara</em> is attributeless&rdquo;; &ldquo;<em>Iśvara</em> is absolutely indifferent (to the welfare of the _jīva_s), &ldquo;His god.head is a mere reflection or image which has no reality&rdquo; • His divinity is the result of some special <em>karma</em>  performed by Him&rdquo;. “He is occasionally subject to such things as <em>karma</em> &ldquo;. &ldquo;The three gods, <em>Brahma</em>, <em>Viṣṇu</em> and Siva, are of equal rank&rdquo;, &ldquo;The three gods mentioned above are really one : &quot; The Supreme Reality or Tattva is someone beyond these three gods&rdquo;, &ldquo;One of these, Brabma and Siva, is <em>Iśvara</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;The essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of <em>Iśvara</em> is subject to change or modification&rdquo;. &ldquo;The material cause and the instrumental cause can never be the same&rdquo;, &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> and <em>Iśvara</em> are only a single self&rdquo;. &ldquo;The difference between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>Iśvara</em> is due to certain limiting factors or conditions (upādhi)&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> and <em>Iśvara</em> are eternally (both) different and non-different,&rdquo; &quot; The <em>jīva</em> is <em>śeṣa</em> only on account of his <em>karma</em> &ldquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is at times <em>śeṣa</em> and at other times not a <em>śeṣa</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is inert (<em>jaḍa</em>)&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is, in his essential nature, knowledge (and does not possess knowledge as an attribute)&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is eternally free from bondage&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> only seems to enjoy (i.e. his enjoyment is not real but illusory). &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is not a doer or agent&rdquo;. &quot; The <em>jīva</em> is a doer or agent independent of <em>Iśvara</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;The self laats (only) until the pralaya&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> lasts only until <em>mukti</em> (and then becomes one with the Supreme Being)&rdquo;. There is only one <em>jīva</em> (all the others are illusory)&rdquo;, &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> stands self-supported&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is, in his essential nature, an effeci baving its origin in a cause.&rdquo; &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> can, in no sense, be considered as an effect (even with regard to His body and the like)&rdquo;, &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> can attain his end only by <em>karma</em> &ldquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em>, in the state of release from <em>samsāra</em>, is like a stone (having no knowledge and the like)&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> finds delight only in his own disembodied self&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is absolutely independent of <em>Bhagavān</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is one with <em>Iśvara</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> is without such things as activities&rdquo;. &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> can separate and unite (with <em>Iśvara</em>)&rdquo;. &ldquo;The _jīva_s vary in the bliss that they will enjoy after <em>mukti</em> &ldquo;. &ldquo;The _jīva_s have such differences as being fit to have only salokya and the like &ldquo;, and other such delusions due to perverted systems of religious thought and to those who are outside the pale of Vedic religion.</p>
<p>So also weakness of faith in the Consort of <em>Śrī</em> as a Protector, the search for other Redeemers, the protest  [See page (89 of the book ).] against being dependent on God, the delusion of being the unconditional <em>śeṣa</em> to others, reverence to other deities, association with those who are their devotees, and, likewise, the delight in serving those who are unfit for service, such delusions as that the body and the soul are the same, such delusions as that the self is independent of <em>Bhagavān</em>, the earning (of money or other things) for one&rsquo;s own use, offence to the devotees of <em>Bhagavān</em>, forgetfulness of the fact that one is helpless and destitute of _upāya_s, a longing for the continuance of life in <em>samsāra</em>, the fear that the soul will suffer annihilation, the taste for doing what is improper, the classification of men into friends and foes, the seeking of other kinsmen (than <em>Bhagavān</em> ), the desire for other ends (than the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em>), averseness to the supreme goal of life and other such hindrances to one&rsquo;s firm stand in one&rsquo;s essential nature, in the real <em>upāya</em> and in the end in view - all these ( delusions) will never approach them.</p>

<p>TEN WAYS OF CONSTRUING AND INTERPRETING</p>
<p>TIRU_MANTRA_:</p>
<p>We shall now consider in what manner the Tiru_mantra_ should be considered as forming a sentence or sentences and the meaning of such sentence or sentences:</p>
<p>The Tiru_mantra_ is considered as being a single sentence, as being two sentences and as beiаg three sentences, in different traditions. So also the meanings of the sentence or sentences are reflected opon in many ways:</p>
<p>ONE SENTENCE-INDICATING <em>UPĀYA</em>.</p>
<p>When it is looked upon as a single sentence, the connection of words is to this effect :-&rdquo; Adoration to Narayaṇa whose nature is such as can be ascertained from the <em>praṇava</em> (<em>aum</em>), for it has been said: &ldquo;Praṇava&rdquo; is the word that denotes <em>Bhagavān</em>.&rdquo; (It is true that) the praṇava itself is the name of <em>Bhagavān</em>, but there is no repetition or redundancy in another name being used, viz,, Nārāyaṇa, for, as stated in Śāṇḍilya <em>Smṛti</em> and the like, the <em>aum</em> (or <em>praṇava</em>) is not of much avail, because its meaning by itself is not definite&rdquo;. Therefore, in the Vyāpaka <em>mantra_s, the other name is for the purpose of indicating the particular (deity). This way of construing the sentence, when considered in the light of the gross interpretation described in such places as the Ahirbudhnya Samhita (see before) will make it (Tiru_mantra</em>) appear as indicating the <em>upāya</em>. However the essential nature (of the <em>jīva</em>) and the supreme goal of life are also implicit in it (for, without a knowledge of them, no <em>upāya</em> can be adopted).</p>
<p>ONE SENTENCE INDICATING <em>KAIÑKARYA</em>.</p>
<p>(2) Considering such passages as &quot; (They) fold their hands together (in anjali) and with great delight utter the word <em>namas</em>&rdquo;. the <em>mantra</em> is held also as indicating the activity of the <em>śeṣa</em>, namely, service, which is included in the supreme experience of <em>Bhagavān</em> in <em>mokṣa</em>. This form of service must (necessarily) be preceded by a reflection on (one&rsquo;s) essential nature or &ldquo;svarūipa  (i. e.) that of being a <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord. This can be made use of also by those who have adopted the <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>), even in their present state, when they can realise the happiness (of that service to the Lord).</p>
<p>TWO SENTENCES INDICATING SVARUPA:</p>
<p>(3) When these two ideas become well-established, it is necesary to have a clear and distinctive knowledge of one&rsquo;s essential  nature. For that purpose, the Tiru_mantra_ may be looked upon as being two sentences (a) a Nārāyanāya um - (b) <em>namas</em> (or na mama) meaning (a) &ldquo;I am the unconditional <em>śeṣa</em> of <em>Bhagavān</em> alone who is indicated by the letter a (in <em>aum</em>) and who has such attributes as being the universal Redeemer and the support of all and (I am the <em>śeṣa</em>) of no other. (b) I do not belong to myself, neither am I the unconditional master of anything nor have I any (absolute or unconditioned) independence. If it be asked &quot; Will there not be redundancy owing to the letter a and the word Nārāyaṇa being both the names of <em>Bhagavān</em>? The answer is (as follows):&ndash; In that case one of the two should be considered as An adjective to the other) for the purpose of indicating the special qualities (such as protectorship) contained in its etymological interpretation. The redundancy would also cease if we construe the sentence into &quot; (I am the <em>śeṣa</em>) of Nārāyaṇa who is denoted by the letter a in (<em>aum</em>)&rdquo;. Do we not see the word &lsquo;<em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;, which is His name, being employed in apposition or grammatical co-ordination (sāmānādhikaraṇya)) with the word · <em>Vāsudeva</em>! (in the <em>Vāsudeva</em> <em>mantra</em> )? There is no redundance, as the word Nārāyaṇa serves a purpose, being used for removing all doubts as to which deity is the ultimate universal cause denoted by the letter which is the origin of all letters (namely a ). The order of words in a sentence is dependent on the ways in which they are recited (according to tradition); but the construction or syntactical con. nection of the words is in accordance with the meaning.</p>
<p>When thus taken as two sentences, the whole of the Tiru_mantra_ is descriptive of the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of the <em>jīva</em>. In the light of this coustruction, namely, that of describing the essential nature, the ancients used to say: &ldquo;Be born in Tiru. <em>mantra</em>, grow up in <em>Dvaya</em> and stand firm in <em>Dvaya</em> alone&rdquo;. * Birth&rsquo; is due to the birth of a kaowledge of one&rsquo;s essential nature and the disappearance of the state which preceded it. This may be seen (from the verse): “Before I had a knowledge of my essential nature, I was like one unborn. After attaining that knowledge, I was born and I do not forget this&rdquo;. That is acknowledging, of one&rsquo;s own accord, that one is the <em>śeṣa</em> of no one other than <em>Bhagavān</em>, that one is not subject to the will of any one other than <em>Bhagavān</em> that, consequently, one has no other interests than being <em>śeṣa</em> to Him and that one has no other saviour than He. &ldquo;Growth&rsquo; means the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> resulting from a knowledge of a particular thing that has to be performed as being suited to one&rsquo;s competency. &ldquo;To stand firm in <em>Dvaya</em> alone&rdquo; means to become well-established in this <em>upāya</em> and in the (know. ledge of the) fruit arising from it, without associating oneself with any other <em>upāya</em> and without any other end in view. Thus Tiru <em>mantra</em> and <em>Dvaya</em> combined together reveal the <em>svarūpa</em>, the <em>upāya</em> and the end for which the <em>upāya</em> is adopted.</p>
<p>TWO SENTENCES INDICATING THE <em>UPĀYA</em> :</p>
<p>(4) In this construction of Tiru_mantra_ into two sentences, some consider that the whole of Tiru_mantra_ has, for its purport, the surrender of the self with its accessories. In that case, the m in praṇava should be considered to be in the nominative or first case. By the principle of the offering of the <em>havis</em> (or oblation), Tiru_mantra_ would then mean &ldquo;This unconditional oflering, namely, the self or soul is surrendered to Nārāyaṇa who is denoted by the letter a as His responsibility and who is the deity subject to no conditions or limiting factors (upādhi). In this unconditional sacrifice of the self, the word <em>namas</em> (na mama) would come to mean that one dissociates oneself from oneself and says, &quot; The burden of my protection is not mine.&rdquo; As when (an offering is made) with the words: “This is for Indra and not mine&rdquo;, here also, the two sentences are essential; one to express the connection (of the offering) with the Supreme Being and the denial of its connection with oneself. Also in this surrender with the words <em>namas</em> (na mama), the purport may also extend to the denial of one&rsquo;s being an agent or doer absolutely independeat of the Supreme Being. The two sentences may also be considered to suggest the meaning; &ldquo;The burden of my protection is of no other (than <em>Bhagavān</em>) nor is it my own&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That Tiru_mantra_ has, for its purport, the offering or surrender of the self was stated in the <em>Nitya</em> as follows :- &ldquo;After offering the self to the deity with the mūlamantra etc&rdquo; This idea is shown also in <em>Śrī</em> <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em> <em>Gadya</em> as follows: &ldquo;Praying that <em>Bhagavān</em> should accept one for eternal service to Himself alone, one should prostrate oneself and offer the soul to <em>Bhagavān</em> with the utterance of the sacred mūlamantra&rdquo;,</p>
<p>TWO SENTENCES INDICATING PURUṢĀRTHA:</p>
<p>(5) In each of the two sentences, some understand a word (like syām) meaning &lsquo;I pray that etc&rsquo; or &lsquo;May I&rsquo; etc. (In that case the first sentence would be <em>aum Nārāyaṇāya syām</em>, and the second <em>na mama syām</em>), and their meanings would be:</p>
<p>“May I render service to Nārāyaṇa denoted by the letter a! May there be no hindrances to this!&rdquo; Tiru_mantra_, as a whole, would then be a prayer for the attainment of what is desired and the removal of all undesirable things and this is considered the supreme end. In that case the reflection on one&rsquo;s <em>svarūpa</em> is implicit in it. Similarly even when the Tiru_mantra_ is considered to have, for its purport, only the indication of one&rsquo;s <em>svarūpa</em>, (as in the third meaning) it would, by suggestion or implication, indicate the specific end to be attained. The <em>upāya</em> and the prayer would then be known from the respective _pramāṇa_s which ordain <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>It is often said that Tiru_mantra_ has, for its purport, the knowledge of <em>svarūpa</em>, of <em>upāya</em> and of <em>puruṣārtha</em>, because a knowledge of these which did not exist before is acquired from it. The knowledge of these is prāpya (to be acquired) and the Tiru_mantra_ from which this knowledge arises may therefore be said to be prāpyapara (i.e.) to have, for its purport, the knowledge of these three. But the expression prapyapara does not mean that Tiru_mantra_ has, for its denotation, this knowledge. It denotes the <em>svarūpa</em>, <em>upāya</em> and <em>puruṣārtha</em> and not the knowledge of these which afterwards arises from it. (For example: the word *cow&rsquo; denotes the animal called &lsquo;cow&rsquo;; but when the word &lsquo;cow&rsquo; is employed, we got also a knowledge of the cow. From this we should not say that the word &lsquo;cow&rsquo; denotes the knowledge of the cow. It denotes only the cow though, subsequently, the knowledge also arises. To put it in other words, the denotation of the word and the items of knowledge which may arise when the word is employed are two different things. &lsquo;Cow&rsquo; and knowledge of the cow&rsquo; are two different things.</p>
<p>THREE SENTENCES:</p>
<p>When Tiru_mantra_ is considered as consisting of three. sentences (there are several ways of understanding the meaning:) (6) &amp; (7) The <em>svarūpa</em> or essential nature (of the <em>jīva</em>) and his supreme goal (<em>puruṣārtha</em>) are stated by the words themselves and the <em>upāya</em> is implicit in the meaning (though not expressed by the words); (8) or the <em>svarūpa</em> and the <em>upāya</em> are stated by the words themselves and the <em>puruṣārtha</em> is implicit in the meaning: (9) or the <em>upāya</em> and the <em>puruṣārtha</em> are stated by the words themselves and the <em>svarūpa</em> is implicit in the meaning (10) or the <em>svarūpa</em>, the <em>upāya</em> and the <em>puruṣārtha</em> ( all the three) are stated (distinctly) by the words themselves.</p>
<p>(6) If it be asked how this is, the answer is as follows: The first two words indicate <em>svarūpa</em> and the third word <em>puruṣārtha</em>.</p>
<p>As stated in the following <em>śloka</em> : I am the property (<em>śeṣa</em>) na mama of only <em>Bhagavān</em> who is denoted by the letter a; I do not exist for myself : He who is denoted by the word &lsquo;Nārāyaṇa&rsquo;, which means the person whose abode or dwelling place is the multitude of the etermal nārās (i.e.) _jīva_s &mdash; To Him the varied forms of service which I should reader in virtue of my nature should appear (to me) in all places and in all states&rdquo;. (as stated in this s&rsquo;loka ), the praṇava and the <em>namas</em> clarify the <em>svarūpa</em> ; and the third word Nārāyaṇāya with the predicate understood (Namely syām) is a prayer for the attainment of the goal, in view of the idea of existing for <em>Bhagavān</em> expressed (already) by the <em>praṇava</em>. The form of the prayer would be “May I be for Nārāyaṇa!&rdquo; In this view, the prayer for the removal of hindrances (to _śeṣa_tva) results from the meaning (and not from the words themselves, because the attainment of the <em>puruṣārtha</em> is impossible without the removal of hindrances). As stated in the <em>Dvaya</em> and in such passages as &ldquo;Thou shalt enjoy thyself on the slopes of the hills in the company of Sītā&rdquo;, since the one to whom service is due has a spouse, the meaning would here also be, “May I be for Nārāyaṇa as well as for <em>Lakṣmī</em>!&rdquo;. If the predicate be needed, a word like bhaveyam (May I be) should be understood. This prayer has indeed been made in such forms as the following:&ndash; “May I render faultless service remaining with <em>Bhagavān</em> constantly in all places and in all states.&rdquo; &ldquo;Vouchsafe upto me Thy grace so that I may render service to Thee&rdquo;. &ldquo;I pray for eternal service to Thee&rdquo; and &quot; I should be Thy eternal servant,&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Existing for His sake&rsquo; is eternal; so there is no need to pray for it; this relationship of existing for His sake (as His <em>śeṣa</em>) is already expressed by the praṇava. Therefore prayer is inside here for service (to <em>Bhagavān</em>), which is the overflow of the full and perfect enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> and which contains within itself all other ends of life as in the common saying: &ldquo;In the ocean is a small puddle (i.e.) the larger contains the smaller within it)&rdquo;.</p>

स्वामिप्रयोजनापेक्षाप्यतस्स्वानन्दहेतुका ॥</p>
</details>
<p>Here in the dative or fourth case ( in the word Nārāyaṇāya ), although the <em>jīva</em> expects his owa gain (namely, the attainment of his <em>puruṣārtha</em> ), yet it ends in the Master gaining pleasure or delight. (Therefore there is no violation of the proper function of the, <em>śeṣa</em>). (Likewise) desiring that the Master should gain conduces also to one&rsquo;s own bliss or <em>ānanda</em>.</p>
<p>&quot; Whether it is said, &ldquo;I beg for service which would please Thee&rdquo; or &quot; Thou shouldst find delight in having my service&rdquo; - in either case, both are gainers&rdquo;. (This is the idea). It has been said:-&rdquo; Food is of two kinds, that which has three qualities and that which has six qualities: That which has three qualities<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> is for those bound by <em>karma</em> ; the other is for others&quot;. Here the food with six qualities is the enjoyment of the (six) qualities of <em>Bhagavān</em> and also the different kinds of service which result from them and which are most enjoyable.</p>
<p>(In the <em>Brahma</em> Sūtras) it is said that since the _śruti_s indicate that there would be perfect resemblance or equality (bhoga mātra sāmya) only in regard to enjoyment between <em>Brahman</em> and the <em>mukta</em>, the perfect equality is only in enjoyment and in <em>jñāna</em> or knowledge. Therefore there is nothing (in the _śruti_s or the sūtras) opposed to the <em>mukta</em> being a <em>śeṣa</em> (to <em>Bhagavān</em>) which pertains to his essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) and, as a result thereof, rendering service (<em>kaiṅkarya</em>) to Him. It has been explained in <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> and elsewhere that when, in the state of aspiring to <em>mukti</em> and in the state of <em>mukti</em>, the <em>jīva</em> meditates on his being <em>Brahman</em>, what is meant is that this contemplation is only in virtue of the self or <em>jīva</em> being the body of <em>Bhagavān</em>. Therefore this notion of &ldquo;I am <em>Brahman</em>&rdquo; is indeed the result of the body (here the self or <em>jīva</em>) being dependent on the inner self (<em>Bhagavān</em> ) and existing only for the fulfilment of His purposes. (Therefore there is no impropriety in the self being <em>śeṣa</em> to <em>Bhagavān</em> even in the state of <em>mukti</em> ). The service that is rendered in the state of release or <em>mukti</em> comes from the very nature of the self: it is free from the pairs of opposites<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> , constant and un-intermittent, and produces unlimited delight. In the state of aspiration to <em>mukti</em> (<em>mumukṣu</em>) the service that is rendered for its own sake is due to the circumstance or upadhi of some good <em>karma</em>  done in the past; it has to endure the pairs of opposites (dvandva ) such as heat and cold and pleasare and pain; it is interrupted by sleep and other such (hindrances) and the delight arising therefrom is limited.</p>
<p>Here all activities of the <em>jīva</em> which do not form the service of <em>Bhagavān</em> and which do not fit in with His commands will yield adverse results of some kind or other. Among those activities which are permitted by <em>Bhagavān</em>, those which are for the purpose of attaining <em>svarga</em>, cows and the like will yield fruits which may appear to be pleasant but which are mingled with many undesirable elements. Therefore they are, for that reason, hindrances. So, as stated in the <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;One should give up the performance of those actions which are aimed at attaining the three ends, namely, <em>dharma</em>, wealth (artha) and pleasure (kāma),&rdquo; the aspirant to <em>mukti</em> may perform those rites or actions in relation to <em>Bhagavān</em> which are the means of securing <em>bhakti</em>  and <em>jñāna</em> and also of promoting the glory of <em>Bhagavān</em> and of Bhāgavatas without caring for any other fruit. Since these rites or actions are not productive of life in <em>samsāra</em>, they would be included in the proper form of service, The state of being a <em>śeṣa</em> to <em>Bhagavān</em> indicated in the <em>praṇava</em> extends to that of being a <em>śeṣa</em> to His devotees in so far as laid down in the _pramāṇa_s, as a consequence of the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s absolute subjection to and sole existence for Hiin, which are indicated appropriately by the word <em>namas</em>.</p>
<p>So the <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service to <em>Bhagavān</em> which is desired in the word Nārāyaṇāya extends to His devotees. This idea is expressed in such _śloka_s as the following :- &ldquo;I am greatly pleased with those who have devotion towards my devotees. Therefore one should honour them greatly&rdquo;, and. “Therefore in order to obtain the grace of <em>Bhagavān</em>, one should please His devotees. By this the Lord becomes heartily inclined to show His grace. There is no doubt of this &ldquo;.</p>
<p>The saying that “dependence upon others is miserable&rdquo; means (only) that the dependence on the worthless, which is due to past <em>karma</em> and which is not suited to one&rsquo;s <em>svarūpa</em>, is the cause of misery. Being subject to (the will of) <em>Bhagavān</em> and tadiyas is the prescribed goal suited to one who realises the essential nature of his self and it is therefore the cause of unsurpassed delight. &ldquo;Tadiyas&rdquo; or &lsquo;Bhāgavatas&rsquo; means those who feel a delight in being the servants of the Lord.</p>
<p>There are some who maintain that service to His devotees (tadiyas) logically follows when one desires to serve Nārāyaṇa who his for His attribute Nārās, for service to the substantive in Nārāņām ayanam iacludes (they say) service to Nārāṇām (all nārās ) which is the adjective or attribute. (If the logic of this statement that what is prescribed for the substantive should be considered as prescribed also for its adjective or attribute, (in other words ), if being the attribute is itself the cause (of being honoured and served), then every thing that is denoted by the word Nārās here, such as <em>Brahma</em> and the other gods, the enemies of <em>Bhagavān</em>, cattle and the like, would come under those to whom service shonld be desired. If it is said, “He desires to serve men&rsquo;s sovereign&quot;, it does not follow that he desires to serve men also who are the adjectives of the sovereign (in the phrase &lsquo;men&rsquo;s sovereign&quot;), So also, by mere logic, the desire to serve Nārās will not become proved. (That will require _pramāṇa_s for proof). Therefore only this much can be said:- By the authority of the _pramāṇa_s, since the aspirant desires to do what is pleasing to the Master, he desires to serve those who are dear to Him and who realise that they are His _śeṣa_s and have no other interests in life. Even in the experience of the state of <em>mukti</em>, the experience of everything else indicated by the word Nāra which is included in the experience or enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> - even this is not understood from (the) logic (of the adjective and the substantive ). It is understood from the authority of the <em>pramāṇa</em>, (namely the <em>śruti</em>) which says &quot; He sees all, and attains all things&quot;.</p>
<p>So far the Tiru_mantra_ was construed as having three sentences among which the first two were held as indicating the <em>svarūpa</em> of the <em>jīva</em> and the third as indicating the prayer for the attainment of the <em>puruṣārtha</em> or goal aimed at.</p>
<p>(7) Different from this is the construction of Tiru_mantra_ into three sentences of which the <em>praṇava</em> brings out the <em>svarūpa</em> or essential nature, <em>namas</em> forms the prayer for the removal of hindrances or evils, and the <em>puruṣārtha</em> which will result from that renewal is indicated in Nārāyaṇāya syām (&ldquo;May I be for Nārāyaṇa !&rdquo;) That the <em>namas</em> in Tiru_mantra_ too, like the <em>namas</em> in <em>Dvaya</em> has, as its purport, the prayer for the removal of hindrances - this interpretation, too, is explained in Bhattar&rsquo;s <em>Nitya</em> in the _śloka_s: “As stated in the <em>praṇava</em>, I am the <em>śeṣa</em> of <em>Bhagavān</em>; in spite of it, I wily subdued by the notions of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and Mine&rsquo; owing to (my) past <em>karma</em> . The word <em>namas</em> states that, hereafter, I should reinember my being <em>śeṣa</em> to <em>Bhagavān</em> and render service to him&quot;. Therefore the syntactical construction becomes (in this interpretation): Aham na mama syam &ldquo;I shall not be my own <em>śeṣa</em> or na mama kinchit syat&rdquo; &ldquo;May I have no hindrances&rsquo;&rdquo; Syām or Syāt being understood. So it amounts to a prayer for tha complete removal of all hindrances such as <em>avidyā</em> or ignorance, <em>karma</em> , the impressions left by them (vāsanas), the taste or inclination (ruchi) and the association with <em>prakṛti</em> or matter. This has been shown in the passage in Vedārthasangraha, where it is said. &quot; Owing to beginningless <em>avidyā</em> or ignorance, two kinds of <em>karma</em>, good and evil (<em>puṇya</em> and <em>pāpa</em>) have been flowing like a stream. On account of this, the <em>jīva</em> becomes enclosed in bodies of four kinds: <em>Brahma</em> and the other gods, men, animals and plants. So in accordance with the notion entertained by the <em>jīva</em> regarding his nature, the streain of <em>samsāra</em> increases in its volume. In order to get rid of the fear caused by it which is hard to resist etc.” So also it ia said, &quot; In order to protect the souls of samsārins whose nature is such that they have false notions of &lsquo;I&rsquo; about the body, bad ways of life due to these (false notions) and the impure body which results therefrom, the Lord of the _Nitya_suris was born into all sorts of castes and species &ldquo;.</p>
<p>It may be asked :-&rdquo; When a prayer has been made for the removal of hindrances, where is the need for another prayer for the attainment of the desired end? Will it not follow as a natural consequence? Has it not been said: “When the <em>jīva</em> attains <em>Brahman</em>, those qualities or attributes of his which are natural to him and which were, till now, hidden begin to shine forth. This is revealed by the word Svena in the <em>śruti</em>&quot;. &ldquo;In the same way as the brightness or radiance of a gem is not produced (anew) but is a natural consequence of washing away the dirt covering it), so also <em>jñāna</em> or knowledge is not produced in the soul (anew). When a tank or a well is dug, the water and the ether (space) are not created but simply come into prominence (having already been there). It is only what already exists that is manifested clearly, How can there be the production of a thing which did not exist ? So also on the removal of undesirable or evil qualities, qualities like knowledge begin to shine forth. They are not created anew, for these qualities are eternal in the <em>jīva</em> (since they belong to his essential nature) &ldquo;?</p>
<p>The answer to this question may be expressed as follows :</p>
<details open><summary>संस्कृतम् - विश्वास-प्रस्तुतिः</summary>
<p>स्वतस्स्वार्हं यथाभागं पुत्रः पितुरपेक्षते ।<br>
सापराधस्तथा दासः कैङ्कर्यं परमात्मनः ॥</p>

<details><summary>संस्कृतम् - मूलम्</summary>
<p>स्वतस्स्वार्हं यथाभागं पुत्रः पितुरपेक्षते ।<br>
सापराधस्तथा दासः कैङ्कर्यं परमात्मनः ॥</p>
</details>
<p>&ldquo;The son begs of his father for his share of the property, though it is lawfully his. In the same way the servant (the <em>jīva</em>) who has offended (the Master) begs of the Supreme Being that he should be permitted to render service &ldquo;. There is nothing inappropriate in the <em>jīva</em> who has lost what he is entitled to, praying thus:&ndash; “May I have what is my sharel Be Thou so gracious as to pardon my offence;&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the passages quoted above, it would appear also that just  when the hindrance is removed the radiance natural to the gem begins to shine by the will of God, as stated in.&rdquo; All things exist as such only by Thy will&rdquo;, so also such things as the expansion of jñāna which naturally belong to the <em>Jīva</em>, are manifested as a result of the Lord&rsquo;s will, which is of the form of the compassion natural to Him.</p>
<p>But it may be asked: &ldquo;In a <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> system of thought which holds that the non-existence (of a thing) means the presence of some other thing, the removal of hindrances should, by itself, be the attainment of what is desired. Hence will not the separate prayer for it be redundant? Besides has not the author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> declared: “The disappearance of <em>avidyā</em> (literally, ignorance; <em>karma</em>  ) is itself <em>mokṣa</em>&rdquo;?</p>
<p>To that question the answer is as follows: - For the sake of some purpose, a single thing may be indicated (in two ways), in its essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) and also in a form that is opposed to it. So (here ), it is called the attainment of what is desired and the disappearance of what is not desired, because of the intention to signify a special purpose. In the state of <em>samsāra</em>, the dis. appearance of something that is undesirable may be another undesirable thing or the disappearance of what is desired and what is not desirable alike. But in the state of <em>mokṣa</em>, since every thing (without exception) that is undesirable disappears, whal remains is all agreeable So the two (the disappearance of the undesirable and the attainment of what is desired) were stated separately in order to show, with great regard, that the former state (<em>samsāra</em>) is most undesirable and the latter most desirable, since it (is free from all undesirable elements and) has only what is desirable. Further the two have to be stated separately, since the withdrawal of punishment by <em>Bhagavān</em> and such things as the expansion of the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s knowledge are different things. It is not improper to pray separately for these two things since the remission of punishment by God which is the cause of the contraction of knowledge and the like is different from such things as the expansion of knowledge, service and the like which results from the disappearance of the contraction of knowledge, service and the like, which were the results of that punishment.</p>
<p>There is also another reason for two separate prayers - In some other systems of thought (like that of the Tārkikas), <em>mokṣa</em> means the disappearance of all undesirable things and the attainment of a state similar to that of a stone (with no positive content in the form of enjoyment or bliss). In order to show that <em>mokṣa</em> in our system is not of that kind, bat has a positive content of enjoyment or bliss, the two are stated as being separate and also to show that in the attainmeot of <em>Bhagavān</em> (in <em>mukti</em>), there is no such thing as an alloy of misery or pain just as there is in attaining such states as the position of Indra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus if it is held that the <em>svarūpa</em> and the prayer are expressed explicitly by the words themselves, the <em>upāya</em> prescribed by the sütras, for the attainment of the end in view (<em>puruṣārtha</em>) namely, the <em>Sādhyopāya</em>, is implicit in the meaning of <em>namas</em> which states the disappearance of undesirable things in the case of the man destitute of all other _upāya_s as a result of <em>bharanyāsa</em>.</p>
<p>(8) <em>SVARŪPA</em> AND UPÃYA :</p>
<p>Since the prayer for the <em>puruṣārtha</em> is not a mere desire but the soliciting of a protector, the <em>aṅga</em> and other accessories may be considered also as implicit and not expressed. The Tiru_mantra_ would then mainly indicate the <em>svarūpa</em> and <em>upāya</em>. If we split Nārāyaṇa into nārāņām ayanam yena &ldquo;He by whom He becomes the resting place of nārās (the world of _jīva_s), the word ayana may be considered also as indicating the <em>upāya</em>, for He is the <em>upāya</em>.</p>
<p>(9) <em>UPĀYA</em> AND PURUṢĀRTHA :</p>
<details open><summary>संस्कृतम् - विश्वास-प्रस्तुतिः</summary>

</details>
<p>Some_ācārya_s considered that, as in the order in which these are expressed in <em>Dvaya</em> and in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>, here, in Tiru_mantra_ also, the praṇava (tāram) expresses <em>bharanyāsa</em> or the surrender of the responsibility of protection and that the other two words <em>namas</em> and Nárāyaṇāya express the attainment of the end in view.</p>
<p>(10) THREE SENTENCES INDICATING RESPECTIVELY</p>
<p><em>SVARŪPA</em>, <em>UPĀYA</em> AND PURUṢĀRTHA</p>
<p>Tiru_mantra_ may be considered also as stating all the three, viz., <em>svarūpa</em>, <em>upāya</em> and <em>puruṣārtha</em> in that order. In this case the praṇava states the <em>svarūpa</em> or essential nature of the <em>jīva</em> (as <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s <em>śeṣa</em>), the <em>namas</em> states the <em>upāya</em> and what remains (i.e.) Nārāyaṇāya states the prayer for the <em>puruṣārtha</em> or the attainment of the end in view.</p>
<p>The details concerning these three should be understood by a study of the Vedanta śāstras. The construction or interpretation given above of Tiru_mantra_ has resemblances to the order in which the <em>tattva</em>, the <em>upāya</em> and the <em>puruṣārtha</em> are explained in the Vedantha _śāstra_s. Does not that śāstra proceed in this way? So the first two chapters (adhyāyas) (of the <em>Brahma</em> sūtras), the Supreme Real (<em>Brahman</em>) and the reals subordinate to it are determined. In the third chapter, competency (<em>adhikāra</em>) and accessories (_aṅga_s) are stated along with the <em>upāya</em> and in the fourth chapter, the fruit or the attainment of the goal is explained by way of conclusion. The essential nature of the Supreme Real and that of the lower reals explained in the first two chapters (adhyāyas ) and the fruit or goal of attainment explained in the fourth are the same for the man who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as a direct and independent means or <em>upāya</em>. The shortcomings and sufferings in <em>samsāra</em> which are dealt with in the sections (pāda) on Vairagya and Ubhayalinga in the third chapter and the Redeemer&rsquo;s being opposed to all that is of the nature of blemish (heya) and His being the sole possessor of all auspicious qualities &mdash; these, too, must necessarily be understood by the <em>prapanna</em> who is an aspirant to <em>mukti</em>. The different forms of meditation or worship (<em>upāsana</em>) of <em>Brahman</em>, which are treated of in the third section (pāda) of the third chapter (of the <em>Brahma</em> sütras ), should be adopted by those who are competent for them (i.e.) those who have adopted <em>bhakti</em>. The man who is not competent for them and who is destitute of other _upāya_s should realise that these forms of meditation are too high for him and adopt nyāsa as his <em>upāya</em>. For, as stated in the following sub-sections:- Nānā śabdādi bhedāt (<em>Brahma</em> _sūtra_s 3-3-56) (The forms of meditation or worship or vidyās concerning <em>Brahman</em>) are different from one another, for their names are different and vikalpah avisiṣṭa phalatvat (3&mdash;3&ndash;57). (Any one of them may be adopted as there is no difference in the resulting fruit). <em>Nyāsa</em> is different from the other _vidyā_s and in yielding the fruit conferred by them, does not require any other aid. The man who has adopted <em>upāsana</em> (or <em>bhakti</em> ) should perform the rights and duties pertaining to his <em>varṇa</em> (caste) and <em>āśrama</em> (stage of life) as an accessory or <em>aṅga</em> to the <em>vidyā</em> or form of meditation as stated in <em>Brahma</em> _Sūtra_s (3.4.33)  The man who practises <em>bhakti</em>  should perform the duties of his <em>varṇa</em> and <em>āśrama</em> as an <em>aṅga</em> to <em>bhakti</em> .&rdquo; The man who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as a direct and independent <em>upāya</em> should perfom these rites and duties as having been enjoined by <em>Bhagavān</em> and for their own sake (without expecting any gain or reward), for it is said in the <em>Brahma</em> Sūtras (3.4 - 32). “Since they are enjoined, yajnas and other rites become the duties of the (respective) āsramas&quot;. If this is understood the, <em>svarūpa</em>, <em>upāya</em> and <em>puruṣārtha</em> which are explained in the Sārīraka _Śāstra_s (<em>Brahma</em> sūtras) are all to be found within the sacred <em>Aṣṭākṣara</em>. We have already explained how the five truths that ought to be understood may be found in this. (Chap. 4).</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF THE TEN INTERPRETATIONS OF</p>
<p>TIRU_MANTRA_ GIVEN ABOVE:</p>
<p>Thus the ācāryas consider Tiru_mantra_, which has innumerable meanings within it, as having ten (different) meanings in accordance with their respective tradition: When the Tiru_mantra_ is considered as a single sentence, it is thought of as indicating (1) the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of the <em>jīva</em> and (2) his activity as a <em>śeṣa</em>. When coosidered as two sentences, it is thought of as indicating (1) the essential nature of the self and (2) the surrender (of the self) by a positive and a negative statement, Namely, (The burden of protecting me is <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s : it is not mine) and so also (3) as indicating a prayer for the <em>puruṣārtha</em>. When it is considered as three sentences, it is thought of in the following ways:- (1) The first two words indicate the <em>svarūpa</em> and the third word indicates the prayer: (2) The <em>praṇava</em> indicates the essential nature or <em>svarūpa</em>, and the other two words indicate the prayer for the removal of undesirable elements and for the attainment of the desired end. (3) In the same manner, the first word indicates the <em>svarūpa</em> and the other two indicate the <em>upāya</em>, (4) the first word indicates the surrender (of the self) and the other two indicate the prayer for the attainment of the fruit ( desired), (5) The three words indicate respectively the <em>tattva</em>, the <em>upāya</em> and the <em>puruṣārtha</em>.</p>
<p>When some of these meanings are considered as the main interpretations, the others, too, should be looked upon as being implicit in the meaning, though not expressed explicitly by the words thenselves.</p>

<p>Therefore by the interpretations of the words and the sentences thus taught (to us) by the ācāryas, who have realised the truth, other interpretations stated by those who are outside the pale of Vedic religion and by heretics (within that fold) have been rejected.</p>
<p>The man who has attained a clear and sure knowledge of Tiru_mantra_ which cannot be shaken by those outside the pale of Vedic religion and by heretics &ndash; that man has been described as follows in the <em>śloka</em> :- &ldquo;He has mounted the (top most) storey of the palace of the knowledge of Tiru_mantra_ and has obtained freedom from all anxiety (about himself). The wise man looks down (from there) at ignorant people suffering for lack of this knowledge, like a man on the top of a mountain looking at people standing below (it)&rdquo;. The knowledge referred to in the following <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;Food, sleep, fear and sex are common both to animals and to men. The superiority of men to animals consists in their possession of knowledge. Those who are without knowledge are like animals&rdquo;-the knowledge referred to here is this clear and sure knowledge. (The man who has this knowledge) will never be moved or troubled by praise or censure as stated in the <em>śloka</em> : &quot; Here he is called a wise man (pandita) who like the (unsullied) waters in the depths of the G_aṅga_ will never feel elated by praise or pained by censure&quot;. &ldquo;In the land where the man who has a true knowledge of Tiru_mantra_ and who stands firmly in its meditation, is honoured, there will be no disease, no famine and no fear of robbers&rdquo;. As stated in this <em>śloka</em> : No such evil will occur there. It has been stated by those who are proficient in Ayurveda : “Adoration to that unique physician who killed, without exception, all diseases like rāga (desire) which are chronic, which lie spread over all parts of the body and which cause feverish activity, ignorance, dissatisfaction (with everything)&quot;. The <em>śloka</em> quoted above really means, in accordance with the above statement in Vāgbhatam, that (in the land where a knowledge of Tiru_mantra_ is honoured) there will be no such principal diseases as rāga or desire, no contraction of knowledge, for knowledge has been described as wealth or <em>Śrī</em> and no such great robbers as those who steal the self which cannot be stolen by external robbers. (The person who considers the self which truly belongs to <em>Bhagavān</em> as his own is a robber).</p>
<p>OTHER VYĀPAKA _MANTRA_S</p>
<p>The ideas contained in the other Vyapaka <em>mantra_s which contain the words (<em>Viṣṇu</em> and <em>Vāsudeva</em>), namely Namo Vishnave preceded by <em>praṇava</em> and <em>namo</em> Bhagavate Vāsudevāya preceded by praňava are just those which have been declared as existing in Tiru_mantra</em>. As interpreted by Ahirbudhnya such qualities as pervasiveness, splendour, entrance (into all) or immanence and will, which are deduced from the respective verbal roots are additional qualities in the Supreme Being, <em>Viṣṇu</em> and decisive of His being the Supreme Deity&quot;. The meanings of the word &ldquo;<em>Viṣṇu</em>” as derived from the root Vish which means &ldquo;to pervade, &lsquo;vas&rsquo; which means to &lsquo;shine&rsquo;, ‘vis’ . which means &rsquo;to enter&rdquo; and ‘ish’ which means &rsquo;to will&rsquo; and so also the meanings of the <em>Vāsudeva</em> derived from ‘vasati’, ‘vasayati’, which mean respectively, &ldquo;He dwells within all&rdquo; and &lsquo;He makes all dwell within Himself&rdquo; and ‘Divyati’ which means &lsquo;shines&rsquo;, from which follow His being the support of all, His being free from any taint due to contact with them, His sportive activity, and His will to conquer - all these meanings are contained in parts of the word “ Nārāyaṇa&quot;.</p>
<p>As stated in the <em>śloka</em> : “Whatever a man ought to know is all contained in <em>aṣṭākṣara</em>, that is, the Vedas viz., Rik, Yajus, Saman and so also Atharvan and other collections of words,&quot; as stated therein, this <em>aṣṭākṣara</em> is, by itself, the revelation of all that is desired by the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>, in relation to the <em>tattva</em> (Truth) and <em>hita</em> (the means or <em>upāya</em> for reaching the goal). A single utterence of it is equal to frequent repetitions of all the vedas, for it has been said, &ldquo;Whatever fruit is gained by those who repeat the Rik, Yajus and Sama Vedas many times &ndash; that fruit is gained by the man who utters the <em>aṣṭākṣara</em> <em>mantra</em> only once. A single utterance of this <em>mantra</em> is equal to a repetition of all the Vedas. Though, as stated in the <em>śloka</em>: &ldquo;In proportion to the faith that a man has in the <em>Mūlamantra</em> does he attain the ends he desires, it is impossible to estimate adequately its greatness&rdquo; (though, as stated in the <em>śloka</em>), there are degrees of success varying in accordance with the degrees of faith, the potency (of the <em>mantra</em>) is boundless (incapable of being measured) in the case of those who have great and intense faith (mahā visvāsa ) in it. Since in that <em>śloka</em> (100) it is not specifically stated by whom it is impossible to measure its potency, it may be inferred that even Nārāyaṇa who propagated this <em>mantra</em>, who is the subject of this <em>mantra</em> and who is, by nature, omniscient and who incarnated as Nara and Nārāyaṇa and propagated (by precept and practice) the Scripture without letting it become extinct-that even Nārāyaṇa knows that its potency is not capable of being measured. Tirum_aṅga_i Alvar who wis initiated into this <em>mantra</em> and its meaning by the seer of this <em>mantra</em> (<em>Bhagavān</em>, who is also its deity, has declared as follows:- &ldquo;If thou shouldst, with the help of the <em>mantra</em> of eight letters, always enjoy <em>Bhagavān</em>, who appears at the end of the Vedas which form the wealth of Brahmins, thou shalt be happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eight great qualities are those which manifest themselves after <em>mukti</em> or those stated in the <em>śloka</em> &ldquo;Eight qualities enable a man to shine (above others): They are:&ndash; right to knowledge, good birth, control of the senses, learning the meaning of the Veda from the ācārya, the skill to win over one&rsquo;s rivals, freedom from talkativeness. charity in proportion to one&rsquo;s wealth and gratitude.&rdquo; Eight times eight kalās are the sixty four arts and crafts. The eight rasas are sṛṅgāra (love), vīra (heroism), karuņa, (pathos); adbhuta (wonder); hāsya (humour); bhayānaka, (terror or fear) bībhatsa (the grotesque or gruesome) and raudra (anger).The ninth is s&rsquo;anti. Among these, there is nothing which he cannot have at his desire. The imperfect development of spiritual qualities results from want of earnestness in meditation. The inability to attain the right forms of wealth is due to neglect. The delay in the release from <em>samsāra</em> is due to weakness in the desire for it. That is why it has been declared &ldquo;The <em>mantra</em> „  <em>namo</em> Nārāyaṇa - secures whatever is desired.&rdquo;</p>
