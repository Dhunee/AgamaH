<p>(5) THE CHAPTER ON THE THREE &lsquo;REALS&rsquo;</p>
<p>(OR TATVAS)</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>The delusion that the soul is nothing but the body and the senses (prakriti) disappears when one has a knowledge of the distinctive features of sentient beings and non-sentient things. So also the disputes on such questions as the unity of the jiva and God will no longer continue, when the characteristic features of each of them are marked out. Our acharyas, whose wisdom never failed, teach us about the existence of three realities (Tatvas) classified in the s&rsquo;āstrās as the experiencing subjects (bhoktū), the objects of experience and enjoyment (bhogyam) and He who rules over both of them (Iswara).</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION OF TATVAS OR REALS AND ITS USE:</p>
<p>It may be asked why the achiiryas should state that the three tatvās or &lsquo;reals&rsquo; should be specially prescribed for the study of those who seek moksha, when they form only &amp; part of the six things that should be knowm, namely, the five truths arthapanchaka and the relationship of soul and body (which exists between God and the world). The answer is as follows: It is necessary to root out the delusion that the body is the atmü and that the jiva is independeant (of the Lord), as well as the view that there is no God, which is the cause of that delusion, for these are great obstacles to inoksha.</p>
<p>The sāstrās, therefore, divide Reality into three classes ; the experiencing subject, the object of experience or enjoyment, and the Ruler who controls and directs them. Among them, non-beptient things which are the objects of experience are of three kinds (1) Prakriti or matter which has the three qualities of sutvam, rajas and tamas (2) Kala or time and (3) Suddha Satvam, the substance of which the transcendental region beyond matter called Vaikunta is made. The nature of (1) Prakriti</p>
<p>THE THREE REALS</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>has been thusk toscribed :-&ldquo;It is &lsquo;pon-sentient (achetana). It exists (always) for others and it is eternal, but subject always to change or modification. It has three qualities satvam, rajas and tamas and is the field of action (karma) for the jiva&rdquo;. The nature of (2) Kūla or time is described thus :- &quot; Bhagavan *Kala (i.e.) Time, which is the body of Bhagavan, has no beginn. ing nor end.&quot; &ldquo;It takes the forms of such divisions es kala and muhoortha which are respectively 13 minutes and 1/30th part of a day (and is the cause of the modifications of matter). But it causes no change or modification in the transcendental world (Aprākritaloka) beyond matter&rdquo;. The nature of the transcenden. tal world beyond matter is such that it is made of s&rsquo;uddha satvam. The world made of it is of the nature of jnāna and bliss. God controls time there ; time is not the cause of any change or modification in the world of suddha-satvam (as it is in the world of matter). Thus the nature of Prakriti, Kāla and suddha satva which belong to three classes of non-sentient things (achetana), has been described.</p>
<p>NOW FOR THE EXPERIENCING SUBJECT OR JIVA:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jivātmiñ is neither &amp; god nor a man&rdquo;; &ldquo;He is ?Deither a god nor &amp; man”. (That is: These distinctions are based only on the respective bodies, whereas the soul within has no such distinctions.) The jīva is of three kiods :- Baddha or the soul in bondage is called in the Gitü &quot; Kshara&rdquo; (because he is in contact with matter which is subject to change) All beings (from Brahma to the blade of grass) are &lsquo;Ksharas&rsquo; or Baddhas. The mukta or the soul wbich has obtained release from contact with matter is no longer subject to change and is called akshara or Kootastha (because it is imputable). The third class</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>50 of jivas are the Sūris who are described as seeing eternally the transcendental world beyond matter. The third class of &ldquo;Real&rsquo; is Iswara who has been thus described :- He is all ;10 He knows all; He sees all; He possesses all strength, all knowledge, all power, all wealth : He is without fatigue, without lassitude, without fear, without anger, without desire and other such (blemishes). Thus has the nature of Iswara been taught,</p>
<p>Thus the three realities consist of the Ruler and the Ruled (the latter including prakriti and the sentient beings) and our Acharyas (Sri Yamunacharya and Sri Ramanujacharya) have stated this concisely in the words &ldquo;(Iswara)&rdquo; on whom depend the essential nature (svarūpa), the continuance (sthiti) and the actively (pravritti) of the three kinds of sentient beings and of non-sentient things with all their differences&rdquo;. The three kinds of sentient beings are those that are in bondage (baddha), those that have obtained release (mukta) kod those that are eternally free (nitya). The three kinds of non-sentient things are Prakriti with its three qualities (satvam, rajas and tamas). Time, and Suddhasatvam. The essential nature (svarīpa) means the substance or thing which is defined by attributes peculiar and unique to it. Continuance (sthiti, means continuance of the thing or object in time. This is eternal for eternal things. In the case of non-eternal things, this continuance is subject to expansion and contraction in accordance with the will of Iswara. Activity or pravritti includes action and abstention from action. All these three : the essential nature (svarupa), the continuance in time (sthithi) and the activity (pravritti) are seen (by perception and other praniņas) to be ditferent in the case of each tbing or object,</p>

<p>THE THREE REALS</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>When the pramānas or sources of knowledge (like peroeption and inference) reveal an object or thing, they disclose the essential Dature or svarüpa of the object, the attributes that define it, the (other) qualities of the object so defined and also its activities. The essential oature is always revealed as endowed with the attributes that define it. It is aot possible to speak of the essential nature of a thing (svarīpa) except in terms of the respective attributes. To speak of an object minus its attributes woald be as meaningless as to speak of a bare&rsquo;s horns.</p>
<p>THE NATURE OF THE JIVA.</p>
<p>Therefore the essential nature (svarūpa) of the jīva way be described as jnāna (knowledge), bliss (ānanda), (amala) being pare, and being atomic (anu) in terms of its defining attributes (i. e.) being of the nature of knowledge, being of the nature of bliss, being pure and being atomic. This reality, viz. the jiva is always sesha to Iswara (i.e.) it exists only for Iswara and it is un. conditional sesha only to Him. Thus its existing (always) for the Lord is affirmed (ayogavyavaccheda) and also its existing for no other than the Lord (anya yogavyavaccheda). This quality of being s&rsquo;esha to the Lord, which is disclosed in the first word of Tirumantra, Damely on (aun), is of the nature of &amp; rela tionship ( sambandha) and requires, therefore, a thing having that relationship and cannot be understood without it. So this s&rsquo;eshatva may be called an additional quality of a thing, namely, the jīva, which has already been defined by its defining attributes. Here the definition of the jīva is that it is a thing which is sentient while being also atomic. Similarly the jiva may also be defined as a thing which is sentient while being also, by its nature, s&rsquo;esha. So this quality of being sesha may also be called an attribute which defines the thing, vix, the jīva. Similarly Iswara may be defined as having sentience along with omnipresence (vibhu). He may also be defined as one that is absolutely independent of everything else, while being the unconditional seshin (i a.) one for whom all other things exist (unconditionally). The class of ñtmas which includes CHAPTER</p>
<p>jivas and Iswara may be defined as those that are sentient and pratyak (i.e.) which are subjective and have inwardness. To be sentient is to be the possessor of koon ledge. To be subjective or inward (or pratyak) is to possens luminosity to oneelf. The atmā or soul is self-luminous and shines as I' without the help of the attributive knowledge *(dharmabhiita jnana). Since sentience and inwardness (pratyaktva) are common to both jīvas and Iswara, the jiva has to be defined as having, in addition, dependance by its very nature (on Iswara). In the Ashtakshara, in the dative of the first syllable (āya) a in aun (om), the jiva&rsquo;s existence for the fulfilment of Iswara&rsquo;s purposes is stated without any condition; therefore the jiva is unconditionally and absolutely dependent upon the Lord of Sri (Lakshmi), who is the universal Savionr. This state ment of the absolute relationship between the jivu and Iswara throughout the existence (of the former ) is called a yogavyavac cheda or denial of the non-existence of the relationship. The second syllable u ip aum (0m) in Ashtūkshara means &lsquo;only&rsquo; and brings out the idea that tbe jīva exists for the purposes of only Iswara and denies bis dependence or existence for the sake of any others. This denial is called anya-yogavyavaccheda or denial of (the jiva&rsquo;s ) relationsbip with others. We will show later that this seshatva extends from the Lord to His devotees as well. The activity of sentient beings consists in their being the doers and the enjoyers subject to Iswara&rsquo;s will and purpose. Since this activity and this capacity for enjoyment are given to them by Him, they are for His purposes and not their own.</p>
<p>BADDHAS :</p>
<p>The difference between sentient beings that are in bondage and others consists in the former having avidyā (ignorance), karma, the impressions left by past karma (tāsana) the inclina. tions due to them (ruchi or taste for worldly enjoyment) and</p>
<p>*NOTE:- The soul is of the nature of Inana or knowledge (i.c.) its</p>
<p>svarupa is knowledge. At the same time the soul has knowledge as an attribute and this fnana or knowledge is called Dharma bhuta jnana or attributive knowledge.</p>
<p>THE THREE REALS</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>association with prakriti or matter. The differences existing mutually among jīvas in respect of knowledge, pleasures and the like may be seen in the groups of jivas ranging from Brahma to a blade of grass.</p>
<p>These bound souls sapport bodies given to them by Iswara in accordance with their respective karma, both by their essential nature (svarupa) as jnāna and by their attributive knowledge (dharına bhūta jnana). The support given to the body by the essential nature (svarūpa) serves to make it exist. The support given to it by the attributive knowledge or dharmabhūtājnāna, while in such states as waking, serves to enable the body to be useful for securing the ends or goal of life and for adopting the means to secare these ends. In the case of the supreme devotee who has already adopted the means of attaining mukti, the support given by attributive knowledge makes the body aseful for the enjoyment of Bhagavan and for rendering service to Him. In the case of singers, this support given to the body is productive of adverse experiences. When the jīva leaves the body, the latter undergoes disintegration, The constituent substances of the body into wbich it disintegrates (such as the five elements) remain the body of Iswara. As regards continuance in time (sthiti), the specific character of souls in bondage, as distinguished from others, is continuous association with the body until mukti. As regards activities, these fivas in bondage have three kinds: punya, püpa and that which is neither of these two.</p>
<p>MUKTAS:</p>
<p>The difference between released souls and others is that the former have attained their essential nature in a manifest condition by the removal of obstacles. As regards their continuance in time (sthiti), their distinctive feature consists in this their essential Dature (svarūpa), which has become manifest, will continue to be 80 without any end. Among souls that have attained mukti or release, the mutual difference is their having attained the manifes tation of their essential nature earlier or later. The difference in</p>
<p>54 CHAPTER</p>
<p>their activities consists in specific kinds of service to the Lord chosen by each and prompted by love, which has resulted from the perfect enjoyment of Bhagavan gained after the loss of it from time immemorial.</p>
<p>NITYAS:</p>
<p>The specific and distinctive feature of the nityas (the eter. nally free) is that the manifestation of their essential nature (svarūpa) is without any beginning and also their absolute depen. dence (on the Lord): The specific feature of their continued existence in time is that their enjoyment of the *Seshi is begin. ningless. Since this is common to all nityas, there is no mutual difference between tbeir respective states of continuous existence in time. The difference in their activities consists in the continu. ous performance of specific kinds of service to the Lord from beginningless time which, though different, yet form a continuous stream of service. It has been said that such nityas is Ananta (Sesha ) add Garuda hold certain specific offices and perform specific kinds of service in due relation to them. If so, it may be asked, how it would be possible to reconcile this with the statement (made by Sri Ramanuja in the gadya) that nityas (the eternally free) and muktas (who have attained moksha) have all access to all kinds of service. The answer is that they are not barred from any form of service which is pleasing to them and is in accordance with the will of the Lord and that no one of them ever desires to render the forius of service which have been specially marked off for others. Besides the service rendered by any one of them is as pleasing to the Lord as that doue by others; therefore the service rendered by any one of them gives the same pleasure of service to all of them. There is no difference in the delight which results from the service as its fruit. Hence there is nothing unreasonable io stating that all of them have access to every form of service.</p>

<p>THE THREE REALS</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>DHARMABHUTAJNANA&quot;</p>
<p>(Attributive knowledge).</p>
<p>To all these ātmās or souls, in the same way as their essential nature (svarūpa) is that of a substance, their attributive knowledge (dharmabhūtājnana) is also a substance. Its essential nature bas not been separately referred to in the passage because of its having been included as an attribute to the soul.</p>
<p>(Note: Passage : the passage which refers to the three kinds of achetana in quotation 11 on p. 50).</p>
<p>This attributive knowledge is luminous by itself to the soul which possesses it, while revealing objects. That is, when the attributive knowledge reveals, for example, a pot to the soul which possesses that attributive kaowledge, it reveals its own existence as well). To Iswara and the nityas (the eternally free), this attributive knowledge ia eternally all-pervasive. For others in the state of sansāra or bondage, it is subject to varying degrees of contraction and expansion owing to karma. In the state of mukti, it is all. pervasive for all released souls, owing to perfect expansion and remains so throughout. The functions (pravritti) of attributive knowledge are as follows :- It discloses objects (external or in. terpal); while willing or making an effort, it directs the body (and tbe senses etc.); in the state of bondage, it undergoes contraction and expansion; it undergoes experiences (bhoga) which reveal objects as agreeable or disagreeable. Experience or Bhoga is the process of feeling a thing as agreeable or disagreeable. All objects, which are among the glories of Iswara, are, by their very nature, Agreeable and are enjoyed as being Agreeable by Iswara, the nityas and the souls that have attained moksha. To those in samsāra, however, these objects appear at different timus, and in</p>
<p>• According to Visistadvaitinms, the self or atma is, in its essential naturo</p>
<p>or svarupa, knowledge. It also possesses jnana or knowledge as its dharma or attribute.&quot; This knowledge is called dharmabhutanana or attributive knowledte</p>
<p>(See p. 52 foot-noto)</p>
<p>56 CHAPTER</p>
<p>different places and in relation to different jivas as slightly agree. able, or disagreeable, or indifferent, but these variations do not belong to them by nature. Their slight agreeableness, disagree. ableness, or being neither of the two is the fruit of the past actions of the jivas awarded to them by Iswara, whose will is irresistible. The jīvas that are in bondage are subject to the experience of the fruits of their karma, both by nature and by auxiliary causes. By nature they are subject to it, because they are sentient beings entirely under the control of another (Iswara). The auxiliary causes are their having cowmitted offences against the Lord. In the case of muktas and nityas, although, by their nature as being subject to the control of Iswara, the experience of the fruit of action might be possible, set since they never perform any action displeasing to Him, there are no auxiliary causes for such experiences. Iswara, by His essential nature, is not sub ject to such experience or enjoyinent of the fruits of action, since He stands as the Ruler over all and with no one else to command Him. Nor are there any auxiliary causes in His case, as there is no one whose commands He may be said to bave disobeyed.</p>
<p>The essential nature (svarīpa) of all ātmās, jīvās as well as Iswara, is being self.luminous to oneself. This luminosity of the self to itself suffers, even in the case of those in bondage, no contraction or expansion at any time. The attributive knowledge (dharmabhūtajnana) of all ātmās is laminious to its supporting self, while disclosing objects (like pots). A common characteristic of svarūpa jnana or the self and attributive knowledge or dharniabhūtajrāna is their both being of the nature of knowledge and being self-luminous (i.e.) being luminous without requiring anything else to light them up. Attriba tive knowledge has the additional characteristic of revealing or dis closing objects (vishayitva). The additional characteristic possessed by svarüpajnāna (or the self) is subjectiveness or inwardness (pratyaktva). Jnana or knowledge, (which is the character of both of them), may be defined as that which makes &amp; thing laminous; that is, it makes either itself or something else fit for being spoken</p>
<p>THE THREE REALS</p>
<p>about and acted upon (vyavahāra). Self-luminosity is the capability of being luminous without the need of any other known ledge to illumine it. Attributive knowledge has visha yitva, because it discloses objects other than itself (like pots, cloths etc.) The subjectiveness or inwardness of souls or ātmās (pratyaktva) consists in their being luminous to themselves ; that is, the benefit of their luminosity is enjoyed by themselves The atma or self is the recipient of the benefit of every object being disclosed or revealed. Pratyaktva is only a special instance of this general, statement, for in it, the self receives the benefit of its own dism closure or revelation. A thing which does not possess this pratyaktva or subjectiveness does not also possess the common benefit of objects being disclosed. It cannot, therefore, be called sentient. Though subjective knowledge or the &lsquo;I&rsquo; and attributive kaowledge, which is its attribute, are both luminous by themselves, yet they are also capable of being apprebended by other forms of knowledge (like that from sõstras), as being endowed with attri butes like being eternal. When one&rsquo;s attributive knowledge happens to be known or apprebended by one with the help of another piece of knowledge, the latter is called another piece of knowledge, merely because of the direction to wbich the attributive knowledge is turned. When we perceive an object, say a pot, dharmabhūtajnana contacts the object and reveals it to the soul or self; but when the dharnabhiitaj nāna itself becomes the object of knowledge, it is revealed to the self by a part of it.</p>
<p>THE THREE KINDS OF NON-SENTIENT BEINGS :</p>
<p>The three classes of non-sentient things are capable of being apprehended only by others, and not by themselves). Non sentience means being without the possession of knowledge. To be capable of being apprehended only by others means that their apprehension is not to themselves or for their own benefit. These two (viz. being without the possession of knowledge and the apprehension not being for their own benefit) are true also of attributive knowledge (dharmabhitajnana), which is thas a non sentient thing. CHAPTER</p>
<p>Of the three classes of non-sentient things, mattor (Prakriti) and time (Kala) ere jada (i.e.) not luminous by themselves. There are some who hold that suddha-satvam is also jada. To be jada is to be without self-laminosity. Those who have studied such treatises as Pancharātra or the Lord&rsquo;s Sāstra would say that suddhasatvam is luminous by itself, as it is declared to be so in that sāstra. It may be asked wby, if it is luminous by itself, it is not directly perceived by beings in the state of samsāra, with out having to be known through sāstra only. The answer is as follows T&rsquo;he soul whose essential nature (svarūpa) is knowledge and its attributive knowledge are both laminous by themselves and yet the former is luminous to itself and not to other souls, who have to know it with the help of their own attributive knowledge. Attributive knowledge, though luminous to its substrate, namely the soul, is not luminous to others. In the same way, the suddha. satvam inay be luminous by itself oply to Iswara, the muktus and the nityas and not to others. There is nothing unreasonable in this view.</p>
<p>It has been said in the following sloka :</p>
<p>“We &lsquo;bow to Hari and proceed to expound the s&rsquo;astra called Nyāya-Tatva :- to Hari who sees, directly by perception and of His own accord, all things simultaneously.&quot; It may be asked how, to Iswara who sees all things with His attributive knowledge, suddha-satvam could be * luminous by itself, when it is illumina ted by the attributive knowledge of Iswara. The answer is as follows - Iswara&rsquo;s attributive knowledge apprebends all things includiog His own divine svartipa and yet do we not hold that His divine form is luminous by itself? So also it is possible that suddhasatuam is self-luminous, tbough it is apprehended also by the attributive knowledge of Iswara. This is true also of nityas. When lighting up an object (like a pot), attributive knowledge, it</p>
<p>*NOTE:- A pot is not luminous, hecause it bocomes visible or is seen only when lighted up by the flame of a lamp. The flame of a lamp is luminous, because it does not require anything else to become visible.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Nyaya-tatvam: Mangala słoka.</li>
</ol>
<p>THE THREE REALS</p>
<p>bas already been said, is luminous by itself only to its sub-strate, Oamely, the self or soul. In tbe same way suddhi-satvan may be luminous by itself to those that have attained release in their new state. There is nothing inconceivable in this. The luminosity of attributive knowledge is obstructed at the time when it is not light ing up external objects (like pots ), by past karmu of certain kiads. So also the luminosity of suddhasatva. may meet with obstruction in the state of bondage and may not, therefore, be apprehended by those in sansāra.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA,</p>
<p>The luminosity of (attributive) knowledge is natural to it (svibhavika), after release from samsūru, but is obstructed some. times during bondage. So also in this case, (there may be obst ruction during samsāra and luminousness after release)&quot;.</p>
<p>Substances which are subject to inodification (vikūrī) are some times agreeable and sometimes disagreeable to the same individual and to different individuals. (Similarly suddha-satvam may be luminous to God, the eternally free souls and those souls that have attained release from bondage, while being non-luminous to those in bondage.) There is no contradiction in this. In matters as certained by the authority of the Scriptures, it is no use pointing out inconsistency based on analogy. If, without accepting this principle, we were to say that suddha satvain is said to be lumi. nous not in reality, but by courtesy, as it were, or figuratively (upachāra), it might become possible to argue that knowledge, bliss etc. are also true of the self or soul only figuratively and not in truth. It may be asked :-&quot; How could there be, in a luminous object (viz. s&rsquo;uddhasatvam), qualities like form and taste and classifications like earth and water and also modific tiops. Self luminous things like the soul and attributive knowledge do not, in general, have shape, tiste, smell and the like)&quot;? The answer is as follows:- (All self-luminous objects are not alike but have diffe rences peculiar to each); for example, knowledge or self which is CAAPTER</p>
<p>the substrate (1.e. the soul) and attributive knowledge, though both are luminous, are different from each other in other respects. Knowledge, wbich is the substrate, has subjectivity, while attributive knowledge is objective, and apprehends objects. So this objection can be given a coanter-check (pratibandhi) and cannot hold good in a matter where the authority of the Sastra must be accepted. Suddhasatvam, which is luminous, is included among the three classes of non-sentient things, because it has not the quality of sentience or being the knower. The activities (pravritti) of these three kinds of pon-sentient things are of the nature of varied modifications (pariņāma) in accordance with the will of Iswara.</p>
<p>PRAKRITI.</p>
<p>Among these, prakriti or watter is, in its essential datore, possessed of three qualities or attributes. Prakriti or matter is constantly subject to modification. When its three qualities satvam, rajas and tamas are evenly balanced, there is dissolu. tion or termination of the world (mahüpralayam) and when theso qualities are uneven in proportions, prakriti undergoes modifica tions into mahat and the like. The region of matter which is not modified and the region which has become modified have been classified by the Sāstras into twenty-four tatvās or reals - prakriti, mahut, ahankāra, tanınātras (five), the elements (bhūtas) (five) and the senses (eleven) - the senses of knowledge (five), the senses of action (five) and the mind (manas).</p>
<p>Sometimes they are spoken of as more than twenty-four or less than twenty-four in accordance with the terms or basis of classification. Tbe subdivisions of each of these classes of tatvas or reals, and the deities (abhimāni devatās ) presiding over or representing each of them should be understood by those who are qualified for their respective meditation. What we are primarily concerned with bere is their being different from the atmā or self. These may all be understood as weapons and ornaments of the Supreme Being, in the following way</p>
<p>THE THREE REALS</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>The self or soul is the invaluable gem, (koustubha); prakriti or matter is the mole on the Lord&rsquo;s body (Srivatsa); the tatva.or real called mahat is His club; knowledge and igaorance (jnana and ajnāna) are His sword and its sheath; the ahankāras are His bow and conch (tamasa ahankāra is the bow (sārnga ) and sātvika ahankāra the conch); the mind is His discus (chakra); the ten senses are arrows; the tannātras and the bhūtas (the elements) form His vanamālā (vaijayanti) or gar. land of wild flowers; Garuda is the Veda and Sri Krishna (Kannan) the object of description in the Veda, is endowed with these and protects all from the top of Hastigiri&quot;.</p>
<p>The distinctive features of each of these twenty-four reals&rsquo; niay be seen in their respective definitions. Of these the twenty three reals which are effects and modifications of prakriti and also their effects and modifications differ from one another in their nature and these differences may be understood from a study of the purānas.</p>
<p>ESSENTIAL NATURE, ACTIVITY ETC. OF PRAKRITI:</p>
<p>Suddhasatvam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satvain or Suddhasatvam illuinines its own existence; it is different from the quality called sātvan&rdquo; &ldquo;The creator is beyond tamas;' &ldquo;It is different from&rdquo; prakriti and is revered by the gods&rdquo;. These and other passages declare the existence of a region (of s&rsquo;uddha satvam) beyond tamas. Therefore the passages which say &ldquo;It (Prakriti) is eternal and has no limits and is beyond all measure. It is endless and incapable of being mea. sured” should be understood as stating that moola prakriti or</p>

</ol>
<p>OR AFTER</p>
<p>matter is endless or infinite except for the region covered by the nitya vibhūti (the region of eternal glory).</p>
<p>The activity or pravritti of matter (or prakriti) is to become modified with its three qualities duly balanced ( during pralaya), and with them as ageven after creation (srishti), for the sake of the experience of souls bound in samsarā, and for their release from bondage and so also for the delectation or tita of Iswara. It also acts in various ways, having assumed the forms of the body and the senses. Owing to the qualities of rajas and tamas in it, it conceals the truths concerning the reals' (tatvas) and gives rise to false or erroneous knowledge. While existing for the expe riences of the baddha during samsāra, it may also reveal the tatvas or &lsquo;reals. just as they are, when the quality of satvam in it is developed and may help in the striving for anoksha. All these contribute to the delectation or lilii of Iswara.</p>
<p>Suddhasatvan is, in its essential nature (svarīpa), the seat or abode of that satvam which is unmixed with rajas and tamas. Its specific state in time or sthiti is eternal in the (permanent) halls and towers (of Vaikunta) and in the specific and permanent forms of Iswara and the eternally free. It is not eternal but tempor ary in such things as the forms that come into existence out of a temporary desire of Iswara, of the nityas and of the muktas. Its specific activity is to undergo modifications to suit their desires so as to serve as accessories for the enjoyment (Dhoga) of Iswara, the s&rsquo;eshi, and as instruments for the service to be rendered by the seshas.</p>
<p>TIME: Kāla.</p>
<p>Time or Küla is, in its essential nature, non-sentient or non luminous and all-pervasive (vibhu). It is eternal because its continued existence ( sthiti) is not limited by time. Its activity consists in its being accessory to creation and the like by such divisions as kală (1/30 of muhurtha ), kashta (1/30 of kala) and the like.</p>
<p>THE THREE REALS</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>All these substances (dravya ) are, in their essential satare (svarupa), eternal. Some of them are said to be temporary or transient, owiag to their assuming &amp; new state or condition (avastha), which justifies their being called by &amp; new Dame. As new states similar to those which have perished follow each other in continuous succession, they are said to be eternal in the sense of a stream or current of water (retaining the same form, though the water at any time may be different ).</p>
<p>The essential nature (svarīpa), the existence in time (sthiti), and the activity (pravritti) of all these substances are dependent upon Iswara, because they have no existence etc, apart from His existence and without His will or desire. Therefore it is duc to Iswara&rsquo;s will that all substances are, by their very natore, agreeable. From this it follows that to Iswara, to the eternally free and to the released souls, they are all agreeable. To those bound in samsāra, however, they appear as disagreeable or as only slightly agreeable at different times and to different persons in accordance with the karma of those persons. Even to bound souls, the essential Dature of their own self or soul is always to be agreeable, as such is the will of Iswara. It is indeed, because of this false identification with the self which is agreeable and also karma, that the body which is disagreeable appears agreeable to those who are ignorant. Since prakriti and its modifications are harmful owing to karma, the man who desires release from bond. age should abandon the attachment to them. To those that have attained moksha, however, these very things are agreeable and not to be rejected. All those things that are taken for one&rsquo;s own with the notion of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mine&rsquo; are barmful. They become agreeable, when a rpan has come to understand bis real nature and to realise that these things exist for the purposes of the Lord. We will ex plain this matter at length when we come to speak of the perfect and complete enjoyment of (the bliss of ) Brahman.</p>
<p>ISWARA : The essential nature (svarūpa ) of Iswara on whom depends the existence of all thioge is truth (satyam), knowledge (ināna),</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>, CHAPTER</p>
<p>infiniteness ( ananta ), bliss (ananda ) and purity (amalatvam ) because of attributes like being truth, being knowledge, being infinite, being blissful and being pare. These attributes define His svarūpa or essential nature. This truth is brought out by the Alwars in the following passages: &ldquo;Thou &ldquo;art light that never becomes extinct and is not capable of being measured&rdquo; (where His essential nature as Truth and Kaowledge is revealed as also His infiniteness ) &quot; Thon that tart perfect kpowledge and bliss&rdquo; and “Thou &ldquo;that envelopest all and art a Light greater than all other ligbts, being both knowledge ard bliss&rdquo; &ldquo;He is **the Pure&rdquo;. In these and other ways the Alwars medi. tated on Him. His other qualities, along with His divine and auspicious form and such other things, are attributes of His essen tial nature ( svarūpa) already defined by those attributes. Among these qualities knowledge, strength, lordship, valour, energy, splendour-these six are associated with His nature as the Supreme Being. Goodness, spontaneous love, and the like are qualities that make bim easily accessible to all. These qualities are, at all times, connected with His essential pature (svarüpa ). The statement that some of these qualities are associated with the Sapreme Person (Para), some with vylíha and so forth is only to show what qualities the Lord of all reveals to those who are devoted to any of these manifestations of His. (It does not mean that the other qualities are absent in any of these forms). Just as in the respective vidyas of the Upanishads, we are to meditate on certain specified attributes of Brabman, so also certain specified attributes are to be meditated upon in connection with particular forms of the Lord as revealed in Pūncharātra or the Scripture of the Lord. In the Para or Supreme Vasudeva, all the six &ldquo;qualities</p>

<p>THE THREE REALS..</p>
<p>beginning with knowledge. are to be thought of. The sāstras sometimes say that the vyuhas (or emanations ) are four&rsquo; and in some places that they are three. Wbere it is said that there are four vyūhas and that Vasudeva is one of them, since there is no difference in the qualities to be meditated on between the Supreme Vasudeva and the Vyžiha Vasudeva, it is tantamount to saying that there are three vyuhas. Those who hold that the vyāhas are three state their view briefly in the following sloka :- &ldquo;O Lord,</p>
<p>Thy original form shone with these six attributes; then came three forms of Thine which had, each of them, &amp; couple of these attributes.&rdquo; Their respective qualities and activities are epitomised in the following sloka :&ndash; &ldquo;O, Sovereign of Sriranga! As the Supreme Vasudeva (Para) endowed with all the six quali. ties, you are the object of blissful enjoyment for those that have attained moksha; as Sankarshana being endowed with strength and knowledge, you destroy the Universe and also promulgate the sāstras; as Pradyumna being endowed with lordship and virility, you create the Universe and make Dharma prevail; as Aniruddha being endowed with splendour and the power to overcome others, you protect the world and teach the Truth. In this way you divide yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The differences arising from planes like the waking state have been thus summarised :-&ldquo;O Lord, * of **those that meditate on Thee, some are like those in the waking state, some like those that dream in sleep, others like those that sleep without dreams, and others still are like those that have fallen into a swoon. (In the first group, the senses function, in the second the senses do pot function, only the wind is active; in the third group oven the wind does not function; they only breathe; in the fourth group even the breath is suspended). In the same way, O Lord, Thou art in four forins and dividest Thyself into four forms and art meditated upon with attributes and weapons suited to each.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The twelve forms that begin with Kesava are' other forms derived from the vyūhas. (Bhagavan also wanifests Himself as vibhavas.) These vibhavas are thirty odd forms like Padmanabha. Among them Avatars like Mutsya and Kurma are specified in relation to some specific purpose. In these vibhavas or avatārs, Iswara conceals those attributes of His which He wants to conceal and reveals those attributes which He wants to reveal to suit the special mission which He has undertaken in them. Among them, there are varied manifestations which are countlpde. So has it been said, &ldquo;The &ldquo;forms of Krishna ere in numerable&rdquo;, Other forms similarly derived from the vibhavas can also be seen in the süstras. Sometimes the Lord enters into some jivas with His own specific form and into others with His energy (sakti) and accomplishes wonderful things. These belong to another class of vibhavas. The forms of the Supreme Vasudeva (Para), the Vyuhas and the Vibhuvas assume the *forms of the images and enter into the shapes of images (installed in temples), for the sake of devotees as desired by them. This ja archāva. tara: The Lord is (also) present in a subtle form in the hearts of all jivas. This form is called Antarpāmi Avatāra, as medita tion on this form has been prescribed as the means which enables those who wish to enter into the meditation of the Antaryāmin or the divine all-pervading svarüpa of the Lord. It has been said of this meditation: &ldquo;Those *who have attained success in Ashtanga yoga and who are desirous of worshipping the one who dwells in the beart are fit to mediate on the one (i.e.! the form in which He dwells in the hearts of all.&rdquo; Therefore this One (Hārda) is spoken as Antaryāmi.</p>
<p>All these forms of incarpation are constituted of the substance called s&rsquo;uddhasatvam and have no connection with karma or its fruits. They are therefore called pure creation (s&rsquo;uddha srishti).</p>

<p>THE THREE REALS</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>These avatārs (vibhava, archa and Hārda ) are all real; in them there is no coptraction or abridgement of jnana and the other attributes of Iswara; the bodies of these avatārs are made of Suddha-satvam; the reason for these avatars is only the Lord&rsquo;s will; their time of manifestation is the time when dharma has to be safe-guarded; their purpose is the protection of the good and the like; those who meditate on these avatars with clear know edge may attain moksha at the end of this very life without any future birth, by their successful adoption of the right means suited to their competency and capacity. All these truths have. been explained by the Gitācharya in five slokas beginning with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bahuni me 26A vyatītāni etc.&rdquo; Many are the births that I have gone through, just like you.</p>
<p>This meditation on the vibhavas (or avatārs) creates sup reme faith or confidence (mahāvisvāsa) in the mind of the seeker after salvation who seeks prapatti as an independent means or upāya, by affording him a knowledge of the great qualities of the Lord who is sought as the refuge and this at the moment when he adopts prapatti as the means. So also the worship of Archāva.' tāra (the image) will lead easily to moksha. Bhagavan Sounaka has said :-*&rdquo; Having shaped a beautiful image of Vishnu with a lovely face and lovely eyes, out of gold, silver and the like in a manner that would be pleasing, one should adore it, bow to it, sacrifice to it and meditate on it. By doing so, one would enter into that form which is none other than Brabman and will have all one&rsquo;s sins dispelled.&rdquo; The Alwars, too, very largely dwelt on this secret doctrine about the Lord&rsquo;s avatārs and the distinctive excellence of the avatars in the form of archa or consecrated images and considered the Supreme Self (in Vaikunta) as their original cause.</p>
<p>Iswara, who is in these varied forms, creates, maintains and destroys all, is also the giver of moksha and has such other acti</p>

<p>vities. These activities of His are dae to the over.flow of His bliss or ānanda.</p>
<p>LAKSHMI</p>
<p>Iswara is with His consort in all situations as stated in pass ages like : &ldquo;Lakshmi, the mother of the world, is eternal and inseparable from Vishnu.&rdquo; This may also be clearly understood from the writings of Parasara and Parankusa (Nammalwar), who, for the help which they have rendered, have been spoken of by Alavandar with great regard in these terms: &ldquo;I bow to the gene rous sage, Parasara, who composed that gem of a purāņa (Vish. mupurāna), wherein he discloses, as they are in reality, the truths concerning cit, acit apd Iswara, their distinctive pature, swarga, moksha and the means of attaining them&rdquo; and &ldquo;I bow my head at the two feet of Nammalwar fragrant with vakula flowers, for they are, to all those who are connected with me, mother, father, wives, 8008 and all forms of wealth and lordship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this context, we bave to understand a difference in their activities or division of labour, as it were ; for the Lord is con cerned with the punishment (of the evildoer) and Lakshmi with pleading to Him for mercy on behalf of the sinner; the Mimām. sakas have declared that the object which is stated by analogy to have attributes similar to those of another object actually described must be different by that very circumstance* from that other object. So in this case, as it bas been stated by analogy or atides&rsquo;a &ldquo;Jast 28A as Vishnu is everywhere, so algo in Lakshmi, o best of Brahmins&rdquo;, there should be a difference between Bhagavan and Lakshmi. This difference should be understood as referring (here) oply to the difference in their functions or activities. This is the conclusion arrived at in the following sloka in Srigunaratna</p>

<p>kosa; &ldquo;Youth and other attributes are common to both of you; however the Lord has manly qualities, like independence, conquest of foes, firmness and the like; you have such feminine qualities as existing solely for the husband, compassion and forgiveness. Thus you two have taken diverse qualities.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is impossible to understand the real nature of God&rdquo;, says Nammalvar in (1-3-6) So in a matter like this, yain assertion or insistence is aot proper,</p>
<p>As has been said: &ldquo;Some make * weak cases appear strong.&rdquo; Although it is possible to prove whatever we please with the help of our proficiency in logical disputation, we submit to the Authority of the sāstras. Therefore we should understand clearly the truth concerning the Real or Tatva that rules and the reals or tatvas that are ruled, only in accordance with the pramanas. We need not try to know all things but should try to know what is ex ceedingly useful. In matters which are only of limited use, we need not be so curious to obtain knowledge. The pilot tries to know just as much about the (vast) ocean 88 would enable him to steer the sbip along the right path. Similarly we bave to under stand necessarily as mach as has been said here. In order to obtain unshakable conviction ( about these truths), more elaborate treatises may be studied.</p>
<p>OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE TATVAS</p>
<p>OR &ldquo;REALS':</p>
<p>Here we have classified the Tatvas into three. So also some consider Iswara 48 the only real or Tatva, because all other reals are His attributes. Some have classified the tatvas into two as follow The ruler and the raled; the self and the non-self; the means and the end (upaya and upeya ). Some classify what should be known into four : the Saviour and that which is to be saved; that which should be rejected and that which should be accepted. Others classify what should be known ander five heada 88 pointed out before and others into six. In the Rahasyasāstras,</p>
<p>.</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>Mahabharata : Sabhaparva: 39–5.</li>
</ol>
<p>70 CHAPTER</p>
<p>what should be known is stated to be seven. To all those who think in those varied ways, there are respective advantages accru. ing to the strengthening of their knowledge and their daily observances.</p>
<p>What is said in the following sloka, is of coarse true: &ldquo;A knowledge of the s&rsquo;āstras can be obtained only with the greatest difficulty. Further it may upsettle the mind. Therefore having obtained a knowledge of Hari from the teacbing of the guru, a Inan should cease from all such activities.&rdquo; This does not mean that one should make no attenupt to learn the sāstras. It only means that one should learn what is most important as quickly as possible and proceed at once to adopt the means learnt therefrom for attaining moksha, without spending too much time over elaborate treatises, which might cause delay in the adoption of the means. The man who has enough to eat without tilling the soil woald never think of tilling it. So also without wasting time over what is unimportant, we should, as soon as possible, adopt the means prescribed for moksha,</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>A clear knowledge of wbat is uselal, indifference to the three ends (dharma, artha, and kama) and being one in thought, word and deed - these constitute the elixir of happiness.</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>Our ancient acharyas who gave as the essence of the Veda have, out of compassion (for us), taught us clearly all about the three wonderful and varied tatvas, cit, ucit and Iswara in order to remove,' from our minds, the cruel delasion in regard to the body arising from karma and the notion that we are independent (of the Lord).</p>
<p>THE THREE REALS.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>By the addition of a point here and the omission of &amp; point there, there are countless systems of thought, each appearing beautiful with fallacious arguments owing to the endless differences due to &lsquo;ia&rsquo; and &lsquo;is not&rsquo;. These are indeed as numerous as the poems composed by the imagination of poets (some omitting an incident and others inventing an incident and so forth). Notwith standing this, the unparralleled vision of the truth about the tatvas) will make them all yepish at once into thin air. When the man is seen in reality, the delusion that he is an animal or &amp; log of wood, sthāņu vanishes at once. So also when, with the help of the pramāṇas, Purushottama is ascertained as the Supreme Deity, the delusion that Rudra (Sthanu) or any other is the Supreme Deity is at once dispelled.</p>
