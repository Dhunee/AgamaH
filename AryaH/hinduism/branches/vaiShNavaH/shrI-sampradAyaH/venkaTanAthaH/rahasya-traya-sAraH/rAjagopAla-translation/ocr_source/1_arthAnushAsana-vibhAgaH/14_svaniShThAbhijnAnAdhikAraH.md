(14) THE CHAPTER ON THE MARKS OR SIGNS BY WHICH ONE CAN RECOGNISE THAT ONE IS 

IN THE PROPER STATE OR NISHTA. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA. 

To a man whose understanding is firmly and properly fixed on (a koowledge of) bis essential nature, on the upāya adopted by him, viz. brapatti and on the ultimate aim of life (purushürtha), & recognition that he is steadily fixed in this state gives more delight (even) than his approaching mokṣa. For by the might of this knowledge, he is able, with a disciplined mind, to close up the chasms lying before him (as obstacles) which are deep and hard to fill and which are as immense as the sky, 

I. Signs or marks regarding nishta in Svartpa 

How can a man kaow that he has firm faith or mishta (in regard to the knowledge of svariipa?) The answer is as follows: (1) when he is treated with such things as contumely by others, he would be free from sorrow or depression owing to the knowledge that these faults pertainiog to the body and the like (ugliness, low birth etc) have no connection (at all) with his essential nature, (2) It has been said:-"When one man' reviles another, the sin of the reviled person passes on to the reviler". So towards these fools that are to receive his sin by their derisive talk, he (the prapanna) should feel over-whelming campassion as stated in such ślokas as the following - "If other created beings harbour enmity and show hatred, the wise man pities them saying, "How wrapped up they are in great delusion!" and "One should very much pity the fool who does evil to himself by violating the süstras and straying from the right path and who is, therefore, like firewood destined for the flames of hell.” (8) The prapanna

would feel grateful to these revilers as being benefactors who remind him, by their censure, of faults which have been described in Alaya dar's \*śloka and in such verses as those of Tirumangai Alvar as fit to be reflected on in connection with oneself. (4) The prapanna (who has the nishta in svarvpa) would understand that all souls are dependent on Bhagavan owing to their essential nature, that all jivas (kṣetrajnas) are under the sway of past karma and that these revilers of his (therefore) revile him by the prompting of lewara, who is independent and is the seshi of all and who enjoys the līlā which follows from past karma in the relations between him and his revilers. He would therefore feel no aversion to them: (5) He would rejoice that his past sins which have begun to operate in this life are now being worked out in part. If he has these marks or characteristics as clarified in the explanation of the meaning of the first word (pranava) and the middle word na mama (namo) in the Moolamantra, the prapanna may consider that he has realised his difference from acit or matter, that he possesses knowledge which will enable him to act beneficially towards all beings, that he feels his being destitute of upāyas of any kind, that he knows his existing solely for the fulfil ment of the purposes of Bhagavan and is entirely dependent on him and should therefore do what is pleasing to the Lord, who, by His very nature, is impartial, who rewards (or punishes), each according to his karma, and who is the independent s'eshi for whom all else exist and that he understands that bis good can arige only from the will of another (ie) the Lord, as has been pointed out in the s'loka; “Where am I'who am so full of evil thoughts? Where is the possibility of my seeking what is good to me? 

NOTE:- Alawandar's śloka: 62. "How can I ever cross the sea of Sorrow and render service at Thy feet - I who have transgressed all the regula tions of the sastras who am mean, fickle-minded, cavious, ungrateful, arrogant, lustful, deceitful, wicked and sinful?" 

† The verses of Tirumangai Alwar: Peria Tirumozhi I - 1. "Born into this life, I fell into deep anguish of mind. I mingled with young women thinking it was greatly to be desired, until at last I realised that salvation consists only in the utterance of the name 'NARAYANA'. 4. Jitanta Stotram: 1-18

Direot me to do 

Therefore, O Thou, that controllest the gods! whatever is good for me, O Madhava!" 

II THE NISHTĀ CONCERNING UPAYA : 

II, in him, these features that follow are found, the man who has performed prapatti may infer that he is in the proper state in relation to the knowledge concerning the upāya (1) He under. stands that, for him, there is no protection from himself or from others and that Īśvara is bis only Protector : (2) Though he is confronted with causes of fear even to the extent of death, he does not bewail his state and feels satisfied as at the approach of what is desirable, for it has been said: "People are 'generally afraid of Death because they have not done what they should have done ; those who have done what they should do expect Death as if he were & welcome guest" (3) He has the perfect confidence of having found a Saviour. Sita Devi taught this by her example. "The beautiful Sita, resting on the arm of Sri Rāma, was not afraid at the sight of the elephant, the lion or the tiger (when she was with him in the forest)" She said to Ravana:-O Thou '(Rakṣasa) with ten heads that deservest to be reduced to ashes! because I have not obtained Sri Rāma's permission and because I have to cherish my tapas as a pativrată (a wife devoted to her husband), I do not burn thee to ashes by the flame (of my chastity) and likewise, "if Rāma who can destroy the forces of bis enemies fills Lanka with his arrows and take me away from here, it will be in keeping with bis character." In respect of the object for which he has made bharanyasu, the prapanna is without any further) effort of his own (to save himself). In that matter, he realises that the removal of what is evil and the attainment of what is good are in the Lord's hands alone. If he has these features, it may be inferred that he is steadfastly fixed in the upāya which be has sought and which is the means of obtaining all the benefits desired

by him, which is prescribed as an upāya in the first half of the Charama śloka, which is to be thought of in the first part of Dvaya and which is implicit also in the middle word of Tirumantra (namo). 

III THE NISHTĀ CONCERNING PURUSHĀRTHA: 

It has been said: "Of the three, your birth, continuance and perishing, why should you be anxious only about your continuance? In the same way as birth and death come of the uselves (without any choice being left to you), your continuance in life also will not depend on anything done by you" and again: "The "goddess of Lak. shmi comes, of her own accord, to one who does not exert himself in any way. Another man who makes efforts does not obtain even the food (he wants). This is in accordance with past karna". The prapan. na whose anderslanding is firinly fixed in the purushūrtha would not feel anxious in relation to such things as the maintenance of the body.which are directed by Īśvara in accordance with particular acts of past karma that have begun to operate in this life. He would reflect that, even if he grieved or felt anxious about these things, pothing would bappen except according to the will of God, as stated in the following passages:- "Though he "flies in the air, or enters the lower world, called Rasatala, or wanders about the whole earth, a man will not obtain what is not ordained for him" and again, “Whatever work is done in the world is work done by me. So others propose but I dispose." When things not forbidden in the yāstras come to him without any seeking of his and by the will of God, the prapanna realises that the debt which has resulted from past karma that has begun to operate is now being discharged. Therefore he enjoys them withont trying to avoid them. For it has been said in Parāsaragita and elsewbere - "House-bolders should receive whatever comes to them without any exertion on their part. As regards their dharmas, on the other hand, it is my opinion that they should, in all possible ways, exert themselves

and fulfil them”, and so also, “The "wise man should not be apxious about his food. He should think oply of his dharma. Man's food comes to him along with his birtb." Liko-wise it has been stated in Ajagaropakhyāna :-"I do "pot avoid enjoymente which come to me of themselves and which are also in keeping with (my) dharma nor do I seek any enjoyment which can be had only with painful effort." 

The prapanna who has attained nishta in purushārtha has neither pleasure nor pain, when he meets with or fails to get objects asually desired other than mokṣa, as taught in the follow ing ślokas :-"When one of these two, pleasure and pain, arrives, one should not feel delighted on seeing pleasure nor feel sorrow when one sees pain", and "The man who meditates on the feet of the Lord is not elated at the possession of wealth, nor does he feel dispirited when what he possesses is lost." He has, on the other hand, a great longing for service to the Lord which is suited to bis essential nature and which is the supreme aim of his life. This urgent longing for the object to be gained will make him cry out as in Aḷavandār's Stotram und in Sri Rāmanuja's gadya, "When, when sball I see, face to face, Bhagavan Narāyaṇa? When shall I press his two lotus-like feet on my head?" When such conduct and feeling are seen in the prapanna, it may be inferred that his mind is firmly fixed in regard to the supreme and infinite goal of existence which is indicated, as (an infinitesimal part of) the sea is by the finger, in the dative Nārāyarāya in Tirumantra, in the dative Nārāyaḥāya and in the word namas in Dvaya and in the sentence "I shall release thee from all sing" in Charama śloka, 

Thus by observing these signs in himself, the man may realise that he is well established in the state of a true prapanna in regard to his essential Dature (svarupa), bis upūya and his supreme aim (purushārtha) as stated in the slokeI am a self, not & body; I am the s'esha who exists only for Lord; I have

· no possessions of my own; I have songht His protection with the desire to render service to Him" and as understood also from Tirumantra and the like. To the prapanna who has seen in himself these sigos, there will be no causes of fear confronting him other than offence to those who know Brahman, which might occur (88 & possibility) on account of his living in the midst of enemies (the body and the senses), nor sources of delight other than the service which suits his essential nature. (This may be seen in the case of Sita devi) of whom it is said, "Sita' does not look at these Rakṣasis; she does not look at these trees full of flowers and fruits. Her heart is fixed on one alone and she sees only Sri Rāma". If by chance, these (other canses of fear and sources of delight) come before him, he will have neither fear por delight. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Those who have become well-established in their knowledge of the three things shown in the Tirumantra (namely, svarüpa, upāya, and purushārtha) will never agree to do what is improper and will do only what is proper. They are really wise men who find, in thevoselves, these attitudes and actions and they may be called eternal sūris living on the earth. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

In the interval between this life of worldly enjoyment and life after mokṣa - ( an interval) which may be compared to a mingling of the state of sleep and the waking state ---some destiny has placed prapannas for a time and they pass the rest of their lives wearing, on their heads, the garland of their nishtă in regard to tatva, upāya, and purushārtha, which has been vouchsafed to them by the Lord.
