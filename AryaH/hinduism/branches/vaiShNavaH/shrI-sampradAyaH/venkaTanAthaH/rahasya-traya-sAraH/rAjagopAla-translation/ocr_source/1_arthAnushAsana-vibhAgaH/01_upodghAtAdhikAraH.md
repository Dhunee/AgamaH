(1) INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER. 

SANSKRIT VERSE: 

I adore the regular and spotless succession of Acharyas which is well-known to extend upwards even to Bhagavan, It is by virtue of their grace that the essence of the meaning of the three secret mantras (mysteries) abides in my mind. 

SANSKRIT VERSE: 

I bow to those great men who have refuted the arguments of men \*that chop logic and ask, “Why and wherefore ?", in connection with the truths of) the śāstra which treats (in two parts) of karma and Brabman. They have thereby rendered clean the highroad that leads to the Lord of Hastigiri. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Lucky indeed are we in having an opportunity, in this world and every day, of meditating on the three mysteries (mantras) with great delight -- secrets which were taught to us with great earnestness for the removal of our dease ignorance by great souls endowed with compassion who sought the feet of the Spouse of the lotus-born Lakṣmī as their sole refuge and gave me also those feet for our protection. 

SANSKRIT VERSE: 

Though the Jiva is ever dear to the Lord (Houri) like the gem Kaustubha, be fails to obtain the paramount supremacy of service (to the Lord) owing to his ignorance; but being favoured

Appullar who established the importance of bhakti and prapatk by refüting the arguments of opponents in his writings.

with His glance at a turn in the tide of fortune, he attains to a knowledge of his real nature ( 48 one entirely dependent on God and existing only for Him ). This becomes possible by virtue of the teaching imparted to him by his gurus and thas he succeeds in saving himself. 

THE HERITAGE OF THE JĪVĀTMĀ. 

How the Jivātmā lost this heritage. The individual soul (Jivatma) has been declared in the diffe rent sāstras as being dear to the Lord of Lakṣmī even like the gem Kaustubha; be has been called the prince, the Lord's son, His disciple, His attendant, His dependant existing solely for Him \*(śeṣa ) and His servant. The Lord is his s'eshi for whose pur poses (alone) he esists by bis very nature. T'he Lord is the ruler of the eternal Suris, who are ever free from ignorance. He is possessed of unsurpassed auspicious qualities; He loves us as He does the lotus-born Lakṣmī. He is the Lord of men on earth and of the Suris in Heaven. As has been said “ The Lord of the Universe dwells in the Supreme Region of Vaikuṇṭha along with Lakṣmī," " +Thou art ever with Lakṣmī adorned with shiping bracelets". He dwells in the pure world of suddhasatva ( nitya vibhiti) along with His great queen and is seated on a couch, as described in such places as the Koushitaki Brāhmana, in a hall of splendour which is lit up with gems and stands on & thousand pillars, in the eternal and changeless city called by names like Ayodbya; for instance, it is said, "It is called Ayodhya and Aparajita and is beyond the world of svarga." The Lord is seated on the bed of the serpent called Sesha who is like an umbrella to the Lord when He moves about and like a throne whenever be is seated. He has been described "&g the Lord's abode, His bed, 

\*NOTE:- A Sūtra or aphorism in Purya Mimamsa says: “ That is called a 

śeṣa which serves the purpose of another (and that other is called a sesht) (e. g.) In a sacrifice, the grains of rice are śeṣa to the sacrifice which is seshi because they serve the purpose of the sacri

and His seat." Sesha, the serpent, is ever bent on serving the Lord in all places, at all times, and in all situations and enjoys rendering service of all kinds in varied embodied forms. As he is thus fulfilling the purposes of the Lord and has no other aims in life, he is, indeed, a real and unconditional Sesha and the name Sesha fits him in every way. The Lord shines on the bed of Sesha as the Supreme and ever-youthful Sovereign of Heaven. It is His gracious desire that all souls should enjoy His blissful state and attain their goal. The Jiva is thus entitled, by his. essential nature, to the service of His Master as his birthright in as high a degree as the eternal Sūris themselves who have the endless bliss of serving Him. But sunk in the sleep of beginningless Maya, he has fallen into the wilderness of matter (prakriti), has had repeated births in quick succession, has lost the primary aim of existence, has found no comfort or consolation, has lost the splendour of big real nature owing to evil desires and passions and is without a true knowledge concerning tatva (that which should be known for salvation and hita the means of attaining it). Well has it been said, "$ Trudging along the many thousand pathways of saṁsāra consisting of cycles of births and deaths, he has become deluded and exhausted and is covered with the dust of tendencies left by impressions in the mind." 

The parable of the prince brought up by huntsmen. 

The condition of the Jiva in sainsāra has been aptly des cribed in the following parable :- A certain king went out & hunting with the women of the harem and was keenly absorbed in the sport. The little prince lost his way even before he knew who be was and was brought up in a hamlet by tribesmen who found him wandering about (helpless). As he grew older, be identified himself with the people who brought him up and thought that he, too, was a savage tribesman, learnt their language as if it were his own and, like their own sops, ate their food and lived their life. Without knowing anything about the enjoyments, the

code of conduct and the traditions of his birth, he found his good and his evil, his joys and sorrows, in extremely gruesome things totally different from enjoyments befitting & prince. Though there were some wise and sage-like men who knew him as a prince, he was not accessible to them and lived like a savage without even the means of being born in a better life after death, owing to life-long savagery due to erroneous notions. The story is told of two parrots born of the same parents. One of them was brought up by holy men and the other by tanners who ate cow's flesh. The former said, "I was brought up by sages and he was brought up by tanners. I hear, every day, the speech of the sages and he bears the speech of tanners. You have yourself seen the difference between iny speech and the speech of the other bird. Goodness and wickedness are the result of (good and bad) associ. ation (respectively)". 

Such was the condition of the prince who lost his real charac ter and acquired a different nature. Similar is the state of the Jiva who, by identifying himself with the body, loses his real character and degumes & different nature. In the case of the prince (of the parable) some generous benefactors who were aware of his real birth (in a royal family) made ap their minds to save him (from savagery) by some means or other. They removed from bis mind bis false identification of bimself with the tribesmen and by discipline and training, physical and spiritual, enabled him to become gradually fit for princely enjoyments and the means of attaining them. They made him realise, both by precept and by example, what befitted him as a prince in matters connected with character and conduct and thus rendered him cap able of bating the mean and gruesome enjoyments of savage life and created in him the power of discrimination by which he could choose and prefer the supremely refined aims and enjoyments of bis princely station.

The applicability of the parable to the Jīva, In the same way, some generous benefactors who are intro duced to the Jiva by parents and the like belp him realise that "the soul is neither God nor man nor beast nor tree, and that these diffe rences of body and shape are due to karma." They opable him to understand that the soul is different from the body and adopt the proper means to make him pursue the goal or sim suited to bis essential nature and to follow the path that would lead to it. They create in him qualities and modes of conduct found in men endowed with the splendour of wisdom and not in men who are so absorbed in their bodies as to forget their soul and they bring him to a position in which he is capable of distinguishing between wbat should be rejected and wbat is worthy of adoption, Now in the parable, on seeing for themselves the prince's innate fitness, the transformation wrought in him by some worthy men and his intelligence, some teachers being directed by the Supreme Master who is all compassion and being themselves bigbly compassionate appear before him and reveal bis true parentage to him as also what is higbly desirable to one in bis station and the means of attaining it. It has been said, "God's love, good deeds done by chance, the gracious glance of God, freedom from hate, willingness to learn and the conversation of good men - these are six causes that lead to the acquisition of an ācārya." Those good men in the parable would strive in every possible way to bring about & longing for re-union in the mind of) the prince and the king. So also with the Jiva. His gurus reveal to the Jīva the intimate relation existing between him and Narāyaṇa, the Lord of Lakṣmī, who rules with Bis sceptre the earth surrounded by the turbulent ocean and the world of Vaikuṇṭha without even the least exception. Do not the sāstras say, "The soul is neither God nor men, neither beast nor tree. Its essential nature is knowledge and bliss and it is entirely dependent on the Supreme Being and exists solely for His parposes (Sesha)" and again, "The souls are indeed the servants by nature of the Supreme + Being ?" These gurus

try earnestly to help the Jiva attain the Lord and feel that his attainment of the glory of mokṣa would give them as much delight as the sovereignty of Vaikuṇṭha (Nitya vibhuti) and of the wbole earth (līlā vibhūti). They have as much love to him as the cow to its calf on the day of its birth when, out of loving kindness, it gives it milk. So with the help of words, neither excessive por defective, they desire to remove his ignorance, his doubts, and his erroneous notions. As stated in the śloka. "He s who teaches the trath concerning cit (sentient being) ucit (non-sentient matter) and Īśvara and their essential character etc.", they (the gurus ) teach him the true nature of the Lord who is the rnler of sentient and non-sentient things that are ruled by Him, of their respective character and of their matual relations to one another, of enjoy ment or experience in saṁsāra (including svarga) and of release from that bondage and of the respective means for attaining them (one to be rejected and the other to be adopted), of the routes by which the soul travels to its destined abodes and of the obstacles, expressed and unexpressed, that stand in the way of salvation; for these are ipatters that should be known to every one desirous of release. 

All these things that should be known to every mumukṣu are found concisely stated in the three mysteries or secrets' (mantras) which are, as it were, the quintessence of all passages treating of the Jive and Īśvara and which contain the best part of all the main doctrines. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

We that deserve a place near the heart of Vishna even like the gem Koustubha which rose from the sea along with Lakṣmī at the time of the great cburning, we that are competent to wear, on the crown of our head, the flower-like feet of God, were in peril of being swept away by the current of the stream of karma which caught us ap even while in our mother's womb, when, fortunately

for us, certain great souls proficient in the knowledge of the five things that ought to be understood and likewise of the subtle doctor rine that the relation of the Jivatma to the Lord is that of the body to the soul, came to us out of compassion to save as from being lost (in that stream). 

(NOTE:- Konstubha: This gem is stated in certain treatises to stand allegorically for the Jiva. ] 

SANSKRIT VERSE: 

In the cycle of karma, avidya and others which succeed one apother, as in the revolution of a wheel, in the varied streams of Sausāra peculiar to each individual and beginning from time im. memorial, all systems of religious thought declare that, when the proper time comes, there is varied fruition resulting from past karina. At the time of this fruition, the Lord, who is the first Acharya, finds bis opportunity, catches the Jiva and bestows His grace on him. Sach Jivas are indeed rare and they become the l'epositories of all forms of wealth (like discrimination and free. dom from desires) extending up to the sovereignty enjoyed by the freed souls in inokṣa (vizı, the enjoyment of Bhagavan and service to Him).
