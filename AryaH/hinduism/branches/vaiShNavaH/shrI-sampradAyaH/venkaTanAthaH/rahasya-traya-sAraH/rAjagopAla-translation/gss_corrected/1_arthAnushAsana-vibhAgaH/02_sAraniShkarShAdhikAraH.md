(2) THE CHAPTER ON THE DETERMINATION OF WHAT IS BEST ? page77

NOTE "The Three Mysteries" have been occasionally referred to in previous chapters. ŚrīVedānta desika presumes that everyone of his readers knows what they are. It is just possible that some of them are not in the know of these mysteries. So a brief account may be necessary of these _mantra_s.

1. One of them is called aṣṭākṣara or Tiru_mantra_ It consists of eight syllables in Sanskrit which are in the form of three words. The first word which consists of a single syllable is Om, which is made of three parts a, u and m or akara, ukara and makara. The second word is _namo_ which, when there is no sandhi, is _namas_. It means 'Obeisance' or adoration! The third word is Nārāyaṇaaya which means " to Nārāyaṇa ". Nārāyaṇāya is the dative (the fourth case ) singular form of Nārāyaṇa . The _mantra_, as a whole, means "Adoration to Nārāyaṇa  ! '' or "I offer my adoration to Nārāyaṇa ." (This is the meaning appearing at first sight.)

2. Another _mantra_ or mystery is the “last" _śloka_  of Śrīkṛṣṇa's teaching in Bhagavadgītā usually called the _carama_ _śloka_ .

It means: “Having given up rites or activities as means to secure _mokṣa_ , surrender thyself to me alone". (This is the first half of the _śloka_ .)

"I will free thee from all sins; despair not."(This is the second half of the _śloka_ .)

3. Yet another mystery or _mantra_ is usually called _Dvayam_. It consists of two parts; the first part means "I seek refuge at the feet of Nārāyaṇa  who is ever inseparable from Śrī or Lakṣmī ". The second part means: "I offer my adoration to Nārāyaṇa  and _Śrī_".

These, then, are the "three mysteries or _mantra_s" which are the best of what should be known and meditated upon. The fuller and more subtle meanings of these _mantra_s are explained in later chapters. )--Tr.

What is opposed to the way of the Vedas is like poison; even in the Srutīs or Vedas, those parts which treat of the means of attaining the enjoyment of material goods (_Prakṛti_ bhoga) and of the enjoyment of one's own atma or self (purusha-bhoga) or (Kaivalya) are not salutary. Therefore the wise who are afraid of the cycle of births and deaths ( _samsāra_) seek the best essence extracted out of the ocean of nectar called the Upaniṣads which has been guarded with great care by sages (i.e.) previous _ācārya_s for our benefit

THE GREAT VALUE OF THE THREE _MANTRA_S:

Among these three mysteries (_mantra_s), Tiru_mantra_ or aṣṭākṣara has[^f39] been stated to contain everything within itself and, if it is known, the meaning of everything becomes known; the _carama_ _śloka_ , which says (in its first half) “having given up all rites and activities as means of attaining _mokṣa_ , surrender thyself to me", establishes that the adoption of the single means taught in it, viz, self-surrender (or s'aranagati) would secure the benefits of all other means prescribed elsewhere; the _Dvayam_, as has been stated in Kaṭha _śruti_  and elsewhere, is capable of making a man perfect in the discharge of all his duties even if it is uttered only once. Therefore these three mysteries alone are of value to the seeker after salvation. It has been said, “One should ignore what is of no value, what is only of slight value, and, likewise, what is valuable and even what is more valuable. It is only what is most valuable that one should prefer in the śāstra , like ambrosia in the Ocean,

[^f39]: Nāradīya Kalpa 1-9.

THE ONLY PRAMĀṆA IN REGARD TO MOKṢA  AND

THE MEANS OF ATTAINING IT IS ŚĀSTRA:

The ultimate goal or aim of life (_puruṣārtha_ ) (namely, _mokṣa_ ) and the means of attaining it are not capable of being understood from sense perception (pratyaksha) or (anumāna) inference. As stated in such passages as "It is from the [^f40] śāstra  that I know _Janārdana_ ", "Therefore[^f41] in determining what [^20] ought to be done and what ought not be done, the only authority that  should guide you is śāstra " and "He who is well [^f43] versed in the Agamas or Vedas will attain _Brahman_", the only _pramāṇa_ that exists for our guidance is sabda or what is revealed in the śāstra s. In this context it has been said, “What are[^f44] to be known are many and endless; the time (at our disposal) is short; the hindrances are many; therefore prefer only what is valuable, like the swan that separates the milk from the water with which it is mixed." The word 'valuable' really means ' most valuable', because it refers to what is always and unconditionally valuable. The śāstras of those who are outside the pale of the Vedas (like Buddhists ) and likewise of heretics (like Advaitins) are not valuable at all and are therefore to be ignored. In the first part of the Veda, the portion which treats of rites leading to the attainment of worldly goods is only of very slight value and hence not to be resorted to. That part which treats of the attainment of the good things of _svarga_ after death, though it may appear valuable to somé as leading to fruits higher than worldly goods is of no use, as, in the final estimate, they are based on sorrow and have other objectionable features. That part, too, which treats of the realisation of one's own soul and the means thereof, though a little more valuable, is not of value to those who desire the enjoyment of the Supreme Self. To the man of discerning wisdom, the part of the Veda which treats of the Supreme _Brahman_, the attainment of _Brahman_ and the means thereof is the most valuable, and is therefore to be preferred.

[^f40]: Mahābhārata   : Udyoga Parva: 68-5.

[^f41]: Bhagavadgītā: 16–24

[^f43]: Mahābhārata  : Santi Parva: 276-2

[^f44]:  Uttara Gita: 3-10

[^20]: ( Alternative meaning): "what should be attained and what should be rejected ( see Tatparya
Chandrika: Gita; XVI: 24)

THE THREE MYSTERIES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT.

Even there, the three Mysteries (_mantra_s) which are, as it were, an epitome of the truths that ought to be known and of the means of attaining salvation, which are the distinctive, unique and exclusive doctrines (of our viśiṣṭādvaita  system) are invaluable and therefore to be most preferred. As stated in the _śloka_  [^f45] " From the many and great _śāstra_s, the wise man should choose only that which is most valuable as the bee takes in the honey from the flowers," the _jīva_ who thirsts for _mokṣa_  should prefer as invaluable these three mysteries (mantrās.)

As if what has been already learnt is not enough, the eighteen subjects of study may confront us like burdens (on the intellect); but they add only to the number (and are of no use). Therefore the _ācārya_s of our system (Visiştādvaitam) have, with wise discrimination, given us what the _Nitya_-sūris whose wisdom never languishes (literally who never wink") speak of in exalted terms. namely, the 'eight' (aṣṭākṣara) and the two' (viz) the _Dvayam_ and the _carama_ _śloka_ ,

The basic _mantra_ (mūlamantra) called aṣṭākṣara shines conspicuously in the Upaniṣads (literally, the end of the various branches of the Veda). If there is any one endowed with discriminating wisdom who has understood from that _mantra_ the truth about his essential nature, and if he spends all his time in uttering the _Dvayam_ which, even at a single utterance, can produce the fruition of the desire for the ultimate goal of life and if he has also absolute faith in the means of salvation taught with compassion in the _carama_ _śloka_  by Śrīkṛṣṇa who, for his sport or liIa, became the charioteer, and, who is the crest jewel, as it were, of the Vedas - if there is any such person (at all) in the world, he will be the leader of all our hosts.
