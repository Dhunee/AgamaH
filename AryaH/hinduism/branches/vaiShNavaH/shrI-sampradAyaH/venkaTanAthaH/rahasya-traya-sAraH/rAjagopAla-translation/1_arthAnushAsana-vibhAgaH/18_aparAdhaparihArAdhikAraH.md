This embodied being (the Jīva  ) obtains the grace of Madhava by the result of past karma (luck), for the removal of his sins -- the grace of Madhava which, by its purity, delightfulness, holiness and efficacy is like the (holy) Mandakini whose waters are clear, sweet, always pure (white) and efficacious. (That is, he becomes a prapanna ). If, in spite of this, he still makes his body unclean by wallowing in the mire of the stream of wretched sense pleasures, his company is avoided by the wise (but this would not stand in the way of his attainment of mokṣa after death).

THE PRAPANNA IS NOT LIKELY TO OFFEND;

IF HE OFFENDS, HE SHOULD PERFORM

PRĀYASCHITTA.

Since the prapanna has, by nature, the sole character of a śeṣa to Bhagavān and since he delights only in rendering service to Him in accordance with the ordinances of the śāstras, it is not at all likely that, in other situations than those that are dangerous, he will offend against the Lord, as it would be opposed to his adopted state of being the exclusive servant of the Lord. If as a result of past karma which has begun to operate (prārabdha) and under adverse conditions of place, time and circumstance, slight offences (against the Lord) take place through inattention in the waking state or (without his knowledge) in dreamless sleep (suṣupti) and other such states, these offences will disappear without causing any stain. If, at the time of prapatti, he did not beg, with dread of them, for the removal of such sins as lead to further sins, since he is still in close association with prakṛti like one who lives under the same roof with a serpent, it is just possible , owing to his deficiency in spiritual qualities, certain lapses

which are inconsistent with his state as a prapanna might, as in the case of weak-hearted Rishis, even occur with his knowledge. If sach lapses do occur, the Lord of Lakṣmī , who, by His very nature, is his well-wisher, stands ever ready to save him. Therefore these lapses in his actions will only be momentary like lightning; he will quickly reflect on these lapses from his state as a prapanna, feel ashamed at them, repent of them, and perform the proper atonement (prāyaścitta) that is suited to his competence. The following ślokas explain the point-"If there is offence, the atonement that is to be done is only the performance of prapatti again. If, after performing prapatti for the sake of mokṣa , a man should perform karma yoga and the like with the thought that these are upāyas (to mokṣa), it would also constitute an offence. In order that this offence might disappear, prapatti alone should be performed again". "Whether a man commits an offence knowing that it is an offence or does it without knowing it to be one, the only atonement (prāyaścitta) that has to be performed is to beg in these words :-"Pardon the offence". So also Sītā says: “It is well known that ŚrīRāma knows what Dharma is and is fond of those who seek refuge under him. Seek his friendship if you desire to live. Propitiate ŚrīRāma who loves those that surrender themselves to him and, with a pure heart, see that I am returned to him."

THE PRAPANNA WILL NEVER GO TO THE WORLD

OF YAMA EVEN IF HE OFFENDS:

When, owing to hard-heartedness due to past karma operating now (prārabdha), the prapanna does not obtain pardon by atonement, he will not go to the world of Yama (but receive punishment in this very life). For it has been said :- "Seeing his attendants with the noose (of death ) in their hands, Yama whispers in their ears :-- "Do not approach those who have performed prapatti at (the feet of) Madhusūdana. I have sway only over others and not over the devotees of Viṣṇu ". And Again : - "O Thou with lotus-like eyes, O Vāsudeva, O Viṣṇu, O Thou that bearest the earth, O Thou that art armed with the conch and the discus, be Thou my refuge" - those that utter these words - leave them at a distance for they are not sinners", and further, "Those that perform prapatti to Viṣṇu, the God who is armed with sārnga, never go to the world of Yama, for naraka is not their dwelling place." As stated above in such treatises as Viṣṇu purāna and Vamanapurāna and the passages in the strutis on which they are based, they do not go to the land of Yama, but they are punished with the blindness of an eye, or the lameness of a leg, or some such thing and thus relieved of their burden (of sin). (They will be punished in this life itself here) on the analogy of one (who is dear) being punished with the prick of a thorn instead of being stabbed with a spear. The Supreme Lord, being possessed of forgiveness, kindness, compassion and over-flowing love, relents in His anger and protects the prapanna after a light punishment in this very life for his offence. An emperor, who is to be duly served, punishes his attendants (like those who carry the umbrellas ), the servants of the harem like the hunchbacks and the dwarfs and so also the princes, in proportion to their offences and (also) to such things as their closeness to Him. (He punishes them) for having committed offences, in spite of his affection to them due to their relationship and His goodness. (He punishes them) so that they may obtain pardon for their offences and know that, in future, they may not offend (in the same manner). The punishments are such as the following: averting his face from them, whipping, getting them driven out, keeping them outside the gates and suspension for a short time. Similarly Iśvara punishes the prapanna, as ŚrīRāma did in the case of Kakasura by making him lose an eye and thus protects him.

Directing those that are gentle to obtain pardon (by atonement) and punishing those that are tough by nature for the sake of correction are of the nature of the Lord's forgiveness, which is a consequence of their prapatti that preceded it. One should therefore feel grateful to the Lord for this correction. To emphasise this point, some said that the Lord would pardon even those sins that are committed deliberately. (They did not mean to say that deliberate offences would be pardoned without any punishment).

PRAPATTI WILL NEVER BE IN VAIN :

It should not be thought that, because sins committed deliberately after prapatti and not atoned for would be followed by their consequences like that part of prārabdha karma which is of the nature of sin, the prapatti performed before would not yield

mokṣa. When asafoetida is applied to the root of a tree for making it wither, the tree is sure to wither sooner or later, according to the nature of the soil and other conditions; (but there is no doubt that it will wither; it will do so, perhaps after a little more time). So also in the case of these prapannas who have committed sins deliberately, there will be difference only with regard to the delay in the complete release from saṁsāra. If they desire to have mokṣa at the end of this life and cannot brook delay and if the period of their life-time is not previously fixed, there will be delay in mokṣa  by the life-time being extended. To those whose period of life-time is already fixed, prapatti will certainly bear fruit within that time.

DISCUSSION OF THE VIEW THAT EVEN DELIBERATE OFFENCES COMMITTED BY A PRAPANNA WILL NOT AFFECT HIM ADVERSELY.

It may be asked “Even after Sītā Devi promised protection to the Rākṣasis by saying "I will protect you," when these Rākṣasis offended her again deliberately, were their sins not forgiven when Sītā Devi said, " I forgive their offences as I cannot bear their sufferings" and "Whether they deserve punishment for their sins or whether they have not committed any sins (deserving of punishment), you should pardon them because of your generous Nature -- There is no one that is above fault"? The answer is as follows:- Even here, the Rākṣasis were afraid that Hanuman was about to punish them severely and were afterwards saved from it. So there was, as in the raising of the sword (to strike a person), a slight punishment (fear) and (then ) forgiveness. Therefore, when it is sometimes stated that even sins committed deliberately by a prapanna, would not cling to him, the statement has no authority in support of it. It is also sometimes stated that the prapanna need not atone for his sins even when he has committed them deliberately, and that, even if he has not atoned for them, there will be no punishment by way of teaching him a lesson. It is sometimes maintained also that when such offences have been committed, there will be no delay in the attainment of the supreme goal even for those who are impatient of delay and that there will be no intermission or diminution in the services which have come to a man as the result of meritorious karma in the past bearing fruit in this life. These propositions maintained by some (should not be taken as literally true); they are made just to glorify the attributes and qualities of the Saviour and the power of prapatti. Otherwise there would be no meaning in the continued tradition of the observance, by previous prapannas, of the code of conduct prescribed for the prapanna, in the śāstras which prescribe methods of atonement for sins in the case of prapannas, and in the texts which say that there will be delay in the attainment of mokṣa  for those who did not perform prapatti indicating the time when they wanted to have it and are also impatient of delay while sinning deliberately. Though it is said as a general

statement, "I will release you from all sins", since it is qualified by a passage standing as a special case: "This atonement consists in the performance of prapatti once again", it is evident that the atonement for sins committed deliberately after prapatti is the performance of another prapatti. It cannot be argued that this passage prescribiog another prapatti is only for those who did not perform prapatti to cover also those subsequent sins that might be committed deliberately. This argument would carry weight, only if there were an explicit statement that prapatti might be performed to cover also future sins of a deliberate nature. (There is none such). If a man knows that the original prapatti may be made in such a way as to cover also future sins of a deliberate nature, there will be no one who will care to give up this easier method and thus the text prescribing a further prapatti will find none to adopt it. A general statement cannot contradict a statement made for a special or specific case (for the general statement covers only all cases except those specified in the special statement). If we hold that a general statement can sublate or contradict a special statement for specific cases, it would follow that, even in the case of one who adopts the upāya or bhakti or upāsana, subsequent sins committed deliberately would cause no stain.

It is evident from the authority of the following śloka  that those who are exclusively devoted to Bhagavān (whether they be bhaktas or prapannas ) will not fall under the sway of Yama : "Whatever may be the family into which they are born, wherever they may live, those who love Bhagavān will never go to the world of Yama." There is general agreement also that the same sin will meet with either heavy or light punishment as its consequence, according to the differences of caste, character and the like. This is also consistent with what obtains in the world in cases like the offences committed by princes.

In cases of deliberate offence, the punishment is not as severe as before (prapatti) nor is there a high degree of grace. To the prapanna the punishment is light as in the case of the sons of kings.

Therefore to avoid even this light punishment which would follow as the consequence, a further prapatti ia ordained. In the case of those who are looked upon as learned and righteous, and who are also capable of atonement, atonement in public, in accordance with their ability, is proper when the offences have been committed in public. This is for the sake of setting an example to the rest of the world. If it were not done, it would be a transgression of (the Lord's) command stated before. The violation of the command is injurious in two ways. When the waiting woman [woman attendant] is suspended from service, she loses what she obtains (from the service ) such as scents and has to experience also dread (of punishment).

It may (now) be asked :-"What if the original or first prapatti is made on one's own initiative (without the sanction of the sāstrās ) so as to cover also deliberate sins of the future ?" This is (easily ) answered by a counter-check :-"What if bhakti or upāsana is performed so as to cover also future acts of deliberate offence? What if prapatti as an aṅga is performed so as to cover such acts ?" If it is stated that in these two cases (of counter-check) also, it may be held that future sins will not cling, it will be heresy opposed to what is stated in Śrī Bhāṣya and elsewhere. It is also opposed to the code of conduct observed by such (holy men ) as Ushasti [Ushasti ate a morsel of cooked gram given by a mahout but refused to drink the water which was afterwards offered by him. He justified his action by saying that he ate the gram to avoid death by starvation, but refused the water because there was then no fear of death.] who were steadfast in the contemplation of Brahman (Brahmanishta). There is no special ordinance to contradict the general statement that when a sin is committed and the man feels remorse, the atonement or the prāyaścitta is to meditate on Bhagavān. Therefore the rule that, unless the occasion has arisen, there can be no application of a remedy (to cover a future possibility) holds good and stands uncontradicted in the case of offences committed deliberately after prapatti. Since the prayascitta or atonement is prescribed only for a sin that has already been committed, if a man dreads the possibility of future sins committed deliberately, he should perform atonement in the form of a prapatti for the sins of the past life which have now begun to operate and which are the cause of these (possible) future sins. For has it not been said, "Bhakti adopted as an upāya can destroy all sins except those sins of the past that have begun to operate in this life. On the other hand, prapatti (or sadhya bhakti). is superior to bhakti and can destroy even those sins of the past that have begun to produce their consequences in this life?" It has also been said :- "The sins committed in previous births afflict a man (in the present life) as diseases. They can be got rid of by medicines, charitable gifts, japa, offerings to the fire (homa) and adoration of Bhagavān". (It is indeed stated here) that, even by japa and homa, the sins of the past which have begun to bear fruit in the present life can be destroyed. (Such being the case, there is no reason to doubt that prapatti can destroy such sins). Therefore if a man performs prapatti in dread of the possibilities of future sins which might be caused by the sins of the past, these can be got rid of and no such future sin will be deliberately committed.

From such episodes as that of Sandili in which even Garuḍa who has been described in Aḷavandār's Stotra as Bhagavān's servant, friend, vehicle, seat and device on the banner, committed an offence against the righteous Sandili and had to undergo the evil consequences of it until he obtained pardon from her -- from such episodes, it is evident that even for those who are in immediate contact with Bhagavān, even slight offences against the righteous are productive of evil consequences. (It may be asked whether nitya sūris like Garuḍa could commit offences at all). The answer is that, if the eternal sūris incarnate like Bhagavān, they have to act the part of those who are subject to the sway of karma and perform atonement for offences in order to promote the good of the world (by setting a proper example).

So, in order that one may not lose the grace of God and thereby incur the need for further prapatti or light punishment, a way must be found to root out the possibility of future offences. In general, the root cause of all offences is want of discrimination (aviveka). Of this want of discrimination, the most important is that which causes the delusion that the self is identical with matter (the body ) which is non-sentient and ever subject to modification and has such other qualities and, likewise, the delusion that the individual self has the attributes and qualities which are peculiar to Iśvara, such as existing in itself, independence, and not existing for any one but itself. The sharp-edged saw that cuts off this want of discrimination is a clear knowledge of the nature of one's self which is neither redundant nor inadequate.

When the cause, namely, the delusion that the self is the body and that the self is independent (of the Lord) and other such delusions disappear, the offences which arise from the desire for wealth and for sense pleasures are (completely) rooted out without any special effort.

The prime cause of all these, namely, the possibility of future offences and the delusions which cause them is sin committed in past births which has now begun to yield its consequences. Therefore it will be atoned for by the performance of prapatti at the beginning so as to cover that sin also or the performance of a further prapatti for the purpose. Of these sins which have to be atoned for, the Bhāṣyakāra (Śrī Rāmānuja) has pointed out that offences done to Bhāgavatas stand in the front rank like those done to the wives of a king -vide his commentary on the Sūtra : "The fruits of mukti too, cannot be said to be attained at any fixed time; for they can be attained only if there are no obstacles".

(Śrī Rāmānuja's commentary is as follows: Though the fruit of upāsana or bhakti is mukti, still the time of its attainment is uncertain, because of the presence or absence of obstacles. It may be asked whether there could be any such obstacle in the case of one whose karma or upāsanā which gets him mukti is far stronger than all other karmas. The answer is:- Even in his case there may be obstacles of the nature of offences done in the past to those who meditate on Brahman).

Such being the case, although there may be resemblance between oneself and such persons as Parāśara, Vyāsa, Śuka , Śaunaka, Nathamuni and others, who were distinguished by their caste, character, conduct and the like in such matters as devotion to Bhagavān and the attainment of the supreme goal of life, they should not be treated with disregard. There are differences due to the will of Bhagavān as seen in the condition of each object among things which are the property of Bhagavān such as cows and cowherds, tulasī and champaka, cow dung and musk. Such points of excellence and inferiority, which are likely to cause envy, should not make one think of treating superior persons with disregard, As stated in Rahasyāmnāya in the section treating of the origin of envy. It is true that particular actions and abstention from such actions have been prescribed in the case of Bhagavatās as due to conditions of caste and the like as stated in the Brahma Sūtra (2-3. 47) " That there is permission and prohibition (in respect of castes ) is due to their relationship with their bodies as in such things as fire" (Fire from the house of a Vedic scholar is fit for use, that from the cremation ground is unfit for use. So also, though the soul is pure, a man becomes fit or unfit for certain specific matters owing to his soul's contact with the

body). In spite of these ordinances, we should also consider such passages as the following :

"Even a man of bad conduct should be considered a good man if he worships me without expecting any other benefit. He should be treated with respect." "The caṇḍāla" who has devotion to Bhagavān - to think even by more chance, of this chanḍāla, to talk to him and to treat him with respect - these purify the man who does so, O, Brahmin " " Whether the devotee of Bhagavān be a südra, a huntsman, or a man who eats dog's flesh, the man who looks upon him as identical with other men of those respective castes will go to hell." "Therefore one should do what one can to please the devotees of Bhagavān. By this, Bhagavān becomes favourably disposed to bless one. There is no doubt about this." So also has it been said (by the Alwar) that those who are the devoted servants of the Lord are his masters in all his future births and that the moment he made up his mind to render service to the Lord's devotees, his past karma was destroyed and that he would never think of giving up this service. In the same way it is our duty not to fail in reverence towards the Lord's servants. Even if there is only this mental reverence, it would amount to the śeṣa's service to the Lord who is perfect and self-sufficient. The thought that " This man is of the Lord” is itself capable of doing good. If there is any deviation from this path, one should tremble in fear as if one has entered into the jaws of Death, as it has been said: Whatever is crooked (in conduct) leads to death ( saṁsāra): whatever is straight leads to the attainment of Brahman". (When there has been such deviation from right conduct) one should at once beg pardon of these devoted servants of the Lord as exemplified in the following: " Since  you have offended, I see no other atonement for you than to be Lakṣmaṇa's pardon, with folded hands", and again "If I have offended you in any way, either on account of overconfidence or love, this fault of your servant should be pardoned by you: There is no one who is above committing an offence", and further, "The harsh words that I uttered to you after hearing the speech of Rāma who is overwhelmed with grief - these words should be forgiven by you". We should reflect on the manner in which Sugrīva, the great king, and Lakṣmaṇa apologise to each other in these śloka s and we should get reconciled to the devotees of the Lord (whom we have offended), as if the split that occurred has been glued up without any trace of its being seen.

Even if one who knows the tattva has deliberately entered on a course of conduct unfavourable (to the Lord), the Supreme Ruler will pardon him, if he performs prapatti subsequently. This may be seen from the following episode :- When Brahma saw Rudra in Badarikāśrama aiming his arrow at Bhagavān who had incarnated as the son of Dharma, he explained matters to Rudra and stopped him from the fight. Rudra  then apologised to Nārāyaṇa  who was his Lord to win His favour. He also performed prapatti to Hari, the Creator of the World, The Supreme Ruler, the giver of boons, became gracious, controlled His anger, became pleased and associated there with Rudra".

Whether a man has offended Bhāgavatas (in this life) or whether some Bhāgavatas hate him owing to his wicked deeds in past lives though he has committed no offence in this life, he should obtain the pardon of Bhagavān by obtaining the pardon of such Bhāgavatas by some means or other : This is evident in the passage which describes the characteristics of a ŚrīVaiṣṇava : "He is a devotee of Viṣṇu who, on hearing harsh words uttered by a Bhāgavata, prostrates before him and begs his pardon." If a man does not do so, he will pass beyond the reach of the grace of the Lord and will lose also what is essential to his nature as a Viṣṇu bhakta, namely, his being a śeṣa to Bhāgavatas and, likewise, his qualities of self-restraint and patience; for it has been said :-“Those who are Brahmins (Bhāgavatas absorbed in the contemplations of Brahman) they are myself. There is no doubt about this O, King; when they are adored, I am adored; when they are pleased, I am also pleased. He who hates them hates me also." "Though the Brahmana strikes him, curses him and utters cruel words to him, he who does not bow to him as I did (to Bhrigu) - he is a sinner. He will be consumed by the wild fire of the Brahmin's anger. He deserves to be killed and punished. He is not mine." To lose these (his being a śeṣa to Bhāgavatas and his self-restraint and patience) is itself, in his case, being killed and punished. Thondaradippodi Alwar [ That is why he calls himself Tondaradippodi, The Dust at the Feet of the Devotecs'.] , who realised and enjoyed his relationship of being a śeṣa to Bhāgavatas, which he considered as his distinctive feature, has described how miserable it is to be outside the pale of the Lord's grace as follows:- "My Lord has not said: “ This is a lad deserving of my affection". How wicked are my sins!"

The word Brahmin occurring in these ślokas has a special significance, as has been said in the śloka : "He who knows, aright, the truth concerning Bhagavān, who is called Viṣṇu  that measured the world ( with His feet) and is also called Vāsudeva he becomes a Brahmin". Even if it is used in its general sense, since the offence to the Brahmin is condemned, much more worthy of condemnation would be the offence to a Bhāgavata or devotee of Bhagavān.

All sins are destroyed, in four equal parts, by repentance, by abstention, by the endeavour to perform atonement and by the completion of the process of atonement. To those who feel remorse and repentance, whether the prapatti is performed in a previous kalpa or in a later kalpa, there is no difference in the prapatti to be performed although (there is a difference in the nature of sins committed). Similarly whether the sins be serious or venial, the performance of a single prapatti done at a time will completely destroy at once (all sins).

Those who dread, at heart, the formidable sins that bear fruit at present and seek refuge at the two lotus-like feet of the Lord who measured the worlds, will be freed from all karma which flourishes like weeds. In order to prevent the occurrence of future offences, the honey-like grace of our Lord prevails over the want of discrimination (aviveka) which gives rise to them.

The Lord pardons, on account of prapatti, all sins committed before prapatti except (some among) those which have begun to bear fruit in this life and also those sins which are committed after prapatti unintentionally. Likewise He pardons ( also) all prārabdha karma except the portion of prārabdha whose consequences he has agreed to bear. In the case of the prapanna, it is not at all likely that sins will be committed subsequently with deliberation. Even if such (subsequent ) sins occur, they will be destroyed by atonement; if, on account of wickedness, no atonement is performed, the sins will be expiated by punishment and the Lord will (then) take the prapanna to Himself.
