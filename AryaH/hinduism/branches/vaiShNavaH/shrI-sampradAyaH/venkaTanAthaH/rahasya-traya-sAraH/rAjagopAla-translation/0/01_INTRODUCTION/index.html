Appullar was the great-grandson of Pranatartibara, the disciple of Sri Ramanuja, who was called Vedanta Udayana for bis proficiency in Vedanta. He had, there. fore, personal knowledge of Ramanuja&rsquo;s religious teaching and tradition,</p>
<p>Vedantadesika seems to have attracted the notice of Nadathur Ammal by his precociousness. Before the age of twenty, he bad acquired a mastery of all the learning current in his days not only in religion but in secular subjects as well. He states that bis uncle, Appullar, taught him with as much patience and care as a man would teach &amp; parrot to speak. Vedantadesika became so proficient in the composition of poetry and in the mastery of the science of jogic that be came to be called Kavi Tärkika Simha (the lion among poets and logicians).</p>
<p>Three holy places are associated with Vedantadesika&rsquo;s name as having been bis residences. One is Tiruvaheepdrapuram in South Arcot District, where, it may be presumed, he composed some of his well-known Stotras or hymas like Gopala Vimsati and Devanāyaka Panchasat in Sanskrit and Achyuta Satakan in Prakrit. He lived for many years at Kancheepuram. It is on the chief deity in Kancheepuram that Desika composed his Varadaraja Panchasat in Sanskrit and his Attigiri Mānmiyam in Tamil.</p>
<p>Srirangam was, then, the centre of Vaishnavite culture and learning and every one who had pretensions to a knowledge of Visishtadvaitic philosophy and religion made it a point to stay there as long 48 he could. Vedantadesika seems to have spent some years of his life at Srirangam, gathering round him &amp; band of disciples who were greatly devoted to him. He says somewhere that he had taught Vedanta (i. e.) Sri Bhashya, thirty times over. He wrote also many treatises in Sapskrit and in Tamil in support of the Vedantic system of Ramanuja and in refutation of rival systems. It is no wonder that the title of Vedāntadesika (or Vedantacharya) was conferred on him, as he himself says, by the Lord Sri Ranganatha.</p>
<p>Vedantadesika, or Desika, to use the shorter Dame by which also he is often referred to, followed the usual custom of going on pilgrimages to places in North India which are considered holy. It was probably at Tirupati that he composed his Stotra called Dayāsatakam. It is said that he visited also Mathura, Brindavan, Ayodhya and Banaras.</p>
<p>Desika chose to live a life of poverty. He would not seek the patronage of the great as it wight lead to a loss of independence. It is said that the great Vidyaranya invited bim to the court of Vijayanagar assuring him of an honourable reception. But Vedanta desika would not consent. His reply to Vidyaranya called Vairāgyapanchakan, wbicb is in the form of five slokas in Sans. krit, reveals his stern and austere independence of spirit.</p>
<p>By his extraordinary learning and exemplary way of life, Vedantadesika won the admiration and reverence of all those who were spiritually-minded. Like Ramanuja before him, he was blessed with a long life of strenuous, spiritual activity and died in his one-hundredth year (1369).</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>. HIS WORKS Sri Vedantadesika&rsquo;s life was dedicated solely to stady, to teaching and to the composition of books and tracts. He is &amp; voluminous and versatile writer who has left works in Sanskrit and Tamil, in prose and in verse, and also in manipravālam, a kiad of Sanskritized Tamil. The number of bis writings would come to a hundred or more and only the more important of them are briefly mentioned below.</p>
<p>Vedantadesika reminds one of the English post Milton. It is well-known that Milton was &amp; scholar in Greek, Latin and Italian, besides bis own language, English. His poetry was the poetry of &amp; scholar steeped in varied learning and a full and critical appreci. ation of his poems and prose writings is possible only to men of learning. With just a few exceptions, all the poems of Milton are on religious themes, as be had a lofty conception of the poet&rsquo;s art and mission and would not care to dally in secular writing. He wrote a drama taking his subject from the Old Testament of the Bible. Milton wrote extensively in prose also, both in Eoglish and in Latin. He was also noted for the austerity of bis life, the earnestness of his religious convictions, and the stubborn indepen dence of his character.</p>
<p>Sri Vedantadesika&rsquo;s works may be classified ander the following heads</p>
<p>SANSKRIT 1. POETRY AND THE DRAMA :</p>
<p>Though Desika was wholly absorbed in the study and the interpretation of Vedanta and of the religious tradition associated with Sri Ramapuja, he had in biw a genius for poetic composition which could not be repressed. So, instead of writing on secular subjecta, he made his mase the bandmaid of religion. With the single exception of Subhashita-ncevi, wbicb is a didactic poem containing gnomic verses like the Satakas of Bhartrihari, all his poems have a religious background.</p>
<p>iv When he wanted to write a Mahakavya like Raghuvamsa, he chose for his theme Sri Krishna&rsquo;s life and composed his Yadavā. bhyudayam in twenty-four cantos (or sargas), The playful activities of Sri Krisboa in his boyhood and yoath lend themselves easily to poetic delight. It is Desika&rsquo;s peculiar feature as &amp; poet to incorporate pbilosopbical and religious ideas even into his poems. The great Advaitic teacber, Sri Appayya Dikshitar, has written a commentary on this Mahükāoya.</p>
<p>Desika was an adtuirer of Kalidasa&rsquo;s genius as a poet and wrote a Sandesa Kavya following his manner. This is Hamsa Sandesa. Sri Rama sends a message by a swan to Sita devi at Lanka where she bas been imprisoned by Ravana. The first part consisting of sixty slokas describes the route that the swan should take in its journey to Lanka. The religious bias of the poet makes bim speak with reverence of the holy places and shrines of South India on this route. In the second part consisting of fifty slokas Sri Rama gives a description of the state of Sita in Lanka as he visualises it in his imagination and this is tállowed by the message which is to give her comfort and consolation. The poem is written in the metre called Mandākrāntā which Kalidasa bad employed with brilliant success in bis Meghasandesa.</p>
<p>Padukāsahasran is &amp; poetical tour de force said to have been composed in the course of a single night. The theme is the sandals of Sri Ranganatha at Srirangam and the poem has one thousand and eight slokas in varied metres and is partly in praise of Sri Rama&rsquo;s sandals which were taken by Bharata to Ayodbya and wbich are identified with Sri Ranganatha&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>THE DRAMA:</p>
<p>Krishnamisra, a gifted poet, wrote an allegorical dracoa called Prabodhachandrodaya on the Advaita Philosophy, wherein Prabo. dhachandra or Jnana brings about the deliveratce of King Viveka from the bondage of samsāra into which he had been forced by his enemies, Lust, Anger, and the like. In reply, as it were, to</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>this play, Desika wrote an allegorical drama called Sankalpa Suryodaya in ten acts. The war is between two sets of comba tants, Viveka, Bhakti, and Spiritual Serenity (Santi) on one side and Last, Pride, Vanity and the like on the other. The hero is Purusha or the Jiva and the final deliverance of Purusha is brought about by the victory of Viveka over Moba with the help of Vishnu. bhakti.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>RELIGIOUS LYRICS (STOTRAS):</li>
</ol>
<p>Vedantadesika has left a number of religious lyrics or Stotras which have won the admiration of Sri Vaisbdevas so much that they are often repeated with great devotion during their gatberings. These Stotras or religious lyrics are mainly on the gods worshipped in Kancheepuram, Srirangam, Tirupati and Tiruvabeendrapuram. Some of them are on Garuda, the Goddess Lakshmi, the Goddess of the Earth and Goda the saintly daughter of Perialwar,'</p>
<p>Desika is said to have been an upāsaka of Bhagavan as Hayagriva and has composed thirty-three slokas in His praise.</p>
<p>The ten avatars of Vishnu are described in ten slokas called Dasavatārastotram. After the Muslim raids in the 14th century, Desika composed his Abheeti-stava, praying for succour to Sri Rangapatha&rsquo;s shrine and worshippers,</p>
<p>Darās&rsquo;atakam consists of about one hundred slokas on the Lord of Tirupati and on His mercy shown to the Jiva in varied ways.</p>
<p>Varadarājapanchasat, referred to before, has fifty-one slokas in praise of Sri Varadaraja of Kancheepuram.</p>
<p>Desika was, for some years, &amp; resident at Tiruvabeendraparam wbere he was a staunch devotee of the god Devanatba, in whose praise he composed fifty three slokas called Devanāyakapanchayat.</p>
<p>Desika was a profound admirer of Sri Ramanuja whose works he studied again and again with reverance and also taught to others. In Yatiraja-saptati, he has expressed his boundless admiration and reverence and also bis indebtedness to Sri Ramanuja. The poem has seventy slokas.</p>
<p>One of the finest of these lyrics is Gopālavimsati on Sri Krishpa. Desika&rsquo;s poetic style is generally that of a scholar and is not easily understood by the ordinary reader. But in Gopāla vimsati, bis deep and fervent devotion has enabled him to visualise Sri Krishoa and sing his praise in slokas which are lucid and delightful and can be understood even by the beginner of Sanskrit studies.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>VEDANTA.</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;is in the discussion of subjects connected with Vedanta that Vedaptadesika excelled. He had studied the philosopbical writings of Sri Sankaracharya and others and was a master, as has already been stated, of Visishtadvaita as taogbt by Sri Ramadnja. He dedicated his life, it may be said without any exaggeration, to the propagation of Ramanuja&rsquo;s gospel by all the means in his power. Being a subtle logician, be refuted rival systems of philosophical thought in many of his writings and established the soundness of Visishtadvaita from the point of view of Srutis and of reason.</p>
<p>Tatvateeka : Sri Desika began an elaborate commentary on Sri Bhashyam bat left it incomplete. It is only the commentary up to the section dealing with the Mahasiddhanta that is now available.</p>
<p>Adhikaranasārāvali is in 502 slokas and is a synopsis of Sri Bhashyam. Desika had a wonderful gift of expressing pbiloso pbical ideas concisely in Sanskrit verse giving the Poorvapaksha and the Siddhanta in each sloka. In this work which is in the wetre called Sragdharā. Desika summarises the meaning of each sītra and of each adhikaraṇa or section of Sri Ramapuja&rsquo;s com. mentary on the Brahma Sutras giving, as a general rule, the prima facie view in the first half of each siloka and the rigbt interpretation of the adhikarana or siddhanta in the second half.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Tatvamuktākalapā is a controversial work in Sanskrit verse, and consists of 501 slokas. The Visishtadvaita pbilosophy is sought to be established as the only right system by &amp; refutation of rival views or theories. Here again, the first half of each sloka expresses the Poorvapaksha stating concisely the tenets of other systems and the second the siddhanta in connection with such topics 88 the Jnda or non-sentient things, the Jiva, the Nāyaka or Iswara and buddhi, wbich are all dravya or substances and also adravya, those which are not substances. Desika has left also a commentary of, bis own on this work called Sarvārthasiddhi.</p>
<p>Satadooshani is a controversial treatise in terse prose against Advaita. Desika finds &amp; hundred points of objection against Advaita, but only sixty-six of them are extant in the texts that are DOW available.</p>
<p>Nyāya Parisuddhi and Nyaya siddhanjanam are treatises op logic or nyaya as it should be understood. They are both critical of the Vaiseshing and Nyaya schools of logio.</p>
<p>Seswara - rimāmsa : It is generally held that Jaimini, the author of the Purva Mimamsā Sūtras, was an agnostic who had no faith in the existence of God or Gods. In this work Desika&rsquo;s aim is to prove that Jaimioi did believe in the existence of gods. Only a fragment of this treatise is, at present, available.</p>
<p>Nyāsa - vimsati. Niksheparakshū, Nyāsa-tilaka, Saraṇāgati panchasat, and Nyasa dasaka aim at establishing Prapatti as an upaya for moksha by refuting the arguments of those who hold that bhakti alone is prescribed in the Sastras as the means for attaiping it. They describe also the manner of performing prapatti and the potency of the upāya along with the qualifications wbich make one competent for it.</p>

<li>COMMENTARIES :</li>
</ol>
<p>Desika has left commentaries on Istāvāsyopanishad, on Ala vandar&rsquo;s Chatus&rsquo;s loki and his Stotra-ratnam, and on the three proso</p>
<p>viii works of Sri Ramanuja, namely, Saraṇāgati gadyam, Sriranga gadyam and Vaikunta gadyam.</p>

<p>TAMII.</p>
<p>Desika has composed many treatises in Tamil, most of them being in verse. Among the verse compositions are Attigiri Mān. miyan aheady referred to and Muomanikkovai which is on Sri Devanatha of Tiruvabeepdrapnram.</p>
<p>Paramatabhangam expounds, in Tamil verse and in highly Sanskritised Tamil prose, the doctrines of Visishtadvaita and refutes sowe sixteen rival systems. It is also in support of the l&rsquo;ancharatra Agamas and describes Saraṇāgati as an upaya,</p>
<p>Srimad Rahasyatrayasāra is, of course, one of his greatest prose works. The Tamil prose in this work, as in others, has a large admixture of sanskrit words.</p>
<p>Desika has left also a large number of tracts on the proper code of condnct and observances that a good Sri Vaishnava should follow and likewise on the doctrines of Visishtadvaita. Visishtadvaitins, who are the followers of Sri Ramapuja, consider the following as pramaniis or sources by which knowledge is acquired :&ndash; (1) Pratyaksha or sense perception. Among the</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>ix</p>
<p>senses or indriyas which provide us with knowledge are the sense of sight, the sense of hearing, the sense of smell, the sense of taste and the sense of touch. To these five should be added the mind or manas which perceives such internal feelings as pleasure and pain. (2) Anumāna or inference: Even without actual sepse perception, we sometimes acquire knowledge based on previous perceptions. For instance, we have seen on many occasions that wherever there is smoke, there is fire. When, afterwards, we see smoke rising on a bill, we, at once, infer that there must be fire on that hill, though we do not actually see the fire. Inference is always based on previous sense perception. (3) The third source of knowledge accepted by Visishtadvaitins is sabda or verbal authority or trustworthy utterance. Though I have never been to London, I telieve that there is a big city of that&rdquo; name on the evidence of those whom I consider intelligent and trustwortby. In matters of religion, this verbal anthority is found in the sāstras, They reveal to us what we cannot see or infer by ourselves. For instance, they speak of the existence of God, who creates the Universe, sustains it and dissolves or absorbs it into Himself. They also tell us that our souls are eternal and are now in the bondage of births and deaths owing to beginningless karma. They teach us also how we can get rid of this bondage. Among these sõstras, the foremost place is given to the four Vedas with their crowning chapters called the Upanishads. These are called the Srutis. Next come the Smritis like those of Mapu, Yagnavalkya, and Parasara and also the Mahabharata with its great inset, The Bhagavad Gita, and the Rāmāyaya, and the Puranas, and likewise, the Prabandhas of the Alvars. These smritīs are valid sources of kpowledge so long as they do not state anything that is directly opposed to the teaching of the Srutīs. The Brahma Sutrās of Badarayana are the result of a critical examination of the Srutīs in regard to what they actually teach and are also authoritative.</p>
<p>The followers of Ramanuja accept also the validity of the teacbing contained in the Pancharatra Agamas. These Āgamās have come down to us from time immemorial and are held by Visishtadvaitips to have been taught by the Supreme Being, Nara yana Himself. Only some among these ägamās are now available to us in print like Ahirbudhnya Samhita, Lakshmi Tantram, Satvata Samhita, Poushkara Samhitā, Iswara Samhita and Garuda Samhila. The followers of Ramanuja do not find any doctrine or statement in these âgamas which conflicts with the Srutis. Therefore they give a high place to them as to Srutis, so far as religion and spiritual life are concerned.</p>
<p>It is on a careful and critical examination of the knowledge provided by these varied sources of knowledge, (pramāņās), that Sri Ramanuja based his system of religious philosophy called Visistadvaita. We get to know the doctrines and traditions con Dected with this system from his commentaries on the Brahnı Sutras of Badarayana called Sri Bhäskyam, Vedānta Deepa and Vedānta-sara and also treatises called Vēdārthasangraha, Sara nāgati-gudyan, Vaikunta gadyam and Sriranga gadyam. In regard to certain traditional beliefs and observances based on the Pancharitra ūgamas. Ramanuja has not left a clear and definite expression of his views. Sri Vedantadesika, who came some one bundred and fifty years after him and who was steeped in the religious lore and the religious discussions which had intervened during this period, aims at giving a clear, complete and compre. hensive exposition of Visishtadvaitic thought and tradition in his Srimad Rahsyatra yasära.</p>
<p>The following is a brief summary of the teaching contained in Rahasyatrayasära on the more important doctrines of Rama. puja&rsquo;s system of philosophy and of the religious and spiritual tradition (sampradaya) connected with him as understood by the Northern School of Sri Vaishnavites (Vadagalais).</p>
<p>TATTVA</p>
<p>The intelligent man who is desirous of miokshu or deliverance from the bondage of samsāra or the cycle of births and deaths should know the three kinds of tattväs or Reals (things that exist)</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>and the relation in which they stand towards one another. Accord. ing to Visishtadvaita, all existing things are roal and none of them is a mere illosory appearance.</p>
<p>There are three classes or kinds of existing things or reals. (1) Chit by which are meant seotient beings which have conscious Dess, however low their level might be (2) Achit which means non sentient things, which have no consciousness and which are all modifications of matter or prakriti and (3) Iswara wbo stands by. Himself (being of different from the other two) as their Ruler and Controller.</p>
<ol>
<li>CHIT</li>
</ol>
<p>Chit is a class name or a name which indicates &amp; group or class of existing things. By Chit is meant Ātma, soul or self. Ito essential nature (Svarupa) or what distinguishes it from the other two, achit and Iswara, may be described as follows:- It is different from the body, the senses, the mind, the vital breath (prāna) and intelligence (buddhi). It is ajada or wompable of shining by itself; its esseatial nature is bliss or ānanda and jnana (consciousness or kaowledge). It is eternal (nitya), atomic (anu) and incapable of being perceived by the senses. It is indivisible and has no parts or avayavas. Besides being of the nature of knowledge (jnana), it possesses also jnana or knowledge as an attribute (dharma), This karwledge possessed by the self is called dharmabhita jnana. The sell or soul is subject to the control of Iswara (ni yamya) and is also supported by Him (dharya). It is s&rsquo;èsha to Iswara (i.e) it exists solely for the fulfilment of His purposes and not for itself.</p>
<p>It was said above that the self can abide by itself. A pot, for instance, can be seen only when it is lighted up by the flame of &amp; lamp, but the flame of &amp; lamp sbines by itself and does not require any other light to help its being seen. So also the sell shines or, in other words, is felt or realised by the person without any other help. The self is also conscious of itself as when a map says &lsquo;I&rsquo;. Pain, misery and the like are due to contact with the body. This contact with the body has resulted from beginningless karma. The self or ülmā thinks that the pain is its own.</p>
<p>If the self is nitya or eternal, it may be asked what birth and death mean. The answer is that birth means contact acquired with a body; death is separation from that body.</p>
<p>The sastrās say that the self is anu or atomic and that at the time of death, it leaves the body from the heart. Though the self is atomic or infinitesimally sipall in size and confined to one place, mamely the heart, it is able to perceive the pleasure or the pain in every part of the body by means of the knowledge which it possesses as an attribute (dharmabhita jnāna). Dharmabhūtix jrāna or attributive knowledge is capable of contraction and expan sion (sankocha vikäsa.) and can expand and reach everywhere. The self has no parts or avuyavas and cannot undergo change or modification (vikāra). In this respect it is different from achit or material objects like pots and cloths and cannot be burnt, cut, cooled or atherwise modified. Advaitins hold that the self or soul is consciousness or knowledge and does not possess knowledge as an attribute (i e.) dharmabhūta jnana. This is wrong, for we feel that we have knowledge and do not feel that we are jnana or consciousness alone.</p>
<p>Just as the self is a knower who possesses knowledge (jnälä). it is also a doer (karta), one that wills and makes efforts and one that experiences or enjoys (bhoktā). It should be remembered in this connection that will wbich acts or puts forth efforts and enjoy. ment or experience are both only forms of knowledge.</p>
<p>The self is a doer but a doer that is ever subject to the control of Iswara. It is supported by Iswara because it can have no exist. ence except that due to His essential nature (svarūpa) and His will (sankalpa). Taking the case of our own body and soul, the soul supports the body and prevents it from disintegrating or falling during sleep by its essential nature (svarīpa). During its waking</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>xiii</p>
<p>moments, the soul keeps the body from falling by its will (san. kalpa). So also in regard to the self as related to Iswara. It will be explained later that the soul stands in the relation of body to Iswara, who is its Inner Self.</p>
<p>The soul was stated before to be sesha to Iswara add to exist only for His purposes. Houses, fields, sons, wives and the like ape sesha to a man and exist for the fulfilment of his parposes. But they can and do exist apart from himn. The self, on the other band, is a s&rsquo;esha to Iswara which cannot exist apart from Him. It is inseparable from Him. So it is an inseparable attribute or viseshaņa of Iswara. In this respect the self is like the body of a man in relation to his soul. The body may be defined as that which is supported by &amp; self and is capable of being controlled by it, while existingfor the fulfilment of its purposes. In this sease the self of every sentient being is the body of Iswara,</p>
<p>When Chit is said to be a class-Dame, what is meant is that ituās or seatient beings are many, though all of them belong to the class Chit, The self&rsquo;s or souls may belong to any one of these groups: (1) those that are in the bondage of samsāra (baddhas) (2) those that have obtained liberation from it (muktas) and (3) those who are eternally free (nityas) (i.e.) who have never been in samsāra, such as Garuda and Adisesha.</p>
<p>Owing to contact with achit, (the body or mattter), the self has avidya (ignorance), karma and vāsanās or past impressions, tastes and aptitudes. When contact with achit ceases entirely, avidya and the rest leave the self. The avidyā and karma have no beginning. Therefore their original cauae is not to be enquired into. What is of importance is to bring about their end.</p>
<p>The self&rsquo;s, be they baddhas muktas or nityas, are inaumerable.</p>
<p>Visishtadvaitids stoatly oppose the Advaitic view that there is only a single self enveloped io avidyā and that when this is realised, the self becomes identical with Brahman, that there is nothing else</p>
<p>xiv but this Brahman, which is pure consciousness, and that all objects in the Universe, around, above and below as, are mere illusor y appearances.</p>
<p>In the state of mukti, though souls or self&rsquo;s are all alike and perfectly resemble one another, yet there is difference among them capable of being perceived by themselves.</p>
<p>The self or ātmā may be defined as a conscious being that solely exists for the fulfilment of Iswara&rsquo;s purposes (s&rsquo;esha). Achit or matter, too, exists for Iswara but it is not a conscious being. The Jiva who is conscious and has intelligence is not only &amp; yesha but a dāsa (servant) of God.</p>
<p>It was stated before that the svarüpa or essential datore of the self is knowledge or consciousness and that it has knowledge a: an attribute or dharma. Is there any difference between these two kinds of knowledge or jnana, it may be asked. The know ledge which is svarūpa is incapable of contraction and expansion; it does not light up anything other than itself; it is conscious of itselt (self-conscious). The knowledge which is an attribute is capable of contraction and expansion and can light op other things like pots, cloths, stars, men and so on to the self. It is capable of all-pervasiveness in the state of mukti, though limited in its range in the state of samsāra owing to past karma.</p>
<p>According to Visishtadvaita, koowledge is &amp; substance or dravya, because it is the seat of action and qualities. Knowledge, though a substance, may also be an attribute or dharma 88 dharmabhuta jnana is of the guarūpa jnana. Attributive know ledge or dharmabhūta jnāna is eternal. In the state of sushupti or dreamless sleep, it is dormant and does not spread out and reach anything, as the senses are then inactive.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>II. ACHIT.</p>
<p>Achit or matter, in its different forms or modifications, is without consciousness or knowledge. It is subject to changes in its form (vikara) though eternal as substance.</p>
<p>Achit is of three kinds - The first kind of achit is called prakriti or matter, such as we see around us in this world. It is sometimes called also misrasattvam, because the quality of sattvam is miogled in it with rajas and tamas. It is prakriti wbich, by its contact with the bound self, conceals from it know ledge and bliss; it is also the cause of erroneous knowledge. As has already been said, it is eternal and is an accessory to Iswara&rsquo;s leela or sportful activity. Sometimes it is called prakriti because from it, other forms of matter are evolved (vikriti). It is also called Māyā, for it is the cause of a wonderful variety of creations.</p>
<p>Misrasattvam is in twenty four forms &ndash;prakriti (the root cause or primordial matter), mahat the next stage of modification, ahankara, manas (mind), the five kinds of subtle elements (tannātras), the five senses of knowledge, sight, smell, taste, hearing and touch (Tränendriyas); the five senses of action, hand, leg, speech, the organs of excretion and sex (karmendriyās), and the five elements or bhutās viz, earth, water, fire, air aod ākāsa (space or ether). It is by mixing these twenty-four tattuās of achit that Iswara creates the anda or world by Himself and through Brabma. There are many such andās or worlds, which are all within the region of Iswara&rsquo;s leclā.</p>
<p>The second kind of achit is called suddhasattvam. It is so called because it is sattva that is free from all admixture of rajas and tamas. Suddhasattvam is a wonderful substance entirely different from the matter or prakriti that we see around us. It is eternal and capable of producing knowledge and bliss. By the mere will of Bhagavad and constituted of suddhasattvam, towers, palaces, assembly halls, groves, gardens and the like exist in the region of eternal glory (rutya vibhuti or Paramapada) which is</p>
<p>xvi beyond the region of prakriti. Suddhasattvam is of supreme splendour (tējas) and is incapable of being measured by the muktas, and nityas and even Iswara. Some acharyās say that it is capable of shining by itself (ajada), while others are of opinion that it has to be lighted up by something other than itself (jada),</p>
<p>Those who hold that it is ajada state that it sbines to the nityās, muktas and Iswara without requiring to be lighted up by some. thing else. But while the jīvas are in samsāra, it remains invisible to them. It is not self-conscious and is therefore achit. Besides it is, as already pointed out, subject to changes or modifica tions such as towers, palaces and so on. It is therefore achit.</p>
<p>The third kind of achit is Time or Kāla. It is in Time that the evolutes of matter (prakriti) undergo their modifications. Time or Kāla has none of the three qualities of prakriti (sattvam, rajas, or tamas). It is eternal (szitya) and all-pervasive (vibhu).</p>
<p>The two kinds of achit, s&rsquo;uddhasattvan, and misrasattvam serve to Iswara and sentient beings (baddha, mukta, and nitya) as objects of enjoyment (bhogya), as accessory instruments of enjoyment (bhoga upakarana) and as places of enjoyment (bhogasthāna). Bhogya is that which is experienced or enjoyed; bhoga - upakaranas are the senses which help the Jiva in experiencing or enjoying, and bhogasthānas are the various worlds (andās) and nityavibhuti and so also the innumerable bodies of sentient beings.</p>
<p>III. ISWARA</p>
<p>The essential nature of Iswara is Reality (satyam), knowledge (jnana), bliss (ānanda) and infiniteness (ānantam). Iswara is opposed to everythiog that is of the nature of a blemish. He has hosts of auspicious qualities (kalyāṇaguna) like knowledge and might. He creates the Universe, sustains it and likewise causes its dissolution. He is the refuge of all jivas and dispenses to them the objects desired by them whether it be dharma, artha (wealth), kama (desires), or moksha. He has a special and characteristic</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>form (vigraha) of His own in nityavibhuti. His chief queen or consort is Lakshmi; Bbumi and Neela are also His consorts,</p>
<p>Even as light is opposed to darkness, Iswara is opposed to everything of the nature of change (vikära) or of blemish (dosha). He is infinite in the sense that He is eternal in regard to time, ompipresent or all.pervasive in regard to space, and has all things and all beings as His prakaras, modes or attributes which are inseparable from Him. He is the inner self (antaryami) of all things and of all beings. Thus He is not limited from the point of view of time, space, or objects.</p>
<p>It may be asked: &ldquo;If Iswara is within all things and all beings, would He not be affected by their faults or blemishes per The answer is: &ldquo;No. The individual self or ātmā is not affected in any way by such changes as childhood, youth and old age which are the modifications undergone by the body. As in the case of the self of the individual, the inner self of all, namely Iswara, remains within, unaffected by the faults or blemishes of chit or uchit.</p>
<p>Iswara is conpact of happiness or bliss (ānanda) and His essential nature is light or splendour that shines. His qualities like knowledge and night are eternal (nitya), innumerable and boundless. He has neither equals nor superiors,</p>
<p>Besides Jnāna or kaowledge and might (sakti, ), He has boundless compassion for Jivas and infinite love to them. He is easily accessible to everyone. He is ever ready to help mortals to cross over samsāra and attain moksha. He is Himself the upaya for us to attain moksha when we are without any other upāya or means for attaining it.</p>
<p>As has been already stated, He is the cause of all the world and this is not due to any karma of His, but His mere will. Creation, maintenance and destruction are of the nature of sport (Tula) to Him; that is, they are not performed for the sake of any fatare</p>
<p>xviii gain bat for the moment&rsquo;s pleasure, recreation or delectation like games played by kings. &ldquo;Is destruction or dissolution of the world (samhāra ) sport to Him?&rdquo; it may be asked. The answer is : &ldquo;That, too, is Tila for him &ldquo;, because in the state of samhāra or pralaya, the jiva is given repose and rest after the sins, troubles and tribulations of life. Iswara is also the material cause of the world (upādāna karana). It is He that evolves into the world of chit and achit. “Does it not mean that He undergoes change? it may be asked. The answer is &ldquo;No. It is not His essential nature (svarūpa) that evolves iatochit and achit, but His attributes or prakaras, chit and achit, which are inseparable from Him and which, during pralaya or dissolution, lie in so subtle a state that they may not be recogoised as existing at all . it is these wbich evolve into tbe world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be asked:&mdash; &quot; How can the same object or person be both the material cause and the instrumental cause? In the case of a pot, mud is the material cause or upādāna kūrına and it is different from the instrumental cause such as the potter, bis wheel and bis stick.&rdquo; The answer is as follows.&rdquo; The same object may sometimes be both upädāna kāruna (the material caase) and the instrumental cause (nimitta kärana). Have we not seen the spider weaving a wonderful web out of the material or stuff constituting its body? Iswara, too, creates the universe with chit and achit, which are His body and which are inseparable froin Him. Iswara remains without change in His svarūpa; it is only his prakūras, modes or attributes, chit and achit, that change.</p>
<p>To achit, Iswara is the cause of modification : to chit or sentient beings, it is He that gives the body and the senses, and that awards also inoksha.</p>
<p>. When we find some beings happy and others unhappy, we should not charge Iswara with partiality and cruelty in creating them differently. It is on account of their past karma that Iswara makes them different and this karma is anädi (beginningless).</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>It has been stated before that Iswara bas a unique form (or vigraha). By its pature and qnalities, this form is supremely delightful; it is eternal, ever the same and pare, it is constituted of s&rsquo;uddha sattvam. It is radiant and is of imcomparable splendour. It is supremely beautiful and enchanting and is fit to be meditated on by Yogis. It is enjoyed by nityas and muktas in the region of eternal glory (nitya vibhuti). It is from this form that the incarnations appear. Iswara is the Universal Saviour and the refuge of all. He has orgaments, weapons, attendants and the like.</p>
<p>Iswara is, according to Pancharatra, in five forms. (1) Para or Para Vasudeva, the supreme Being (2) Vyüha or emanations, such as are described in the Pancbaratra ūgamas (3) Vibhava incarnations. (4) antaryāni or Harda (the inner self in the heart who controls all activities from within) and (6) archi or image. Para is the Supreme Being in Vaikunta or nitya vibhuti ever enjoy ed by nityas and muktas. The Pancharatra Agames call Him Vasu deva. He is the same as Narayana, Visbnu and Brabmao. Vyaha is the emanation from Para into the forms of Vyaba Vasudeva, Sankarshapa, Pradyumne, and apiruddha for the sake of the creation, the maintenance and the destruction of the world and for conferring His grace on those who worsbip Him.</p>
<p>Io Para the six* qualities such as Jnāna are full and perfect; each Vyuba other than Vasudeva exbibits lame only two of those six qualities.</p>
<p>Vibbaves are many and they are of two kinds ;- some are principal (mukhya) and others secondary (gaung). Incarnations are dne only to the Lord&rsquo;s will add not to karma.</p>
<p>The forms of the principal incarnations are not constituted of prakriti or matter. They retain the nature and qualities of the</p>
<p>* The six qualities : Jnana (knowledge): alsvarya (lord-ship or doimpeded activity independent of all others; sakni (ability or potency to become the material cause of the world; bala (strength, absence of fatigue sustaining power); virya (virility-changcléssness); and tejas (splendour, might, the power to defeat others). Sopreme Being and are like new lamps lighted from an original one. They are fit for the meditation of those wbo aspire to mukti, Sach are Rama, Krishna and the like.</p>
<p>The secondary incarnations are through such as sre Jivas like Vyasa.</p>
<p>The object of an incarnation is to protect the righteous, to destroy the wicked and to establish dharma.</p>
<p>The Anataryāmī or Harda dwells within the heart of the Jiva,* whatever he may be, in order to belp bim, in order to be meditated on by him and in order to redeem him.</p>
<p>Archa is the Supreme Being residing within the images or other objects that are worshipped in houses or temples.</p>
<p>It was said above that chit and achit are the body of Iswara and that these evolve into the world of sentiept beings and pon. sentient things during creation. This doctrine that Iswara is the inder self of all beings and of all things and that they are His body is the principal feature of Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s Visishtadvaitic thought. The relation that exists between chit and achit on the one side and Iswara on the other is that between the body and the self särira sariri bhāva. The doctrine is based on a passage in the Antaryāmi Brāhmaṇam of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, where Brahman is said to have everything in the Universe as its body and to control everything from withip. The definition of body or sarira given before should be remembered in this connection.</p>
<p>Note: The jiva here means a jiva who can meditate.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>VISISHTADVAITA AND ADVAITA</p>
<p>Ramanuja&rsquo;s system of religious philosophy is called Visishtad. vaita or Visishta Advaita to dia inguish it from Sri Sankara. charya&rsquo;s Advaita. There are some passages or texts in the Upanishads which state that Brahman alone exists and that there is no second to it. Basing bis system on such texts, Sankara inaintains that there is only &amp; single reality or Real, namely, Brabman. The multitudinous objects and beings which we see around, above, and below us in the Universe are, according to him, unreal and illusory appearances like the mirage and like the silver which sometimes appears as an illusion on the shell. The world that exists around us consists of sentient beings, chit and non sentient things, achit. Sankara bolds that all these are illusory projections (mithyā) on the only real entity which is Brahmap. His system of philosophy is, therefore, called Advaita, the philo sopby which treats of the one without a second. Sankar&amp; states that this Brahman bas po attributes or qualities by which it can be described or defined and that we can only speak of it as mere consciousness (chit or Jnāna). It is not consciousness which is conscious of anything within it or outside of it, for there is nothing else within it or outside of it. It is the only Real and nothing more can be said of it except that it is the opposite of non existence, nonconsciousness and finiteness,</p>
<p>Ramanuja interprets these texts which declare the oneness of Brahman and its having no second in the Universe in a different way. According to him, Brahmap is said to be the only Reality in the Srutis or Upanisbads in the same way as a man who has a body and the senses in addition to his soul, or ātmā is said to be &amp; single entity. In fact the passage referred to already in the Brihadāranyaka Upanishad called * Antaryāmi Brahmana declares, in unmistakable terms, that the Universe consisting of sentient beings, jivas and non-sentient things (watter) are all the body of Brahman and that Brahman is their inner self or soul.</p>
<p>• II</p>
<p>7xxii All sentiert beings, be they gods, men, animals or plants, are the body of Brahman and, likewise, all inanimate things are its body. On the authority of such texts, Ramapuja explains the passage stating Brabman to be the only Reality as meaning that Brahman which has for its body the universe of septient beings and don. sentient things (chit and achit) is the only Real. The body is an attribute or viseshana of the self. So the universe consisting of chit and achit which, according to the Srutis, is the body of Brah. nan, is &amp; viseshana or attribute of Brahman. Uplike Sankara, Ramanuja holds that Brahman has an infinite number of auspi. cious qualities and finds many passages in the Upanishads to support bis view. So the Reality that the Srutis speak of is Brabman with its viseshanas or attributes and qualities (chit and achit and guņas). All these are as real as Brabman itself and being inseparable from their inner self or soal, they are incladed in Brahman when it is declared to be the only Real. Ramanuja&rsquo;s religious philosophy is therefore called Visishta Advaita or the philosophy that treats of the one Reality, namely Brabman, with all its inseparable attributes or viseshanas included tithin itself.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no difference between the views of the Northern School (Vadagalais) and those of the Southern School (Theogalais) in regard to wbat has been said so far about the three tattvas or Reals. It is only about Kevalas or Kaivalyan that there is a slight difference of opinion. The Soathen School con sider Keralas who delight in the enjoyment of their own dis.' embodied self without attaining the bliss of Bbagavad as being also muktas wbo are of an ipferior class residing in the outermost parts of Paramapada. The Northern School maintain that niukti, in the true sense of the word, means the attainment of that bliss and that kaivalyam is not mukti as it is without it. If, in some treatises of ancient acharyas, kovālas are called muktas, it is oply by way of courtesy, as they are in many respects superior to other baddkas, Kevalas have still to attain mukti since they have some remnants of sin or karma clingiog to them,</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>xxiii</p>
<p>There is, bonever another point about which there is a diver gence of views. What is the position and the essential nature (svarupa) of Lakshmi? Is she a jīva, atomic in nature like other jivas, though superior to all of them? If she were considered as being equal in status to Bhagavan, would it not be against the relationsbip of the wife to ber lord and would it not also conflict with the saying that Bhagavan is &lsquo;destitute&rsquo; of equals and superiors ?</p>
<p>The Southern School hold that Lakshmi occupies &amp; special and unique place of her own below that of Bhagavan. She is anu or atonic and is a jīva. She acts as a mediator pleading to her I ord for mercy to the sinner (purushakāra). She is also the seshi along with Her Lord, both in Leela vibhuti and in Nitya vibhuti, and is entitled to the service of the baddhas in this world and to that of the nityas and the muktas in the world beyond viz. the region of eternal glory (nitya vibhuti). Bhagavan is, however, the</p>
<p>ole upaya or means for the attainment of moksha and Lakshmi has no part in this in the same way as she has no part in the creation, sustenance, and destruction of the world.</p>
<p>Vedantadesika, the greatest of the exponents of the Northern School, states tbat Lakshmi, the inseparable attribute of Bhagavan as described in the Bhagavat Sastra or Pancharatra is in every way the object of equal veneration and worship as Bbagavan and that our worship is always to the Lord and Lakshmi. Being inseparable from Him, She participates in all His activities except in the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the world. She is s&rsquo;eshi to all of lis, baddhas, muktas and nitrās as much as the Lord Hinuself. She is not anu or atomic bnt vibhu or all-pervasive and ompipresept. She is not only the mediator (purushakāra) intercejing and pleading for the pardon of the offences of Jivas but also the upaya along with Her Lord for the attainment of mukti by the prapanna. Our service after the attainwent of mukti extends to her as much as to Bhagavad. Whenever Bhagavan is mentioned, we should take it that Lakshmi also is intended to be understood. Our daivatam or Supreme Divinity is the Divine Couple, Bhagavan and Sri, and not Bhagavan alone.</p>
<p>xiy PURUSHARTHA OR THE GOAL OF LIFE.</p>
<p>It is true that men strive for varied ends or objects in the course of their lives, but the wise man who realises the misery implied in samsāra or the cycle of births and deaths anderstands that the only purushärtha or goal that he should aspire to is moksha or liberation from samsāra. Moksha, according to Visi shtadvaita, is not merely the deliverance of the ātma from the bondage of karma and the cycle of births and deaths, but the positive attainment of the bliss of Bhagavan in Paramapada or Vaikunta. This alone is true moksha or sayujyam, as it is other. wise called. In religious treatises, mention is often made of the attainnent by some jivas of sālokya, of sārībya apd of sūrneepya. These are different from the true moksha or säyujyu, in as inuch as the happiness attained in those states is neither perfect oor eternal. Sālokya means the attainment of a world or lika which is one of Bhagavan&rsquo;s but is not Paramapada. Sarūpya means the attainment of a form resembling the Lord&rsquo;s as the result of constant meditation on one of these forne, (say, Rama or Krishda). Sameepya is the attainment of a place near Parama. pada bat pot Paramapada itself. So also mention is sometimes made of &lsquo;Vibhava lokās&rsquo; and Vynila lokās'. If a man constantly meditates on any of the important vibhaväs or avatārs he will attain the world of that vibhava from which he will afterwards have to attain Paramapada. So also with regard to the Vyuha loka. Sayujya, which alone is inoksha in the trge sense of the word, consists in bhoga sāmyan, that is, the self attains, in that state, perfect happiness or biiss exactly like that of Bhagavan Himself. There may be and are differences between the activities permitted to the self in moksha and those that are Bhagavan&rsquo;s, but in regard to enjoyment or bliss, there is absolutely no difference *(paramam samyam upaiti). The love felt by the self to Bhaga. van in moksha is so great that it overflowa into service or kainkarya to Him. Kainkarya or service to the Lord is also bliss In fact it is the crowning glory or bliss of mukti (Kainkarya sūnirajyam).</p>

<p>UPAYA OR THE MEANS OF ATTAINING</p>
<p>THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF LIFE,</p>
<p>How or by what means is the self to attain this bliss of moksha? In regard to this, there is a divergence between the viewe held by the Northern School and those held by the Southera.</p>
<p>The view held by the Northern School (V&rsquo;adagalais) is stated in distinct and unmistakable words by Vedantadesika in bis Rahasyatrayasāra. There are only two ways in whicb or upāyas hy which the self can get rid of its past karma and attain moksha. They are bhakti or bhaktiyoga, as it is called, and prapatti, the surrender of the sell to the Lord whom it seeks as the only refuge. Prapatti may be adopted as a preliminary way of approaching the Lord for the performance or adoption of bhakti or as a direct means of attaining moksha. In the former case, prapatti or saranagati is said to be an anga or accessory to bhakti. Or it may be adopted as the primary and direct means or upāya for attaining moksha, when it becomes angī. So prapatti may be anga prapatti or angi prapatti. These terms will be explained presently. Bhakti and prapatti sre the only two means for securing the grace of Bhagavan, who, beiog pleased thereby, grants moksha. Bhakti is otherwise called Upasana or dhyāna. There are some thirty-two vidyas* or forms of upāsana explained or indicated in the Upanishads. Constant meditation of Brahman and His attributes or qualities accompanied by the proper perfor mance of the rites and duties prescribed in the sāstras, such as nitya and naimittika for one&rsquo;s varna (caste) and one&rsquo;s ūsrama (stage of life), is the way or upāya called bhakti. The meditation has to be practised daily as long as life lasts. Ultimately it should attain the stage almost of actual visual perception of Brabman. To ordinary men, this upāya is difficult, but if it is adopted in the fulness of its perfection, all past karma which stands as an obstacle</p>
<p>Brahma Vidyas like daharavidya, sadvidya, bhumavidya, sandilyavidya and antaradityavidya.</p>
<p>xxvi to the attainment of Brabman is destroyed except that part of it which bas already begun to yeild its consequences (prārabdha) and when this too is brought to its end by the enjoyment or experience (anubhava) of its effects, either in this one life or in one or more future lives, the self attains moksha. Thus there is likelihood of delay in the attainment of moksha to the man who follows the way of bhakti. Bhakti is sometimes loosely employed to include bowing before archa, uttering the holy nanues of Bhagavan, singing His praise and such other acts of devotion and love. Service to Bhagavan in temples and the like is also sometimes called bhakti. This service also extends to the devotees of Bhag. van who are dear to him. These acts tend to promote bhakti but do not form bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Bhakti yoga results from seven auxiliary states of mind : (1) viveka which arises from bodily purity resulting from the avoidance of impure food (2) vimoka (freedom from desires) (3) abhyāsa (freqnent meditation of the auspicious ohject) (s&rsquo;ubhü s&rsquo;raya) (4) kriyū the performance of such rites as the five kinds of yagra in accordance with ope&rsquo;s ability, (5) kalyānāni (kind. ness to all beings: being one in thought word and deed, compassion, freedom from covetousness, refraining from injury to others by thought, word or deed) (6) anavasüda (freedom from depres sion) and (7) anuddharsha (freedom from elation or undue exaltation of spirit).</p>
<p>Bhakti aided by these virtues results in something l&rsquo;esembling visual perception of Bhagavan and is the cause of the last thought being turned to Bhagavan. It has three stages of development called by Sri Ramanuja: para bhakti, parajnana and parama bhakti.</p>
<p>When karma is said to be destroyed by bhakti or prapatti, what is really meant is that Bhagavan, being pleased with the man&rsquo;s devotion or self-sorrender, gives up the thought of ponishing bim for his sios or karma.</p>
<p>INTRODUOTION</p>
<p>Xxvii</p>
<p>Prapatti is also called nyasa, nyasa vidyā, nikshepa, bharan. väsa, s&rsquo;aranagati, and bhara-samarpanam. It consists primarily in seeking Bhagavan as the sole refuge for one&rsquo;s salvation and surrendering one&rsquo;s self to Him for salvation.</p>
<p>It has five angas or accessories which are mental attitudes (1) the will or determination to do what is agreeable to the Lord, (2) the avoidance of wbatever is displeasing to Him, (3) maha. viswäsa or intense faith that the Lord can and will be one&rsquo;s Saviour, (4) Helplessness or being without the knowledge or capacity to adopt any means for saving oneself and (5) prayer to the Lord that He should extend his protection,</p>
<p>Nyasa has to be performed only once under the guidance of the acharya and it is capable of securing moksha at the end of this very life. Bhakti, it was said before, destroys all past karma except that which has already begin to operate (prärabdha). Prapatti, on the other hand, is capable of destroying even prü rabdha karma. The central idea in prapatti is the thought of the inan that he is incapable of performing the rites and duties pres cribed in the sāstras for the expiation of his sids and for the attainment of moksha and that, therefore the Lord should, Himself, be the upāya or means for the expiation of his sids and tte attain ment of mioksha. Pleased with bis surrender, the Lord, out of bis natural compassion, pardons all the man&rsquo;s sips and short-comiogs and grants the map the goal desired by Him, viz. moksha. In the Rahasyatrayasära, bhakti or upāsana or dhyāna and prapatti are called sādhyopāja or upāga or meads wbich the man Oan adopt following the guidance of the swastras and the acharyas, Bhagavan is called siddhofāgia, tbe utāga that is already present ever ready to save.</p>
<p>One of the finest chapters in the Rahasyatravasära is that called the Uttarakrityadhikära; it prescribes the kind of life that a man should lead after the performance of prapatti. Bodily purity, freedom from evil thronghts, the performance of nitya and Haimittika ribes without any desire for the fruits or consequences,</p>
<p>xxviii goodwill to all, even to enemies who hate and revile, service to God and the devotees of God, contentment with wbatever one bas or whatever comes in one&rsquo;s way without any effort for attaining it - these are some of the virtues that the prapanna should cultivate. His service to God and His devotees is prompted by the mere love of it and is not due to the expectation of any reward. When one has performed prapatti, one gives ap all thoughts concerning oneself, even the thought of attaining moksha, for the Lord has taken on Himself all this burden or bhara,</p>
<p>It may be asked: “It was said before that one of the angas of prapatti is the will or determination at the time of its perfor mance to do whatever is pleasing to God and the avoidance of wbat is displeasing to Him. Human nature being what it is, it is just possible that the prapanna commits offences against the Lord, either anawares or even deliberately. If he does so, how can it be said that the performance of prapatti is sure to bring bim moksha of the end of this very life?&rdquo; Vedantadesika apswers this question as follows:- &ldquo;In matters which cannot be understood by human reasoning, and in which the sāstras are the only authority, we have to accept with faith what is stated in them, just as they are stated there. Prapatti is said in the süstras to have the potency of conferriog moksha at the end of this life. The man who has performed prapatti is not likely to commit sips deliberately. If he commits them unawares, they will be ignored by the Lord as they were not deliberate. If he bas, at any time, owing to the weakness of buman Dature, committed &amp; deliberate offence, he should offer expiation (prayaschitta ) for it and thus obtain pardon and the prayaschitta for such offences is another prapatti. If, however, being hard of heart, he does not choose to offer this expiation, the Lord will punish bim in this very life, before his death, in some way or other for the sin committed by him. He may become blind or lame or meet with the loss of friends or relatives or become subject social obloquy. There are bundreda of other forms which the punishment might take. It is certain,</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>xxix</p>
<p>however, that the prapanna will have moksha at the end of this very life as desired by him.</p>
<p>Among the prapannas, there are two classes driptas and ārtas. Driptas are those that can bear the sufferings of this life until death overtakes them. secure in the consciousness that the Saviour will confer moksha thereafter. Artas are those who, while per forming prapatti, beg to be relieved of this life at once, as they cannot endore separation from Bhagavan even for an instant. They, too, will have their prayer fulfilled.</p>
<p>Competence for the performance of prapatti consists, 88 has been already indicated in want of full knowledge of the upāya (bhakti. yoga) described in the sāstras or in the incapacity to adopt it. Even if a man bas the knowledge and the capacity, if be cannot endure the delay in the attaindent of moksha which is likely in bhakti as an upaya, he is competent to adopt prapatti. It has to be added that upāsana or bhakti is open only to men belonging to the three higher castes; prapatti, on the other hand, is open to all castes and to both sexes.</p>
<p>The performance of prapatti is a rite to be gone through with the prescribed mantras or mysteries. There are two forms in which the rite is gegally performed today. One is the rite in which he disciple is made to repeat the mantra of prapatti de dictated by the Acharya. This is uktinishța in the other the disciple does not repeat that mantra but the acharya performs it for him. This is acharyanishtā.</p>
<p>The reader may now ask: &ldquo;In this scheme of upayas for the attaioment of moksha, if bhakti and prapatti alone &amp;re stated to be the upayas, what is the place of karma yoga and jnana yoga which are described at considerable length in the Bhagavad Gita ? Do they in any way contribute to the attainment of moksha juu The answer is as follows:- Karma yoga means the performance, by one who has understood the truth concerning the essential nature of the jiva and that of the Supreme Being, of such karinas</p>
<p>XYZ or rites and duties as are prescribed in the sāstras for one&rsquo;s varna and one&rsquo;s asrama under the heads of nitya (compulsory and regularly recurring rites) naimittika (compulsory bat occasional rites due to particular occasions) and kämya, those which are capable of yielding certain fruits but wbich are not forbidden. These rites and daties should be performed without any desire for the consequences or fruits which they might be capable of yielding and in accordance with one&rsquo;s ability. Further any one of the following should be treated as most important, adoration of the Gode, austerities (tapas), pilgrimages to holy places, gifts of charity and yagnas or sacrifices. If duly performed, they tend to remove the sids of the Jiva and help to promote jnāna yoga and through it to create bhakti. They may also directly promote bhakti. Jnāna yoga is capable of helping the jiva to realise bis self as detached or separated from the body. It leads directly to bhakti. Other means such as the pruise of the Lord and the utterance of Bis holy names are helpfal in promoting bhakti.</p>
<p>It should be clearly anderstood that bhakti and prapatti are only particular forms of jnāna or knowledge. So the saying Jnänāt muktih (Inukti is the result of jnīna,) applies to bhakti and prapatti.</p>
<p>The devotee may be either an Ekantin or a Paramaikantin. He is called Ekantin who prays to Bhagavan for moksha as well as for the good things of this life but worships no other deity. He is &amp; Paramaikantin who, while praying only to Bhagavan, does not pray for anything other than bhakti and jnana and their fruit moksha.</p>
<p>From what has been said before, it would be clear that bhakti, an upaya, requires certain rites and duties as aids or accessories (angas) and that, without them, it would be incomplete. Prapatti, on the other hand, does not require the performance of any such rites and duties. It is complete in itself. It has been described as resembling the Brahma missile (Brahmtstra) whose potenoy would disappear if it were accompanied by the use of any other weapon or missile. The question would arise, “Why should the prapanna perform the karmas or rites like nitya and naimittika, if they serve no purpose in promoting the efficacy of prapatti ?&rdquo; Vedantadesika ådmits the potency of prapatti to secure moksha without the supplementary aid of other rites and duties, but insists that the prapanna, too, like the bhakta, should continue to perform these karmas or rites as they are God&rsquo;s ordinances or commands revealed through the Srutis and Smritis and as their non performance would be a violation of divine injunctions and therefore disobedience to God. By their neglect the jiva would incur punishment from Bhagavan.</p>
<p>So far we have described at some length Sri Vedantadesikar&rsquo;s teacbing on bhakti and prapatti as upāyas for the attainment of noksha with reference to the competency for each of them, the fruit arising from each and the differences between them. It is well known that in the Rahasyatrayasära, several chapters (notably 23, 24, 25, 26 and also 29) deal with controversial matter, For &amp; clear understanding of the discussion contained in those chapters, it is necessary to have a knowledge of what the acharyas of the Southern School, especially Sri Lokacharya, have said in such treatises as Sri Vachanabhooshanam and Mumukshuppadi about bhakti and prapatti.</p>
<ol>
<li>According to Sri Lokacharya,* bhakti, thoagh described as an upaya in the Upanishads, is really against the essential nature of the jiva (svarūpa viruddhai) The jiva is the body of Iswara. He is absolutely dependent on Iswara for all that he is and does and is also His s&rsquo;esha or dasa who has no will and no capacity for action which he can call his own.</li>

<p>Press, Madras. Also Srivachanabhooshanam: Dviteeyaprakaranam: Sutras 115, 116, 117, 178.xxxii Sri Lokacharya argues :&ndash; &ldquo;If this is so, to adopt bhakti as an upāya would mean that the jiva trusts to his own endeavours and efforts for his salvation. How can a creature who has no will of bis own think of depending on himself, when every thought and every movement of bis are directed and controlled by Iswara ?&rdquo; Therefore prapatti alone is the means of salvation for one whose svarüpa is being s&rsquo;esha to Iswara.</p>
<p>To this Vedantadesika replies :- &ldquo;It is true that the jīva is dependent on Iswara for all that he is. But Iswara has endowed hiin with intelligence and reason, so that, as a rational being, he may use the powers granted to him by Iswara for rejecting evil and for choosing what is good. If the jīva is absolutely without any free will of his own, the s&rsquo;āstras which enjoin certain thiogs to be done by him on pain of God&rsquo;s displeasure would be meaningless. And the süstras do prescribe at great length bhakti as an upaya, It would be anfair on the part of the sastras to prescribe something for the adoption of the jīva if it were against his essential nature.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Another point at issue between the two schools is the nature of prapatti or what is meant by that word. Sri Lokucharya lays emphasis on the jiva&rsquo;s being the body of Iswara and on his being His s&rsquo;esha and also on the overwhelming compassion of the Lord towards the jiva. He argues from these that, like a man who would cleaose the dirt on his own body without being prayed to by that body, Iswara would, of His own accord, cleanse the impurities of the self which is his body without any prayer or effort on its part. So prapatti is, according to bim, merely mental acquiescence, on the part of the jiva, in Iswara&rsquo;s undertaking the responsibility of his protection. What is required of the prapanna is refraining from rejecting the Lord&rsquo;s eagerness to save him (*apratishedha) or in other words, mere receptivity. The jīva does not remain passive like a clod (achit) but is mentally aware of the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, of His omnipotence and of his grace which requires</li>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>XXXüi</p>
<p>no cause hetu or effort on the jiva&rsquo;s part. In fact, considering the enormity of mad&rsquo;s offences, bow insignificant and worthless would any endeavour of his be! So the Lord&rsquo;s grace redeems man from samsāra, for He is bound to protect #bat is His own. Besides, He is so compassionate and bis love to man sa over. powering that, like the cow wbich licks the slime on the body of the new-born calf, He rould consider even the faults, offences, and shortcomings of the self as agreeable (* bhogya). To a lover, the dirt on the person of his beloved is far from being bateful.</p>
<p>Sri Vedantadesika replies :- &ldquo;The sõstras lay down rules and regulations for the conduct of man. They teach wbat is dharma and what is adharma and state that offences against the Lord would meet with punishment unless expiated. It is gross exaggeration to say that offences could ever be agreeable to God.</p>
<p>When a man feels that he is ignorant of what he should do for following the path of bhakti or is unable to adopt it owing to his weakness or inability, he seeks refuge under God, begs for His pardon and protection and surrenders bis self to God to be saved by His mercy. Then God stands in the place of expiations which he is unable to perform and in the place of bhakti as the upāya for his moksha. Here prapatti is not mere passive acquiescence or receptivity but an active mental process of seeking the Lord&rsquo;s refuge and praying to Him for succoar. So prāpatti is a rite or dharma which has to be adopted with the help of an acharya. It is true that God&rsquo;s mercy is boundless (niravadhi), but unless man who is a being endowed with intelligence, does something to deserve the Lord&rsquo;s grace, it will not come down on Him of its own accord So some endeavour or effort, however insignificant it night be, some gesture at least (a vyāja) is required before the Lord would undertake the bhara or responsibility of protecting him. Further if the Lord&rsquo;s grace were to come to man&rsquo;s succoar without any effort on his part, it might be asked whether it would</p>

<p>come to all without exception or only to those whom it chore. In the former case, it would mean that there is salvation for all beings and all at once (sarra mukti). In the latter, the grace of God would seem partial to some and in different to others. So &amp; vyāja or gesture is necessary on mad&rsquo;s part to become worthy of the Lord&rsquo;s grace and this vyāja is the performance of prapatti.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Another point at dispute is the question whether the performance of nitya and naimittika karmas is at all necessary for the prapanna, since prapatti is admitted by all to be capable of yielding moksha without any such aid. Sri Loka. charya states in his Mumukshuppadi * that it is no offence at all for the prapanna to give up the performance of these rites and duties. But, he adds, almost immediately after making this statement, that the prapanna, however, per forms them for fear of public opinion and out of compassion to those who are ignorant, lest they too should give up their perfor mance by following his example and thus bring ruin on themselves 1 (lokasangraha). Since they are performed by the prapanna ont of love for his fellow-boman beings who are not prapannas and without looking upon them as upājas, the Lord would feel delight ed at their performance, which would, therefore, be of the nature of kainkarya or service to the Lord.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sri Vedantadesika agrees in thipking that prapatti does not require any complementary or supplementary rites and would yield its fruit irrespective of their performance or pod.perfor. mance. But the performance of nitya and naimittika rites is ordained by God as a command and its transgression would bring the consequent punishment. So these rites have to be performed by the prapaona, not for lokasangraha or as kainkarya, but to avoid punishment due to disobedience of God&rsquo;s injunctions,</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>XXXV</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Sri Lokacharya enjoins great reverence for the prapanna, whatever may be bis caste and considers it one of the greatest of offences to treat him with indifference, disregard, ill-will or com tempt on the ground of his caste. Though he does not state that inter.dining and inter-marrying are proper among prapannas, bis eulogy of the prapanna might lead people to think that these acts were permitted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sri Vedantadesika also speaks in bigb terms of the prapanna&rsquo;s devotion and of bis being fit for moksha, whatever his caste. But he states that the rules concerning inter-dining and inter-marrying are based on the differences of the bodily equipment of the jiva and that these rules should be observed as long as the body laste. There will, of course, be no difference in the attainment of moksha and there will be no such things as caste in Paramapada, but as long as the body lasts, the prapanna, too, however great bis devotion to God and however pure his life, bas to follow the rules and regulations of caste in social life. &ldquo;The temple cow is certainly more worthy than other cows inasmuch as its milk, butter and the like are used in the service of God, but on that account, it does not cease to be a cow&rdquo;.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>In addition to prapatti, the âchāryas of the Southern School consider that the love and goodwill of the * achārya to his disciple who has won them by devout service to bin can, of themselves, secure moksha for the disciple even without any prapatti of his. It is true that Jniiiia is the means to moksha, In this case the acharya&rsquo;s jnāna secures it for his sishya.</li>
</ol>
<p>The controversy concerning the performance of nitya and naimittika by the prapanna had its origin in the interpretation of the Charamasloka t of the Bhagavad Gita. There it is said</p>
<p>Sri Vachanabhushanam: Chaturthaprakaranam : Sutras 461 &amp; 462 Pages 360m-362; Ananda Press, Madras (1908).</p>
<p>Note &ldquo;Having given up all rites and dutics, seek me alone as refugo.</p>
<p>Do not grieve, for I will release thee from all sins.</p>
<p>Chapt XVIII-Sloka 66.</p>
<p>XXXVI &ldquo;Sarva dharman parityajya māmekam saranam vraja&rdquo; (Having given up all dharmas (rites and duties) seek me as your refuge ) What is the meaning of &ldquo;Having given up all rites and daties ?&rdquo; Sri Lokacharya argues, &ldquo;When it is said snätvā bhunjeetha (&ldquo;Having bathed, one should eat&rdquo;) it means “first bathe and then eat&rdquo;. So also &ldquo;having given up&rdquo; means: &ldquo;First give up the performance of these rites and then seek we as the only dharma&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sri Vedantadesika, on the other band, interprets the words thus : &ldquo;When it is said, &ldquo;Having come into this world of suffering, it is your duty to seek some means of deliverance from it,&rdquo; having come does not mean &ldquo;first come into this world and then seek deliverance&rdquo;. It means &ldquo;since you have already come into this world of suffering&rdquo;. So also in the Charamasloka, the meaning is, &ldquo;Since you find yourself unable to perform the rites and duties enjoined in the sästras for the forgiveness of your sids and the attainnent of moksha, seek me as your refuge&rdquo;. The man is not asked to give them up as a condition for seeking God&rsquo;s protection, since he has already given them up oning to inability. Besides the performance of ordained karma is insisted on again and again by the Gitacharya. So it is only in the event of inability that saranāgati is prescribed.</p>
<p>It is because prapatti is clearly defined in it with its accessories and with its potency in full detail and in accordance with what is laid down in the Pancharätra Āgamas that Rahasyatrayasära has been called Prapatti Sastra,</p>
<p>Rahasyatrayasūra is thus a handbook of Visishtadvaitic Vaishpavism as uoderstood by the Vadagalai Acharyas. It is in four parts: the first part comprises chapters 1 to 22 and gives a detailed exposition of the doctrines of Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s system or Visishtadvaitic Vaisboavism, in accordance with the traditions of the Northern School and with detailed instructions about bhakti and prapatti as upayas for the attainment of the supreme goal of mad; the second part (chapters 28 to 26) discusses &amp; number of disputed points concerning bhakti and prapatti and states the</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Xxxvii</p>
<p>conclusions arrived at by the Northern School. The third part (Chapters 27 to 29) is devoted to an interpretation of the words and the sentences contained in the three great rahassas or mantras wbicb are mysteries into which the disciple is initiated by the acharya. The last three chapters 30 to 32 are on the duties of acharyas and s&rsquo;ishyas and a peroration. Sri Vedantadesika shows that all the vital tenets of Ramanuja&rsquo;s bystem are contained, as it were, in an epitonie in these mantras or buysteries. Just like the world of matter, the jiva is s&rsquo;esha to the Lord and exists oply for the fulfilment of His purposes. Since the jiva is besides a chetana endowed with intelligence, bis being sesha means that be is the servant of God. His service in this world extends also to the devotees of God. The ultimate goal of life is moksha wbich has, for its crowning glory, the service of Bhagavan and Hig consort. Man does not exist for bimself and the sooner he gives up thougbts of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;wipe&rsquo;, the better will it be for bim. The moolamantra states these truths briefly. The easiest and best way of obtaining God&rsquo;s mercy or grace and moksha wbich results from it is saraņāgati or self-surrender and this is prapatti which is done with the mantra called Duaya. The charamasloka explains how Bhagavan accepts the responsibility of redeeming the jivu when He is propitiated by prapatti and when the jīva is unable to adopt other upayas.</p>
<p>Sri Vedaptadesika wrote this treatise in Tamil with a free and generous admixture of Sanskrit words and pbrases, which has been called manipravălan, for the benefit of those whose know ledge of Sanskrit is very limited. The booķis, by no means, easy to understand, for the author is not satisfied with giving only a brief and broad outline of Ramanuja&rsquo;s system. He aims at an</p>
<p>* The Three Mantras (1) Moolamantra or Ashtakshara &ldquo;Namo Narayanaya with the pranavam or the syllable aum preceding it. (2) Dvaya &ldquo;Sriman Narayana charanau saranam prapadye, Srimate Narayanaya Namah&rdquo; and (3) The Charama sloka of the Bhagavad Gita already referred to</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarva dharman parityajya mamekam saranam vraja,</p>
<p>Aham tva sarva papebbyo mokshayishyami ma suchah.</p>
<p>XXXviji exposition of it in all its details and with all the references and authorities (pramānas) for what he says, so that it may be a manual of Visishtadvaitic Vaishnavism, complete and compre hepsive. When he quotes pramaņas in support of his statements, interpretations or contentions, Vedantadesika often gives only the first one or two words of the slokas or prose passages and of the Tamil verses of the Alwars, preso ming that these texts inust be familiar to the reader and need not therefore be quoted in full. At the present day, many readers are likely to be ignorant of them and cannot understand the line of reasoning adopted by the author owing to this ignorance. It is therefore, rightly the practice everywhere to study Rahasyatrayasāra under &amp; guru. Besides these passages quoted as pramäņas, tbe explanation of the meao ings of the words and sentences in the three great mantras requires, for &amp; clear understanding, at least an elementary koowledge of Sanskrit grammar. Further the author clinches conclusions arrived at after a discussion in &amp; number of Sanskrit slokas of his own which he does not render into Tamil. The gist of each chapter is also given in Tamil verses and in Sankrit s lokas, both at the beginning and at the end. These, too, add to the difficulty of understanding the text by oneself.</p>
<p>In this English translation, an attempt is made to minimise these difficulties. The pramūnas referred to only by their first words are translated and given in full. The author&rsquo;s own slokas are also rendered in English. Whenever it is felt necessary, explanatory words, phrases or sentences are added within brackets to make the author&rsquo;s meaning clear. Occasionally longer explana tions are given as footnotes. The author&rsquo;s interpretation of the meaning of the three mantras has been made as lucid as possible, though, as has been already said, a fall and perfect understanding would be possible only to those who have a knowledge of Sanskrit grammar, so far at least as declensions of nouns and pronouns are concerned. It is earnestly hoped that this English translation will be of help to those who have only &amp; mengre knowledge of Sapskrit, when they study the original under their guru.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Xxxix</p>
<p>It now remains for me to conclude this introduction with a grateful acknowledgement of the generous belp wbich I have received in connection with this translation. I should not have taken up the adventure but for the suggestion and kind encourage. ment given by Sri Ubbaya Ve-Agnihotram Ramapuja Thatha. cbariar Swami. His approval of the repdering of some of the earlier chapters was heartening and, after the completion of the work, he took opon bimseli the entire responsibility of getting it printed and published.</p>
<p>My grateful thanks are due to Sri K S. Patrachariar, m. A., whose eminence as a scholar in Sanskrit and in English bas been the admiration of all his friends and acquaintances. He read through the manuscript of the introduction with great patience and made a puniber of valuable suggestions for its improvement. I should like to express my respectful gratitude also to my guru, Sri Ubhaya Ve-Sinpamu Srinivasa Patrachariar Swami of Kumbs kopaw, under whom I studied Sri Bhashya and Srimad Rahasya. trayasära. He was kind enough to hear me translate the intro. duction orally into Tamil and to correct several errors that bad crept in.</p>
<p>I consider myself as baving been lucky in having sought the assistance of my esteemed friend, Sri G. K. Rangaswami Ayyangar, M. A., before giving the manuscript to the press. As a devout admirer of Sri Vedantadesika, he gave me upstinted and entbasi. Pastic co-operation in making the translation as free from errors and defects as possible. Having studied the original under the late Chetlar Mahamahopadhyaya Narasin bachariar Swami, he has a good mastery of the subject and by close scrutiny and uneparing criticism, he drew my attention to inaccuracies in the rendering and to the omissions of even single words left untranslated by oversigbt. He assisted me also in the laborious task of reading the proofs. It would be presumptuous op my part to think of thank ing him for all that he has done.</p>
