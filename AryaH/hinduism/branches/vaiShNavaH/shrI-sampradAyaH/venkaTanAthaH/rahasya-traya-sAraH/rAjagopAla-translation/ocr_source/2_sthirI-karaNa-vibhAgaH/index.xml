      <description>२४ साध्योपाय-शोधनाधिकारः
(24) THE CHAPTER ON THE CLARIFICATION OF WHAT IS MEANT BY SADHYOPAYA OR THE UPAYA THAT HAS TO BE
ADOPTED.
SANSKRIT SLOKA:
It appears to us, from the srutis, Smr̥tis and the words of gurus fortified by reason, that the Omoipotent Lord being propi. tiated by yajnas (sacrifices ), gifts made in charity, offerings made in the fire (homa ), adoration, surrender of reponsibility (bhararı yasa ), constant meditation (bhakti yoga) and the like in accor dance with one&amp;rsquo;s competence confers benefits op men.</description>

      <description>२५ प्रभाव-व्यवस्थाधिकारः
(25) THE CHAPTER ON THE LIMITS WITHIN WHICH THE UPAYAS BHAKTI AND
PRAPATTI HAVE POTENCY:
SANSKRIT SLOKA
The essential nature (svarupa) of the Omnipresent Lord (vibhu), what and of what description are His qualities, His vibhavas (avatārs), His sportful activities and the like and the limits set by His command &amp;ndash; all these can be determined from the s&amp;rsquo;rutis. So also the greatness of His devotees and the potency of the ways in which we should worsbip Him (bhakti) and the like (prapatti) have been determined by great men like Sri Rāmanuja in accordance with what is stated (in the süstras).</description>

      <description>(26) THE CHAPTER ON THE VINDICATION OF
(THE) POTENCY (OF PRAPATTI ).
SANSKRIT SLOKA:
It is, of course, wonderful that stones and the like should be. come women and the like (Ahalya); (but) more wonderful is it that fire should become as cold as snow (as in the case of Hanu. man) and that a blade of grass should become a missile (Kakasura); even niore wonderful is the act of slaying when it becomes the means of redemption (as for Sisupala and others).</description>
