(13) THE CHAPTER ON THE MAN WHO HAS DONE 

WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE (1. E.) PRAPATTI. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA. 

When Bhagavan, who is omnipotent, who knows all things and who is, by His nature, full of love for us, has accepted the res. ponsibility (of protecting us ), there is nothing more remaining to be done by us here for it; let us therefore fix our souls in that boundless sex of supreme bliss and feel the satisfaction (of having attained our object) by becoming rich in rendering service to Him, poor though we may have been before. 

THE PRAPANNA HAS DONE WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO 

AND HAS ATTAINED HIS GOAL: 

(1) The man who has adopted this upāya (prapatti) has, from the time when he adopted it, nothing else to do for attaining the fruit thereof. (2) What he had to do has been done by per forming prapatti once; (3) (Bhagavan) who is independent (of all others), whose will is irresistible and who is the one that rewards us with the fruit (of our actions) saya, "Do not grieve t," Owing to these (three) reasons, the prapanna would become care-free at the thought of having surrendered bis bhara. Since the Lord of all who has been accepted as the upāya\*, which is ever present as stated in. "Seek refuge under me alone", has said "I will release Thee from all sins", and since the Lord can (always) be trusted and since He is capable (of acting according to His word), he would bave no doubts or fears in regard to the realisa tion of his object. So he (the prapaia) would rejoice at baving given up even the slightest trace of other aing or objects and also with baving given up other upüyas along with upāyas which are subsidiary to them. Like a poor man who has received a great treasure with little effort, he would rejoice at the prospect of the

supreme goal (of life ) which he is to attain. It has been said: "Hel who has sougbt, in every possible manner, the refuge of Narayana who is the Saviour and the guru of the world is not the servant of the gods, of the rishis, of animals, of men and of the pitris. He is in no way their debtor". In regard to such jivas (kṣetrajnas) as have taken the names of Prajapati (the Lord of creatures ) and Pasupati (the Lord of beasts, vis. bound souls), he is able, like one whose promissory note registered in the un. written Vedas under certain conditions (upādhi relating to caste etc.) and requiring service as interest for the principal ( borrowed by him from them) has been fully discharged (torn off). There fore when he has to pronounce their names in the performance of \*such compulsory and regularly recurrent and occasional rites 46 the five great yajnas (pañcamaha yajnas), he would realise that these dames refer really to Isware (Bhagavan) etymologically: as has been stated by the sages in passages like :-" Those who worship the pitris (the spirits of their fore-fathers), the gods, the Brahmins and Agoi - they (in reality) wore bip only Viṣṇu, who is the Ioner Self of all beings." When the kiog's servants place a garland and a jewel on the coat worn by the king, their object is not to please the coat but to gain the favour of the king. 

The same idea has been expressed in such places as the chapter called Yajnagrahara in the Mahabharata\* (Ch. 349 Santi Parva) and in Hastigiri Māhātniya. In the Brahma Sutras algo (1-2-29), it is said : "Since words like Agni refer directly also to Brabman, Jaimini is of opinion that there is nothing unreasonable in it". Such words as gods and pitris have no connection with the coats called gods and pitris and by the full significance contained in their 

NOTE:- The idea is that Prajapati, Pasupati. Agni and others are only like the coat of a king and that, within them, there is the Inner Ruler, Immortal, who alone is Parameswara or the Supreme Ruler. 

1. Bhagavatam: 11-5-41 2. Mahabharata: Santiparva: 355-24 

• Mahabbarata: Santiparva: Chapter 349: "The Great Padmanabha receives the quintessences of all the offerings made in sacrifices" and when the gods asked Brahma who was performing a sacrifice to Bhagavao be replied: "Neither by me nor by any one else who wants to cross the sea of samsara are you adored with sacrifices. It is only Bhagayan who receives our offerings\*\*.

parts (i.c.) etymology or derivation, they stand for Īśvara (Bhagai van), in the same way A8 words like Narayana do. In pronouncing such words (Prajapati, Pasupati, Agni), the prapanna would realise that there is no violation of his sole and exclusive devotion to Bhagavan, in the same way as, when the pare Bacrificers (s'uddhayaji) who live in Swetadvipa pronounce the word Narayana (Nārānamayanam), they do not go against their exclusive devotion to Bhagavad by using the word NāraBhagavad has willed to accept him as His servant to render service in accordance with his varna, asrama, occasions (like the birth of a child) and qualities (like being a Vaishnava). Therefore by service to Him who is the Ruler and the Seshi . service which consists in obedient performance of His commands and permissions as understood from the Sāstras, the prapanna would do his little bit of service like the freed souls who understand the mind of the Lord by direct perception and be like the muktas; he would be extolled, according to the Sastras and those who stand by them, as one who, by the completion of the upāya (prapatti), has done his duty and who, by the completion of his aim in life, has attained satisfaction. 

Sri Rāmanuja has conclusively described the prapanna's reflection on his satisfactory fulfilment of his duty thus in his Saranagati gadya :-"Therefore rest happy in the assurance free from all doubt that you will know me, see me, and attain me As I truly am". This is what it means:-"We were wandering in samsāra owing to Bhagavan's punishment inflicted on us for transgressing His commands from beginningless time. By the compassion of Bhagavad ever waiting for an opportunity (to save us), we came into the reach of the kind glances of our good ācāryas and by repeating after them their utterance of Duaya, we have completed our prapatti. There is no further means needed for obtaining the Saviour. Therefore He will pardon (all the sins) which were the cause of the punishment. The Lord of Sri (Lakṣmī) who is the seshi of all and who is capable of purity. ing His devotees and obtaining their service, will, for His own glory, protect us. With this faith, the prapanna would be free 

13

139 

from all care or anxiety or responsibility." (This is the purport of Sri Rāmanuja's words in the Gadya). This idea is the conclu. sive meaning which is surely contained also in the Saviour's words "Do not grieve" (in the charama śloka ). 

THE MARKS OF ONE WHO HAS PERFORMED 

PRAPATTI : 

Since one of the qualifications for the performance of prapatti, is sorrow or grief before prapatti, if he had no grief before, he would not have the necessary qualification for performing prapatti. So by the principle "when there is no cause, there is no effect," bis npaya (prapatti) will not be effective. If, after the performance of prapatti, he grieves owing to want of faith in the words of the Saviour, it would follow by the principle "When the effect is absent, there must have beeu absence of all the required materials (or causes)" that his upüya is incomplete (owing to want of full faith) and that the benefit or fruit will be delayed inasmuch as it will require the cowpletion of the upāya. The man who was formerly full of grief and who is now free from sorrow in accor. dance with the words" Do not grieve" may be considered to have done what should be done (i.) prapatti in the proper manner, 

TAMIL; VERSE: 

Our spiritaal leaders whom the Lord of Sri that dwells on Hastigiri has taken into His protection after endeavouring for & long time to find out what boon He should confer on those who loved Him. they are like kings and gods (to us), for they have, ever in their minds, the abode of the Lord of the eternal süris and they are like Paramahamosas, because they have completed all rites that have to be performed, (or like swans in their purity or in their capacity to separate the essential from the non-essential). 

140 SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Bharanyāsa (or the surrender of the responsibility of protec tion) has been made (at the feet of) Bhagavan (Hari) for reach ing beyond samsāra. So also actions that can produce only limited pleasures have been given up just like forbidden actions. The sustenance of the body will continue in accordance with past karma (which has begun to operate). 80 nothing need be done for it. Thereafter (i.c) after prapatti the bounds\* imposed by the Lord's command are scrupulously observed by wise men, (merely because it is the Lord's command.) 

NOTE:-\* This means that the nirya and naimittika karmas which are ordained by the Lord in the Sastras have still to be performed after prapatti, as, otherwise, there would be transgression of His command.
