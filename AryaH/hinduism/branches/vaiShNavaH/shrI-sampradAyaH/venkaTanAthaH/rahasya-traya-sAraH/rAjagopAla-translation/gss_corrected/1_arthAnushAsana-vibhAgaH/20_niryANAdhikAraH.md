(20) THE CHAPTER ON THE DEPARTURE OF THE



SELF (FROM THE BODY) page255



SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_:



मनसि करणग्रामं प्राणे मनः पुरुषे च तं  
झटिति घटयन् भूतेष्वेनं परे च तमात्मनि ।  
स्वविदविदुषोरित्थं साधारणे सरणेर्मुखे  
नयति परतो नाडीभेदैर्यथोचितमीश्वरः ॥ ४४ ॥

The Lord merges the aggregate of the senses in the mind, the mind with the senses in the vital breath (prāna), the vital breath with these in the self or soul, the self in the subtle elements (Sakshina bhutas ) and the self with these elements in Himself (the Supreme Self) very soon. So far, the process of the soul's departure is common to both the person who has realised Him and the person who has not realised Him. Thereafter, the Lord leads the self through different veins ( nadi)[^56] which lead either to the (dark) path of smoke or to the shining path of light (archirādi) or elsewhere in accordance with the qualifications (of each individual).

[^56]: The soul of the man who has realised _Brahman_ is said to be led through a vein issuing out of the head into the shining path of archis along which it passes into immortality in Vaikuṇṭha  . The soul of the man who has not realised _Brahman_ is led through other veins into the dark path called dhuma or smoke. He will be born again in _samsāra_.






"Having given up all _upāya_s, and having given up also all desires including the desire to enjoy one's self, I seek as my refuge, O, Lord, Thy feet which measured the world." When with these words, the _prapanna_ takes the feet of the Lord, the Lord takes him by the hand, which, it has been said, is the only support of the _prapanna_: "The hands of the Lord who is called _Janārdana_ and who has been bought with the price of _bhakti_ is the only support for the _prapanna_." The Lord who has been called "the king of kings of all (beings)" and who is the possessor of the two glories, _Līlā_ Vibhūti (in this world) and _Nitya_ _Vibhūti_ or eternal glory in Paramapada, (having taken him by the hand) fixes him in a place of His own liking and the _prapanna_ leads his life there, being held in as high a regard as an anointed queen and following such occupations as are consistent with his exclusive and supreme attachment to the Lord.



DELAY IN THE ATTAINMENT OF THE GOAL :



Among prapannas, there may be (some ) who, on account of certain specific evil deeds done in past lives which have begun to operate now, may become subject to such lapses as the following :- (1) They may display the feelings of 'I' and 'mine' (ahankāra and mamakara) (2) as a result of these (feelings) they may commit offences; (3) they may display a taste or desire for other objects than the Lord; (4) owing to this desire they may contact other deities; (5) they may be weak-minded; owing to this (weak-mindedness ), they may desire to adopt other _upāya_s. There may be others who, owing to good deeds done in past lives which have begun to yield their fruits in this life and owing to the specific nature of the request for benefits made at the time of _prapatti_, have never swerved from the service of the Lord. It may be asked what is the nature of the delay in the release from _samsāra_ in the case of these two classes of prapannas. The answer is as follows:



(1) In this matter, prapaninas will never have the feelings of 'I' and 'mine' in any deep-seated form such as the Cārvākas (materialists) have. Even people who walk warily sometimes stumble; so also prapannas may, on rare occasions, show these feelings; but these improper feelings or notions will disappear by later wisdom originating in reason.

(2) In the chapter on the atonement for offences, we explained how, if offences are committed, they will last only until the time of winning pardon or the undergoing of punishment and how the offences will be expiated within the required time.

In the case of those who performed _prapatti_ without indicating any definite time (for the attainment of _mokṣa_ ), it is said as follows: "The man who has performed _prapatti_ to me and who has not abstained from sins committed frequently, attains me late after wearing out all his sins."

(3) "Since the _prapanna_ is bent on attaining _mokṣa_, he is not likely to have any long-standing desire for other benefits. Like those who have both _Brahma_ bhāvana and Karma bhavana, (_Brahma_, Rudra and the like), they might entertain a desire for other benefits along with the desire for _mokṣa_ ; if so, _Iśvara_, who is their well-wisher, will not grant them those (so called) benefits ( as they are not for his good); for it is said :-"Even when the _bhakta_ prays for it, _Iśvara_ does not permit him to do what is not good to himself. Does not the mother prevent her child that longs to fall into the fire ?" It is said also :-- " He whom I want to bless -- his wealth I take away from him. His relations will then desert him. He will become miserable. If, in his misery, he still clings to me, I confer on him such blessings as are unattainable even for the devas." The same idea is found in the story of Kundadhāra[^57] . Sometimes _Iśvara_ creates in the _prapanna_ a distaste for these other things by making him realise that they are trivial, transient and mingled with pain. Sometimes, as in the case of Soubhari and Kuchela, he gives them the benefits desired by them, but makes them feel an aversion to them afterwards.

[^57]: Kundadhara : A certain man who was devoutly attached to Kundadhara begged him for wealth. Kundadhara, instead of granting wealth, saw to it that his follower should become attached to _dharma_.






Thus the man who performed _prapatti_ indicating the time when he should attain _mokṣa_ , will have acquired an aversion to other benefits than the Lord within the prescribed time. In the case also of the man who did not indicate any such time while performing _prapatti_, there will be delay, as has been stated in the _śloka_ : - "The man who is desirous of performing such _karma_ as is a means of obtaining other benefits (than God ) enjoys pleasures unmingled with pain, and at last acquires a distaste for them (and the spirit of renunciation ), after which he reaches the abode of _Bhagavān_. In accordance with this, the delay in his attainment (of the supreme goal) will be only until the birth of aversion to worldly objects.



(4) In regard to contact with other deities, the Ruler of All will bring him back some day or other into the company of those who are staunchly and exclusively devoted to _Bhagavān_, correct his lapse until he gets ashamed and thus remove his deviation from the right path.



If, in some, this contact with other deities becomes permanent, it may be inferred that the adoption of _prapatti_ as an _upāya_ was incomplete in their case. It may also be understood that they may have such things as Naraka in future. In a man of this description, the fragmentary _prapatti_ performed to _Bhagavān_ may, at some time in the future, attain completion and become effective.



(5) In those who performed _prapatti_ after the rise of full and great faith, there will not be any weak-mindedness nor the desire to adopt other _upāya_s. If these - viz., weak-mindedness and the desire to adopt other means -- are present, it is to be inferred that their former faith was not strong enough. The Lord of All will correct these men also until they acquire great faith and make them perfect prapannas.



In the case of those in whom no such lapses occur, there is no possibility at all of delay in the attainment (of the supreme goal). There will be delay for them only as long as they desire it. They will attain _mokṣa_  at the time when they desire to have it. The Adhikarī who has attained the true state of a _prapanna_ will always be the favourite of the Supreme Ruler, who is the Lord of Lakṣmī , as pointed out in the passage. "O, Thou, Lord of _Śrī_r_aṅga_m, that delightest in those idle* men (prapannas ) who stand outer-most (as being incapable of _karma_ _yoga_, _jñāna_ _yoga_ or _bhakti_ _yoga_ )". [ They are called 'idle', because, after _prapatti_ they do not seek any other _upāya_. They are said to stand "outer-most" because, being unable to adopt _karma_ _yoga_, _jñāna_ _yoga_ and _bhakti_ _yoga_, they have adopted the _upāya_ (_prapatti_) which is prescribed in the _Carama_ _śloka_  of the Gita.]



In the case of this _prapanna_, the Lord who is the unconditional _śeṣī_  of all, who is independent of all others and without limitations of any kind and whose will is irresistible, withholds his desire to punish, which is the cause of all fears, at the very first moment in which he utters the sentence expressing _prapatti_, in the same way as at the beginning of the meditation in the case of the upāsaka or _bhakti_ _yoga_ _niṣṭhā_, who has adopted _prapatti_ as a means to _bhakti_, of whom it is said. " When the _vidyā_ commences, the destruction of former sins and the absence of contact with subsequent sins (occur), for so the śrutis say". The Lord makes up His mind (at that very instant) to bring him and those who are his followers into the company of the eternal sūris and, not satisfied with having done only this, He devours, as it were, all the heaps of sins committed by those who have sought Him and does not reveal any trace of them outside and feels also that He should stomach even more (of these sins). He removes the sins of his followers too, even when they are committed deliberately, by His will to grant the _prapanna_ His blessing. In virtue of this, they will expiate their sins by repentance and the like. It is said: "He (the Lord) hastens to give Paramapada to the man who is fit for _mukti_". The Lord pities the _prapanna_ for the delay which he has chosen and hastens to create in him an impatience of delay (in attainment). He produces in him an eagerness to attain the goal as illustrated in the following (verses ) :- “ Hereafter I do not want to be born in this world of ignorance" and "Do not deceive me as Thou didst before. I swear by Thee and by Thy queen whose beautiful locks of hair shed their fragrance like a garland on Thy chest - I swear that I must be taken to Paramapada." Having made him so eager and so impatient to obtain the goal, the Lord decides on giving him Paramapada as desired by him at the end of this life, which has come to him as a result of past _karma_: So has it been said :-"Our Lord" is the greatest benefactor that confers Vaikuṇṭha   on those who have performed _prapatti_, when they happen to die". The Lord* has already seen to it that the fetters of gold and iron which bind him to _samsāra_ namely, his _pāpa_ and puṇya, past and future, as also the _karma_ which has begun to operate, except that portion of it which he has agreed to expiate (during this life) are cut off without any trace being left at all. [ Even puṇya _karma_ which would lead to swarga is a fetter (though of gold ), because it stands in the way of _mokṣa_.] It is said :- "The sins of the past and the sins committed after _prapatti_ vanish like cotton thrown in the fire." So when the time for leaving the body has come, the Lord causes his meritorious deeds (puṇya) and his sins (papa) to be divided and distributed among others, namely, those who were his well-wishers and those who did evil to him, respectively, as the consequence of the good and the evil wrougbt to him by them. For it has been said:-- "The man who is about to attain _mukti_ leaves his puṇya and _pāpa_ to his friends and foes respectively and attains _Brahman_ as the fruit of _bhakti_ _yoga_". and again "The sins which are notorious in this world and which, oppressive like Yama, make a man sink into _samsāra_ left the man about to attain _mukti_ without making the least noise and entered into plants (viz, his foes )". The authors of the _Smṛti_s have expressed the truth contained in the Upaniṣads in the manner stated above.



THE _PRAPANNA_ MAY DIE AT ANY TIME, DAY OR NIGHT, IN THE BRIGHT OR IN THE DARK HALF OF THE MONTH : ETC.



In regard to those who are desirous of other benefits than _mokṣa_  and who have not fulfilled completely the means of attaining _mokṣa_ , it has been said in the _Smṛti_, and in the science of the celestial bodies, in the context of the departure from the body that Day-time, the bright half of the month (Sukla paksha) and the Uttarayana are favourable times for those that die. But (as the _prapanna_ has adopted successfully the proper _upāya_) there is no such rule for him in regard to the time of death. For it has been said about him ;-"It is not right to say that the man who dies at night will not attain _mokṣa_ , for the association with _karma_ lasts only as long as the body lasts ", and again " For the same reason, the views is not right that the man who dies in dakshmayana will not attain _mokṣa_ ." Whether in the day of man or in the night of man, whether in the day of pitṛs (s'ukla paksha ) or in the night of the pitṛs (Kṛṣṇapaksha ), whether in the day of the gods (uttarāyana ) or in the night of the gods (dakshmayana ) - at the time appointed by the Lord, He makes him remember all his previous thoughts and desires (for _mokṣa_ ) and like a king who is gracious and who cuts off the fetters of the prince lying in the prison-house, the Lord takes him along with Him. He causes some occasion or other suited to the time, for the soul's parting from the body without regard to auspicious or inauspicious time.



THE PROCESS OF THE SELF LEAVING THE BODY:



Then the Lord makes the ten external senses like speech merge in the mind and the mind with the senses of action and of knowledge, which are thus eleven in number, merge in the vital breath (prāna) and the vital breath in the self. Then at the moment of the shaking of the bone in the back called vamsa, the Lord churns out the subtle elements from the gross body (_sthūla_ deha) and contacts the self with the subtle elements (_sūkṣma_ bhuta) and then comforts the self so mingled with the senses, the vital breath and the subtle elements by keeping it by the side of Himself in the form that He has assumed in the heart; for, by nature, He is its friend and well-wisher. After giving the self, rest and relaxation, the Lord sees that the self passes out of the body. So far, the process is the same both for the man who has realised _Brahman_ and for the man who has not.



THE PATH OF THE JOURNEY AFTER DEPARTURE:



(In regard to this passage of the self from the body), it has been said as follows: "The _Jīva_   who abides in the heart like a lamp has innumerable veins (nādi). They are of many colours:--- white, black, violet, blue, golden yellow, yellow and red. Among these veids (1ādīs), which are of varied colours, there is one which proceeds upwards. The individual self (_Jīva_  ) who passes through this vein breaks through the sphere of the sun and, having passed beyond the world of _Brahma_, reaches the highest state. One hundred other nādīs also go upwards. The _Jīva_   who goes out through them attains the bodies of the devas and reaches their worlds. Some nādis of various colours go downwards and they are dim. The _Jīva_   who goes out through them is born in _samsāra_ in this world, without any choice on his part, in order to experience the fruits of his _karma_. (Since the nādīs are like rays proceeding from the heart which is like a lamp, they are called rays (rasmis).



The Lord sees to it that the self of the _prapanna_ does not go out through any of these nādīs which lead those that are thieves of themselves, ((i. e.) who do not realise that they belong to the lord) to _svarga_ and naraka (hell) and are therefore like the routes along which thieves take their victims. He makes the _prapanna_'s self enter the _Brahma_ Nīdi, which is beyond the hundredth among those nādīs that go upwards and which leads to the shining path called arcirādi, and helps it to start with the support of the rays of the sun.



When Kooratth alvan (ŚrīVatsankamisra) was in his last moments, his tongue was parched with the fatigue (of the moment) and (unable to speak or utter any words) he caught hold of Śrī _Rāmānuja_'s feet. At that time Śrī _Rāmānuja_ whispered the _Dvaya_ _Mantra_ in his ear[^58] . The other disciples, who were there, said to themselves with mental depression :- "How can we hope to get this blessing ( _Dvaya_ being whispered in the ear by Śrī_Rāmānuja_)? What shall we do?" Śrī _Rāmānuja_ understood their fears and said, "Do you not know the true character of Alvan? When he is in this condition (unable to say anything owing to the parched throat), what I did was only like placing a little camphor and a piece of sugar-candy (in his mouth, to make it wet). I did not whisper the _Dvaya_ in order to make the _upāya_ complete with its accessories". The disciples were relieved on hearing this.

[^58]: The idea is that the _prapanna_ will attain _mokṣa_ even if he is unconscious and unable to utter the _Dvaya_ or other _mantra_s.




Therefore as has been said in the following two ślokas: " The man who has performed _prapatti_, whether he dies in a holy place or in the house of one who eats dog's flesh, will attain _mokṣa_  even if he dies unconscious," and, "The man who, when his mind is in its normal condition, when the body is not shattered, and when the elementary constituents of the body (dhatu) are in perfect equipoise, meditates on me who have the world as my body and who am not subject to births due to _karma_ when  man lies like a log of wood or a piece of stone in his dying moments, I think of (him) my devotee and lead him to attain the highest state", and as has been stated also in the Tamil verses , -- "O, Lord that reposest on Adi _Śeṣa_ in _Śrī_r_aṅga_m, a man seeks refuge under the strong in order that he may obtain their support when he is in distress; though I am not like Tby devotees who know how to seek Thy help, yet I approach Thee, since Thou wert gracious even to the elephant; when the langour of the dying moment has come, I may not be able to think of Thee. Therefore I entreat Thee, even now, that, at that time, Thou shouldst come to my rescue," -- as has been said in these passages, the _prapanna_ need not seek the remembrance (of God) in his last moments (by any effort of his own ).



THE LAST THOUGHT :



The statement:-"At the time of casting the body away, you will be in full possession of your intelligence owing to my grace; you will have a vision of me and will have all your previous memories and desires (for _mokṣa_  )" -- this statement, too, has to be interpreted in a manner that would not be in conflict with the verses cited above. This is how it should be interpreted. Some _ācārya_s interpret as follows:-"The statement made in (_Śaraṇāgati_ _Gadya_) applies to those prapannas who, while performing _prapatti_, begged also for the remembrance of the Lord) in their last moments." This interpretation cannot be accepted for the following reason :There must be some-last thought or other at the time of casting off the body and this thought must have some object or other. If the object that is thought of were other than the Lord, it would become dangerous, for it has been said. " Whatever object one thinks of at the time when one leaves one's body -- that alone will one attain (after death)", So we have to conclude that) if the man has performed _prapatti_ as an independent means (whether or not he begged for the remembrance (of the Lord) in his last moments while performing _prapatti_, he will get that remembrance as stated in the _Gadya_. This is the interpretation favoured by some_ācārya_s. In the verses from Sanskrit and Tamil quoted above (where the last remembrance is not declared to be necessary), what is meant is that the last remembrance is not prescribed for the _prapanna_ as something to be effected by his own effort as an _upāya_. In the eighth chapter of the Gitā, and in the _śloka_  which says :-"That _Bhagavān_ whom the yogis keep in their minds by an effort at the time of leaving the body-keeping that _Bhagavān_ in mind, Bhīṣma gave up his body. Was he not one who attained the fruit of his _bhakti_ or _upāsana_ ?" (The last remembrance comes as an _upāya_ for those who adopt _bhakti_ as the means and it comes by their own effort); but in the case of the _prapanna_, the remembrance comes out of the Lord's grace alone. " Kevalam madiya dayaya" are Śrī _Rāmānuja_'s words. What does this last remembrance mean? When speech and other activities have be come impossible, the remembrance or thought which arises in the mind before the mind, too, ceases to function-this is the last remembrance. Those who stand by cannot know it. Śrī _Rāmānuja_'s commentary on the _Brahma_ _Sūtra_: “It is seen  that the mind functions even after the senses have ceased to do so", means only this, that the mind's functioning may be inferred by some sign or other. It may also describe his own experience in some states of ill-health and the like. Therefore this last remembrance is a thing that could be known only to the man who becomes a _mukta_ and to (the Lord) who gives him _mokṣa_ .



After this, the self, whether it be of the yogi or of one who is not a yogi, takes repose by the side of the Supreme Being who is in his heart (Harda) and is in a state similar to that of dreamless sleep (_suṣupti_).



It may be asked whether the description contained in the slokās and Tamil verses quoted above (Nos. 20 and 21)-such as being like a log of wood or like a piece of stone, and loss of all remembrance or consciousness may not be a reference to this state of _suṣupti_. The answer is that if so, there would be no special consideration for the _prapanna_ ( which certainly there is).



Thereafter (i.e. after repose by the side of the Supreme Being), the self or soul attains perfect knowledge being awakened by the Lord (who is wise) and who says that "the _Jīva_   gets knowledge, memory and forgetfulness only from Him. Lighted by that knowledge, it enters into the _Brahma_ Nadi. Thence  forward Time is one eternal day for the self.







TAMIL VERSE:

नन्निलमामदु नऱ्‌पगलामदु नन्निमित्तम्  
ऎन्नलुमामदुयादानुमा मङ्गडियवर्क्कु  
मिन्निलैमेनि विडुम्बयणत्तु विलक्किलदोर्  
नन्निलैया नडु नाडिवऴिक्कु नडैबॆऱवे. (27)

To the _prapanna_ (who is a devotee of Śrī Raṅganātha) who departs from the body which is as transient as lightning and who is to journey from the central _Brahma_ nadi, along the beautiful and shining path (of arcirādi), which is free from all impediments, the place of his departure is itself an auspicious place, the day of his departure is itself an auspicious day, the omens and signs that are then seen are all auspicious, whatever they may be.



SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_:

दहरकुहरे देवस्तिष्ठन्निषद्वरदीर्घिका  
निपतितनिजापत्यादित्सावतीर्णपितृक्रमात् ।  
धमनिमिह नस्तस्मिन् काले स एव शताधिकां  
अकृतकपुरप्रस्थानार्थं प्रवेशयति प्रभुः ॥ ४५ ॥

Like a father who descended into a well full of slushy mire to take out his son that has fallen into it, the Lord, (in His līlā), abides in the cave of the heart (dahara) and at the time of our leaving the body, He helps us to enter the nadī which is beyond the hundredth, so that we may start on our journey to the city that was not built by any one.
