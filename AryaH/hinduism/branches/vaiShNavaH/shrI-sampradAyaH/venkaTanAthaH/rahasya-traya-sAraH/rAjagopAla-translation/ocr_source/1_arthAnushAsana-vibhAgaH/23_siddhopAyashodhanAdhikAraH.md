(23) THE CHAPTER ON THE CLARIFICATION OF WHAT IS MEANT BY THE UPAYA 

THAT IS ALREADY EXISTENT. 

(SIDDHOPAYA) 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The Supreme Person who knows all things, at the same time, by direct perception (pratyakṣa) and without any aid or instrument (in the form of sense organs), who is the boundless and divine ocean of mercy, protects the world, with the daughter of the ocean (Lakṣmī), being omnipotent. Having accepted the responsibility of saving those who follow the right path, He is the upāya that is already existent. 

(NOTE: By Siddhopaya, the author means Bhagavan who is the upāya already existent for those who perform prapatti. By Sadhyopaya he means such upāyas or means as bhakti and prapatti which socure the Lord's favour so that He may act as the Siddhopaya). 

RECAPITULATION OF THE CONTENTS OF 

THE FIRST PART: 

We have already described below how the jiva ( Kshetrajna), who has been wandering in saṁsāra from beginningless time, becomes averse to it by the mercy of God which is awaiting an opportunity (to help him), how he understands from the right sāstras (the truth about ) the tattvas, the means or upāya and the ultimate goal or aim of life, and how he becomes eager to attain mokṣa. (We have already described how he adopts ( owing to this desire for mokṣa ) an upāya or means (bhakti or prapatti) which is in accord with his fitness or competency, how he thereby does what should be done, how, having realised his state as a 

232 CHAPTER 

prapanna or bhakta, he readers faultless service in accordance with that state and in accordance with the s'astras, for the remain. ing term of his life here. We have already described ), how, after the fall of the body, he reaches a region free from the touch of matter (prakr̥ti) by journeying along the shining path begion. ing with archis and bow he attains there the supreme end, namely perfect service which is the overflow of the unlimited enjoyment of Bhagavan. 

THREE CAUSES BY WHICH THE LORD'S 

GRACE IS WON: 

There are three main causes for the removal of the will of the Lord imposed on men as a panishment for past sins, owing to which the jīvas who are subject to the sway of past karma have no clear knowledge concerning the upāya that is already existent (namely Bhagavad), the upāya by which His favoar is secured (Sadhyopāya) and also the potency of these upāyas. They are as follows:- One is the speech that comes from the lips of Lakṣmī: If one asks, \*\*May this Saraṇāgati by mine!" Her reply is \*\*"Let it be yours; everything will be obtained by it alone." Next is the grace of the good ūcharya and the third is the obser vance of the tradition of the righteous. The queans (vyāja) by which the grace of the good ācārya can be secared and the benefits arisiog therefrom may be understood from the episodes of Parāśara, Maitreya, Sanjaya, Asvalayapa and others. 

NOTE By the advice of Vasishta, Parāśara put a stop to the perform ance of a satra (sacrifice) which was aimed at the destruction of Rakṣasas. Pleased with this, Vasishta and Pulastya blessed him for his forbearance with a kpowledge of the sasiras and with the gifts necessary for the composition of a purāṇa. 

Maitreya studied the Vedas, the dharma śāstras and the Vedangas from his guru and, by his grace, obtained a knowledge of Vedānta by which bo realised how the origin, maintenance and destruction of the world occur and how there is nothing other than Viṣṇu. \*Sri Rāmanuja: Sarapagati gadya

HOW TO WIN THE LORD'S GRACE 

233 

Sanjaya says:- "By the grace of Vyasa, I listened to this supreme Yoga, the most secret of all, from Kr̥ṣṇa Himself the Lord of all Yogas". Aswala. yana learnt the Rig Veda by his devotion to Sounaka. 

The observance of the tradition of the righteous consists in this :-- 

Full of the quality of sattva, and entering his career of disciple. ship in the right manner and with perfect attention and concentra. tion of mind, one should learn from the good ācārya who is without any expectation of renown, Wealth or honours and who is under the sway of compassion, the truths concerning the tattvas and the means or hita, which have come down in regular succession to the present day from the Lord of All, who is the first āchārya of all. While imparting instruction, there should be no unnecessary elaboration and no skipp ing over points that require clear exposition. The instruction received is such as follows:- Madhava' (the Lord of Lakṣmī) is both the father and the mother of all the worlds. O, best of men, seek refuge under that Saviour by sāraṇāgati". To those who are faithful and pious but who are not competent to enter on the difficult study of the stāstras, which mighty, owing to tbeir diffi. culty, unsettle the wind, this instruction by the guru is alone important. To others, the study of the sāstras with the proper exercise of reason is legitimate for their own clear understanding and for convincing those who are deluded by the specious argu. ments (of rival thinkers ). 

FORMS OF INFIDELITY: 

It has been said, "He who understands dharma prescribed in the Vedas and the Smr̥tis with the help of arguments not opposed (to the spirit of) the Vedas and stāstras - be alone knows dharma, and not others." Those who have not understood dharma by the proper exercise of reason will become rationalistio 

1. Mahābhārata : Aranya Parva; 

192-56 

2. Maou Smr̥ti : 12-106284 CHAPTER 

(and sceptical) and will misinterpret the true meaning with specious arguments inconsistent with the Vedas; it has been stated that "by the followers of Kanada (Vaiseshika logicians), the followers of Sakya (Buddhista ) aod the heretics, the dharma ordained in the Vedas has disappeared." 

This misinterpretation or denial is of two kinds that con cerning the glorious possessions (vibhūti) and that concerning the One who possesses these glories. That concerning the One who possesses the glories consists in denying the existence of the Supreme Ruler, the Lord of Lakṣmī, or declaring some other deity as the Supreme Ruler and relegating the real Supreme Ruler to the category of His possessions (vibhiti). The misconception or misinterpretation concerning the glories consists in tbis : denying the existence of these glories (oc objects created by God) or considering these vibhūtis as existing but as independent of the Lord by denying their relationship to Him, or declaring that they are dependent on oneself or others, 

ASSOCIATION WITH WICKED MEN SHOULD BE 

AVOIDED: 

Any one of these forms of denial might occur in the case of a weak-minded man who has performed prapatti, on account of association with those who are not fit to be associated with If such a misconception should occur, it is worse\* "than the great sin of taking back & thing that has been given away (io cbarity)". That sin will deprive a man of the merit acquired by all previous gifts made from the time of birth onwards. Bat this is worse, for the object of the gift was itself acquired by stealth from 

the person to whom it was given later, and then the person is robbed of what was given to him. Therefore, of the many causes of delusion, association with rationalists (and sceptics) is most to be avoided. This has been declared in passages like the following: 

3. Atri Smr̥ti 

4. Sandilya Smr̥ti 

23 

AVOID ASSOCIATION WITH THE WICKED 

235 

“These who are heretics opposed to the Vedas, those who do things forbidden in the sāstras, those who are like cats (deceiving others ), sceptics, rationalists who depend only on reason, those who are like cranes ( ever injuring others who are near them) - these should never be honoured even with words "; 80 it is said also:-"A map #suffering from starvation may beg money of a king, of his own pupil, and of the men whom he has helped to perform a sacrifice ( yajna); But one should never beg of those who are dissemblers, rationalists, beretics and men with the nature of cranes." Again, “One should associate with good men (i.6. men who know God.) Whether in dispute or friendship, one should associate only with them; one should never do any of these things with the wicked (those who do not believe in God), “Give up the company of the wicked; associate ever with the good; do whatever is righteous, both in the day and in the night, remember always that you yourself and those who are related to you are not immortal.” And again, "Far better is it to dwell in à cage of flaming fire than to commit the crime of dwelling with sceptics, who do not countenance any thought of Souri (Bhagavan)." 

Conversation with rationalists makes men foolish in spite of their seeiog, 'as their 10 knowledge is lost by specious reasoning.' (this association with rationalists ) removes men from every one of the four classes which Īśvara calls His own, in the śloka : “My "people" are of four classes and they are all known to be my bhaktas." It would take them away from the group of men whom Sri Ranganatha calls "lads who are worthy of His love." It wonld throw them into the midst of those who are outside the range of Bhagavan's love as declared in: " There are 2A wicked

men who do not seek my protection by performing prapatti; they are of four classes : fools, men who are vile, men who have lost their knowledge by specious reasoning and men who are of the nature of the Asuras." 

Even men with supreme faith that have sought the protec tion of the Supreme Ruler who is the Saviour of those that have no one to protect them - even they, we \*know. become deluded by association with others; though they are not cast away, they have afterwards to be corrected by good achāryas. 

Have not the great sages declared :- "If there is were only one sāstra, it would be possible to acquire knowledge free froin doubts. Because there are many sāstras in this world, it is exceedingly difficult to obtain knowledge that is true" and again, "The Lord " dwells in all who are free from doubt. The Lord of Lakṣmī never dwells with those who are full of doubt owing to the exercise of free thinking." 

It is true that it has been stated: "In those "A who have bhakti to Purushottama, there is no apger, no hatred, no covetous. Dess nor impure minds", but this is applicable only to those individuals who are perfect in the possession of spiritual qualities. In the case of those who have yet to ascend to that high spiritual level, it is well-known that their minds may become deluded. Thus it has been said "We bear that the gods (devas), in dread of the diminution of saṁsāra among those who are devoted to Govinda, become their enemies, (i.e. try to hinder devo tion)" and again, "To "truthfulness in speech, there are a hundred hindrances; to tapas or the performance of austerities, the bind. rances are & thousand; and bhakti to Govinda meets with ten

thousand biodrances". Here we will first speak of the doubts (or misconceptions) that are likely to arise in regard to Siddho. paya, the upāya, namely Bhagavan, that is already existent and consider the way in which these doubts may be cleared. 

( HEREAFTER THE AUTHOR STATES POSSIBLE DOUBTS AND MISCONCEPTIONS AND 

TRIES TO REMOVE THEM ): 

Doubt (1):- No upāya is necessary on the part of the jiva : 

(1) Īśvara who ignored a man from beginningless time has Dow concerned Himself with him (for his protection ). This is not due to any action or work on the man's part, but only to the Lord's omnipotence. If it is not so, how is it that when the Alvar asked "The Lord has" Dow made me realise Him and placed Himself within me. Why is it that He allowed me formerly to stray from Him?," no reply was given except that "the cloud 18 which adorned the measureless sky thundered in music". The implication is that there is no answer to this question except that it was the Lord's will to do so. Therefore why should we perform or adopt any upāya (for securing His protection)? Some say, therefore, that, of His own” accord, and at the time when He chooses, the Lord saves us and that the Lord bestows His grace on His servants and protects them when He is pleased to do so and that no endeavour of any kind is incumbent on os. 

This doubt may be cleared as follows :- Although Īśvara is omnipotent, He makes the man adopt some gesture, some means (vyāja) or pretext on his part and, in consideration of it, protects him in order that the faults of partiality and cruelty (vaishamya, nāirghrnya) may not stain Him. The Alwar bimself has declared this truth in :-"I seid 20"Tirumaliraojolai" and immediately, the Lord of Lakṣmī filled my mind with His presence." (The Vyaja, 

17. Tiruvoymozhi: 10.8-9. 18. Tiruvoymozhi: 10-9-1, 

19. Tiruvaymozbi: 1-7-5. 20. Tiruvoymozhi: 10-8-1. 

238 CHAPTER 

endeavoar, or gesture, here, is the utterance of the word Tirumal. irunjolai by the Alwar). It may be asked "This vyāja, too, is adopted by the Lord's grace. Why did He not make the person adopt it before ?" The answer is as follows:- The souls of men have streams of karma flowing from beginningless time. These streams of past karma produce their respective conseqnences at different times and Īśvara has to bestow, on each individual, the rewards or punishments that are in accordance with such karma. If He were to do otherwise, He would be tainted with partiality (and injustice). Īśvara did not make the person adopt the vpāja before, as the time for the ripening of the fruit of the karma bad not yet come. Therefore, from the effect we have to infer the cause, as stated above. If this view be not accepted, no follower of any system will be able to answer the question why a person acquires ( at a certain time) such things as eagerness for mokṣa which did not exist before. That these are dae to the varied nature of the streams of beginningless karma is the common explanation for both those who believe in Īśvara and those who do not. Īśvara's independence and omnipotence consist in His determi. nation to protect the jiva when He chooses to do so, on the adoption of a vyāja or some form of upāya (endeavour) (or even an apology for upāya ) and in there being no power to prevent Him from doing so. 

If this is so, it may be asked how we are to explain the verse of the Alvar cited before, when be put the question why the Lord did not choose to save him before and received ao soswer and also the texts according to which the Lord is the unconditional Saviour: Our answer is as follows:--The Alvar attaches great importance to Īśvara's omnipotence and compassion and ignores the vyāja or vyājas adopted by binosolf, by which special meana he secured the Lord's compassion, when he says. "For Thy neglect of me in former times and for taking me into Thy favour at present, I see no prominent causes other than Thy omnipotence and compassion. But, if owing to Thy omniscience, Thou hast seen any such cause, favour me with a knowledge of it". The Lord gave no reply and 

28 

THE NEED FOR UPAYA 

899 

thereby the Alvar revealed to the world that the primary or promi. bent causes were only His omnipotence and compassion. This does not mean that there was no subsidiary cause or vyāja on the part of the Alvar. From this it follows that the primary cause for making the jiva an instrument of His Lila is Blis omni. potence (svātantryam) and the subsidiary cause thereof is violation of the command of the omnipotent Lord which has been flowing like & stream from beginningless time. Now the primary cause for making the jīva an instrument of His bhoga (in Paranapada) is the Lord's natural compassion. The subsidiary cause (sahakāri karaṇa ) is the vyaja (bhakti or prapatti) which extinguishos the Lord's punishment (hitherto) acting as a bindrance or obs. tacle. Bhakti and prapatti which are adopted as vyaja to secure Īśvara's favour, are, themselves, the result of His compassion due to special acts of merit. These reveal Īśvara's omnipotent and compassionate nature. The prapanna should bear in mind this attribute of the Lord, His being free from partiality and cruelty (vaishamya and nairghrnya) and bondage and mokṣa being depen. dent on the violation of His command and the adoption of the vyāja, respectively, as they are all based on pramānas. Thus it becomes bis duty to lead the life of staunch and exclusive devotion with firm faith in the compassion of the omnipotent. This is the (real) meaning, 

The omnipotence of one who has no compassion is dangerous to others; the compassion of one who is not omnipotent is not helpful to others and may also cause pain to the one who feels compassion. But the compassion of a person who is also omnipo tent can accomplish whatever is desired and will bring delight to him and be the cause of immediately relieving the distress of those who seek bis help and of giving them what they long for. 

In regard to incarnations, it has been said, "In" the distresses of men, Sri Rāma is greatly distressed". (It may be asked how this distress can be reconciled with the delight spoken of above ). 

21. Rāmayana: Ayodhya Kanda: 2-40 

240 OB APTER 

It means only this: that this distress ie only in order to give delight to those who are worthy of His grace. In the case of wicked men with the nature of Asuras, the distress assumed by the avatār is to make the evil-doer become deluded into thinking that he is not Īśvara's incarnation. The great snges have declared the truth of what has been said so far in the following vlakas: "It \*is Bhagavan alone that rules over time and death over those that move and those that do not move. I am stating the truth to you; the Lord of all the worlds, though possessed of omnipotence and omniscience, begins to act (during incarnations ), as if He were only a weak tiller of the soil. In this way, by His association with wonderful powers, He deludes the world, bat those who seek refuge ander Him are never deluded", and "Sri Kr̥ṣṇa, who had large eyes, removed the burden off the earth, deluded the whole world and has now gone back to His own abode," and again "He imitates \*A the actions of those who bave the bodies of men, but the fila of the Lord of the world is dependent only on His will". Therefore in the stories of the avatārs or incarnations, the distress is only of the nature of play.acting and that, too, has compassion as its cause. It is of the nature of Tilā or sport to the Omnipotent. Have we not seen hunchbacks and dwarfs often taken into protec tion by kings who do not expect any return from them? It is a matter of ma or play to them and, at the same time, the conse quence of compassion. That is why it is said, "The Upaniṣads \*\* state that the Lord of Sri creates, maintains, controls and does such other things in regard to sentient and non-sentient things, only for His own sake. It is therefore, 0, Lord of Sriraṅga, Thy nature to be the means of salvation (upāya ) for the jiva and also the object of attaioment. Therefore I seek Thee as my upāya without any thought of my own interests." 

Since Bhagavan is the seat of the activity for the good of others, He is the Saviour of those who seek refuge under Him and 22. Mahābhārata: Udyoga Parva: 23. Viṣṇupurāṇa: V 22-18

THE NEED FOR UPAYA 

since He places Himself in the place of other upāyas (like para bhakti) (in order to protect them), He is also the upāya. Since He is the seat of the fruit of the activity of protecting (namely, His delight), He is the seshi and consequently the object of attain. ment. That His being all this is due to His essential datare (svarūpa) is understood from the pramānas or authorities which help us to know Him, Of the principal qualities of Īśvara, such as juara (knowledge) sakti or power and compassion, knowledge and power are qualities which come into play for both punishment and favour, whereas compassion comes into play (only) in conferring favours. Compassion, here, means, the inclination to do good to others. Bhagavan's compassion comes into play in all the following in the creation and sustenance of the three kinds of sentient beings (baddha, mukta and nitya), in keeping them in activities pleasing to the Lord, in the eternal enjoyment of the eternal sūris, in seeing that those who have obtained release from bondage do not return to saṁsāra, in the creation of all things (like mahat, ahankāra tanmātras, etc) in lilā vibhuti (i.e.) in this world, in the pure creation called Ais avatār untainted with matter, in propagating a knowledge of tbe sāstras and in causing through them a knowledge of the tattvas and of the means of attaining inukti, in creating an eagerness for mokṣa, in enabling & person to do ineritorionis actions which would become the vyāja or upāya for causing the eagerness for mokṣa, in prescribing upāyas suited to the nature of each individual for wiping out the punishment for violation of His commands, in being accessory to the mind being prompted to adopt the wpāya, in removing any obstacles that might stand in the way of the man who has adopted bhakti as the upāya (upāsaka) in standing, in the case of those who are destitute of other upāyas (1.6.) prapannas, in the place of these upāyas and protecting them from all danger, in ignoring countless offences of a serious nature committed by the jīva from begioningless time, by being gracious to him on account of the vyaja or upāya performed by him and releasing him from saṁsāra 80 that he may enjoy endless bliss, in bestowing mokṣa 

242 CHAPTER 

immediately on those prapannas who are impatient of delay, and, in the case of those prapannas who are not impatient of delay and who have forgotten to beg for a life free from sin (after prapatti), in creating repentance for any offences committed by them owing to past karma which has begun to operate (prārabdha ) and inducing the person to perform the necessary prāyascitta or expiation suited to his competency; in the case of those who are too hard-hearted to perform prāyas. citta, in preventing their entrance into the world of Yama and loss of the benefit begged for by them by seeing that they are punished for these offences (committed after prapatti) in this life itself with sufferings (like blindness and lameness ) - in all these the Lord's compassion is the principal and common cause. 

Īśvara, who is endowed with compassion as described above, is called Siddhopaya or the upāya that is already existent; thus it is said:- “Those "Brahmins who know the first part of the Veda and those who know the latter part of it, which treats of the Sapreme Being - they state that Sri Krisbna is the eternal dharma (i.c.) the upāya that always exists." Bhakti and prapatti, which are adopted as the means for making Him gracious are called sādhyopāyas (ie) upāyas to be adopted for securing His grace. 

THE CONTENTION THAT THERE IS NO INJUNCTION 

TO PERFORM PRAPATTI AS AN UPAYA: 

(2) The injunction to perform prapatti is contained in the words, "Seek refuge under me \*alone". Some say that it is not an injunction to perform prapatti and that this prapatti should be considered as an attribute of the person specified. We answer 88 follows 3. This attribute cannot be held as that of the person 80 concerned or qualified, as it does not satisfy the definition of an

248 

adjectival attribute.\* This statement is therefore contrary to pra. mâna or authority. If this were not 80, while Īśvara is the upāya for bhakti, the sāstras which prescribe certain forms of medita. tion and the like might also be considered as speaking of the attri. butes of the person concerned and not actions to be performed. 

THE ROLE OF SIDDHOPAYA AND SADHYOPAYA 

(3) Therefore the exaggerated statement of some that prapatti is not an upāya is only to be taken as stressing the impor tance of Siddhopāya (1.6.) Īśvara who is the existent upāya (and not to state that prapatti is bot an upāya ). Siddhopāya is of prime importance, because if, by proper propitiation, the punish ment of the Lord is cancelled, it becomes belpful for the enjoyment or experience (of Bhagavān) which is natural to the Self (in its purity). If it is asked how this happeas, the easwer is as follows: When the gem is cleansed of the dust (enveloping it), it shines with a natural radiance, but this natural radiance is due only to the will of Īśvara that ordains its having radiance. So also the expansion of knowledge and other attributes which the mukta acquires are due to the will of Īśvara, which ordains them. Like. wise, in the case of the eternal süris (their eternal possession of certain attributes is due to the eteroal will of the Lord). Learned men expressed this idea briefly in the śloka : "All 28things have their being in accordance with Thy will; among them some are ever pleasiag to Thee; chey are eterool; Thy noble attributes which are, by nature, subject to Thee illustrate this truth to us". Therefore, though Siddhopaya or Īśvara who is the existent upāya is all-important, the mesos of obtaining His grace, otherwise called sadhyopāya, has also to be adopted. This is not 

: \* NOTE: "He who desires svarga should perform the Jyotishtoma sac rifice". Here, who desires svarga is an attribute or adjective of the person and the injunction is that he should perform the sacrifice. In Mam Ekant Saranam Vraja, the praparii has to be performed after hearing the vidhi or in junction; it did not exist before, like the desire for svarga in the example cited. Therefore, it is not an attribute; besides vraja is a verb that prescribes an action.

SRIMAD RAHASYATRA YASARA 

CHAPTER 

at variance with the statements of former ācāryas as seen in Tiruvoymoshi (10-8-9), cited before. 

The śloka which says: "The Lord \*who took the necessary meads or upāya for making me live, while yet in my mother's womb - is He now asleep or is He now dead in regard to the means to be adopted for making me live after being born ?" - this is sometimes quoted in support of the statement that the Lord is alone the upāya and that the jiva has to do nothing at all by way of upāya or vyāja. It should be taken only as meaning that we should not seek any other protector (and not to forbid man from any form of endeavour). Otherwise one will have to give up evon such endeavours as bave to be made for obtaining food. 

Likewise the following s'lokas:-" The embodied being is like a larop of clay subject to the will of another and unable to help bimself. How, then, cao he protect another?," and " The jiva "lis ignorant and absolutely helpless in matters concerning bis pleasures and pains. He goes to svarga or naraka being directed by Īśvara, who rules over all," and also, \*"Inscratable is Bhagavan He cannot be ordered by any one. He can go wherever He chooses. He has all beings under His control. Like a child playing with its toys, He plays with beings (and enjoys His lila)" -- in these ślokas, what is intended to be stated is only the jiva's entire dependence (on the Lord) and Īśvara treating him in accordance with his karma. (They do not prescribe the giving up of all endeavour on the part of the jiva ). If this interpretation is not accepted for the verse in Tiruvoymochi (quoted above ) and for these ślokas, there will be conflict with all sāstras and also inconsistencies with what has been said before, 

So far we bave dispelled certain misconceptions that may arise from a consideration of Īśvara's omnipotence and the compassion which is natural to Him. We will now proceed to clear doubts 29. Viṣṇudharma:

28 PRAPATTI NOT INCONSISTENT IN THE SESHA 245 

w 

which might arise from a consideration of the peouliar relationship ( that exists between the jiva and Īśvara ). 

(4) THE CONTENTION THAT BEGGING FOR 

PROTECTION IS INCONSISTENT WITH 

QUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE SESHI. 

There are some who deny the need for sādhyopaya or the means or endeavour for winning the Lord's grace, by stressing the point that He is the seshi for whom we exist and to whom we belong. (They argue as follows): "Īśvara is the seshi and we are like His suoklings as expressed by the sages to Sri Rāma: "We "are like babies in the embryo", who ever hoard of a suckl. ing doing anything other than crying for mother's milk, such as paying wages for it? Would it be consistent with the essential nature (svarūpa) of the jiva to perform the surrender of the self (atma samarpanam), to ask for protection, to have full faith in His protection and such other things ?". 

We meet this objection as follows:- The great søges and the author of Sri Bhashya observed, in their own lives, the injunction about self-surrender by begging for the Lord's protec tion with faith preceding it. They have cited sāstras in support of this (traditional) practice and have handed it down as instruc tions for successive (generations). Therefore though Īśvara's relationship as the seshi is eteranl, He will not protect the jiva who is subject to the influence of past karma, unless the jiva adopts some form of sādhyopaya or endeavsar (for winning His grace). This truth has to be accepted by every one who holds by the s'āstras. If the sāstras are given ap (as authorities), there will be no Īśvara at all to stand in the relationship of the s'eshi (to the jiva ). 

It was stated previously that, owing to His being the sosht, Īśvara is bound to protect the jiva and that the jiva being the śeṣa is neither called upon nor able to protect himself. What was said there is (not inconsistent with what is said hore). 33. Rāmayana : Aranya kanda : 1-31 

246 OHAPTER 

There, with an illustration from ordinary life, the relationship between the protector and the protected was shown to consist in the protector being bound to protect and being capable of doing 80. It was not meant to show that the Protector would protect in every case, whether or not there is endeavour on the part of the jiva to win His grace by propitiation. If that view were taken, it would mean that all souls should be eternally free from bondage. If it be maintained that, in the matter of protection, the Lord, being omnipotent, chooses to save some and not others, then it would mean that the Lord is partial to some and cruel to others. 

Those who maintain these propositions merely on the basis of reason cannot say that the knowledge of the relationship (of the s'eshin and the śeṣa ) is alone required for securing protection and that no request for protection need be made. For have we not seen that non-septient things, cattle, deer, birds and the like and suckling children are protected, though they have no know ledge of this relationsbip, just as they do not ask for protection ? If it be held that, though we have seen (such instances ), yet the knowledge of that relationship is required on the authority of the stāstras, we answer that, if so, by the very authority of the stāstras, the special kind of knowledge consisting in bhakti and prapatti will also have to be accepted (As necess 

ary). 

If it be held that what is required for protection is that, while being protected, there should be, in addition to the relationship, no attempt to prevent protection, we answer that, in that case, the Lord should grant mokṣa to all in such states 88 dreamless sleep (suṣupti), (where there is the relationship and no attempt on the part of the jiva to prevent protection). If, on the other hand, it be maintained that there should be no attemapt to prevent protection in those mental states in which one is capable of doing so, we answer that we have seen protection of evea non-sentieot things which are jocapable of preventing it and of even such sentient beings as cattle and sops which attempt to prevent it. 

23 UPAYA NECESSARY EVEN FOR THE SESHA 247 

From the śloka : "Those that whave nathas (lords or protectors) in the world do not perform their daty of protecting themselves. It is their Natha or lord who pats forth endeavours on their behalf, just as Sibi and others did the duties which should have been performed by Yayāti " - from this śloka, it should not be thought that endeavour on the part of those that are to be protected is not required at all. For the word Natha is from the root nath and means, bere, the begging for protection and nāthavantah in that siloka means, by the force of the termination (vat or mathup) those who have a protector. So the word nāthavantah in the śloka suggests, by the etymological meaning of natha and by the termination (mathup) which shows the relationship (of seshin and śeṣa) that is necessary for the state of being carefree, the prayer for protection and the act of self. surrender. Otherwise there should be (as said before ) rnokṣa for all and other such objections. If it is said that the word nāthavantah ia that śloka should not be interpreted as having & suggestion of all the meanings (referred to), we have to state that analogies taken from ordinary life should not be pressed too far in the s'astra on mokṣa, for they would be at variance with actual and explicit statements made in the sāstra). 

We shall now explain the real purport of the words of trust worthy authors where the apparent meaning would seem to be that, while Īśvara is the Protector or Saviour of all, we are not required to put forth any endeavour for our protection. Their real meaning is this. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

When self-surrender has been performed for the sake of & certain object, there should be no repetition of that performance for the same object, (The need for the adoption of the upāya or endeavour in the form of prapatti at first is not denied ). Even before prapatti, the jiva could not act independently of the Lord. 

34. Mahābhārata ; Aranya Parva : 121-2. 

248 CHAPTER 

There is no injunction for an endeavour at a later time also for protection, when once the surrender of the responsibility for protection has been made in 8ccordance with pramūnas. For even in that act of the original prapatti, the surrender of the responsibility for one's protection was made possible by Īśvara, out of consideration for some meritorious act performed by the jiva as a result of the ripening of past karma flowing like a stream without any beginning. Since even this prapatti was the Lord's doing, we sbould not be under the impression that we are protecting ourselves. We should feel that the Lord who, we are taught in the Moolamantram, is the Protector of all that He made us adopt a certain means and became propitiated thereby so the to protect us. The (following) śloka conveys the same idea: \* My Master Himself makes me surrender myself to Him, as I am His śeṣa and am ever subject to Him. (I surrender myself to Him) with the help of the intelligence given to me by Him and am now free from all responsibility in regard to my protection as He has taken that responsibility on Himself". 

This is the form prescribed for enabling us to meditate on Bhagaven without the faults of the desire for renown, gain, honour or benefit, and of attachment to the fruit, the notion of one's being the (independent) doer and having an upāya. Therefore such things as the prayer for protection are like the child's act of suck. ing the mother's milk and the grace of the Lord flows like mother's milk (after the propitiation). From this it follows that (in stress ing the need for the jiva's endeavour), we do not minimise the primary importance of Siddhopāya, namely, Īśvara, who is the existent upāya. 

So far we have dispelled the misconceptions that might arise from a consideratiod of the peculiar attributes and the peculiar relationship (of śeṣa and seshi) which aro revealed in the word Nārāyana, 

23 

SIDDHOPAYA INCLUDES LAKSHMI

(5) LAKSHMI IS AS MUCH THE UPAYA AS 

THE LORD HIMSELF: 

Hereafter we shall proceed briefly to remove certain misconcep tions which arise from the relationship of spouse that is expressed in the word Srimat (having Lakṣmī) as existing between Sri and the Supreme Ruler who has consecrated Himself for the sacrifice or yajna of saving all. As stated in the following siloka, "It is said in all religious systems and in the Vedānta that Bhagavan acts as the Saviour only in the company of Lakṣmī, who is the very embodiment of compassion". (The phrase, 'religious systems' here refers to the four pañcaratra systems). 

There are some who hold that, in the former part of the Dvaya, the word Srimat is an upalakṣana\* ( an accidental sign by which the thing is distinguished and not a permanent attribute (or viśeṣana), whereas in the latter part, the same word means & permanent attribute of Narāyaṇa. (If this were true, it would follow that the words 'I seek as my refuge' saranam prapadye would apply only to Narāyaṇa and not to Sri or Lakṣmī who, in that part, according to them, is not meant to be taken as an inseparable attribute but as only an accidental mark to distinguish Narāyaṇa, Since in the latter part, Srīniat is, according to them, an inseparable attribute (vīśeṣana), it would follow that the dative and the namah would apply to the attribute and the substan tive, vix, Srī and Bhagavan. (It would then mean that Lakṣmī is not to be sought as the upāya but that adoration and service are due to her as well as to her spouse, Narāyaṇa ). 

In this (wrong) view, when the same word Srimat is found in both the parts (of Dvaya) and when there is no objection to interpreting it in the same way, in both the places, the adoption of an interpretation which is at variance with the well-known view 

\* NOTE: Upalakṣana; In "That is Devadatta's field where the crano was sitting before", the crane is an upalakṣana or accidental feature to identify tho field with. It is not a permanent attributc or viśeṣana of the field. 35. Lakṣmī Tantram : 28-14

BRIMAD RAHASYATRAYASARA 

CHAPTER 

of the ancient ācāryas and with the tradition connected with Nammalvar, the chief of all prapannas and which would give two different interpretations to the same word in the same sentence has no justification. For in the following śloka it is said :- "O Lakṣmī, with a face delightful like the moon! When (we) try to study Thea as distinct from Bhagavan, (we feel) that Hia svarūpa or essential nature and His being the Ruler over all are the consequence of the greatness, which is His, by His bejag ever with Thee. Thou art, therefore, the part (or attribute) by which Bhagavan is understood as being of such and such a character. Since Thou sad Bhagavan are thus (inseparably) united, the Veda does not speak of Thee separately". 

It may be asked whether, if we take Srimat as an inseparable attribate of Narāyaṇa in the first part of the Dvaya also, it would not follow that there are two upāyas viz., Narāyaṇa and Lakṣmī, and whether this would not be at variance with the texts which say that there is no other upāya than Bhagavad. We counter this objection by asking whether, if we take Lakṣmī as the inseparable attribute, as you hold, in the second part of Dvaya, it would not follow that there are two objects of attainment, namely, Bhagavan and Lakṣmī and whether this would not be at variance with the texts which say “There is no other interest or object of attainment than Bhagavan". 

If it is now asked: "In that case what is the objection to taking the word Srimat as only an accidentally associated mark (upalakṣana) by which Bhagavan is distinguished in both the parts of the Dvaya, the answer is as follows:--Certain qualities, certain forms ( vigrahas) and certain activities are necessary for Īśvara being the upāya. Likewise certain other qualities, certain other forms and certain activities are ever associated with Īśvara as the object of attainment. These necessary ( things ), also, would be at variance with Īśvara being the only upāya and the only object of attainment respectively. So they, too, would have to be 

36. Sri Gunaratoakosam : 28. 

23 

SIDDHOPAYA INCLUDES LAKSHMI 

251 

considered as accidental features and not inseparable attributes, but this would be against the view of these critics who hold that Īśvara is the Protector or Saviour only in virtue of (such attributes as) His omnipotence and His compassion. So they cannot concede that these qualities are only accidental features (upalakṣana) 

They might argue that these qualities, forms and activities are inseparable attributes (viśeṣana) and not accidental features (upalakṣanas), because they are useful for the purpose of protection. We reply that the same may be said ( with justice ) of Lakṣmī's relationship as spouse, both in the first part of the Duaya and in the second part of the Doapa. (i.e.) (She, too, is useful for the respective purposes ). The respective uses of particular things or beings are in acoordance with their nature and may be understood from the pramānas and from tradition. The use of a thing or of a being is determined, of course, by its nature. 

The usefulness of this attribute Srī in Srimat, both in the part dealing with upāya and in that which treats of the object to be attained by that upāya has been described by Nammalvar in the following verses :- " Lakṣmī whop7 abides in the ever-frag rant lotus will destroy the karma of jīvas (i.e.) those karmas which act as hindrances to Bhagavan becoming the upāya" and "I will 803 weep Thy temple with the help of Thy grace and that of Lakṣmī who abides in the lotus." (So also ) Bhagavad Valmiki declared in The Rāmāyaṇa, the earliest of all kavyas, which is the very essence of the doctrine of saraṇāgati"This Sita bis cap able of protecting us from the great danger (confronting 08), O, Raksbasis" and "She ''is capable of saving the host of Rakṣasis from (the anger of Raghava)". Such authors as Hiranyagarbha and Kasyapa declared: “We should“ meditate on Lakṣmī, who can grant 08 all the benefits that we desire, who can take as safe out of the sea of saṁsāra, who becomes easily gracious and who

can make us happy." Sri Bhagavan Sonnaka has given this pre. cept. "The man" that prays for the attainment of Bhagavan, who is the purport of all words, should perform prapatti to Lakṣmī also." The great sage Parāśara who received the know ledge concerning the truth about the Supreme Deity from boons granted to him by Vasishta and Pulastya has stated "Thou art, O Goddesses, \*the knowledge concerning the soul, the giver of mokṣa, the object of attainment." Even if, in this śloka, the conferring of mokṣa be looked upon as an adjective qualifying the knowledge of the soul, it has to be considered as her glory or vibhūti on account of the appositional use (sāmānādhi karanya ). The Lord of Sri has himself proclaimed in connection with the meditation on Bhagavan as the Lord of Sri in Sri Satvata Sam hita -"Those \*8A who meditate on Bhagavad seek the protection of Lakṣmī and with that they easily cross the sea of saṁsāra which is constituted of these three qualities". Apart from the s'āstras treating specially of Sri, thege śāstras which do not pertain to any special sect or cult are of great authority. 

Aḷavandār, too, has stated:- "The whole world depends apon the glance of Sri, for its support." and again "Without \*\* the grace of Lakṣmī, the beloved spouse of the lotus-eyed Lord, we cannot have those glorious experiences which one might desire in this life (sansāra), nor the experience of our disembodied self, nor the enjoyment of Bhagavan in mokṣa". The author of Sri Bhashya, in his Vaikuṇṭha Gadya, says that she commande Adiśeṣa, Vishvaksena and other attendants to render such service to Bhagavan as is -guited to the time and the circumstance, and that the service to Bhagavan, which is the supreme goal, should be rendered in accordance with her commands. Koorathalvan,

\* NOTE: The śloka says: Thou art the knowledge concerning the self or atma vidyā: Lakṣmī is in apposition with arma vidyā. The meaning is that atma vidyā is one of her vibhutis or glorious possessions. Since arma vidyā cao confer mokṣa, it follows that Lakṣmī can confer mokṣa. 42. Soudaka Saṁhitā

too, sings his praise of Lakṣmī in ślokas beginning with these words: "The "bounds of Thy greatness. O, Goddess, are not known to Bhagavan nor even to Thyself". These words are an elaboration of what is contained in the śloka :- "May Lakṣmī \* confer happiness (on us) --- Lakṣmī, looking at whose face, and with Her will as His aid, the Lord creates, destroys and sustains all the worlds, and grants also such things as svargā, naraka (hell) and mokṣa. Since the two are engaged in the same work and experience the same kind of delight, the Lord cannot feel happy if he performs the tita of the work of the world without her participation in it," Bhattar, also, has commented on the word Udara (generous ) used in the Śruti (viz., Sri Stiktam) as ap adjective for Sri in this manner:-"How generous Thou art! O, Mother, to the man who merely raises his hands folded in worship to Thee, Thou grantest wealth, the enjoyment of his disembodied self and even parmapada and yet Thou feelest ashamed that Thou hast not done anything adequate for him." Peria Jeer, too, has brought out all these ideas in his commentary 00 Sri Saikta. Thus, from what we find in the Śruti, Smr̥ti and tradition, (the reader) gifted with insight can under stand that the attribute expressed in the word Srimat in Duaya has its uses, just like such things as forms (vigraha), in accordance with its own nature. 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS: 

You (critics who do not consider Lakṣmī as an inseparable) attribute or viśeṣana of Narāyaṇa in the first part of Dvaya) maintain that such things as the qualities of the Saviour (compas. siop etc) are attributes and not mere upalakṣana, even though they cannot undertake the responsibility (bhara) of protection and cannot have the will to protect (being only qualities and therefore non-sentient). Why do you object to the idea of Lakṣmī being the attribute (viśeṣana) and Narāyaṇa being the substantive 

49. Sri Gunaratnakosam : 58 

47. Koorattāḻvār: Sristavam: 8 48. Koorattāḻvār : Sristavam :254 CHAPTER 

(viseshya), when this divine couple have the same pleasure or relish in all actions and when they are both seshis, when there is the authority of the stāstras for it? In such vidyās or forms of medi tation as that of Pratardana, although the Supreme Being is the object of knowledge, we admit that sentient beings like Indra can be attributes of Bhagavan just like non-sentient qualities. Similarly in this vidyā called prapatti, the Omnipresent Lord is the object of approach with His Spouse and with such things as His quali ties in accordance with what is stated in the respective mantras. 

We have already stated that what is understood from the pramāṇas should not be set aside by mere logic or reason. There fore, just as we accept the Lord with His Spouse, as the object of attainment in accordance with the wish of the Saviour, there is no objection to the Lord with His Spouse being the upāya as well. 

Just as Bhagavan with particular qualities (like omnipotence and compassion) and particular forms (vigraha) indicated, res pectively, by the words Nārāyana and charanau, (the two feet) which are attributes of Narāyaṇa forms a single upāya, so also Bhagavan with Lakṣmī, who appears in the word Srimat as an attribute in the eternal relationship of being His Spouse, may with. out any impropriety, be considered as a single upāya. If it is said that we should give up all the attributes of the upāya in order to make the upāya single, the dharma of being an upāya (i.e. upa. yatua) will have to be given up also. 

It should not be thought that the substantive (here Bhagavan), when it gains some excellence from the attribnte (here Lakṣmī), should be considered as previously wanting in some excellence. Well has it been said in the śloka :- “Thou art, O 6 Lakṣmī, the property of Bhagavad by Tbine own will; hence, though His supreme excellence is due to Thee, His greatness is not dependent on any one else. A gem becomes valuable on account of its radiance. It does not thereby become in itself worthless; its 

50. Srigunaratnakosa: 31 

SIDDHOPAYA INCLUDES LAKSHMI 

255 

value, which is natural to it, does not diminish thereby, because its greatness is not due to anything else," In the same way as the substantive, (namely, Bhagavan) gaids excellence from its attribute (visēshana), namely, Lakṣmī, the substantive, too, has its owa Datural excellence. This is illustrated in the śloka in the Rāmāyana :-"Jast" as radiance cannot be separated from the sun, I cannot remain separated from Raghava". Brightness is the natural quality common to radiance and the sun. 80 also Sri Ram& and Sita bad, in common, auspicious qualities not dependent on any one else, as described in the śloka :-"We bow to "Bhagavan and Lakṣmī, who have in their very nature, all auspicious qualities, who are the causes of the world and who are beyond all comparison". 

There is nothing improper in stating that the substantive and the attribute give excellence to each other as indicated in the following: "That \*splendour which is Sri Rāma is beyond all ineasure, for the daughter of Janaka is His". "Though she is always with Thee, Thy Lakṣmī astonishes Thee every day as if she is new; she is in every way fit for Thee by her attributes, her forms, her sportful activity and her interest in protecting others". “Thy Sri LA “Thou artsB the Sri of Sri" and "The Sri of evens Sri " - these expressions show how Sri and the Lord of Sri are excellent in themselves and add also to each other's greatness. 

By the authority of texts in the Śruti (such as "He is the Lord of the Universe", "The Spouse of Viṣṇu who is the empress of the world", and "The syllable ma indicates that the jiva is the servant of both "), and by the authority of the following śloka, "The world of sentient and non-sentieot beings is śeṣa to Lakṣmī, (i.c.) it exists for Lakṣmī: She and the world are śeṣa

to Bhagavan, who is Her seshi. Notwithstanding this, the control of the world is common to botb: the two together are seshi, in relation to the world". By these authorities it was determined by Somasi Andan in Shadarthasamkṣepa, that both form always & single s'eshi. In the case of certain special offerings (havis) en joined in the Karmakanda, the offering is made to two deities like Agni and Vishou as if they were single. So also in this offering of the soul called prapatti, the two may, without any impropriety, be the single recipient. As stated in the siloka, "Youth Hand certain other qualities are common to Thee and Bhagavan; however you have divided other qualities between you for your enjoyment and (that in this way) :- Bhagavan has manly qualities like independence of others, control over enemies, firmness and the like and Thou hast such feminine qualities as gentleness, exist ing only for the husband, compassion and forbearance"; the wife is ever dependent on ber Lord and in the performance of yajnas or sacrifices, only the yajamāna is spoken of (as his wife who participates in the performance is implicit, as it were, in the word yajamāna, even when one yajamana is referred to). So also in regard to the teaching of the s'āstras, the mention of a single person does not mean the absence of the wife who is, as it were, inseparable from her spouse. In the verse :-- "Bhakti 5 and prapatti are forms of knowledge which have, for their object, only Bhagavan, the Lord of Lakṣmī, who abides in the lotas agd 80 also the knowledge called the perfect enjoyment of Brahman has only Him for its object" - in this verse this is realy the mean. ing, viz., that Lakṣmī, being included in Bhagavan, no separate mention is made of her. This may be seen also in the passage: "Since Thousand Bhagavan are thus inseparably united, the s'ruti does not speak of Thee separately". 

Nanjeeyar heard, from Kadambi Achan, what the author of Sri Bhashyam had declared and summarised it thus:-"In places 

58. Srigunaratnakosa : 28 

56. Srigunaratnakosa : 34 57. Mudai Tiruvandadi: 67 

SIDDHOPAYA INCLUDES LAKSHMI 

257 

where Bhagavan is referred to, it should be understood that Lakṣmī is also referred to". 

" Those whose object is only mokṣa and who have no other aim,or interest, worship Lakṣmī in her situation as laya (on the chest of Bhagavan) and as bkoga in the image of the spouse standing by the image of Bhagavan. But just as we bow before certain images of Bhagavan (like Sastanakrishna), which bestow primarily the benefits desired in this world, there is, for even mumukṣus, no impropriety in such actions as bowing before the image of Lakṣmī installed in a separate shrine and worshipped for certain worldly benefits (adhikarārchā), just as we should bow before our mothers, since in all images of Lakṣmī (wherever they may be) her being the Spouse of Viṣṇu is an established fact, 

When such authoritative doctrines are seen in the words of those who are disinterested, those who are still so obstinate as not to give up their wrong notions, are in a state described in the following ślokas:- "The fool" who clings firmly to what he has learnt before, the man who is igaorant of dharma, the man who will not have his doubts cleared by those grown old in wisdom - this man will come to grief like a blind man falling into a ditch", and “ To 6 those who are weak in intelligence, who are wicked, who have been bitten by the serpent of specious reasoning and whose senses have become deluded -to these men, truths appear different from what they (really) are", 

In the investigation of the real meaning of the word Siddho. pāya, the following passages should be remembered:- "There is al nothing other than these two. The niales are Bhagavan and the females are Lakṣmī". "Just as Viṣṇu is in all things, so also is she, O, best of Brahmins,". "The heart of this lady is fixed on Sri Rāma and his heart is ever fixed on her. Therefore it is that

she and Sri Rāma who is the embodiment of dharma continue alive for even the fraction of an hour." "Both Bhagavan and Lakṣmī aro omnipresent, since they are inseparably united, they are spoken of as one tattva or real." Therefore, since they form a single soshi, since they are ever of the same wind, since they are intimately attached to each other, and since they are inseparably connected with each other in their svarüpa or essential nature, and in their rūpa or forms, those who are established in sattva should understand the meaning of the word Nārāyana with its adjective Srimat in such a manner as will not be at variance with the inseparablo unity of the tattvam (Bhagavan ) with its attribute (Sri) so well expressed in the śloka :- "Tby \*\* essential nature svarūpa and the forms that Thou takest and the svarūpa and the forms assumed by Bhagavan are in close embrace with each other." 

( The author summarises the gist of the chapter in a qumber of ślokas as follows:--) 

The Lord of Sri, who is the embodiment of compassion and who secures, for them, all the benefits desired by men is called Siddhopāya, because He is already an existent upāya. The ways of securing His favour are such as bhakti and prapatti and these are called sadhyopāyas, because they can be adopted and accomp lished by those who desire the respective benefits. When the Sadhyopaya flows with high mounting waves and increases the flood of compassion of the seshi, who is the siddhopāya, the latter breaks through the flood of filā which is also Hia. By (that very flood of compassion) all bindrances to His service, such as even the former will of the Omnipotent, disappear like dams built of fine sand. Though the acts of propitiation (like bhakti and prapatti ) are prescribed in the sāstras for securing the fruit, yet Siddhopaya is considered as of prime importance, because the Lord alone is capable of granting mokṣa, since bhakti or prapatti being non-sentient, cannot give the fruit directly and 64. Abirbudhoya Sambita: 4-78. 65. Chatussloki: 4 

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER

since Bhagavan alone can act directly. To those who have adop ted prapetti &s the primary and independent means, it is specially ordained that they should rest on the Omnipresent in order that they may know that their own endeavour perishes instantly after prapatti. Therefore with what aim, the surrender of responsibility has been made to Siddhopāya - for that aim, the man should make no further endeavour and depend only on the Siddhopāya, In the definition of prapatti in the mantra for prapatti, in the injunction concerning it and in other passages and so also in Sri Bhashya and the like and by tradition, Brahman is declared as the upāya. Just as we admit that certain (holy) places and the like which exist already are called dharma productive of spiritual excel. leace, so also it is said by those who understand the truth that Sri Kr̥ṣṇa is the eternal dharma (or upāya ). This Siddhopaya is to be thought of in the three mysteries or mantrās in such as the syllable a in aum etc. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Narāyaṇa, with His Spouse Lakṣmī, who is staunch in being every kind of relation (to us ), who is the sea of compassion that dispela ignorance (and delusion), who shines sustaining all (things and all beings ) with His mere will, being the Supreme Lord with out a second and who takes compassion on us on account of ( $ri), the nectar born of sweet nectar - Narāyaṇa with Sri is the firm refuge of all who seek His protection having no other support. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The treasure (of gold - vix. Bhagavan), which is not seen 

is witbio them, because they are guided by heretical systems which have not the benefit of the traditional knowledge of our spiritual teachers -(the treasure which they fail to perceive) even though resting on it night and day (as in suṣupti) -- the treasure which is proclaimed in the strutis to be itself the means or sādhana for its attainment - that boundless treasure will make its presence (felt) among those who are pure of mind.
