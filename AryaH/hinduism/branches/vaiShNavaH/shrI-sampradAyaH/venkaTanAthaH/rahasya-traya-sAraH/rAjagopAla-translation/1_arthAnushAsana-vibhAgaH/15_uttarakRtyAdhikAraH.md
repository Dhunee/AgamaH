(15) THE CHAPTER ON THE MANNER IN WHICH ONE SHOULD CONDUCT ONESELF 

AFTER PRAPATTI. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The prapanna, with his eyes fixed on the absence of his own responsibility (bhara) in regard to both what is seen in this life and what is to come hereafter, follows, until the fall of his body, a course of action which is faultless and agreeable ( observing the code of conduct prescribed for his varna and his asrama) and for the sake of delight (in the enjoyment of the auspicious qualities of Bhagavan ) frequently studies Vedanta with good men, teaches the sweet and noble utterances (of such as Alvars ), always and also listens to them. 

THE CODE OF CONDUCT SUITED FOR A PRAPANNA: 

The man who has thus done what he should do and insers his proper attainment of nishta (in svarūpa, upāya and purushärtha) should follow the line of conduct described hereunder as long as he lives, like a farmer who, out of a big field fit for use in the adora tion of the Lord, gives up a large part and reserves only a small fraction of it as enough for his needs. This adhikari, Damely, the prapanna, who has given up his connection with many things and is still connected with certain things (like the body) should follow & line of conduct wbich would be most delightful like the successive services rendered by released souls (in heaven). This line of conduct is an end in itself; it has been prescribed for him in the sāstras as required to be done (in certain specific divisions of time); it is a form of service connected by links to the service wbich is to follow immediately after and is the means of winning the favour of the Master and is also its effect. The following passages indicate this line of conduct; - "I read" the books which describe the attributes and qualities of Bhagavan; I listened

to other people reading them, I bowed to Him, I worshipped Him always and performed service to Him and thus saw to it that my time was not spent in vain". "Men should get rid of their sorrow wbich is as deep as the sea on account of past karma surrounding the soul, by meditating on those passages which reveal the Lord's qualities. If they should not do so, by what other thought can they get rid of their sorrow wbile in samsāra p" "We should, without intermission render service to the Lord in all places and in all circumstances and at all times". "If the Lord is so gracious as to eaable me to spend my time always with the passages which describe His qualities in my mouth, with His form alluring the eye and other senses in my mind, and with flowers fit enough for His form in my hands - if I find this grace, what is there uppleasant for me wbile living here? "I wasó born to seek flowers that are hard to obtain in order that they may be placed at the Lord's feet" “May I, the sidner that I am, press the tender feet of the Lord wbich are gently pressed by the incomparably beautiful Lakshmi and the other, viz, the goddess of the Earth!” “Tbis is the only object that I desire – that the Lord should take me into His service for His own satisfaction". "We will 'render service, O Lord, only to Thee". "If the Lord 'will be so gracious as to let us gently press His feet in the place where He sleeps'' "My fingers will keep couni wben I utter the names of the Lord." "The days of my starvation are not those on which I do not eat - (they are) the days, if ever they occur, on which I do not constantly meditate saying "nāmo Nārāyana" and the days on which I do not approach Thy feet with the three Vedas wbich are (as it were) freshly blossomed flowers". "My tongue" will not praise any one but Thee; I wonder whether Thou wilt

"My mouth 18 does not praise any one but Him", "My "shoulders do not bow to any one but Him", "I 18 will not look upon my soul which belongs to the Lord as my own, nor will I remain in the company of those mean persons who think so," "May 'Thon be so gracious as to make me over meditate on Thee ", " When will u? these two eyes of mine delight in looking at the forehead of the Lord where the two gems that shed light shine dispelling dark ness?" "I do not long for birth accompanied with wealth that (only) makes the flesh grow but pray to be born as a bird in the Venkata Hills". "The eyes of those who have not seen that Golden Hill which rides on the bird and which, long ago, planted the bill wound with the serpent in the sea and churned it for the sake of nectar -- their eyes are not eyes at all" 

Likewise also these Sanskrit silokas om 

"I do not long for the wealth of Brabma or for that of Radra. I long to be either & kadamba tree or a kunda tree on the backs of the Yamuna (which Sri Krishna purified with His holy feet)." "Take me as "Thy servant. There is nothing improper in this. I will attain thereby the satisfaction of serving Thee for whom alone I exist. Thou wilt also obtain the satisfaction of having protected one who has sought Thee as his refuge." " Whe ther you are awake or asleep, I will render all the service that is required." "Live" as you may for a hundred years, I will be under you. Order me yourself to do whatever you want in places which you consider beautiful”. “I long at only for being the

servant of Bhagavad in all my births." "I will \*spend my daya tbus, rendering the appointed service in each of the five parts of the day and in worshipping Bhagavan with good chandana. flowers and the like - such as I can obtain with my own effort." 

These are the ways of service after prapatti which are in keeping with one's essential nature (svarūpa) in spending the time. 

THE PRAPANNA SHOULD SEEK 

SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE: 

Further the prapanna should not remain complacently ignorant of what should be known to one in that state, in the pre sumption that he has already done what should be done. In the state of perfect enjoyment of the Lord, knowledge and love are (both ) essential. Therefore in accordance with the sloka, "One \*should never beg of the Lord anything but knowledge and love for His holy feet. The man who begs (for other things ) will surely perish ", there is nothing improper in desiring knowledge and love of the Lord. It has been said :- "The Lord of the yellow raiment has incarnated as the guru to teach the Veda." So the prapanna should learn from such gurus possessed of exclusive devotion to the Lord and having a clear knowledge of (the truth ). He should obtain clear knowledge from them by following the injunction contained in the sloka - "Bow to "$ your guru, place your doubts before bim and render service to him, (then) learn from him the true nature of the self. (Your) acharyas will teach you the truth concerning the self." He should have his knowledge readered clear and pure, for (the poet) says, "Even a man "that is dull becomes intelligent by seeking the company of the wise. Muddy water becomes clear and pare by being mixed with the lather from soapnut." It has been said, "He whose 80 knowledge of the truth (concerning Bhagavan ) extends up to the enjoyment 25.

of the Lord all those who fall within the range of his eyes will be purified of all their sins." So the prapanna should live in close contact with such as are well established in this knowledge. As stated (in the Gita):- "In a stank which is intended for all and for various purposes, one should take only as much (of the water) his is required for one's purposes", the prapanna should deter. mine what he should choose, from among their ways of life and conduct, what is in accordance with his varna, bis asrama, his gotra, his character and the like and conduct himself in keeping with that deterwination and should walk warily last be should fall into the pitfall of thinking of bis own superiority and the inferiority of others, which might arise from his conceit while observing this code of conduct. 

Even if, as it occurred to such as Nammalyar and Natha munigal, he is blessed with the special grace of the Saviour so as to enjoy the rise of such benefits as the vision (of the Lord), he sbould feel sure (that it is not due to aay merit of his own) as said in, "I do not\* know wbat is good and what is bad”, and "Even if I know what is good and what is evil, I cannot obtain what is good and avoid what is evil" He should see to it that his be. ing destitute of all upāyas (Akinchanya) which is due to his svarüpa, his maintenance (sthithi) and his activities (pravritti) being entirely dependent (on the Lord) does not suffer any change or loss. He should remember his atter helplessness (kärpanya ) as described in the sloka “I Ham the abode of all transgressions, I have no means of protecting myself and I have nothing else to attain than Thee", and in such verses as "I have not been observing the code of the disciplined life, nor bave I keen intel ligence", "What \*can I do? "May my \* misery be put an end to by Thee ! If thou dost not do so, there is no one else to protect

me", "I have no other upāya end no other protector," "I do not know of any one whom I can hold as the Saviour of my sou!" "We are such " ignorant women belonging to the race of cowherds as eat in forests while grazing the cows there", "I bave "given up the rites pertaining to Brahmins of worshipping the three fires after ablutions", "I was not born into any of the four castes wherein one is fit to follow dharma", "I am ignorant and of low birth", "I "have no one to seek for support". "Even if s Thou dost not remove from me the sufferings due to karma, I have no other refage than thee," "I have not " practised karma yoga; I have not understood the real nature of the disembodied self (i.e) I have not performed Jinayoga, por bave I bhakti towards Thy holy feet.” (In these Tamil verses and Sanskrit slokas, the feeling of helplessness is well depicted and the prapanna should realise his owo helplessness by remembering such Verses). 

Owing to the knowledge of his own unfitness from time imme. morial and the loss of the Lord's service which resulted from it, which may canse excessive disgust, the prapanna should not fall into despair which makes one lament in the words of the Alvar saying, “The nature of the man in samsāra is sach that be identifies himself with the perishing body and calls it "I"; from it arises alao evil conduct and from it arises again the body that is foul". (Without falling into despair ), he should hearten himself with the succeeding words there :- "O" Lord of the immortals, Thou wast born into all castes and even from the wombs of animals in Thy eagerness to protect the Jivas!" He sbould comfort himself

with the words of the Saviour who appears in front to save bim - the words which are wholesome and sweet like mother's milk (such as \* For the protection of the good and the destruction of the wicked and so also for the establishment of dharma, I am born again and again in every yuga." He should bathe, as it were, in the words (of Bhagavan) which reveal the secret of the avatārs and take courage (from passages like the following) :- "Whatever a man may have been in the past, it be lives a righteous life in his old age, it will do hina good; his evil deeds in the past will do him no harm" and "A man nugy have been wicked in his past life; he may have fed on anything (however impure ); he may have been ungrateful; he may have been a sceptic; ia spite of all that, if he earnestly seeks the protection of the Lord, who is the cause of the world, know that that man is faultless owing to the Lord's greatness ", " In one half of an instant, a jiva commits a sin which cannot be expiated even in the course of ten thousand kalpas of Brabma. But Thou pardopest him if only he gives up the thought of sioning (again), even though he has transgressed. How wonderful this is !" "The past." is past, what can we do concerning it? The wise man should think of erecting the dam. even when the water is flowing," " It is good to die after per. forming prapatti to the Lord at least in the dying moments" 

In accordance with this principle, the prapania 'should not lament for what is past and without running away at the thought of bis past unfitness, he should make himself fit for the future by reflecting on the present fitness which has resulted from the infi. nite greatness of the Saviour which brooks no questioning, like those who construct a dam for the water that will come up in the future; he should not stray from the path of performing the commands and permissions of the Lord which are in keeping with his present state as & prapanna.

ing the Lord should be rendered fit (to enjoy Him) by means of pure food and service and directed towards such (spiritual) expe riences as are available and turned away from the desire for uawholesome objects, like cows that are turned away from steal. thily eating the crops. 

When people are waiting for the boat in order (to cross the stream) to go to a place of their desire, some of them may avoid playing chess or other game with stakes, as it could not be stopped whenever desired but may be engaged in playing the game without any stakes so that they might be in a position to give up the game (when the boat bas come). Though they play merely for the enjoyment (and not for money), they move the pawos (on the board) in strict accordance with the rules of the game. In the same way (though the prapanna does not expect any profit ont of it) he performs gladly the rites commanded and permitted by the Sapreme Ruler, which are really services to the Lord, in accordance with the specific time and place at which they are ordained for performance. (In performing them), be should resemble not those who drink milk for relief from excess of bile, but like those who have got well easily and quickly with the help of a medicine and who drink milk with pleasure (not as a cure for disease ). 

SERVICE TO ARCHĀ: 

While rendering this service, the prapanna should do such acts of service as are in keeping with the respective relationships between him and the Lord and with the Lord's supreme majesty and easy accesssibility; he should do these acts towards the images (archa) into which the Lord has incarnated for the sake of some devotees with exclusive devotion to Him; for it has been said : "He who "believea in the eternal forin and supreme majesty of the Lord -bim, O Poushkara, the Lord approaches," "In the same way as the water of the ocean taken up by the clouds and let fall

(as rain ) becomes fit to be enjoyed by all, Bhagavan whose image has been installed by devotees becomes fit to be served and enjoyed by others". "The six "qualities like Jnana are found in transcendent measure in the mantras and in the images (archa ). They are described in the mantras, and the qalities are found in Bhagavan, since He has, out of His compassion, chosen to abide in these images". This shows the fullness of perfection, "He who looks upon the Lord residing in the image as Purushottama and beholds Him (again and again) from the pedestal of the foot to the crown on the headbis five deadly sins (Mahāpātaka) are destroy ed quickly: Is it necessary to state that minor offences, too, perish ? This shows how supremely purificatory the archa is. And again it is said ;- "If mens of clouded intellects happen to see Bhaga van abiding in the archit even by mere chance, all the evil tendencies in them, such as the following, perish :- the thought that the body is the self; the false potion arising from it that he Bees the soul by perception; false conclusions arrived at by falla cious reasoning, false inferences resulting from wrong premises, false interpretations of scriptural texts and want of faith in the Sāstras." Thus the worship of the image (archa ) is a panacea for all mental diseases arising from a false understanding of cause and effect. 

The prapanna should meditate on the Lord's placing Himself at the disposal of those who seek His protection in a manner which cannot be understood by the mind or described in words, for it has been said, "Whoever wants to see me and in whatever form - to him I reveal myself in that very form." The same thing is stated also (in the Tamil verse) "He assumes the form desired by His devotees.” He should also meditate on the allaring beauty of the Lord of which (the Alvar) says "The eyesel that have seen the Lord will refuse to see other things." Having

156 CHAPTER 

done so, the prapanna should render service suited to the respect. ive relationships between him and the Lord (such as master and servant, father and son) and to His supreme majesty and easy accessibility, in accordance with the following verses :-"One\*\* should render service to the Lord like a chaste matron to her beloved husband, like a mother to her suckling, like a disciple to his acharya and like a friend to his friend. The Lord of Lakshmi should always be looked opon as a master, as a friend, as an ācharya, as a father and as a mother", "One should serve the Lord with as much fear as one would approach a king who is youthful, and an elephant in rut. In the same way as one would entertain a welcome guest who has come to one's house, one should worship the Lord with devotion, reinembering His easy accessibility.” “One should treat the Lord with as much affec tion as one would a beloved child". 

Like Bharatalvan who conducted himself like & servant of a king before (Sri Rama's ) sandals and of wbom it is said, "While the sandals6 were ruling, Bharata placed, before them first, whatever business had to be transacted and whatever valnable tributes were brought and then accomplished whatever had to be done in the manner in which it should be done", — like him the prapanna should render service as to a king, with materials earned righteously. He should look upon this service as & wedded wife would look upon the careful custody of her sacred wedding - thread and the like. He should have the conviction that he has attained this ultimate aim of life, which begins from service to Bhagavan and extends up to the service to His devotees, by his relationship with his good Acharya : for it has been said: "Kshatrabandhu, the great sidner, and Pundarika the virtuous, both attained moksha by having Acharyas" So also has it been said (in Tamil) :- "Our ācharyastale like bees which place as at the (flower-like holy feet

of the Lord, who is our Master and who renders help to the eternal sūris" and "If \*\* Vishnuchittar ( Perialvar) who was born in the city of Villipattur and who was perfect in the qualities of the spirit, by some means in his power, make the Lord appear before us, we can see" (That is to say - without the grace of Vishoucitta, the ächürya, they cannot do anything themselves). The prapanna should feel grateful at the thought of the expansion of knowledge which the achiiryas have wrought in him and of such things as the service (of the Tord and His devotees) whicb have resulted from it. He should behave towards thein as towards the servants (of the palace) who light the lamps and keep them barning on the night before the coronation of the prince (as a token of their rejoicing). He should feel grateful also to the Lord at the thought of His innate compassion which is the common and primary cause of all these and wbich, in the state of mukti, removes the dreaded possi bility of a break in the enjoyment of Bhagavan wbose independent will cannot be questioned. For it has been said:-- "The Lord \*\* makes us climb up to Vaikunta through the centre of the sphere of the sun whose rays dispel darkness and He removes the ladder that helped to climb, so that there may be no coming back", and again, "If one goes to Vaikunta after performing prapatti by utteriog the words 'Namo mürana', He will not let one come back to the world of samsāra, even if one should furnish security for going back to Vaikunta". (Nammalvar) says: "The firm "feet of Nare. yana whose praise is upsarpassed" (the feet being firm, those who have caught hold of them can never slip down); and again "Bhagavan" is our Father who takes away from His devotees their future births, leads them to Vaikunta, helps the manifestation of their svarūpa or essential nature and sees to their ever remaining under His feet even like the lines on the soles (of His feet)", and further, "The Lord" looks after (our) welfare by taking as to His feet and by preventing our fall therefrom". The prapanna

should feel gratefal to the Lord of Lakshmi, the s'eshi, whose will is ever absolute and who, even after moksha, shows the same compassion as during samsāra. (The Alvar describes this compas sion in the following words);- "By Thy" grace and the grace of Thy Spouse wbo lives in the lotus, I served at Tby temple of 

old" 

WHAT THE PRAPANNA SHOULD DO WITH HIS MIND, 

HIS SPEECH AND HIS BODY: 

About this code of conduct (of the prapanna) we will now state what is considered as the essence in regard to what should be avoided by the three senses viz the mind, the speech and the body and also in regard to what should be observed or followed by them: "Between poison (Visha) and the objects of sense (Vishaya) there is a great gulf of difference, for poison kills only the man who eats it, whereas objects of sense kill even at their mere thougbt." It has been said also, "Is it "fair on Thy part to delude my soul by showing before sinful me the various pleasures by which the senses allure me to my suffering ?" Therefore in order that the desire for the ultimate object of life may not languish, the most important among those that should be forgotten is the enjoyment of sense pleasures. In order that one may not become ungrateful, the chief thing that should be thought of is the assistance given to us by the acharya from the time bis glance first fell on us. In order that we may not lose the sense of helplessness, the chief thing that should be avoided in speech is the expression of our excellence. In order that one may not forget one's conviction in the upāya, the chief among the things that should be uttered is Dvaya; 48 (the Bhashyakara says) "?one should ever utter the Dvaya with an understanding of its meaning ". In order that Bbagavan who is entitled to receive our service with pleasure may not become dis. pleased at heart, the most important among those that should be

avoided by all the three senses is offence to those that know Brahman; 28 Andal says, “ We will never do what ought not to be done". In order that the ser of our supreme aim in life may not dry vp or become shallow, the most important among those things that should be done is service to the acharya and other devotees of Bhagavān as ordained in the Sastras and #8 forming the outer limit of the service of the Lord. 

This code of conduct which should be followed after prapatti and which is an end in itself should be considered in those parts of the three mysteries (mantras ) which indicate the benefit or fruit that results. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Our holy men who know the songs of the Tamil Veda with their meaning and who have discharged all their debts (to the gods, the pitris etc.) by the performance of prapatti accepted by Sri Krishna of the beautiful Dwaraka, enjoy, with delight, even in this world, that service which the mīktas and the siris perform without intermission and with eagerness in the world yonder. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Like a beloved wife who, in a big jewelled mirror, well-polished, sees her loviog husband by the side of her own image - her loving husband who has come behind her and stands beside her, and is at once transported into the ecstasy of love and enjoys his presence with the scattering of flowers that spread their fragrance all round - (like that beloved wife ) good men, whose wealth consists in their prapatti, see the Supreme lord in the great mantra (Tiro. mantra) which has frequently been meditated upon and enjoy Him with loving service similar to fragrant flowers.
