3. THE CHAPTER ON THE MOST IMPORTANT AND DISTINCTIVE DOCTRINE THAT IS UNIQUE TO VIŚIṢṬĀDVAITA. page81

SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_:

आधेयत्व-प्रभृति-नियमैरादिकर्तुश्शरीरं  
सत्ता-स्थेम-प्रयतन-फलेष्वेतदायत्तमेतत् ।  
विश्वंपश्यन्नितिभगवतिव्यापकादर्शदृष्टे  
गंभीराणामकृतकगिरां गाहते चित्तवृत्तिम् ॥ १० ॥

When _Bhagavān_ is seen in the mirror of the 'vyāpaka[^21]  _mantra_s, which disclose His all-pervasiveness, one will see that the universe (which we perceive with our senses) is absolutely dependent on Him for its existence and continuance and likewise for its activity and the fruit or result arising from it; since the universe is supported and controlled by Him and is also solely for the fulfilment of His purposes, one will understand that it is the body of the Primaeval Creator. By realizing this relationship of the universe being the body of the Creator, one is enabled to reach the heart of the śrutis, which were not composed by any one and which have the deepest significance.

[^21]: Vyāpaka  _mantra_s: These are (1) Aṣṭākṣara (2) Ṣaḍakṣara, the _mantra_ with six letters (Namo Viṣṇave with _Praṇava_ at the beginning) and (3) Dvadaśākṣara, the _Mantra_ with twelve letters (Namo Bhagavate Vāsudevāya with _praṇava_ at the beginning)

WHAT IS MEANT BY PRATITANTRA? THE MEANING

OF ŚARĪRA -ŚARĪRI BHĀVA:

The word Pratitantra means a doctrine or feature which is peculiar and distinctive to a certain (philosophical or religious) system exclusive of all others. Here it may be asked what the doctrine that is most important and unique to our system of Vedānta  is. It is the doctrine which maintains that the relationship between _Iśvara_ and the world of sentient beings and non sentient things is that between the soul and the body. (Another is the doctrine that every word, whatever its ordinary denotation may be, such as 'cow' "man" and the like, refers ultimately to _Iśvara_ who is within them as their innermost soul).

WHAT IS A SARĪRA AND WHAT IS A SARIRI :

_Iśvara_ is called the inner self or soul (Sariri), because as long as they exist, He is, in regard to sentient and non-sentient substances (dravya), their support (_ādhāra_), their controller or ruler (_niyantā_) and their Lord or Master (_śeṣī_ ) for whose purposes they exist. Sentient beings and non-sentient things form His body, since, with regard to Him, they stand as substances supported by Him, controlled by Him, and existing solely for the fulfilment of His purposes, throughout their existence. _Iśvara_ is called the Supporter and the Controller or Ruler of all sentient beings and non-sentient things, because from His swarupa or essential nature and His _saṅkalpa_ or will, they derive their existence, continuance and activities as [^f46] befitting[^22] each of these two (_svarūpa_ and _saṅkalpa_). It may be asked how this could be. Just as _Iśvara_ is the abode, _āśraya_ or _ādhāra_ (support) of the attributes which define His essential nature (_svarūpa_ viz. Satyam, Jñānan, Anantam and the like) and of the other qualities possessed by Him with His essential nature so defined (qualities like compassion and accessibility), He is also the inseparable and direct support, (āsraya or ādhāra) of all substances (sentient and non-sentient) other than Himself. He is also the support, through these substances ((i.e.) indirectly), of the qualities that pertain to them. There are some who hold that _Iśvara_ is the support, through the _jīva_s, of the bodies supported by the _jīva_s. Some _ācārya_s say (on the other hand) that both directly by His essential Nature and indirectly through the _jīva_s, He is the support of these bodies.

[^f46]: As befitting each of these two - By His _svarūpa_, He is the cause of their existence and continuance; this is because of being their support; by His Sankalpa or will also, He is the cause of their existence, continuance and activities; this is because of being their controller.*

[^22]: As befitting each of these two - By His _svarūpa_, He is the cause of their existence and continuance; this is because of being their support; by His Sankalpa or will also, He is the cause of their existence, continuance and activities; this is because of being their controller.

_IŚVARA_'S SUPPORT BY HIS _SVARŪPA_ AND

BY HIS WILL.

In relation to _Iśvara_, all (substances ), sentient and non. sentient, are attributes that are inseparable from Him (Aprithaksiddha vi_śeṣa_ṇas). Therefore their existence and the like depend entirely on the existence of their support (i. e.) Isvara. The existence of all things is also dependent on His will. Those of them that have only a temporary existence take their origin from a temporary will or _saṅkalpa_ of His and those of them that are eternal (like Vaikuṇṭha   and the sūris ) exist for ever by His eternal will. This distinction has been stated by one who is worthy of respect for his learning in the (following) _śloka_  :-"The [^f47] existence of all things is only by Thy will. Of these some are eternally dear to Thee and are hence eternal and even these eternal beings or things are entirely dependent on Thee for their essential nature."

[^f47]: Vaikuṇṭha  sthavam: 36

Since the continuance of a thing is merely the continuity of its existence, everything, (i. e.) existence and continuance, is dependent on His will. There are heavy substances that are stated in the śāstras to be supported by _Iśvara_'s will. For instance, the following _śloka_  says: "The Heavens,[^f48] the sky with the moon, the sun and the stars, the different quarters, the earth, the great ocean - all these are supported by the might of the Supreme Being, _Vāsudeva_.” It is stated here that, in regard to keeping these heavy things in their respective places without their falling away from them, the existence, continuance and activity of these things depend on _Iśvara_'s will. The word 'supported' (in the _śloka_ ) means “is dependent on His will'. If it be asked how, when every substance is supported by His will, the essential nature (_svarūpa_) of _Iśvara_ can have anything to do with them, the answer is that the will of the Supreme Being ordains that these objects should be supported by His essential Nature (_svarūpa_). That all tbings are dependent on _Iśvara_'s essential nature and also on _Iśvara_'s will. In the world (of daily life) also, we find that the body is supported by the essential nature (_svarūpa_) of the soul or self and also by the will of the self. Since the body exists from the time of the entry of the soul into it and perishes or disintegrates when the soul leaves it, it is known to be supported by the _svarūpa_ or essential nature of the soul. In the state of dreamless sleep (_suṣupti_) and the like, when the will of the self is dormant, the body continues to exist without any deterioration; so its existence then is clearly dependent on the _svarūpa_ of the self and not its will (or _saṅkalpa_). In the waking state, when the body is kept from falling, it is sustained by the will or _saṅkalpa_ of the soul. When the existence of the body is dependent only on the _svarūpa_ of the self or its essential nature, it is said to be supported (adheyatva) by the latter; and when the existence depends on the will or _saṅkalpa_ it is said to be controlled and directed by the latter (niyāmyatva).

[^f48]: Mahābhārata  : Anusasanika parva 254-136.

WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ŚEṢA-ŚEṢI  BHĀVA?

_Iśvara_ is said to be the _śeṣin_ of all things, because they exist solely for the fulfilment of His purposes. They are His _śeṣa_s, The following _śloka_  explains how _Iśvara_ is the _śeṣin_ of all:  The [^f49] Utterance of the Upaniṣads is to the effect that the Lord takes in both sentient and non-sentient things for the fulfilment of His own purposes, by being the cause of their existence, their continuance and their control. In regard to (one of the two (i.e.) the sentient being), Thou art both the end to be attained (upēya) and the means of attaining it (_upāya_). This is Thy essential nature and not an adventitious quality of Thine. Therefore, O Thou that hast Thy repose in _Śrī_r_aṅga_m, I seek refuge in Thee without any selfish interest.”

[^f49]: Srirangarajastavam: (Uttara Satakam) 87

THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE.

Sentient beings and non-sentient things exist not for their own sake but for the fulfilment of God's purposes. Their nature is ever to exist for somebody else (i.e.) the Lord. In using them for His own purposes, His glory is manifested. This is being _śeṣī_ . "But" it may be asked, "what does this sentient being gain by being supported and controlled by Him and by existing solely for his master ?" The answer is as follows: By having the Lord as his _ādhāra_, the _Jīva_   becomes an inseparable attribute of the Lord even like His own attributes _Jñāna_ and _śakti_ or power. By being the Lord's _śeṣa_ and by having the Lord as his _śeṣī_ , the _jīva_ acquires a taste for an ultimate goal or end which is appropriate to his essential nature, for every being aims at a goal or end suited to the conception held by it about its nature. By being the _śeṣa_ of the Lord and by having Him as his controller and ruler, he comes to know the specific means or _upāya_ (viz _Bhagavān_) of attaining the goal or ultimate aim suited to his essential nature. This _upāya_ or means (is the Lord Himself who is the only proper means for the attainment of this end and who) does not require any auxiliary aid for helping Him. From what has been said above, it follows that this sentient being has no other support, exists for nobody else, and has no other protector than _Bhagavān_.

THE PRESENCE OF THESE IDEAS IN THE THREE

MYSTERIES OR _MANTRA_S.

If it be asked how this idea is contained in the first mystery (i.e.) aṣṭākṣara, the answer is as follows:- The word  ‘Nārāyaṇa’ is a compound word which means either "He to whom Nārāh are a resting place (ayana )", in which case it is a possessive adjective compound (bahuvrihi samāsa), or " the resting place of nārāh (i.e.) men", in which case, it is a determinative compound in which the first part Nārāh is in the genitive case (i.e.) nārānām + ayanam ( which is qualified by the genitive.) The compound word Nārāyaṇa  interpreted in these two ways establishes His being the support (of everything) and of His pervading it. From this it would follow that the _jīva_, in his essential nature, has no other support and is pervaded by no other than Nārāyaṇa  The words Om and Namo which precede Narayanāya imply that the _jīva_ exists for Nārāyaṇa  and is entirely dependent upon Him for protection. It would follow therefrom that the _jīva_ serves no other purpose than that of Nārāyaṇa  and that he has no other refuge or protector-than He.

In _Dvayam_ which is, as it were, a gem of a _mantra_ and which discloses the activity or process of self surrender (_prapatti_) to the Lord, the first part reveals that the _jīva_ has no other refuge than Nārāyaṇa  and the second that he exists for no purposes other than those of Nārāyaṇa , while, in both parts, the idea of the _jīva_ having no other support (_ādhāra_) is evident (from the word Nārāyaṇa).

Similarly these ideas may be discerned in the _carama_ _śloka_  also, either directly and explicitly in the words themselves or by implication or purport arising indirectly from the meaning of the words.

The _carama_ _śloka_  declares that _Bhagavān_ is Himself the already existing and established means (siddha _upāya_) for attaining Him, for He is ever ready to help us to attain Him, and that, in order to secure His help, we have yet to accomplish or adopt a means (sādhya _upāya_), which is self-surrender (s'aranāgati) to the lord. This _Sādhyopāya_, namely, self surrender or _śaraṇāgati_ is performed by uttering the _Dvayam_ and the thoughts that we should bear in mind at that time are concisely disclosed in the Tiru_mantra_ or _Aṣṭākṣara_ as in a little mirror reflecting bigger forms.

The (two) meanings of the first word OM (_aum_) are illustrated in Arjuna's chariot and in the (famous) _śloka_  of the Rāmāyana which says:- [^f50] Rāma went first. Sītā walked in the middle, and Lakṣmaṇa, bow in hand, walked behind, following them. The word OM is constituted of three parts a, u, and m; a, which is seen first, means _Bhagavān_, the Protector or Saviour, who is seen first in Arjuna's chariot, and m means the _jīva_, Arjuna, the object of protection who is seen afterwards; a means, only; it may also

[^f50]: Rāmāyaṇa: Aranyakāṇḍa

mean Lakṣmī . When u refers to Śrī or Lakṣmī , the two _śeṣī_ s, _Bhagavān_ and Śrī appear first and the _śeṣa_ appears afterwards. In the _śloka_  quoted from the Rāmāyana, first we think of the Saviour, then we think of Lakṣmī  and then of Lakshmane who is their _śeṣa_. So also is _praṇava_ or _aum_; a, u and m refer respectively to the Saviour, Lakṣmī  who pleads for the _jīva_ and then the _jīva_ who requires their protection. The second word in Tiru_mantra_, viz, _namo_ or namah means "adoration" or "I adore", This brings out explicitly, by the word itself, the idea of the _jīva_ being entirely dependent on the Lord. Since _Bhagavān_ is pleased with those who serve His devotees (Bhagavatās), it is implicitly stated in the word _namas_ that we depend also on Bhāgavatas and are subject to their direction and control. Illustrations of these may be found respectively in the lives of the devotees, Bharata and Satrughna (the former of whom delighted in obeying and serving Rāma and the latter in obeying and serving Bharata).

The third word in Tiru_mantra_ is Nārāyanāya, which is the dative or fourth case of Nārāyaṇa . (The word Narayan, has two meanings: (1) the resting place or refuge of naras or living beings and (2) He who has naras (living beings) as His abode or resting place. This means that the _jīva_ depends for his very existence on Nārāyaṇa  and that Nārāyaṇa's glory (vibhūti) cannot manifest itself without the _jīva_. It has therefore been well said: "I do [^f51] not exist without thee, O Nārāyaṇa, nor dost Thou without me". Nārāyaṇāya, which means for Nārāyaṇa ' should be construed along with some such word as _syām_ or_ bhaveyam_ and the meaning would then be, “ May I exist for Nārāyaṇa "! These meanings of the word Nārāyaṇa  may be seen illustrated in all created beings of Kosala (who could not bear their existence without ŚrīRana and who departed this world along with Him, and in ŚrīRāma, too, who departed with them.

[^f51]: Nanmukhan Tiruvandadi: 7

The first word, _Praṇava_ (_aum_), signifies that m, the _jīva_, exists only for a (aya) and the second word _namo_ that the _jīva_ depends on _Bhagavān_. His existence is for _Bhagavān_ and His devotees, to the latter of whom the _śeṣa_tva extends as its ultimate limit, and he depends absolutely on _Bhagavān_ and His devotees In the light of this interpretation, the third word Nārāyanāya has, for its purport, the goal of the _jīva_, vis, _kaiṅkarya_ or service to the Lord and His devotees. This service may be seen illustrated in an active form in that of Lakṣmaṇa and in a passive form in the sandals[^23]  of Śrī Rāma which were an incarnation of Lakṣmaṇa or Adi_śeṣa_ and which left Rāma's feet to go along with His devotee, Bharata. (In these instances) the service is such as would be pleasing to the _śeṣī_ (namely, _Bhagavān_).

[^23]: Lakṣmaṇa is a partial incarnation of Adisesha and Adisesha serves the Lord as His sandals. His bed, and so on. Therefore the sandals of Rama are, in a sense, the incarnation of Lakṣmaṇa.

All this elucidation and illustration of the meaning of Tiru_mantra_ were vouchsafed by Śrī Appullar. The implicit and explicit meanings contained in _Dvayam_ and the _Carama_ _śloka_  should be understood on the same lines.

IN REGARD TO BEINGS ENDOWED WITH

INTELLI GENCE, _ŚEṣA_TVA MEANS DĀSATVA:

In these mysteries _Iśvara_ is disclosed as the _śeṣī_ (i.e.) as one for whom everything else exists. He stands in the relation of _śeṣī_ to both sentient beings and non-sentient things in common, In relation to non-sentient things He is _śeṣī_ , because they exist for His purposes. In relation to sentient beings or _jīva_s endowed with intelligence, He is s'eshī in the special sense of being Swami (i.e.) Master whom it is their duty to serve, and this is the manner in which we should understand while uttering the mantrās. Our being _śeṣa_ to the Lord we share in common with non-sentient things but we are _śeṣa_s in the special sense also of being His servants (dāsāh).

The ordinary relationship of _Śeṣa_ and _śeṣin_ between the _jīva_ and _Bhagavān_ is disclosed in the first syllable of the _aṣṭākṣara_, viz, _aum_ where the a, the first member, is in the dative case ‘aya’, though the termination has dropped. It means for a or _Bhagavān_'. The specific form of being _śeṣa_s which applies only to _jīva_s (and not to non-sentient things ) and which is really being the servants of the Lord ( dāsas) and of His being the Swami or Master is revealed in the purport or implication. So also in the word 'Nārāyaṇāya' there is the general relationship of the seshin towards all things and the specific relationship of Swami or Master which obtains in the case of jivās. Here the goal of usefulness to the Lord, which is the result of the general attitude of the _śeṣa_, becomes the goal of service or _kaiṅkarya_ to the Lord, owing to the _jīva_ being His servant or dāsa. Thus by being the _śeṣin_, _Iśvara_ attains a unique glory and as a consequence of His being the Swami or Master, this glory consists in the enjoyment of service which is His _puruṣārtha_. _Iśvara_ is responsible for the protection of His servants and has also the power to do so, whereas the _jīva_ or _Cetana_ is not responsible for his own protection nor has he the ability to protect himself. This is due to _Iśvara_ being the unconditional (nirupadhika) _śeṣī_ and the unconditional Director and Ruler. Owing to their being the unconditional _śeṣa_s and their being subject unconditionally to His control, it becomes, indeed, the responsibility of the owner to protect what belongs to Him and of the strong to protect the weak. _Iśvara_, however, makes up his mind to protect the _jīva_ only after making him adopt some means or _upāya_ for winning His protection, (because the _jīva_ is subject, according to the śāstra  to the law of Karma).

The Lord gave us our existence and is our support (dhāraka) as well; He is also the unconditional Ruler that directs and controls us. There is nothing that does not exist for the fulfilment of his purposes; He is also our Master for whom all things exist; He stands alone with no one to compare with Him. It is the earnest conviction of those who understand the spirit of the Vedas that we are the bodies and the unconditional (or natural) servants of the Lord with the crown of Tulsi leaves (for the Antaryāmi Brāhmana of Brihadaranyaka upanishad states this explicitly.)

SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_:

यद्येतं यतिसार्वभौमकथितं विद्यादविद्यातमः-  
प्रत्यूषं प्रतितन्त्रमन्तिमयुगे कश्चिद्विपश्चित्तमः ।

If, in the Kali yuga, there is any one supremely wise who can understand this unique and distinctive doctrine of the relationship between _Iśvara_ and the world being that between the soul and the body, which was taught by that sovereign sannyāsin (Śrī _Rāmānuja_) and which is like the dawn that dispels the darkness of ignorance , then in that place where he is, the tumultuous waves of logical disputation arising from the eagerness to establish the truths of other systems will subside at once.
