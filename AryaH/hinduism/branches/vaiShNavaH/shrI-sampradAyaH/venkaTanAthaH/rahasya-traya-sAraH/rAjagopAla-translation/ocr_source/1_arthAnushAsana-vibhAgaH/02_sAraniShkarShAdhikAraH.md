(2) THE CHAPTER ON THE DETERMINATION OF WHAT IS BEST ? 

NOTE "The Three Mysterics" have been occasionally referred to in previous chapters. Sri Vedāntadesika presumes that everyone of his readers knows what they are. It is just possible that some of them are not in the know of these mysteries. So a brief account may be necessary of these mantras. 

1. One of them is called Ashtakṣara or Tirumantra. It consists of eight syllables in Sanskrit which are in the form of three words. The first word which consists of a single syllable is Om, which is made of three parts a, u and mor akara, ukara and makara. The second word is namo which, when there i s no sandhi, is namas. It means 'Obeisance' or adoration! The third word is Narayana which means " to Narayanaya". Narayanaya is the dative (the fourth case ) singular form of Narayana. The mantra, as a whole, means "Adoration to Narayana ! " or "I offer my adoration to Narayana." (This is the meaning appearing at first sight.) 

2. Another mantra or mystery is the “last" śloka of Sri Kr̥ṣṇa's teach ing in Bhagavad Gita usually called the charama śloka. 

It means: “Having given up rites or activities as means to secure mokṣa, surrender thyself to me alone". (This is the first half of the śloka.) 

(This is the second half 

"I will free thee from all sins; despair not." of the śloka.) 

3. Yet another mystery or mantra is usually called Drayam. It consists of two parts; the first part means "I seek refuge at the feet of Narayana who is cver inseparable from Sri or Lakṣmī". The second part means: "I offer my adoration to Narayana and Sri". 

These, then, are the "three mysteries or mantras" which are the best of what should be known and meditated upon. The fuller and more subtle meanings of these mantras are explained in latter chapters. )--Tr. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

What is opposed to the way of the Vedas is like poison; even in the Srutīs or Vedas, those parts which treat of the means of attaining the enjoyment of material goods (Prakriti bhoga) and

of the enjoyment of one's own atma or self (purusha-bhoga) or (Kaivalya) are not salutary. Therefore the wise who are afraid of tbe cycle of births and deaths ( samsāra) seek the best essence extracted out of the ocean of nectar called the Upanishads which has been guarded with great care by sages (i.e.) previous ācāryas for our benefit 

THE GREAT VALUE OF THE THREE MANTRAS: 

Among these three mysteries (mantras), Tirumantra or Ashtakṣaru has' been stated to contain everything within itself and, if it is known, the meaning of everything becomes known; the charama śloka, which says (in its first half) “having given up all rites and activities as means of attaining mokṣa, surrender thyself to me", establishes that the adoption of the single means taught in it, vis, self-surrender (or s'aranagati) would secure the benefits of all other means prescribed elsewhere; the Dvayam, aus has been stated in Katu sruti and elsewhere, is capable of making & man perfect in the discharge of all his duties even if it is uttered only once. Therefore these three mysteries alone are of value to the seeker after salvation. It has been said, “One should ignore what is of no value, what is only of slight value, and, likewise, what is valuable and even what is more valaable. It is only what is most valuable that one should prefer in the sastra, like ambrosia in the Ocean, 

THE ONLY PRAMANA IN REGARD TO) MOKSHA AND 

THE MEANS OF ATTAINING IT IS SASTRA: 

The ultimate goal or aim of life (purushārtha ) (namely, mokṣa) and the means of attainiog it are not capable of being understood from sense perception (pratyakṣa) or (anumāna) inference. As stated in such passages as "It is from the

2 Sastra that I know Janardana ", "Therefore 3 ia determining what\*ought to be done and what ought not be done, the only autho. rity tbat should guide you is Sastra" and "Be who is well "versed in the Agamas or Vedas will attain Brahman", the only pramāna that exists for our guidance is sabda or what is revealed in the Sastras. In this context it has been said, “What ares to be known are many and endless; the time (at our disposal) is short; the bindrances are many; therefore prefer only what is valuable, like the swan that separates the milk from the water with which it is mixed." The word 'valuable' really means ' most valuable', because it refers to what is always and unconditionally valuable. The Sastras of those who are outside the pale of the Vedas (like Buddhists ) and likewise of heretics (like Advaitins) are not valu. able at all and are therefore to be ignored. In the first part of the Veda, the portion which treats of rites leading to the attainment of worldly goods is only of very slight value and hence not to be resorted to. That part which treats of the attainment of the good things of svarga after death, though it may appear valuable to somé as leading to fruits higher than worldly goods is of no use, as, in the final estimate, they are based on sorrow and have other objectionable features. That part, too, which treats of the realis& tion of one's own soul and the means thereof, though a little more valuable, is not of value to those who desire the enjoyment of the Supreme Self. To the man of discerning wisdom, the part of the Ved& which treats of the Supreme Brahman, the attainment of Brahman and the weaps thereof is the most valuable, and is there. fore to be preferred.

THE THREE MYSTERIES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT. 

Even there, the three Mysteries (mantras) which are, as it were, an epitome of the truths that ought to be known and of the means of attaining salvation, which are the distinctive, unique and exclasive doctrines (of our Visishtadvita system) are invaluable and therefore to be most preferred. As stated in the siloka " From the many and great sāstras, the wise man should choose only that which is most valuable as the bee takes in the honey from the flowers," the jiva who thirsts for mokṣa should prefer as invaluable these three mysteries (mantrās.) 

TAMIL VERSE: 

As if what has been already learnt is not enough, the eighteen subjects of study may confront us like burdens (on the intellect); but they add only to the number (and are of no use). Therefore the Acharyas of our system (Visiştādvaitam) have, with wise discrimination, given us what the Nitya-sūris whose wisdom never langnishes (literally who never wink") speak of in exalted terms. nainely, the 'eight' (Ashtakṣara) and the two' (viz) the Dva. yam and the charama śloka, SANSKRIT VERSE: 

The basic mantra (moolanantra) called Ashtakṣara shines conspicuously in the Upanishads (literally, the end of the various branches of the Veda). If there is any one endowed with discriminating wisdom who has understood from that inantra the truth about hia essential nature, and if he spends all his time in uttering the Dvayani which, even at a single atterance, can produce the fruition of the desire for the ultimate goal of life and if he has also absolute faith in the means of salvation taught with compassion in the charama śloka by Sri Kr̥ṣṇa who, for his sport or Ia, became the charioteer, and, who is the crest jewel, as it were, of the Vedas - if there is any such person (at all) in the world, he will be the leader of all our hosts.
