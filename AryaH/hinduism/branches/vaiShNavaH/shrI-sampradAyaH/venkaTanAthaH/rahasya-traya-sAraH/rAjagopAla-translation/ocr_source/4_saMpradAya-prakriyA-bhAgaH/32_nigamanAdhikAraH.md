32. THE CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

There may be found some one who, by the grace of his ācārya, has seen (the truths concerning) the Universe (as distinctly) as if they were a jubube berry (08016 6 5 mil) in the hand, whose illusions have been dispelled and who enjoys (the meanings contained in) such mysteries (mantras) as the moola. mantra. When a worthy sishya baving the necessary virtues has been found, be instructs him in the spiritual tradition and gleans, for his own observances, all that is good in the conduct and obser vances of great men and becomes worthy (himself) of the appre. ciation of the hosts of the eternal sūris. 

TOPICS TREATED OF SO FAR 

Here (in this treatise), we have set forth, just as we learot them ourselves and just as we believe them to be true in our heart of hearts, without giving room to any ignorance, doubt or misconce. ption, the following topics of knowledge in accordance with wbat is sanctioned by the s'rutis, the smritis, the stitras and the ancient tradition and in accordance also with right reason: (1) How the jivatma whose essential nature is such that he is fit to enjoy the bliss of Bhaçuvan just like the stiris - how he has lost this fitness from beginningless time, how later he acquires the spirit of detachment (vairāgja) in some measure, how he comes in contact with a worthy ācārya from whom he begins to learn the truths and the means of attaining the ends desired by him; (2) how among the pramāṇas or valid sources of knowledge, the three secrets or mysteries (mantras), are of the greatest importance; (3) how, among the meanings revealed in these (mantras), such things as the relationship of soul and body that exists between the Supreme Ruler and those which are ruled over by Him are the central and most essential doctrines to be learnt (4) how the five subjects of knowledge (artha. pañcaka) including that relacionship which have been summar.

By His devotees. (20) how, to the man who has been living such a life, the soul's departure from the gross body may take place, by ibe peculiar will of the Saviour, in any place and at any time irrespective of their being usually considered worthy or noworthy (21) how the self that has started (from the body) proceeds, like a prince invited by his father to bis installation as heir-apparent, in full glory to travel along the archiridi route to Paramapadat, (22) how after reaching there, the self will have the full and perfect enjoyment of Bhagavan which will include also free and voluntary service or kainkarya and which is the supreme state of Lordship reserved for the mukta (23) the Siddhop'iya which is the most important of what are to be known (24) the südhyopii ya which is the ruost important of those things that are to be per. formed (25) and (26) the ways in which misconceptions arising frou impure food, from association (with undesirable persons) as also from the character of the yuga and the like should be removed, misconceptions in regard to the potency of this upüya in relation to the man who has adopted it, misconceptions which describe its potency is higher or lower than what is stated in the siistras (27, 28 & 29 ) the construction and interpretation of the words and the sentences in the three secrets or mysteries (mantras) which enable a in:in to weditate on all these points, (30) the regulations in regard to the imparting of instruction and the refraining from it, which have to be kept in toind by the achirya who has to propagate a kpowledge of the spiritual tradition concerning these truths in accordance with the sāstras and (31) the duties expected of the sishya who, on account of bis inability to recompense hig āchārya adequately has to remain eternally indebted to him --- 

THE GOOD RESULTS THAT WILL FOLLOW FROM 

A STUDY OF THIS TREATISE: 

The s'ishya should, at first, approach the good üchürya in the proper manner and beg of him in these words : "I am your pupil and have sought you (for guidance). (Therefore) command

me as to what I should do". He should listen (to the ācārya's discourse) with reverence and close attention and should also glean with care the advice which wonld supplement (what is taught by the achürzu) as stated in the following sloka :- “One should\* observe the wise words of great men and their virtuous ways of life and glean from theru whatever is required for oneself, in the same way as some live on the grain gleaned in the fields." He sbould try to have a clear understanding of what is taught therein by repeated study. 

It has been said: "The hurmas followed by the good is too subtle, U monkey, to be easily understood" and "There is po end to arguments. The Vedas are diverse; the rishis frona whose words truth could be ascertained are many. The truth regarding sharma is hid (as it were) in a cave," and also, " Dharma' is more subtle than the sharp edge of a razor. Who is there competent to declare what it is ? " Thus where even sages have to tread with the greatest care, we have to follow what is stated in the following slokas :- "The way that is followed by great men is the way (to be followed by others)" and "Whatever is said, even in sport, by Brahmins seated in the chariot of the dharma siistras and arnied with the sword of the Vedas --(What. ever is said by them) is considered as supreme dhurina". There fore to walk along the path followed by the ancient uchiiryas who depended solely on the srutis an. tbe smritis and cleared the way so that it may be free from hindrances - to walk along this way is not improper for us. To those who walk along this path, there will be no such painful anxietips as those feit by great sages when they said :- "There is no rest house, no staff for support, no food (on the route) and no one to guide us. It is the path which leads to hell and is too dark to walk alongs. How will you

traverse it alone ?" and “The path leading to the bouse of Yama where there is no water for quenching the thirst, on staff for support, no sharle to sit under, no house or lodge to rest in and which produces prolonged suffering." To one who follows the track of great men, there would be no such painful paths. They need not be tossed about to and fro like cotton cleaned of its seeds, combed, and carded before being spun and go up and come down, like the bucket in a picotah, along the path of smoke (alliimmüdi route)\* described in the pañcagni vidyu in the sixth chapter of Chindogja uparishad, 

It has been said :-- "O. Lord,' Thou pinyest, as with balls, with creatures bound by the strings of karma and going up and coming down". To the man who follows the ways of great men, the siate when he is thus a toy for the sport of Bhagavan will soon pass away. Ile will then go along a path which is superior to the paths followed by others to attain bigh ends (like sturger), because it will lead to an end or goal greater than all others and will never result in a return to samsüra. It has been said:- "I know' that the path which will be trodden by the man who has exclusive devotion to Bhagavan is for superior to others" and likewise, “He I the" jīva ) starts from the body by an excellent path, which is so cool as to remove the sofferings of sumisira." and further, "lo those "who have practised yoga, (all) sufferings will cease and they will then jourbey by the Deva yana route," This excellent path will terminate in the region (Paramapada) described in the following slokus -- " It is a 'splendid region on reaching which the self will become (itself), (i. e.) free from uvid vir and conse. quently from suffering," " The abodet of the Supreme Being, Vishn:1, shines far more than the sun or the fire. It is so dan

zlingly bright that even the gods and asuras cannot gaze at it," “Those great souls who have completed their practice of yoga and have become free from ignorance and illusion reach that region from which there is no return to this world of samsāra." "When compared with the region where the Supreme Being abides, this svarga and other worlds are, my child, like bells". This path (Devayāna) will terminate in Paramapada which is declared in the srutis also as the ultimate terminus of the route leading away from samsāra. The self (that takes that path) will have, for its supporting staff, the grace of Bhagavan, and will have, for the victuals of its journey, the delight in the thought that it will (soon) attain the supreme end of life. As stated in the Brahma-sūtras "' He will stort" from there by the opening of the vein (rūdi) indi cated and lighted by the Tord who dwells within the heart" and take the archiradi route along which, in the respective regions of the gods, he would be greeted and welcomed with honours befitting emperors by the respective deities thereof with auspicious lamps and pitchers full of water (poorìakumbha) and attended by their followers. They will escort the self on its path and those deities to whoin the man made offerings in the world of karma before will (now) pay tribates to his self. The self then passes into regions which are beyond their range and attains a supreme perfection which would make it difficult for it to be distinguished from the eternal siiris when it enters their assembly. The self will then reach under the two feet of the Suprenie „Ruler and Ilis consort who are resting on a couch in Parumapada, the like of which has been described in the Mahibhürata and the Rimiyara in coonec tion with the avatars as their manner of being seated: \* Then he saw Sri Kr̥ṣṇa scatedlé on a thiude made of gold and adorned with gems and looking like a blue cloud resting on Mount Meru.

Ile was like a mountain lighted up by the sun and bad & crown on His head. Snch was His appearance that, in all the three worlds, there could be found no one to be set in comparison with him?" and “Sumantra, the charioteer, saw Sri Rāma seated like Knbera on & throne inade of gold and having a beautiful coverlet. His body was covered with the paste of saadal red like the blood of the boar, pure, fragrant and of superior quality. Sita was standing by him with a chümara in her hand, like the star Chitra near the moon, His splendour is like that of the sun. Sumantra, who knew the etiquette (suited to courts), bowed with respect to the invincible Sri Rania who ever gave what was asked of him." (Having rench ed the feet of the Supreme Being, the self will receive the privlege of rendering all kinds of service suited to all places, all times aod ill circumstances and be for ever blissful as prayed for in the verse :- “We sliould render, 4o constantly and without inter mission, service to the Lord - such service as will be most appro. priate to all times, to all places and to all occasions". 

Thus (both) in the state of endeavour (upāya) and in the state of attainment, the holy feet of Narayana, the Lord of Sri, are our support. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

The feet of Sri Ranganatha, ever true to tbeir devotees can never be given up; they were once awake to the danger from a mighty wheel (the forın taken by an usura) and hy touching it they tuade it break into pieces): on another occasion, they crawled on all fours and caused the two Maruda trees which grew close to each other to fall down; on the occasion of His searching (for butter) in the pots hanging from above, they stood indistinguish. able from the mortar to which they were bound (by Yasoda), (On a later day), they gladly consented to go on the mission assigned to them by the virtuous Dharmaputra; they came to Bripdavan

to bring about the destruction of the wicked asuras; while gently stroked by the hand of Lakshmi, they became red like the petals of the lotus; they were favourable to the devotion shown by the great sages who wanted freedom form.the bondage of births; they rested in a wonderful vimūnu (having a reserublance to pralava), which was an object of worship to kings of the race of Manu; they shone in the chariot of the righteous Arjupa during the great war; they were inflamed with wrath when they danced on the cruel hoods of the serpent, Kaliya, and made them break down; they rested in a region (Paramapada) that could not be (even) imagined by the six systemis of philosophical thought; they became the subjects of praise in the tongue of the Alvar (Nammalvar), who was the glory of the beautiful city of Kurngai; they had, for ornaments, the fragrant flowers of Tulisi; they showed their glory by graciously transforming the fallea piece of charcoal into a cbild (Parikshit); they chased the armies of the asuras to their destruction.

In bibe the nectar of spiritual tradition which has come down from the Udayana of Vedānta (Kilambi Achan) which is fragrant with the odours streaming forth froin the kitchen of the prince of sannyasins (Sri Rāmanuju) and fit to be enjoyed by the assembly of learned men (also gods). 

(NOTE: Kidambi Achan, the disciple of Sri Rāmanuja, was in charge of the kitchen during his ācārya's life-time)

ing off illusions and errors, as also the nature of the self (as the s'esha of the Lord), the unique compassion of the Lord shown to those who are destitute of upāyas, and the carefree state arising from holding on to the Lord as a refuge as taught in the three mysteries (mantrus)? We have spoken (thus far) to those who can appreciate excellence. SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Our youth has been spent in the enjoyment resulting from repetitions of the words of that prince of Sannyasins (Sri Ram. nnja). Oor days have been lived in happiness by casting off the hell of depending on any others (than the Lord); the arrogance of thuse who are perverse las also been annihilated for the satistaction of good inen; and for the rest of onr life, we shall be earnestly and constantly looking up to the realisation of the vow of compassion taken by that divine couple for the fulfilment of wbose purposes alone we exist. 

TAMIL VERSE:-- 

Ithese thirty-two Tamil verses, which, when recited, are like nectar to the ears (that hear them), which explain clearly, the truths that lie deep within the four Vedas the like of which cannot be seen elsewhere and which becarne possible only owing to the compassion of those ichürgvis who delight, of their own accord, to innpart instruction to s'ishiyas, when they find in then integrity of character and freedom from faults like envy me these thirty-two) verses foru an ornainent to this treatise by virtue of these three qualities viz., their beantiful diction, their wealth of ileas and their fitness for being sung. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

There will be found some one (or other) who has faith in religion, who is keen of intellect and (at the same time) free from envy, whose mind has become pure by following the righteous tradition of good men, whose aim is to attain the highest goal, who

is not afraid of conventional judgments and who would look upon wealth and worldly success as if they were mere trash - He will certainly follow the virtuous path (which is described in this treatise) and which will never beconie obsolete. 

TAMIL VERSE:-- 

Those who have faith in the truths revealed in the Vedas, who have keepness of intellect, who would never think of speaking in depreciation of real nierit, whose minds have become pure by the training which they have received from their gurus, who have lofty aims, who, being firm of mind, would never swerve from the right path owing to the fear of perverted judgements and who would never care for what is worthless -- these men will enter the righteous path which will never become obsolete and which has been indicated by our pure-minded ācāryas who had inore for bearance than even the Earth. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

"Our ācāryas will say :-- "This is the right path" and will look upon (this treatise) as being delicious like Dectar; they can show how the pleasures of the senses are mean and are different from the righteous way (that is described in this treatise). Owing to their desire that the path indiculed here should prevail, they will overlook any mistakes of ours that may be found (in the book). We huve, by the grace of our «whiryas, accepted this as the proper way. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

I was so ignorant that I did not know even that eight and two make ten ;\* Our Madhava who is eager to bestow on us Parama pada, which is most difficult of access, has taught me (through the ācāryas) the mantra of eight syllables and the other two mantras (Dvaya and Charama sloka). By His brilliant and noble speech

saying: "I will see to the absolution of all your sids; Do not be afraid "-By these words I have attained the state of staunch faith, 

TAMIL VERSE: 

These states of mind in regard to one's essential pature, the upāyas and the end to be attained (which are explained in this treatise) and which are understood only with effort by even those who are in Paramapada are indeed possible of attainment even here in this world of samsāra. This treatise, though decried by perverse minds bent (only) on finding faults, will be found sweet by the Supreme Ruler wbose lotos-like feet overflow with honey. 

TAMIL VERSE:-- 

The Lord whose face resembles that of a wbite burse (Haya. ghiva) assumed the form of my ācārya and, by that device, wrote these truths in my mind and I have (oply) transcribed them on these leaves. The part played by me is none other than this. Whether this treatise is accepted as worthy or rejected 88 unworthy, my clear prind, ( nien of critical minds, will feel neither elated nor Hepressed in the least. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

This treatise, “The Gist of the Three Mantras or Mysteries" was composed in brief by the wise Venkatesa endowed with mani. fold vision, to the satisfaction of those who look upon Sri Narayana and His consort as the only Saviours,
