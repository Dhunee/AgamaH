      <description>The misunderstanding  In 18.66, he says abandon all forms of dharma and surrender unto me. I shall liberate you from all pApa. XYZ has formally surrendered via Prapatti/BharaNyasa, and there&amp;rsquo;s no need for her to do anything else according to our Acharyas and according to Krishna himself. I understand is that after Prapatti everything else is more of an anubhava for us. Because puNya and paapa are not the currencies for moksha.</description>

Śrī Rāmānuja’s Vedāntic Harmony: Samanvaya As A Paradigm For Social Harmony
M A Alwar
Śrī Rāmānuja was a philosopher par excellence and the famous proponent of the philosophy called Viśiṣṭādvaita. The religious side of that philosophy is called Śrīvaiṣṇavism. It is often said that philosophy without religion is lame and religion without philosophy is blind. Hence philosophy and religion should go hand in hand for their survival. On the one hand, the religious aspects needed for spiritual progress are strengthened by theoretical foundations and, on the other hand, philosophy finds purpose in the practice of religion.</description>
