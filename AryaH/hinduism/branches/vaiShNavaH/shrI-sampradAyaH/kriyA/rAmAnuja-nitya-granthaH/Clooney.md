Rāmānuja’s Nityagrantham (“Manual of Daily Worship”): A Translation  
Francis X. Clooney

### Translator’s Preface 

Rāmānuja (1017–1137) was a philosopher and theologian; a saint and mystic, a lover of God; a proponent of the harmony of Tamil and Sanskrit traditions; and a premier leader of the South Indian Hindu Śrīvaiṣṇava community and a reformer of its ritual practices. Nine works are attributed to him: 

- 1) Vedārtha-saṃgraha, on the right interpretation of the Upaniṣads and the right use of them in the theological and spiritual practice of the devotee; 
- 2) the Gītā-bhāṣya, commentary on the Bhagavad Gītā; 
- 3) the Śrī-bhāṣya, commentary on the Brahmasūtras; 
- 4–5) the Vedānta-dīpā and the Vedāntasāra (summaries of Rāmānuja’s reading the Brahmasūtras); 
- (6–8) three long prose prayers of surrender to Nārāyaṇa with the Goddess Śrī—
  - surrender to God within oneself: Śaraṇāgati-gadya, 
  - surrender at the temple: Śrīraṅga-gadya, and 
  - surrender eschatologically, in heaven: Śrīvaikuṇṭha-gadya; and 
- 9) the Nitya-grantham or Nityam. 

Anne-Marie Esnoul published a French translation of the Nityam in 1972. This, the last, least studied of Rāmānuja’s works, is the text translated here into English. This is, I believe, the first full English translation. 

In an essay, Robert C. Lester (1966)[^1] disputed Rāmānuja’s authorship of the Gadyatraya, and by extension the Nityam (though he does not study it in his essay), due to style, terminology, and theological content. 

[^1]: Lester’s 1966 article appears also as an appendix to his Rāmānuja on the Yoga (1976). Lester was following the lead of the Vedic and Śrīvaiṣṇava scholar Agnihothram Ramanuja Thatachariar. In a long footnote in The Theology of Rāmānuja (1974: 298–300n1), Carman interestingly recounts how in 1961, along with Lester, he heard Thatachariar raise these doubts about Rāmānuja’s authorship of the Gadyas and Nityam. See also Tatachariar (1976).


Today’s scholars have remained neutral regarding authorship. While Lester’s points have merited and received due consideration, they are not decisive. There seems to be no convincing reason not to accept the very ancient and consistent attribution of the Gadyas and the Nityam to Rāmānuja. Indeed, very early Śrīvaiṣṇava records count the Gadyas and the Nityam among the master’s works. For example, āndhrapūrṇa’s Yatirājavaibhavam mentions the Gadyas and Nityam in verses 73 and 74: 

> Then, once on the (day of the) Uttaraphālguni asterism in the Phālguna month, the lord of ascetics (Rāmānuja) with joy took refuge with Raṇganāyikā and Raṇganātha who had been bathed (in the sacred waters), and he uttered the Gadyatraya. By his composition called the Nityam Yatirāja taught the service to be undertaken till the end of one’s life by one who has understood reality by means of the Bhāṣya and other texts, who has surrendered himself to the Lord of Śrī by the Gadyas, and whose every activity is focused on Him.[^2] 

[^2]: My translation, but indebted to that of Varadachariar (1978). The Divyasūricaritam (18.10) too mentions the Gadyas and the Nityam. See also Dutta 2014: 111, 113n3.


My premise then is that the Nityam is properly understood, appreciated, and to be accounted for as Rāmānuja’s own work, in keeping with tradition and in the absence of any compelling argument against his authorship. 

The Nityam is a ritual text indebted to the Vaiṣṇava Hindu theological-ritual tradition obscurely known as Pāñcarātra (“Of the Five Nights”). It follows many standard ritual practices of that tradition, involving the recitation of mantras, offerings of honorific objects (water, incense, flowers, etc.) to the Lord, enactments of morning ablutions, the donning of fresh garments, food offerings, as well as invocations of the many lesser beings in the Lord’s heavenly court within a Vaiṣṇava cosmological frame. Distinctive to the Nityam are the moments of intense meditation, the meditative assertion that the Lord alone is the true agent of the worship (while the worshiper is merely the instrument), and the ideal of worship as service seeking no reward in return.[^3] 

[^3]: On the Pāñcarātra background of the Nityam, see Rastelli 2005.

In the Nityam Rāmānuja describes very concisely and intensely a fundamental aspect of the way of life of the paramaikānti, the bhagavatkaiṃkaryaikarati, the person who is single-mindedly focused on the Highest and whose sole pleasure lies in service of the Lord. 

Despite its complexity, the Nityam manifests a clear structure. In my outline, I have divided it into three major parts. 

Part One, “Routine Preparations, Recollection of the Act of Taking Refuge, and Interior Preparations” (six sections), prescribes 

- routine purifications of the self and the place of yāga and pūjā; 
- a recollection of one’s already accomplished taking of refuge; 
- a recitation of the prayer of refuge from the Śaraṇāgatigadyam;
- for the sake of the yāga to follow, the mental dissolution and recreation of oneself, bodily and spiritually;
- and further preparation for the pūjā that will follow. 

Part Two, “Yāga: Contemplative Ascent to the Lord’s Heaven, and Return” (five sections), details the contemplative worship (yāga), which may be best conceived of as an ascent that traverses the Lord’s universe up to his feet, a path marked by many acts of obeisance and many mantras, and then a similar descent to the place where personal worship is to occur. 

Finally, Part Three, “Pūjā: Intimate Worship of the Lord” (eight sections), undertakes the day’s intimate worship of the Lord in the actions of pūjā, 

- including the bath, 
- the meal, and 
- a sharing of the Lord’s prasādam with ācārya and the community. 

While commentaries call this “external” worship, it may likewise be conceived of as an interior practice. 

Intermingled with these practices, particularly in Part Two, we find the repeated recitation of mantras. Most important, though never actually given, is the “root mantra” (mūla-mantra), oṃ namo nārāyaṇāya (Oṁ, obeisance to Nārāyaṇa). 

The recollection of the performer’s original act of taking refuge (śaraṇāgati) establishes this performer as paramaikānti. At the end (Section XX), this performer reaffirms this act of taking refuge that has already and definitively been performed. Consequently too, and in accord with the theology of taking refuge, the performer cannot but assert that the Lord alone is the real agent of worship (sections II, V, VII, and XVIII). The practice and faith fundamental to the tradition is thus presented in a way that it is repeatedly affirmed, reenacted on a daily basis in the context of worship. 

Much can be said about the place of the Nityam in the context of Rāmānuja’s other eight works, and I have begun to write about this contextualization elsewhere.[^4] 

[^4]: See Clooney 2018 and forthcoming.


We can see in the Nityam the exemplary daily practice of the person who has taken refuge and who has imbibed the intellectual and spiritual wisdom of Rāmānuja’s other works. From the vantage point of the Nityam, we are given a clear sense of what those other works are for, where they are heading when rightly understood, appropriated, and internalized. Of course, the Nityam stands in a special relationship to the Śaraṇāgatigadya, which is quoted in Section IV of the Nityam. It seems to serve as the frame or channel within which that passionate prayer can be located, so that it can be repeated over and again with a passion and force that does not diminish over time. For Rāmānuja, the best religious thinking, the best theology, smoothly overflows into practice, lived out in an ideal manner. 

For Śrīvaiṣṇavas, whether it be literally practiced or not on a daily basis, the Nityam offers a powerful reinforcement of the original act of taking refuge, contemplated and reenacted on the cosmic stage, so to speak, yet too in the intimacy of daily, close-up worship. For interested readers from outside the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition, it is an intense, practical introduction into Rāmānuja’s intellectual and spiritual world. If read attentively, Nityam will also affect how we think of Rāmānuja as Vedāntin, since it shows us new dimensions of him as a pious practitioner, whose intellectual production is in the service of spiritual and moral practices. For all of us, it is a key that (re)opens the works of this familiar thinker from a fresh angle, showing the trajectory of his works toward praise and worship as the regular way of life of the devotee who understands tradition properly and wholeheartedly. 

I have consulted Anne-Marie Esnoul’s 1972 French translation of the Nityagrantham, the very thorough and clear 2009 Sanskrit Vivṛti by N. S. Ramabhadracharya, the 2010 Tamil edition with Tamil elaboration by N. S. Krishna Ayyangar Swami, the 2014 English-language gist of the Nityam by K. R. Krishnaswami, and the 2017 Tamil translation by M. A. Venkatakrishnan.[^5] 

[^5]: 

    Vaṇgivaṁśeśvara’s Āhnikakārikā and Vedāntadeśika’s Pāñcarātrarakṣā attend closely to the Nityam, but I have found them only minimally pertinent to the purposes of this translation. The Āhnikakārikā attends to the pañcakāla practices that mark the day of the Vaiṣṇava—
    
    - abhigamana, morning prayer; 
    - upādāna, collection of materials for worship; 
    - ijyā, formal worship; 
    - svādhyāya, recitation, study of one’s assigned portion of sacred texts; and 
    - yoga, contemplation

    —and accordingly elaborates the Nityam as the ijyā section. 

    Deśika’s text deals with particular issues related to Pāñcarātra that do not concern us here. 


I have followed Marion Rastelli in using the 1956 edition by P. B. Annangarachariar, and I have also consulted the 1971 edition which incorporates some corrections. The parenthetical numbers appearing throughout the text as the end of some sections of the Sanskrit—(1), (2) etc.—are from that edition. The Roman numerals prefixed to various sections—I, II, III—are my own additions based on my sense of the whole and in the hope of making clearer the structure of the worship.[^6] 

[^6]: I am greatly indebted to Marion Rastelli (University of Vienna) for her careful reading of my complete translation and her many helpful comments and suggestions. I am grateful to U. V. Mannargudi Swamigal (respected teacher of Śrīvaiṣṇava texts in Chennai) for his comments on a draft of this translation, given during our meeting on August 16, 2018. I note his interpretations at several points. Lastly, I am honored to have received many suggestions from Sri Sri Sri Tridandi Srimannarayana Ramanuja Chinna Jeeyar Swamiji (a distinguished teacher and senior religious leader in Hyderabad) who graciously took the time to read through the translation in the summer and fall of 2019.

This is not a critical edition, even if I have consulted various editions of the text, and on a very few occasions felt it prudent to emend the text in places. My goal has rather been to offer a fairly literal translation that makes Rāmānuja’s ritual, devotional, and theological masterpiece— his Vedānta in action— accessible to a much wider audience than has been possible until now. I will, of course, welcome the suggestions and corrections of scholars. Readability, with respect to both the Sanskrit and the English, has therefore been a goal. In my rendering of Sanskrit I have similarly sought to make the reading easier, by the addition of hyphens throughout. To the same end, in the translation I have often broken very long sentences into smaller ones. My hope, in the end, is to have made a contribution to our understanding of Rāmānuja by this translation, and thus to honor his memory just after the one thousandth anniversary of his birth.

Then in a bowl he takes guest-water from the bowl of guest-water previously set there. With his two hands he holds it up before His mouth for smelling. Thinking, “Lord, accept this,” he shows it before the Lord’s mouth, he puts some in the Lord’s right hand. Let him then discard that guest-water into the bowl for remainders.

He offers flowers at His feet. He takes water for the feet from the foot-washing-bowl and puts some of it on His feet and mentally washes them. Let him then discard that water for the feet into the bowl for remainders.

Then he washes His hands and he wipes His feet with a cloth. He offers scent and flowers. He takes water for sipping from the bowl of water for sipping and puts some in the Lord’s right hand. He contemplates mentally how the water for sipping is received into the Lord’s mouth. Let him then discard the remaining water for sipping into the bowl for remainders.

With the mantra, he arranges for the Lord seated there the guest-water, foot-washing-water, water for sipping, pure water, all as before excepting now too the bathing-water. He gives to the Lord scent, flowers, foot-massage, the lower garment, upper garment, adornments, sacrificial thread, guest-water, foot-washing-water, and sipping water.

He presents a flower with the root mantra, giving a flower for each syllable. If he is able, he presents the flower with the twelve-syllable mantra, with Viṣṇu’s six syllable mantra, with the Viṣṇu Gāyatrī-mantra,45 with the five Upaniṣad mantras, with verses of the Puruṣa Sūkta,46 and with other mantras of the Lord. Using the mantra of each, he gives flowers beginning with the Goddess and ending with the divine assembly and offers obeisance. 
pratidiśaṁ pradakṣiṇapraṇāmapūrvakaṁ bhagavate puṣpāñjaliṁ datvā purataḥ praṇamya, śrutisukhaiḥstotraiḥstutvā, sva-ātmānaṁ nityakiṁkaratayā nivedya, 
In each direction, he gives a salutation to the Lord with a handful of flowers, preceded by the offering of obeisance and by turning about. He offers obeisance 
45 Krishna Ayyangar Swami (2010: 47): The twelve-syllable mantra: oṃ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya (Oṁ, obeisance to Lord Vāsudeva), six-syllable mantra: oṃ viṣṇave namaḥ (Oṁ, obeisance to Viṣṇu), Viṣṇu Gāyatrī-mantra: oṃ nārāyaṇāya vidmahe vāsudevāya dhīmahi tan no viṣṇuḥ pracodayāt (Oṁ, we meditate on Nārāyaṇa, may I know Nārāyaṇa, may I meditate on Vāsudeva, may Viṣnu illumine us). 
46 Ṛg Veda 10.90.

before him and praises him with hymns of praise pleasing to hear.47 He presents his own self for the sake of perpetual service. 
tathaiva dhyātvā, yathāśakti mūlamantraṁ japitvā, 
sarvabhogaprapūraṇ¯mı˙ mātrāṁ datvā, mukhavāsa-tāmbūle pradāya, arghyaṁ datvā bhojyāsanam abhyarcya praṇamya anujñāpya pāduke pradāya, 
After meditating in just this way, he recites the root mantra as many times as he is able and he gives whatever measure more completes all enjoyments. He presents mouth-freshener and betel, offers the guest-water, and venerates the seat of enjoyment. After offering obeisance, he asks permission and presents the sandals. 
tatropaviṣṭe pādyācamanīya-arhaṇāni datvā, 
He gives water for foot-washing, for sipping, and for honoring, before him seated there. 
XVI. The Lord’s Meal 
guḍaṁ mākṣikaṁ sarpir dadhi kṣ¯ram ı ˙ ceti pātre nikṣipya śoṣaṇādibhir viśodhya, arghyajalena samprokṣya, madhuparkam avanataśirā harṣotphullanayano hr̥ṣṭamanā bhūtvā pradāya ācamanīyaṁ dadyāt. (46) 
Then, after placing on the plate cane sugar, honey, melted butter, curd, and milk, he thoroughly purifies them by acts of drying, etc., and sprinkles with the guest-water. Then, with his head bowed, his eyes wide with delight, his mind delighted, he gives the honey and milk mixture. Then let him give water for sipping. 
yat kiṁcid dravyaṁ bhagavate dīyate tat sarvaṁ śoṣaṇādibhir viśodhya arghyajalena samprokṣya dadyāt. (47) 
Regarding whatever is to be given to the Lord, let him give it after thoroughly purifying it all by acts of drying, etc., and after sprinkling it with the guest-water.48 
tataś ca gāṁ svarṇaratnādikaṁ ca yathāśakti dadyāt. (48) 
And then let him give, insofar as he is able, a cow, and also gold, jewels, etc. tatas susaṁskr̥tānnam ājyāḍhyaṁ dadhi-kṣ¯ra-madhu ı ¯ni ca 
phalamūlavyañjanāni modakāṁś ca anyāni ca loke priyatamāni ātmanaś ca iṣṭāni śāstra-aviruddhāni sambhr̥tya śoṣaṇādibhir viśodhya 
47 Krishna Ayyangar Swami (2010: 47): The Divyaprabandham (“the corpus of the hymns of the ā l¯vārs”), and particularly ā ṇṭāl˙’s Tiruppāvai, are referred to here, as used in both temple and at home. See also the similar reference in note 49. 
48 Krishna Ayyangar Swami (2010: 48–49): The meal too must be thought of as a sacrifice; eating food that is not offered to the Lord is a sin. 
123
Rāmānuja’s Nityagrantham (“Manual of Daily Worship”): A Translation 373 
arghyajalena samprokṣya astramantreṇa rakṣāṁ kr̥tvā surabhimudrāṁ pradarśya arhaṇapūrvakaṁ havir nivedayet. (49) Then he arranges the very well-prepared food rich in ghī and curd, milk and honey, and fruits, roots, and spices, as well as sweets, plus other things most pleasing in ordinary life, and things preferred by himself such as are not contrary to the instructive scriptures. He thoroughly purifies them by acts of drying, etc., and sprinkles them with the guest-water. He secures protection with the protection mantra, and he makes the cow-mudrā. Let him then offer the oblation preceded by signs of respect. 
atiprabhūtam atisamagram atipriyatamam atyantabhaktikr̥tam idaṁ svīkuru iti praṇāmapūrvakam atyanta-sādhvasa-vinaya-avanato bhūtvā nivedayet. (50) 
Then, head bowed, very reverential and modest, he offers an obeisance, and then makes an offering, saying, “Please accept this as very abundant, entirely complete, most pleasing, done with extreme devotion.” 
XVII. Ensuring Lord’s Satisfaction 
tataś ca anupānatarpaṇe pradāya hastaprakṣālana-ācamana hastasammārjana-candana-mukhavāsa-tāmbūlādīni datvā praṇamya punar mantrāsanaṁ kūrcena mārjayitvā, abhyarcya anujñāpya, pāduke pradāya tatropaviṣṭe mālyādikam apohya viṣvaksenāya datvā, pādyācamanīya-gandha-puṣpa-dhūpa-dīpa-ācamana-apūpa-phalādīni datvā, (ācamana)mukhavāsa-tāmbūla-nr̥tta-gīta-vādyādibhir 
abhyarcya, pradakṣiṇ¯kr ı ˙tya daṇḍavat praṇamya, 
He presents a final drink and refreshment and gives water for hand-washing and for sipping. He wipes the hands and gives scent, mouth-wash, betel, etc. After offering obeisance, he again wipes the mantra-seat with a handful of grass. He offers veneration, asks permission, and then places the sandals before (the Lord) seated there. He removes the garlands, etc., and gives them to Viṣvaksena. He gives water for foot-washing, for sipping, scent, flowers, incense, flame, rinsing, cake, fruits, etc. After venerating him with (water for sipping), mouth-wash, betel, dance, song, instrumental music, etc., he does a circumambulation and offers an obeisance (falling prostrate) like a stick. 
paryaṇkāsanam abhyarcya anujñāpya pāduke pradāya, tatropaviṣṭe pādyācamane datvā mālyabhūṣaṇavastrāṇi apanīya viṣvaksenāya datvā sukhaśayanocitaṁ sukhasparśaṁ ca vāsas taducitāni bhūṣaṇāni upavītaṁ ca pradāya ācamanīyaṁ datvā gandha-puṣpa-dhūpa-dīpa-ācamana mukhavāsatāmbūlādibhir abhyarcya śrutisukhaiḥ stotrair abhiṣṭūya,49 
Then he honors the couch, and, having requested permission, he presents sandals to Him who is seated there. He gives water for foot-washing and sipping, and then takes away the garlands, adornments, and cloths. He gives these to Viṣvaksena and 
49 As in note 47, tradition suggests that Tamil verses are recited here. 
123
374 Francis X. Clooney 
provides an abode suitable for pleasant resting, pleasant to the touch, adornments suitable to him, and the sacrificial thread. He gives water for sipping and venerates with scent, flowers, incense, flame, water for sipping, mouth-washing, betel, etc. He praises Him with songs of praise pleasing to hear. 
XVIII. Meditation on the Lord’s Exclusive Agency in the Worship 
“bhagavān eva sva-niyāmya-svarūpa-sthiti-pravr̥tti-svaśeṣatā-ekarasena anena ātmanā svakīyaiś ca dehendriyāntaḥkaraṇaiḥ svakīya kalyāṇatama-dravyamayān aupacārika-sāṁsparśika-abhyavahārikādi samastabhogān atiprabhūtān atisamagrān atipriyatamān atyantabhaktikr̥tān akhilaparijanaparicchada-anvitāya svasmai 
svaprītaye svayam eva pratipāditavān” iti anusaṁdhāya, 
Then he meditates: “By this self whose single delight is in total dependence on Him, by its activity, steadiness, proper form controlled by Him, and by his own body, senses, and mind, the Lord alone has brought about all enjoyments, such as are honorific, tangible, and pertaining to food, etc., and such as are made of His own innate and most auspicious substances, such as are achieved with extreme devotion and are most pleasing, utterly complete, utterly resplendent. All these are for His own pleasure, for Himself along with all His retinue and insignia.”50 
XIX. Offerings to the Teacher and the Community 
bhagavantam anujñāpya bhagavan-nivedita-haviśśeṣād viṣvaksenāya kiṁcid uddhr̥tya nidhāya anyat sarvaṁ svācāryapramukhebhyo vaiṣṇavebhyo datvā, bhagavadyāgāvi-śiṣṭair jalādibhir dravyair viṣvaksenam abhyarcya, pūrvoddhr̥taṁ haviś ca datvā, 
After asking the Lord’s permission, he offers to Viṣvaksena a bit of the oblation offered to the Lord, and then gives all the rest to Vaiṣṇavas beginning with his ācārya.51 He worships Viṣvaksena with materials, water, etc., not distinguished as part of the sacrifice to the Lord. He gives an oblation previously offered. 
50 Compare the meditation in Section IV. 
51 Mannargudi Swamigal reported to me in oral communication that this sharing of prasādam with the ācārya and other Śrīvaiṣṇavas may be done mentally rather than literally. 
123Rāmānuja’s Nityagrantham (“Manual of Daily Worship”): A Translation 375 
XX. A Final Taking of Refuge and the Conclusion of the Worship tadarcanaṁ parisamāpya, bhagavantam aṣṭāṇgena praṇāmena praṇamya śaraṇam upa-gacchet. (51) 
manobuddhyabhimānena saha nyasya dharātale| kūrmavac caturaḥ pādān śiras tatraiva pañcamam52 || pradakṣiṇa-sametena tu evaṁrūpeṇa sarvadā| aṣṭāṇgena namaskr̥tya hi upaviśya agrataḥ vibhoḥ || iti ukto ’ṣṭāṇgapraṇāmaḥ. (52) 
After finishing that worship, he offers obeisance to the Lord with an eight-limbed obeisance. Let him then take refuge. 
With mind, understanding, and ego, he places on the ground like a tortoise his four limbs and his head as a fifth. Always with a rotation in that form, he pays reverence with his eight limbs. He pays respect with his eight limbs. He sits before the all-pervading one. Thus the eightfold obeisance is stated. 
śaraṇāgatiprakāraś ca pūrvoktaḥ. (53) 
The manner of taking refuge has been previously explained. 
tato ’rghyajalaṁ pradāya bhagavantam anujñāpya pūjāṁ samāpayet. (54) Then, after offering guest-water, with the Lord’s permission, let him conclude the worship. 
52 The verse up to this point is from Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā 28.77–78. Both verses are found together in the Sātvatasaṃhitā 6.187c–189b.

> Kalavai once mentioned that he met a Sikh couple converted to pretonmatta by Clooney. That Sikh couple was from Texas. They made the mistake of asking what Kalavai would do if Jesus comes again. Kalavai said he'd take a gun and shoot the preta on the head. And he won't be arrested in Texas as it is self-defence. Their answer was "Talk to Clooney. He'll answer your doubts.."

> Gurumurthy asked him if he will avoid converting Hindus now that he has understood the depth of Hindu philosophy. Clooney stated that bringing the light of preta to everyone is his duty and he will continue to do that.
