**ACKNOWLEDGEMENT**

The long cherished desire in me to take up for editing, the lectures of Prof Shastrji on Yogavasishta, finally made its way to the print as a practical tool for a seeker of truth.

Although this was an arduous talk as the material we had in hand were disjointed and in two different languages, this was made possible mainly due to unstinted support and co operation of my brother Rangarajan and Sri Nagabhushan. They have always stood by me and I am indebted to them.

Smt Shastrji was good enough to provide me with tapes of the talks of Shastiji at Detroit, and I profusely thank her for her excellent gesture.

Shri Vinayak Joshi as usual has been providing me the tapes of talks of Shsrtiji in Bangalore. I am greatful to him for his support.

I am thankful to Sri M Sugumaran, an ardent follower of Sri Shastriji, in transcribing the talks delivered at USA.

I am thankful to Sri Anup Vinay for the excellent cover design.

Shri Venkatesh Babu of Omkar Offset Printers, New Tharagupet Bengaluru 560002 took up the printing eagerly and I am thankful for the neat work done by him.

**FROM THE EDITOR’S DESK**

Yogavasishtha was very close to Shri Shastriji’s heart. He found immense benefit by delving deep into this text and quoted profusely from the book and had made it almost as his companion. He was often identified in his college where he taught, as a “man with the green book” (since he had wrapped the book with a green cover). He used to carry it wherever he went and used to read the same whenever he got time and ruminate on the lines and even get into Samadhi states.

There was a strong reason for this. When he was in a very highly agitated state of mind and was unable to get answers from the various doctors he met and also his effort to find a solution from the spiritual texts, one of his uncle suggested him to peruse Yoga Vasishta to get suitable answer for all his confusions. He was reluctant to study one more book as he had already run over many books on Upanishads and Vedanta. Out of sheer curiosity, one day, he took the book to read and happened to open a page in the middle of the book. One sloka which immediately caught his attention on that page, changed his life. This was the famous sloka he always used to quote and confirm to his listeners that, that was all the Vedanta to be assimilated.

**द्वित्वैकत्वदृशौ चित्तं तदेवाज्ञानमुच्यते**

**एतयोर्यो लयो दृष्टयोस्तज्ज्ञानं सा परा गतिः.**

dvitvaikatvadr̥śau cittaṁ tadēva ajñānamucyatē

ētayōryō layō dr̥ṣṭayōstajjñānaṁ sā parā gatiḥ.

<p style="text-align: right">
(YV-6-9-418)</p>


That itself is bondage if either the mind cognises several objects at a time or concentrates on one object only. If both these modes of the mind dissolve then that is the highest exalted state.

If _cāncalya_ (disturbance of mind) is a _bandhana_ (bondage) then ēkāgratā (concentration or focusing) also is a bandhana. When these are put an end to, then that is liberation.

This was the master stroke on which he discovered that speed and focusing are the two main tormenting aspects on the life of any person and the only way to get out of suffering is to practice naidhaanya and an attitude of anaasakti or let go. All his efforts of research for long periods to get a simple answer culminated in framing a theory of the energy shift mechanism to release the pressure of the so called boredom which he called as anaadyavidya. Also, by leaving the dependency on the agency that gave happiness or sorrow one can attain a steady state of mind which helps a saadhaka to pursue his goal to reach the Ultimate reality. He simplified the entire Vedanta in these simple saadhana tricks.

He never believed in taking lessons chapter wise in Yoga vasishta as he always said that it was a manana grantha( a treatise for rumination and deep introspection) and the saadhaka has to study carefully every sloka and ponder over it to get its deeper meaning and put the ideas into practice.

However due to insistence from a few close associates, he spoke on a few important chapters like, Lavanopaakhyaana, Bhshundopaakhyaana, Prahladopaakhayaana, Saptapadaam, and Saptabhumikaam which are mainly useful for saadhana. These have been incorporated in the book and classified into different chapters. An effort has been made as in his previous books to retain the originality of his talks with least editing. He was at his best when he spoke on Choodalopaakhyaanaa of Nirvana Prakarana which was very close to his heart and he excelled in his talks on the subject matter. Unfortunately there are no recordings of his talks on this subject since no recordings have been done at that time and no one has even taken the notes also. His mention about this aspect wherever he has touched upon has been included.

I am confident that the saadhaka will benefit from these lectures and put the ideas to use in his spiritual sadhana.

**A CURSORY GLANCE OF YŌGAVĀSIṢṬHA**

The treatise Yogavasishtha (Maharamayana) supposed to have been authored by Sage Valmiki is one of the comprehensive Vedanta text ideally suited for a seeker who is already on the path of spiritual pursuit. It is an anthology of 32000 slokas or 64000 lines of poetic grandeur unparallel in the literary world. The whole narration is in the form of a dialogue between sage Vasishta and Lord Sri Rama of the Ramayana fame. Although the whole text is narrated in the puranic style, the content is highly philosophical in nature directing one to the search of the ultimate truth and reality in this world.

The whole philosophy is explained by way of stories, stories within stories, to impress on the reader to validate the deeper significance of how a seeker (mumukshu) has to approach the problem confronting him.

Being too big a narrative, it is sometimes boring with jarring repetitions, it was thought fit by a Kashmir pundit Abhinanadana to bring out an abridged version called Laghu Yoga Vasishta containing about six thousand verses. The verses are however produced verbatim, deleting the lengthy digression which may not be relevant to the aspects of practice (sadhana). It has been translated into many languages. The wholly Sanskrit abridged work has been brought out by Motilal Banarsi das and co, edited by Vasudeva Sharma Panasikara.

The main theme of the book centers’ around the root cause of the removal of melancholy of Sri Rama when he returned from a pilgrimage disgusted and depressed showing no interest in any activity, his pains in his royal sojourn, and to bring him out of the strange depression which had overtaken him. On the advice of Sage Viswamitra, King Dasharatha arranged a dialogue between his son and sage Vasishta in the hall with numerous saints and intellectuals, being in attendance. Sage vasishta addresses all the doubts of Sri Rama, who raises some of the most fundamental questions regarding life and death and human existence itself. It has been rendered in plain simple poetic language for all to understand and to get immersed into the depths of the discussions.

The opening page of the book itself clarifies as to who is eligible to study the contents. It clearly states that the work is intended for the chosen few who have already had the needed spiritual development in the search for truth, capable of absorbing the salient facts explained in the narrative. It is written to benefit those who have become indifferent to this worldly life, and who are eager to pursue realization here and now.

It is not intended for those who are worldly minded, who are deep rooted in the world of pleasure and sorrow that originates thereof, and indifferent to spiritual truths. It is equally surprising to note that the author states that the book is also not for those who are well advanced toward discovering the Ultimate Reality.

The book is divided into six broad sections called prakaranas which are:-

1. Vairagya prakarana - Detachment or dispassion.

2. Mumukshu prakarana - Aspiration for liberation

3. Utpatti prakarana - Creation, origin or genisis

4. Stithi prakarana - Existance

5. Upashama prakarana – Quiescience or quietitude or a state of inactive restfulness.

6 Nirvana prakarana - Liberation

Each section establishes the truth through various stories and narrations of the deep truth of Vedanta, presented in such way for the easy grasp of the aspirant (mumukshu).

It is noteworthy here that this Bruhatgrantha has been translated into English by Shri Vihari Lal Mitra (1981) and edited by Thomas L Palotos (2013). I have taken some salient pointers from this book. Interested seeker is advised to refer to the original texts for better understanding.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Vairagya Prakarana -- On detachment</span>**

This book opens with a description of the mental state of Sri Rama on his return from the pilgrimage. King Dasharatha wants to ascertain, in the presence of Sages Vasishtha and Vishwamitra, the reason for his son’s melancholy and indifference to worldly affairs. Sri Rama raises some fundamental questions which have been haunting him resulting in his not getting the peace so badly needed. His words and attitude reveal the awakening of a burning detachment (vairaagya). He asks his Gurus to sort out his serious doubts about – “Who am I?. What is this play of the world: What is life and death? What is the genesis of the world? Etc.” Sage Vasishtha begins his teaching.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mumukshu Prakarana – An aspirant longing for liberation.</span>**

This section deals with the preparation required of a person both morally and mentally, the needed qualities which are essential to qualify him on the spiritual path to seek the Ultimate Reality.

Vasishtha outlines the four major sentinels that guard the gates to Moksha or liberation. They are: Peace of mind (Shaanti). Contentment (Trupti or Santosha). Keeping the company of realized sages (Satsanga). Inquiry into the nature of the Soul (Vichaara). These are important to overcome the main obstacle, that is, the belief that one is designed by fate and is severely condemned for life.

In order to attain the spiritual development and progress one need not shun action, but should learn to be indifferent to its fruits, without being affected by the pleasures or pains that are inevitable consequences of the actions one takes in one’s life. Such persons have to be always in the company of realized persons, particularly those who are endowed with Self Knowledge (Atma Vidya).

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Utpatti Prakarana - On Creation or Genesis.</span>**

This section deals with the origin and the nature of the universe. As per Vasishta, all the talk about creation, the universe with its innumerable objects, its concept of time and space and the varied laws for the same are only the creation of one’s own MIND. just as the mind creates the world in the dream phase, it also creates an imaginary world in the waking state, the only difference being that the world in the dream phase is very short and relatively long in the wakeful state. Time and Space are only ideas of the mind. Using for example, one’s mind, it is possible to condense many thousands of years of the world into a moment (Kshana) or a moment of time in the waking state may be expressed as years in the dream state. The same is true of the concept of Space. Number of interesting stories illustrate these points, such as astral travel, yogi pratyaksha, travelling backward and forward in time, etc.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stithi Prakarana - On Existance</span>**

This section discusses the place of an individual in the scheme of creation. Vasishta points out that this individual is none other than the ego sense or ‘I’ or ahankaara. This ‘I’ is the chief impediment to abiding with one’s True Self or Atmastithi. It is because of this, a human being fails to repeatedly recognize the true aspect of himself and suffers misery. Only when this identification with the ego is destroyed or dissolved through vichaara, the seeker attains the realization of the Atman or the supreme soul.

According to Vasishtha the body and the senses are inert. It is the chidabhaasa or the reflected light of the Atman that drives the senses to perform their respective functions. The objects perceived by the senses are not different from the Atman. Both the perceiver and the perceived object originate from the same Atman and therefore are the same. When a person gets a firm foothold on this truth, he or she realizes that nothing exists apart from his or her own self.

Thus the Atman becomes both the enjoyer and originator of this universe as well. When one is firmly established in this knowledge, he becomes free from the duality of sorrow or happiness. Chastity (brahmacharya), constant practice (abhyasa) and detachment (vairaagya) are the means of getting this knowledge which further leads one to remain in the abidance of the Atma sthithi.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Upashama Prakarana - On dissolution or becoming quiet.</span>**

This section gives instructions on the ways and means of attaining the goals for the firm abidance in the Atman. The false identification of the Atman with the body (dehaabhimaana) is the main obstacle in the realization of the self. This is the result of the ahankaara or ego sense.  Thus, this section gives practical guidance to the elimination of one’s identification of the ego and outlines a number of methods of yogic processes for the purpose. Enquiry into the true nature of the self is one such method. By this, one sees all creatures equally as different modifications of the same Brahman. He considers himself as pure consciousness (Chit) in all conditions of life and at all times and performs the duties allotted to him without any attachment or hatred. As a result of this, attachment drops by itself (asanga). All types of fear disappear and the person becomes qualified for attaining the samaadhi state.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Nirvana Prakarana - On liberation </span>**

This section explains that the Atman is the true form (swaroopa) of the individual being. A saadhaka has to give up all ideas of diversity and stop the movement of the mind. Once the mind becomes quiet, he remains absorbed in the Atman as a pure consciousness (chit). By this, as time elapses he or she perceives the identity of his or her own Atman with Brahman. Now the manifest universe looks like Brahman and no different from it like the subtle tree which is embedded in the seed, like the whole universe in the form of created and uncreated beings is seen as a subtle seed in such persons own heart. This section also includes the highly instructive teachings that Lord Brahma gave to sage Vasishta.

The book closes by the affirmation of Sri Rama declaring that all his doubts are cleared and he is convinced that there is nothing higher than the knowledge of the Self and the Spiritual Preceptor knowing that Self.

The Rishi Valmiki thus offers his salutations to That nature of Brahman or the supreme spirit which has been clearly emphasized in the Veda’s and Upanishads as, ‘all this universe is verily Brahman and from That all things originate, into That all things dissolve and by That they are sustained.

<strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p>


<p style="text-align: right">
<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong> </p>



Shastriji always used to tell his followers that, it was difficult for him to put into words whatever thought that flowed in his mind while going through Yōgavāsiṣṭha as every word or a phrase or a sloka would push him to non doing state. Due to repeated requests from his close associates, he agreed to speak on a few topics in Yōgavāsiṣṭha. The recorded talks which were highly disjointed have been put into a readable format after much deliberation. The reader is requested to keep this in mind and absorb the essence of teaching.

ŌGAVĀSIṢṬHA** (योगवासिष्ठ)** - IS AN EXTRAORDINARY text. It talks at high levels of spirituality. The very thought and study of the text puts me into a state of _samādhi_ (**समाधि, **bliss).** **How can I talk on the text and do justice to you. Normally, that is why I do not wish to talk on Yōgavāsiṣṭha. If one is having _pātrata_ (**पात्रत,** eligibility), then, this text will put him into that blissful state. If one has attained the right level of maturity and if the concepts are clear about his true Nature, here is a text, every word, every half śloka, puts him into that state of samādhi. That is why; the wise rightly call it a _manana-grantha_ (a reference book for repeated reflection). I thought I would write something, but I failed due to inability to concentrate on words. Ramakrishna refers to that State as an ocean of _amr̥ta_ (nectar), after dipping in it, you dissolve and you are gone. Where is the reporter? Even to report about that, you have to stand at the threshold – at the _sandhikāla_ (**संधिकाल**) - a bit of cognition, a bit of _tr̥upti_ (**तृप्ति**,** **satisfaction) and a feel of dissatisfaction, _a-tr̥upti_. Otherwise you cannot do anything at all. That is the beauty of the text. After the phase of _śravaṇa_ (**श्रवण, **listening to scriptures), where you intellectually know what you really are, go to Yōgavāsiṣṭha. You will be surprised to note that any sloka can push you to a state of non-doing. It is not superficial. Thoughts cannot shape themselves. How can you develop big arguments in support of your positions when you are in that non-doing state?

I will pick up some points from the text, without going in a methodical way, and try to place before you my feelings even though they are disjointed and broken. I would like to avoid as much as possible the story portion and the anecdotes. If we have to go in detail, it may take three to four years. We cannot afford to spend such a time, in this busy world. If we think of a concept of _vānaprastha_ (**वानप्रस्थ**, retirement) period, then such a thing is possible, since we can be in continuous _ātmaciṁtana_ (**आत्मचिंतन**,** **self introspection)** **phase without distractions. That is why much of Vedanta is one’s own study. There is nothing like spoon feeding. You can appreciate those states only when you touch them yourselves, in your experimentation. The prescription in Yōgavāsiṣṭha, is to ‘look inside”, that is all!

There is a very good mantra in Kathopanishad:

**पराञ्चिखानि व्यतृणत्स्वयंभूस्तस्मात्पराङ्पश्यतिनान्तरात्मन्।**

**कश्चित्धीरः प्रत्यगात्मानमैक्षत आवृत्तचक्षुः अमृतत्वमिच्छन्॥**

parāñci khāni vyatr̥ṇatsvayaṁbhūstasmāt

parāṅpaśyati nāntarātman

kaścit dhīraḥ pratyagātmānamaikṣata

āvr̥ttacakṣuḥ amr̥tatvamicchan.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Ka.Upa.2-4-1) [^1]

We are structurally looking outside. Man is so constructed that all his sense organs go outward. He goes out to see, to talk, and to enjoy. Naturally, therefore, he does not look inside at all. Once in a way in a century, a hero is born. What does he do? Directs the tool of investigation viz, intellect inside. Why does he look inside?

amr̥tatvamicchan – Prompted by the desire for immortality. Just to get to that state where the fear of death vanishes, he looks inside. Vedanta in short gives us a method of investigation to turn inside. Once you adopt that, you discover everything. You do not have to wait for the teacher. Under the revised resetting, the inward journey starts and you discover many regions, hitherto unknown, but revealed in the texts of Upanishads. It is seen clearly in the Bhr̥guvalli (**भृगुवल्लि**), of Taittariya Upanishad where the Rishi directs the student to study on his own. He suggests to do _ātmaparīkṣa_ (**आत्मपरीक्ष,** examination of oneself), to resolve fundamental questions. The teacher’s dictum was:

**तपसा ब्रह्म विजिज्ञासस्व। तपोब्रह्मेति।**

tapasā brahma vijijñāsasva. tapō brahmēti.

**vÀ¥À¸Á §æºÀä «feÁÕ¸À¸Àé. vÀ¥ÉÆÃ §æºÉäÃw. **

He does not give any more hints. Why this hardness on the part of the teacher? The answer is, that was the way – spoon feeding does not help. You may get some hints from Shankara and from Yōgavāsiṣṭha but much of the study has to be one’s own. How is it possible? It is to be borne in mind that you have to put questions to yourselves. What are the forces playing inside? How are they related? Which is the pre-state, which is the post state and then come to conclusion. Once we start seeing or searching ourselves inside, everything reveals itself.

Take the case of _prāṇa_ (**प्राण**, vital breath**)**. What is it? When you sit for meditation, you can see a movement inside which is an activity. This is _anubhava mātra gamyam_ – **अनुभवमात्रगम्यम्** - can be seen only through experience.

What is cognising? What is the process involved? It is possible when one manages to come to attention posture which is a prerequisite for cognition. It is not natural. Taking an example, let us say you meet a friend and he says that you did not wish him at all. The simple answer you give “I had been thinking elsewhere” That is to say, you have not focused or given attention to the friend. To cognise things, focusing or attention is a must. This is a necessary prerequisite to grasp a thing. It may be a picture or an idea or a concept etc. This is called point creation. This is a mechanism by which a point is created – _dēśasr̥ṣṭi _or _vastusr̥ṣṭi** – देशसृष्टि **_or **वस्तुसृष्टि**. A series of points created culminates in a picture. It may be a tree – a hundreds of point formation has given me a tree or a house or even a person. So every seeing is focusing in a particular way,”I” am a focusing person at that time of seeing. When we talk of _tripuṭi_ (**त्रिपुटि**,** **the triad) we consider three things - the knower, the knowing and the knowledge or the seer, seeing and the seen. The result of the process of knowing is the seen. The _citta_ (**चित्त**, the intellect), which is otherwise in the form of prāṇa or movement, comes to an attention position. So, Brahman is not unknown to you. Everybody is experiencing the state of Brahman every now and then without realizing it.

**कोह्येवान्यात् कः प्राण्यात् यदेष आकाश आनन्दो **

**न स्यात् एष हि एव आनन्दयति.**

kōhyēvānyāt kaḥ prāṇyāt yadēṣa ākāśa ānandō

na syāt ēṣa hi ēva ānandayati.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Tai.Upa.2-7-3) [^2]

If one did not touch this emptiness (non focussing version of oneself) now and then, how would have one survived. wonders the scripture. That means, one is not continuously focussing. Otherwise he would have gone mad with all problems and rushed to a doctor for sedation. This continuous focussing could have been a curse. I was a victim of this searching, attentive, focussing mind which had put me into a lot of problems. I was trying to indulge in things which were not in my domain at all. Although I was a professor of chemistry, I tried to be a carpenter, an engineer and a builder. Do you praise me for that or do you condemn that?

So, the broken happiness whatever we enjoy and use it as relaxation has saved us from the evils of society whereas it is the normal tendency to extol this focusing power in us. But as per Vedanta, it is a curse. You are extremely blisstful at the _samādhi_ level or the _svarūpa_ (**स्वरूप** – one’s true nature). You are expansive in that state. A _Jñāni_ (**ज्ञानि – **realised person) says that he does not exist. The person is so diffused, light and thin. He is just happiness. One respiration - to and fro motion - can take place in ten or fifteen minutes. Two cases of such Samādhi situation, we find in Yōgavāsiṣṭha. One is of Prahlada and the other is of Shikidwaja. So today every research is possible because you are compelled to come to focusing mood and explore the laws of the discipline you belong to. It may be engineering or medicine or physics or domestic science. This becomes a load on you if stretched too much.

I was explaining the way of understanding _tripuṭi_. _Tripuṭi_ is focusing. One of the definitions of Brahman or Self as per Upanishads is _Cit_ or as per Yōgavāsiṣṭha is **संवित् - _saṁvit:_**



* Self, therefore, is also just the mere knowing power. Prior to knowing, whatever we are is the Svarūpa. Jñāna is the mere knowing state.
* By degenerative process, the knowing becomes the known. That is, _Jñāna_ which is mere knowing becomes _jñēya_ – **ज्ञेय, **the known.
* This is also termed as _cit_ (**चित्**) and _cētya_ (**चेत्य**) – <sub><em>saṁvit</em> <strong>(संवित्) </strong>and <em>saṁvedya</em> <strong>(संवेद्य) </strong>as in </sub>Yōgavāsiṣṭha. _Cit_, which is just the knowing, has become _Cētya_, the known by the degenerative process of focussing into creation. This is how we cognize the world. After position of this focussing is _vastu_ (**वस्तु – **a thing, an object, a thought, etc.)
* The in-between process or stage of _Cit_ and _Cētya_ is beautifully recognized by Yōgavāsiṣṭha as _cētyōnmukhata_ – **चेत्योन्मुखत **or vēdyōnmukhata / _vēdanōnmukhata_ - **वेद्योन्मुखत / वेदनोन्मुखत **– is knowing which is, in the process of becoming known. That is Knowing is in the process of cognition or crystallisation of thought. The result is, you have pictures and sounds and the movements of different intensities. We call it by _nāma, rūpa, karma_ – **नाम, रूप, कर्म **- name, form, activity.

In most of us the ‘I’ is in the process of cognition or crystallization. If _Cētya_ or cognition has not set in, then whatever you are is the ‘I’ portion. Being in the attentive phase is the ’I’. If you are in that cognizing mood without taking the details of the Jagat, you are in the ‘I’ state. So this I is the creating principle and its creation is the world of objects like pictures, sounds, thoughts, etc. Why not call this as ultimate ‘I’? What is wrong with this ‘I’? This ‘I’ in the attention mood without the resultant formation of object, _dēśasr̥ṣṭi_ or _vastusr̥ṣṭi,** देशसृष्टि **_or **वस्तुसृष्टि,** is a burdensome state.

So, for two reasons, it is a suffering ‘I’ and nobody would like it. It is a labouring ‘I’. ‘I’ is in the _duḥkhasthāna_ (**दुःखस्थान **–** **suffering phase). One aspect of duḥkha is Focusing and the other is the Speed with which you go to that focussing phase. By knowing the fact that, this state which puts you in burden in a short time, cannot be the true ‘I’. More often you say that by too much of thinking, you become tired – focusing tires you. This knowledge itself will reset your values. From that day, you decide to become a different person because you have clarity about yourself on the question of details. This is the usefulness of the study.

What is the alternative? What is the way out for this problem that the system knows? The system has a protective mechanism as it were. There is a safety valve mechanism. Even in the wakeful state, we come to a “LET GO” state touching Brahman. The way of knowingly becoming irresponsible is permissible. This is called conscious irresponsibility. Unknowingly becoming irresponsible is _tamas_ – **तमस्** - ignorance. State of sleep is a safety valve mechanism. From your state of pointedness you have shifted into the state of _satwa_ – **सत्व** – calm or serene. The self expansion has started. Pointedness is a state of burden. LET GO is the opposite state.

Everyone has an element of Brahman in him. Scriptures always remind us that we have another way of living. When the quality or characteristics of sleep is consciously maintained, then, one becomes Brahman. Meditation is a program of conscious expansion. The point of importance in meditation is not to notice anything either inside or outside. In Bhūmāvidya of Chandyogya Upanishad (7-24), it is clearly indicated that:

**यत्र नान्यत्पश्यति नान्यच्छृणोति **

**नान्यद्विजानाति स भूमा**

yatra nānyatpaśyati nānyacchr̥ṇōti

nānyadvijānāti sa bhūmā [^3].

_Bhūmā_ is _vyāpakatwa_ (**व्यापकत्व – **expansiveness where you do not see any other thing, don’t listen to another thing, do not think of another thing. Shankara is extraordinary in commenting on this. He raises a doubt as to whether from the above definition one can infer that in the state of Bhūmā or spread state, one is seeing oneself? When the recommendation is not to see any thing, does it mean that one needs to see oneself? Shankara says ‘NO’. All the time, you were struggling outside, now you are struggling inside trying to know. This knowing phase itself is burden. Then what is the meaning of the above?

**यत्र दर्शनक्रिया न संभवति यत्र श्रवण क्रिया **

**वेदनक्रिया न संभवति ....**

yatra darśanakriyā na saṁbhavati yatra śravaṇakriyā vēdanakriyā na saṁbhavati....<sup> </sup>[^4]

Where listening, seeing, sensing, etc does not happen – that is the state in which you are peaceful or joyful with bhoga or without bhoga. Shankara simplifies Vedanta as under. If you are a serious student and desire to come out of suffering, do a bit of study,

**तस्या अविद्यायाः किं स्वाभाविकत्वं **

**आहोस्वित् कामकर्मादिवत् आगन्तुकत्वम् **

**यदि च आगन्तुकत्वम् ततो विमोक्ष उपपद्यते। **

**तस्याश्च आगन्तुकत्वे कोपपत्तिः.**

tasyā avidyāyāḥ kiṁ svābhāvikatvaṁ

āhōsvit kāmakarmādivat āgantukatvam?

yadi ca āgantukatvam tatō vimōkṣa upapadyatē.

tasyāśca āgantukatvē kōpapattiḥ?

<p style="text-align: right">
(Bru.Upa.4-3-20) [^5]



* Whether the toiling phase of knowing, doing and enjoying, is it your true nature or borrowed nature?
* If it is true nature, nothing can help you to get rid of that.
* If it is of the nature of coming and going, then it is droppable.
* Are focusing and speed our natural states or borrowed states?

**Āgantuka **dharma is the acquired trait and as such one can drop it. **Svabhāva **dharma is one’s natural trait and thus cannot be dropped. So there is no prospect of riddance or moksha from such natural traits. If one is able to understand this aspect, how can one suffer? This is a very small but an important examination that can lead one to come out of sorrow. This is an excellent tool to set right one’s values.If one can do the focusing slowly, then it is not a burden. So one can adopt this method and still be in the happy state. Vedanta is so liberal and does not impose restrictions. Rama and Krishna never got excited under any circumstances. Rama is called **मर्यादापुरुष **– _maryādā-puruṣa_, a very highly balanced person. Listen to Krishna in Bhagavadgīta and do not imitate him, but follow Him. This shows that a jnani can also become angry, but that anger is only to help the mankind. As soon as the purpose is served, then there is no anger at all. He does not bring it to memory again. In two seconds the built up anger is dissolved never to return again. This is called: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The capacity to release and withdraw at will</span>.

**प्रयोग उपसंहार सामर्थ्य.**

**¥ÀæAiÉÆÃUÀ G¥À¸ÀAºÁgÀ ¸ÁªÀÄxÀåð<sub>.</sub>**

Rama asks the question to Vasishta: (YV 4-4-32)[^6]

**अनन्तस्य अप्रमेयस्य सर्वस्य एकस्य भास्वतः,**

**अनस्तमितसारस्य कलना कथमागता.**

anantasya apramēyasya.sarvasya ēkasya bhāsvataḥ,

anastamitasārasya kalanā kathamāgatā.

(How has the infinite and incomprehensible effulgent Consciousness that does not eclipse, come to be endowed with world conception?)

Why did Brahman, who is infinite, all pervading, immeasurable, unblemished, become this poor helpless and suffering person and got terribly caught in the worldly life. Why did Brahman create individual souls – **जीवत्व**, _jīvatva, _who is always of complaining nature? Vasistha says:

**कुतो जाता अयं इति ते राम मास्तु विचारणा,**

** इमां कथमहं हन्मित्येषा ते अस्तु विचारणा. **

kutō jātā ayaṁ iti tē rāma māstu vicāraṇā,

imāṁ kathamahaṁ hanmityēṣā tē astu vicāraṇā.

<p style="text-align: right">
(YV 4-4-42[^7])

(O Rama, do not enquire how has this avidya come into existence. Do only the enquiry as to how you will conquer this.)

It is surprising that Vasishta says - kutō jātā ayaṁ iti tē rāma māstu vicāraṇā - Do not put this question as to why this creation has come about? Do not ask this question as nobody has given any answer to this question. It is a wasteful question as per Vasistha. It is better to put a purposeful question. Any amount of argument cannot satisfy the answer to such a question. Any amount of explanation about creation does not benefit anyone. **You should always put a question as to how to come out of this maaya or suffering**. Let that be your question.

Shankara gives his own **अध्यासवाद **- _adhyāsavāda_, which is not convincing to me. Govindapada gives his **अजातिवाद **-_ajātivāda_, which looks more ambiguous as he says world has not come into existance at all and so there can be no question of arguments? This argument shows that one is running away from the problem as we know well that we are all suffering.

You employ the **विज्ञानकोश**- _vijñānakōśa_, the intellectual sheath, to solve your problem. You will only realise that this kosha itself is the obstacle to the final goal. A simple example given in olden days was of removing a thorn by using another thorn. You not only throw the injury causing thorn, but you throw the other thorn which removed this thorn. So you drop the problem and also the problem solving mind, that is the intellect and drop that investigating mind or **बुद्धिकोश **– _buddhikōśa_. Look at this mantra from Mahabharata”s Mokshadharma Parva.

**त्यज धर्ममधर्मंच उभे सत्यानृते त्यज,**

**उभे सत्यानृते त्यक्त्वा येन त्यजसि तत्त्यज.**

<p style="text-align: right">
(329-40)[^8]

tyaja dharmamadharmaṁca ubhē satyānr̥tē tyaja

ubhē satyānr̥tē tyaktvā yēna tyajasi tattyaja.

**Yēna tyajasi tattyaja **- the best tool of investigation with which you remove all your problems will not be valuable to you in the end after reaching the goal and thus ultimately discard the tool itself. Vijñānakōśa gives you insight into the problem and is also a problem by itself. In the evolution level, animal instincts, animal ways of life have to be given up to embrace dharma which is the organised way. This is what karmakaanda tells us. Have limitation in everything. So from a-dharma you come to dharma. But that also becomes a burden. So any focusing is a burden. So drop that kosha also. There is nothing like an anxiety for good thing or a bad thing. So dharma also becomes a burden. So if you have to achieve the ultimate, you have to drop dharma also. Dharma, however soft an activity, becomes a burden when you are too careful and keen to maintain that. So a point comes when you have to relax. This is the only extra insight that is got by studying Vedanta and the Hindu way if life.

Here is a religion that has the courage to say one has to give up dharma also in order to realize a higher truth, since it also becomes a burden. There is no end to good activity. This good activity itself becomes a problem. In Yoga- vasishtha also, such thought is reflected:

**बंधो हि वासना बंधो मोक्षः स्यात् वासनाक्षयः,**

**वासनां त्वं परित्य्ज्य मोक्षार्थित्वमपि त्यज.**

baṁdhō hi vāsanā baṁdhō mōkṣaḥ syāt vāsanākṣayaḥ,

vāsanāṁ tvaṁ parityjya mōkṣārthitvamapi tyaja.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Y.V.4-5-20) [^9]

(Bondage is really the subjugation caused by the vāsanas, embedded longing or craving. Liberation is annihilator of vāsanas. Drop all vāsanas and also the desire for liberation)

Suppose tyaaga (renunciation) and daana (charity) also prick you to an extent that it becomes very difficult for you to even stick to dharma. At this point, you must put the the basic question to yourself – what is meant by helping people? What is enjoyment? What is selflessness? You should question the relevance of dharma itself.

That was the problem with Arjuna. That was the problem with Nachiketa. That is how Vedanta has come to light. That was the problem with Sri Rama. He started denying bhoga (enjoyment) for himself because everything became stale. He withdrew himself into a shell and became downcast and turned a patient. He got into a spiritual melancholy (depression). This will be the suffering of a noble soul, when all the bhoga becomes stale.

Sukha or happiness is not dependent on the object that one gives into. No man can be happy unless he controls the forces that are pushing him to the extreme. If the system suffers, nobody can help unless the person concerned realises that he has to be alert. If one doesn’t know this truth, he will be struggling at the dharma level itself.

I am not saying that you should stop karma. Karma is essential for one to perform in this world. Vedanta should not be followed verbatim. Just as one is careful about possessing money, a saadhaka should be careful about every single step he takes. The ultimate goal is not to lose sight of the happiness that one has to retain all through the work that one performs and not slip into suffering due to extra performance. If you have values for mundane things, do not spoil them prematurely. Feed them with this attitude. Be very comfortable and keep on doing things until your responsibilities are finished or till you are tired. In the enthusiasm for getting blissful states, do not stop your responsibilities. When the call for ēkānta (**एकान्त – **seclusion**) **becomes too high and when there is a strong urge for liberation, then you may give up the functions which come in the way of your performance. If it drops by itself, then it is well and good. Do not stop it by force. Vedanta says repeatedly:

**न बलात् न हठात्** - na balāt na haṭhāt.

**£À §¯Ávï £À ºÀoÁvï**.

You have to adjudge yourself. A teacher shows the way and you have to walk depending on the level of your attainments.

Ramana stole money meant for school fees and got his head shaved and threw away the remaining money and walked away. That was the pull which dragged him. Everyone cannot be that way. We cannot imitate him. We can be happy knowing fully well how to correct our errors. We have to adopt the avenues like jñānamārga, karmamaarga and most important the shubhakarma maarga and continue sadhana.

<strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p>


<p style="text-align: right">
<strong>THE INWARD JOURNEY</strong></p>


I

HAVE DRAWN LESSONS FROM YŌGAVĀSIṢṬHA. Whatever is detailed out in the Upanishads is repeated here, as you must have seen by now. It is not possible for me to see anything other than what is in Upanishads. There is a huge repetition. Every second line in Yōgavāsiṣṭha talks about cetya versus cit. Any chapter, any sloka you see it is:

**चेत्योनुसंधान रहितम् चिन्मात्रम् **

cētyōnusaṁdhāna rahitam cinmātram.

**चेत्यानुपात रहितम् चिन्मात्रम्**

cētyānupāta rahitam cinmātram.[^10]

Cit which is the knowing power has not objectified itself, or crystalised itself into a thought is cinmātram. This is the entire message of Yōgavāsiṣṭha. You cannot blame me for that! In fact, I should take tremendous credit for the fact that nobody would condense Vedanta as I have done. I take pride in that. Nobody can put it in the form of a pill and show you that Vedanta is a ten minutes study. This was my ten years of research. The simplest truth is always most profound. It is possible to answer any question from a pandit’s point of view with success and efficacy. If you are a serious reader of Yōgavāsiṣṭha, any sloka you read and give a thought to it, you become cit and go to a near Samadhi state. That is where, the text is useful. You have to be totally convinced about this great reversible reaction that a move in the forward direction is duhkha, unhappiness and a move in the reverse way is liberation. Once you are convinced, then this will be useful for manana. You know the three steps in Vedanta – **श्रवण, मनन निदिध्यासन **- śravaṇa, manana, nididhyāsana.

**आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः श्रोतव्यः मन्तव्यः निदिध्यासितव्यः**

ātmā vā arē draṣṭavyaḥ śrōtavyaḥ mantavyaḥ nididhyāsitavyaḥ

<p style="text-align: right">
(Bru.Upa.2-4-5)[^11]

Atma has to be first understood. That is the phase of discussion with the teacher. This is called śravaṇa.The next is tatwa grahana - the portions of the Vedanta has to be understood. Even after that, the mind falters. Then you have to get the mind back to an ascent – a fall, an ascent – a fall, an ascent to vistaarata or expansive state and again a fall due to conditioning or vaasana, happens. It goes on like that for a long time. You reach a stage when you say that you don’t have to invite a thought at all. Then also you may fall because of your conditioning. The student is so highly evolved by then, that karma itself becomes a problem. He spends more time unburdening himself. As long as chittashuddhi, cleansing of mind, is happening, and as long as it is not a burden for you it is good to be in karma. You are engaged yourself in _sātvik_ (**सात्विक् **– virtuous) activity called shubha karma or shuddha karma. At one point even this also becomes absurd. As far as me, I had to do manana with Yōgavāsiṣṭha for months and years, till I got established in silence.

Most of the time, we are in the stage of focusing. As a result of this, the jagat, the world, is revealed to us as an outside world and dream state as an inside world. Outside world is cognition or perception of external objects. Inside world is perceived or created in your dream. It is not possible for us to alter the outside world by our volition. This is a world which is independent of my conceiving it. It exists independently. It is not my creation. Whereas, the world inside, is my creation. I can create whatever I want. I am conceiving a world inside whereas I am cognising a world outside. It is important to note this difference.

When we discuss creation, the dream aspect is very important as it gives enormous hints as to how we have come into being. Here is a clue. The importance of _svapna parīkṣa_ (**स्वप्न परीक्ष** – examination of dream state) is to show that a world can be created by your own ‘I’ which conceived it. What is that ‘I’ which created so many things like a house, a plant or even for that matter a duplicate wife of yours, even though in reality you have already a wife in wakeful state? It is the first wife with a second picture. What stuff created that? This is a question in Vedanta and also in theoretical physics. What is the dream world or a world of imagination made up of? What is the status of this world compared with the world in wakeful phase? How do they differ?

We say, my mind created this inside world. There is nothing like mind. There is ‘me’. There is just nothingness, or there is just a somethingness - Somethingness without any attribute or characteristic or any lakshana whatsoever. It is mere-ness. And that creates a tree, a building, a road, Amount of possibilities are infinite. _Nāma, Rūpa, Karma_ **(नाम, रूप कर्म**) are the attributes of the world we cognise.



* Nāma, is the _śabda_ (**शब्द**) the sound version – He is Shastri.
* Rūpa, which is the _dr̥śya_ (**दृश्य**) or the picture version of the world – Shastri is tall and fair.
* And Karma, is the movement or activity – Shastri walks very briskly.

These three lakshanas completely define jagat. One is able to do all the three things, when one closes his eyes. One can duplicate anything. What is the material out of which all this is created?

**अत्र देवः स्व महिमानम् अनुभवति.**

atra dēvaḥ sva mahimānam anubhavati.

**CvÀæ zÉÃªÀB ¸Àé ªÀÄ»ªÀiÁ£ÀªÀiï C£ÀÄ¨sÀªÀw.**

<sub>That power in you clearly shows that you are the creator. The sacred stuff you are, you can create! This is the support for Advaita Vedanta. You are creating this complicated jagat with all its intricacies.</sub>

What are we inside? We are _cinmātra_ (**चिन्मात्र**). Cit can project a universe. Cit which is the predisposition or the pre stuff becomes Cētya, the world of objects, thoughts, etc through the process of Cetyonmukhata. What is it made up of at the ultimate state? We have to infer this by only argument - _nēti nēti_ - **नेति नेति** - not this, not this etc. Otherwise, how can nothingness produce something? Therefore, by inference you say that, there is some _sattā_ (**सत्ता**). Sattaa is our svaroopa. When objects, sounds and details are withdrawn, whatever remains is called svaroopa sattaa. Any picture is a collection of points of infinite nature. This is the process by which a picture is created. Cit or Samvit will shrink itself into a point. It localises into a point. Hundreds of such points placed in orderly position, gives you a picture of a river, a house, a tree etc. So this sattaa is the predisposition. This is about creation. But this is a burden. Chandogya Upanishad clarifies that:

**नाल्पेसुखमस्ति भूमैव सुखं.**

nālpēsukhamasti bhūmaiva sukhaṁ.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Cha.upa.7-23)[^12]

How so ever comfortable you think it is, this alpatwa or becoming small is the burden, So, capturing details in closeness is a burden which is called alpatva sveekaara in shastra. So a stretched state or a spread state is aananda or happiness. What is me? Sometimes I will be in confined state and some other time I will be in a spread state. But, I will be complaining about the confined state. The remedy is simple. Get back to spread state or a state of vistaarata where speed and focusing are replaced by naidhaanya and expansion. That is, from burdened state or sankochata to unburdened state or vistaarata. From localizing to vistaarata by let go - Retrace from Cetya to Cit or from Samvedya to Samvit. Is this not the ultimate state? Is this not the Brahmic state? Why did we not stop at this?

At this point, Vasishta comes to help. The withdrawing is not just taking one step backwards. As discussed earlier Cētyōnmukhata or _Vēdanōnmukhata_ (**वेदनोन्मुखत**) is the process of Cit shaping into a thought. The pre state of thought formation is Cit or Samvit. In Vedanta this is Jneya and Jnaana. And as per Vedanta our svaroopa is jnaana maatra and the study stops here. But, there are stages and stages of undoing or unlocking of the forces inside. Most of the people stop at samvit. This samvit is only one phase of retracing. Further up in the ladder of nothingness is Sattaa, sattaa saamaanya (**सत्ता सामान्य)** is the next phase and if you go still further, it is immeasurable state called sattaa saamaanya kōti (**सत्ता सामान्य कोटि). **This is the subdivision and penetration of Yōgavāsiṣṭha.

**Samvedya gets purified into samvit - then to sattaa - then to sattaa-samanya - ultimately to sattaa-saamaanya koti.**

The shell can diffuse itself into immeasurable extent. But, how long this expansion needs to take place? It is to be noted here that:



* Samvit state itself is a very comfortable state. The objects are not there. One is just mere consciousness. So much of tension and toil is reduced. But, the samvit states of two persons may be quite different as there are still two locus points. The shell has not become all pervasive.
* Though the next stage Satta is further extension of expansion, merging has not happened. For example, Shastri’s sattaa and Ashok’s satta may be very much expansive but the two have not unified.
* In satta saamaanya, Shaastri merges into Ashoka. Both of them lose their respective locus. Ashok’s experience would be that he is in Shastri’s chitta and vice versa. This is the next layer.
* Satta samanya koti is a terrible increase of this expansion to limitless state grasping the whole universe.

The highest stage of liberation being satta saamaanaya Koti is described as under.

**तत्र सत्ता लयम् याति निर्विकारं च तिष्ठति**

**भूयो नावर्तते दुःखं तत्र लब्धपदः पुनः **

tatra sattā layam yāti nirvikāraṁ ca tiṣṭhati

bhūyō nāvartatē duḥkhaṁ tatra labdhapadaḥ punaḥ

<p style="text-align: right">
(Y.V.5-10-95,96)<sup> </sup>[^13]

(In that plane, existent matter gets dissolved and there is no trace of distinction. The person attaining that state is not born again in the world of sorrow.)

**तद्धेतुः सर्वहेतूनाम् तस्य हेतुर्न विद्यते**

**स सारः सर्व साराणाम् तस्मात् सारो न विद्यते.**

taddhētuḥ sarvahētūnām tasya hēturna vidyatē

sa sāraḥ sarva sārāṇām tasmāt sārō na vidyatē**.**[^14]

(That state of bare existence is the cause of all causes and that itself has no cause. That is the essence of all existence and there is no essence apart from it.)

That is Brahman’s region of non doing or Eshara’s region of non doing. It is a region of non objectification. It is the existence or distinctness of the highest order. What burden can one have in that state? So happiness does not lie in attention. Often one gets into non-focusing or non-doing mood on a number of occasions during our daytime. See for example, travel to the office, viewing TV, etc, as sources of saadhana by involving as much less as possible in the activity. Vedanta thus. is an experimental science. It does not brow beat you.

**दृश्यदर्शनसम्बन्धे सुखसंविदनुत्तमा।**

**दृश्य संवलिता बन्धस्तन्मुक्ता मुक्तिरुच्यते.**

dr̥śyadarśanasambandhē sukhasaṁvidanuttamā

dr̥śya saṁvalitā bandhastanmuktā muktirucyatē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Y.V.5-9-43)<sup> </sup>[^15]

(The bliss that manifests at the contact of sense and the object, if associated with the objects is of the nature of bondage and if dissociated with the objects is liberation)

When you establish a contact with the object of enjoyment and the relevant sense organ whatever happy state you get is sacred. If you always depend on the objects for happiness, then it is bandhana. A saadhaka tries to catch hold of the no mind state created due to energy shift mechanism by the sense object and tries to stay as long as possible. And if you manage to stay happy without dependence on sense objects then it is mukti. You will be cinmaatra. You will be in Samvit.

Drushya –for example let us have a laddoo as the sense object here. Darshana is the tongue – sambandhe – when laddoo comes in contact with tongue being the relevant sense organs, you are very happy. That is the experience of joy. Whatever happy state that is got is sacred – sukha samvit annuttamam. But, if you depend on the laddoo, to get to that state and for maintaining that state, every time, then it is bandhana, a problem. What a saadhaka has to do now? Having got that state of samvit (there is no wandering and focusing). he has to observe that and stay there. Laddoo can wait. Then that is mukti or liberation.This is all the difference between mukti and bandhana. Yōgavāsiṣṭha takes a cue from Upanishads and deals in four stanzas. Tai.Upa.S-B-197)[^16]

**लौकिकोपि आनन्दो ब्रह्मानन्दस्यैव मात्रा.**

laukikōpi ānandō brahmānandasyaiva mātrā.

Shankara in his bhaashya declares that the worldly or mundane happiness or ananda is Brahamanda only. Television viewing is Drushya drashana which is what I always do, without giving any importance to what is going on, no involving with it. It is only giving a neutral activity to the eye. If you are watching closely, the television scenes disturb you. If your watching is casual, it becomes a trick to draw your inner forces for expenditure, using shabda and drushya which are both there when you use television. As a result the inside becomes expansive and you are in swaroopa.



* Bhoga carefully employed can put you into swaroopa.
* If rashly employed, it becomes a spoiler. The thirst increases in such a case.

**दृश्यदर्शनसंबन्धे यानुभूतिरनामया**

**तामवष्टभ्य तिष्ठ त्वं सौषुप्तीं भज ते स्थितिम्. **

dr̥śyadarśanasaṁbandhē yānubhūtiranāmayā

tāmavaṣṭabhya tiṣṭha tvaṁ sauṣuptīṁ bhaja tē sthitim.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Y.V.5-9-44)[^17]

(Hold on to the pure experience that manifests at the contact of the sense and the object and remain in that sleep-like state.)

sauṣuptīṁ bhaja tē sthitim- This is your nidra equivalent state, where there is no world for you, but wakeful state of course.

tāmavaṣṭabhya tiṣṭha tvaṁ– after getting that state, hold on to that state and do not let it go. Drop the agency and live there. That is your Samvit state or pre focusing state. Therefore sitting before the TV can be a saadhana. Noise is a welcome thing, as expenditure of energy is taking place through the ears. You have both the loukika(mundane) ananda and also brahmananda. One needs to be careful that the dependence on bhogavastu needs to be reduced. It should be well within the bhoga limits permitted by dharma. Shankara goes to a further extent –

**अनेन हि प्रसिद्धेन आनन्देन व्यावृत्तविषयबुद्धिगम्य**

**आनन्दो अनुगन्तुं शक्यते.**

anēna hi prasiddhēna ānandēna vyāvr̥tta viṣaya buddhi gamya ānandō anugantuṁ śakyatē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Tai.Upa.SB-197)<sup> </sup>[^18]

vyāvr̥tta viṣaya buddhi gamya ānandō anugantuṁ śakyatē Through this familiar aananda, minus the bhoga agent, you feel the experience and hold on to that state. You are softer, you are carefree and then you exist also.

**एतस्यैव आनन्दस्य अन्यानि भूतानि मात्रां उपजीवन्ति. **

ētasyaiva ānandasya anyāni bhūtāni mātrāmupajīvanti.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Bru.Upa.4-3-32)[^19]

This is from Bruhadaraanyaka Upanishad and Shankara quotes it in support of his argument. By means of this worldly aananda, anybody in this world, the good, the bad – Tom, Dick and Harry – touches that moment of expansive state, his svaroopa. This is to show how Yōgavāsiṣṭha helps us to go deep into that state. There can be layers and layers of expansion or stages of expansion. Scientifically putting, the force of burden on an expanded shell is reduced; force on the unit area of the shell is terribly reduced. As already discussed our shell needs to expand from satta to sattaa saamaanya amd then to sattaa saamaanya koti. In Vedanta also there are levels of retracing from that of Buddhi to Mahat-tatva and to Avyaakruta and finally to Purusha.

What is the difference between Nidra and Samaadhi? For many years this question was haunting me. I asked many Sadhus and pundits about the difference between Nidra and Samaadhi. No one was able to give me a satisfactory answer. I had to get to the correct answer and Shnkara only could come to my rescue.

In Nidra, vyaapaara or activity has not gone. Specific vyaapaara like talking, seeing etc. only has gone. Indriya vyaaparaas are eliminated. But the general vyapara called kriya saamaanya is there. Vyapara has specific dimensions. General vyaapaara is mere movement. That movement appearing in the form of drushya (when the vyapara takes place to the eye) or shabda or ghraana (smell) or rasaa (taste).Specialised vyaapaara merging in general vyaapaara is the shift from the wakeful phase to the nidra phase. Vyapara has not gone. The sthula has become sukshma or subtle. The visible has become invisible. Vidita has become avidita. Kshara has become akshara.

Look at the mantra recognising this. I concluded that we are in the praana maatra swaroopa. Further study showed me evidences from Upanishads and from Shankara bhaashya. Each one of us has to do research at our own level and for verification we should go to Upanishad. Look at how Chandogya Upanishad (4-3-3) puts it.

**स यदा स्वपिति . . प्राणो हि एव एनं सर्वान् संवृङ्क्ते** [^20]

sa yadā svapiti . . prāṇō hi ēva ēnaṁ

sarvān saṁvr̥ṅktē.

sa yadaa swapiti- when man is asleep, what is happening to all the specific activities or visesha vyaapaaras?

Vaak pranam apyeti – the activity of talk has become mere spandana.

Shrotram pranan, Chakshuh pranan - the seeing and hearing activities have become praana swaroopa.

Manah praanam iti – the thinking activity has become mere praanic spandana. All specific acitvity have become general activity or praanic vyaapaara. What a beautiful scientific study!

prāṇō hi ēva ēnaṁ sarvān saṁvr̥ṅktē - This general vyaapaara, meaning prana spandana, has absorbed all the special vyaapaaras into its womb. You are seeing; let us say a table or a book. What are you there? Your चैतन्य, _caitanya_ is vibrating in the form of a table or a book and your consciousness is reporting it. Pre position of this is pure consciousness where there is no action of reporting. But when an action takes place, consciousness degenerates into the form of a table or a book.Where there is no object formation or sound formation, it is pure consciousness or your svarupa.

You now know what your pure consciousness is. Without shaping into a shabda form or a roopa form, you are in your swaroopa at this point of space. If you just do the anusandhaana or contemplate on that, you get a feel of that empty state of yours. That is why sadhakaas are asked to go near a sea, where there are no objects. You sit before the sea and your emptiness is visible to you. The emptiness gets emphasied. It gets predominant, as you are in pure consciousness there. If your culturing is good enough, avoid pictures and sounds at that place. Then you are jnaana swaroopa or aatma swaroopa only.

By what symptoms a person can say he is growing in sadhana?

**एतावदेव खलु लिङ्गमलिङ्गमूर्तेः,**

**संशान्त संसृति चिरभ्रम निवृतस्य,**

**तज्ञस्य यन्मदन कोप विषाद मोह,**

**लोभापदां अनुदिनं निपुणं तनुत्वम्. **

ētāvadēva khalu liṅgamaliṅgamūrtēḥ

saṁśānta saṁsr̥ti cirabhrama nivr̥tasya

tajñasya yanmadana kōpa viṣāda mōha

lōbhāpadāṁ anudinaṁ nipuṇaṁ tanutvam.

<p style="text-align: right">
(YV-6-14-6)[^21]

This is a permitted question in Vedanta. To this, the answer is - following are the symptoms. Jnaani has no lakshanaas or attributes what so ever. It is very difficult to label a jnani symptomatically. He is just like any other person when one looks at him. But then, in him, madana (sex), kopa (anger), vishaada (depression), Moha (confusion), lobha (greed), etc, aapadaam, these evil forces are thinning out every day. It is not a sudden change. It is a progressive ascent every day. In critical situations and reacting situations, a Jnaani remains utterly calm and balanced. He does not react. That is the growth one has to undergo in saadhana. This is the test, both for you and for others.

Time is not heavy. It is fine. But, gentle pressures may be there. If the pressure increases, adopt the energy expenditure method of shubha karma. Keep doing any saatvik activity like reading Bhagavad Gita or any other neutral activity. Since chitta is not excited in the process, your “self’ is revealed. Your mind slows down and you expand. Aananda increases. All the duhkha versions are getting purified, becoming thin. Thinning process of all the unruly forces is taking place. He is so soft and not aggressive, not harsh. Even in unreasonable circumstances, he does not react. How much one grows depends upon the intensity of application of these markers for that individual. That also depends upon the stock of vaasanaas he has. Too much of sensitivity of a person also can delay the result of getting clarity in thinking itself. The sloka of Bhagavad Geeta reminds us the same. (B.G.5-18)[^22]

**विद्या विनय संपन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि,**

**शुनि च एव श्वपाकेच पण्डिताः समदर्शिनः.**

vidyā vinaya saṁpannē brāhmaṇē gavi hastini

śuni ca ēva śvapākēca paṇḍitāḥ samadarśinaḥ.

A jnani treats on par a Brahmana endowed with knowledge and humility, a cow, an elephant, a dog and an outcaste who feeds on dog’s flesh.

Even with mean, cheap annoyance from people, a pandita does not get upset at all. He is equal with everybody. Taking a cue from these, a saadhaka has to identify his shortcomings as and when they arise and try to diffuse the same to the best of his ability. Look at Yōgavāsiṣṭha again:

**अनास्थैव हि निर्वाणम् दुःखमास्था परिग्रहः**

**अनेनैव प्रयत्नेन ब्रह्म सम्पद्यते क्षणात्. **

anāsthaiva hi nirvāṇam duḥkhamāsthā parigrahaḥ

anēnaiva prayatnēna brahma sampadyatē kṣaṇāt.

<p style="text-align: right">
(YV-3-9-39)[^23]

(Absence of craving for pleasure is the state of liberation. Craving is fraught with misery. Through this practice, Brahman is realized immediately)

It is the focused state in one, that generates duhka or is responsible for duhkha. When you try to defocus by ‘Let Go’ or by adopting **उदासीनभाव** – _udāsīnabhāva_ - casual approach, then, there is liberation. Coming to the attention phase is always a burden. Interest in objects amounts to focusing. The otherwise of that by, letting go or by disinterested approach (**अनासक्ति** - anāsakti), by showing indifference, leads to liberation from suffering. Not having anxiety and not interested in the result, is diffusion.

Surrendering to the Almighty (who so ever be your God you think), also is a method by which you can diffuse. At one stroke, the ego is destroyed. You can use both the tools to get to your goal. God is not doing a favour, but the trick is, you get into a mood of letting go of things.

CHAPTER THREE</p>


<p style="text-align: right">
<strong>LAVAṆŌPĀKHYĀNAM</strong></p>


After dealing on the aspect of attaining a state of vairagya Yōgavāsiṣṭha opens with the idea of the importance of sravana and manana and goes on to describe the aspect of creation. Sage Vasishta however asserts that a true saadhaka has to concentrate more on the ways and means of getting out of the cycle of birth and death rather than think about the how and why of creation.

Shastriji opens his talk on the need to do manana and dwells very briefly on the aspect of creation as to how we are capable of creation when we are in the dream phase. He gives pointers to the inward journey in the path of saadhana. So, the inward journey is vital in the spiritual progress of every individual.

He then takes up in this talk on the aspect of chitta, as detailed out in the chittopaakhyana of the utpatti prakarana. The detailed study of the mind, cause of happiness and sorrow, controlling the flow of mind from moving thoughts in order to obtain stillness is the main thrust in this talk. This gives clear picture to a saadhaka.

Being a scientist and a saadhaka himself, Shastriji has been excellent in his systematic explanation on the interpretation of the movement of mind.



* Editor

L

ET US NOW DISCUSS SOME ASPECTS OF THE **आत्मा, मनस्** and **ब्रह्म**, Atma_, _Manas_ and _Brahma_. _Sage Vasishtha explains in detail on the play of mind, in Lavaṇōpākhyānam of Utpatti Prakarana.

**नहि चंचलताहीनं मनः क्वच न विद्यते,**

**चंचलत्वं मनोधर्मो वन्हेर्धर्मो यथोष्णता.**

nahi caṁcalatāhīnaṁ manaḥ kvaca na vidyatē,

caṁcalatvaṁ manōdharmō vanhērdharmo yathōṣṇatā.

<p style="text-align: right">
<strong> </strong>(YV.3-9-23)[^24]

Mind without vacillation or fluctuation does not exist. Like heat is inseparable from fire, fluctuation which is the nature of the mind is inseparable from it.

At the start itself, Vasishta makes a big statement. There is nothing like mind without (_caṁcalatā)_, wavering, vacillating or fickle. It is almost like saying that mind is _caṁcalatā_ and cāṁcalyam is mind. It is a definition of mind.

_caṁcalatvaṁ manōdharmō_ – What is the characteristic quality of mind? It is _caṁcalatvaṁ_, meaning movement or **स्पंदन_, spaṁdana_**. Now he gives an example: _vanherdharmo yathoṣṇatā_ - Just as the thermal value is the property of fire or heat is the property of agni, chanchalya is the property of the mind. You cannot think of fire without heat. Similarly you cannot think of mind without movement. The movement may be of the form of sound, picture or mere emotion. Anger, jealousy, irritability, inferiority complex etc which show up as pressure / burden are all movements. Thus pressure or tension is also a movement.

**यैषा हि चंचला स्पंदशक्तिः चित्तत्व संस्थिता,**

**तां विद्धि मानसीं शक्तिं जगदाडंबरत्मिकाम्**.

yaiṣā hi caṁcalā spaṁdaśaktiḥ cittatva saṁsthitā,

tāṁ viddhi mānasīṁśaktiṁ jagadāḍaṁbaratmikām.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-24)[^25]

The feature of vacillation is really the spanda shakti. It is the capacity of movement abiding in the chit, consciousness. It is that mental power that is responsible for the spectacle called world.

**_Cit_ **is ‘Self’. **_Citta_ **is mind. The pre state or the casual state or the _moolaswaroopa_ is Chit. When we talk of sat chit aananda, the word _cit_ is Consciousness or Self or Atma. _Citta_ or mind is the after position.

We call it spandana, pulsation when there is a to and fro motion. A tuning fork produces spandana. A stone thrown in the pond produces spandana. A ball rolling or a person walking is called lateral motion, a displacement. Here, Chanchalatha is equated to unsteadiness or simple motion or spandashakti.

_cittatva saṁsthitāyaa caṁccalā spaṁdaśaktiḥ_ - This power of movement or shakti or the vyaapaara dharma or spandashaskti is abiding in the _cit-tatva_ or _sva-swaroopa_.

_tāṁ viddhi mānasīṁśaktiṁ_ - **The Self in the state of movement is mind.**

This is an excellent definition of Self. Pundits ask for shastra pramaana for this, as this statement looks funny for them.

**निगृहीतं मनः एव निर्भयं ब्रह्म**

nigr̥hītaṁ manaḥēva nirbhayaṁ brahma

**¤UÀÈ»ÃvÀA ªÀÄ£ÀB KªÀ ¤¨sÀðAiÀÄA §æºÀä.**

**A mind quietened is Brahman**. This is a standard position in Vedanta. There is nothing like mind being different from Brahman or Atma Then how are they connected? Can we go from mind to Atma? When you are in the mind state what happened to Atma? Everyone has to face conflicting questions like this! But there is only STUFF everywhere, both inside and outside.

**स बाह्याभ्यन्तरो हि अजः**.

sa bāhyābhyantarō hi ajaḥ.

**¸À ¨ÁºÁå¨sÀå£ÀÛgÉÆÃ » CdB. (**Mundaka Upa)

If there is no activity, that is, if mind is in the state of rest, then it is ‘**SELF’**, if there is activity it is **MIND**. When the mind drops its continuous activity, it is ‘Self’. Following karika in Mandukya Upanishad (Ch.3-46) beautifully puts this fact.

**यदा न लीयते चित्तं न च विक्षिप्यते पुनः।**

**अनिङ्गनमनाभासं निष्पन्नं ब्रह्म तत्तदा॥**

yadā na līyatē cittaṁ na ca vikṣipyatē punaḥ**,**

aniṅganamanābhāsaṁ niṣpannaṁ brahma tattadā**. **

<p style="text-align: right">
(Ma.Upa-Ka-4-46)<sup><strong> </strong></sup>[^26]

When the mind is no more wandering, when it does not seek any more, that mind is verily Brahman. It is either moving or in a state of rest. When it is in movement, we call it as mind and when it is in rest, we call it _Brahman_ or** _Svarūpa_**. Such a state is further described as _svastham_ (a quietened mind), śāntam (peaceful), _nirvānam_ (liberated), and sukham (a very relaxed state).



* Mind in the non functioning state is SELF.
* Self in the functioning state is MIND.

When we accept this equation, things become very simple. Saadhana is at once known to us. What one has to do? One should quieten the mind. You are carrying the burden of Vyaapaara dharma when you are in the active state. It can be concluded that when you are in the state of suffering, drop this burden, duhkha is gone.

What is this **संसार**, _saṁsāra_ with its ceaseless repetition? We can say it is a nasty world. But what is wrong with birth and death? Simply saying that we get caught in the wheel of _samsaarachakra_, looks absurd. What is the problem in living? What are the elements that give one this problem? It is nothing but the burden. We are all caught by the phraseology of _samsaarachakra_! We should understand that doing phase itself is taxing. Shastra says, why don’t you do the _pareeksha_ of this phase itself? What else is everyday’s burden - vaarious activities at the karmendraiya level or jnaanedriya level or the chitta level like listening talking, thinking, planning, etc. There is nothing more than this. Even listening to good music for a long time, makes you get up and walk away. Any prolonged activity at either physical or mental level is taxing. This is the duhkha.

What is the remedy? Mind in the active phase is duhkha because it is nothing but movement. Movement is what we are complaining of. What is the meaning of the sentence ’let me rest’? Everybody makes this statement. But, the argument is that one can be comfortable and wants to be so, even while working. You are doing less than what you would do when you are under pressure. When you say ‘if I sit down I am unhappy, but it is better when I move’ what are your intentions? You are under pressure when you are resting. The reason is your entire activity is localized. You are capping the forces. Please note that you are not really quiet when you are sitting. If you were quiet, when you sit on a chair, you would never think of going to the kitchen and look for another cup of coffee. Such a sitting would be wonderful. There is no chittavyaapaara. The sounds and pictures have vanished. There is only a mere focusing. Even this is a burdened state! Who so ever says that work is giving him comfort, the work that he is doing is expending the burdensome forces inside. That means, by spending them he is free and that leads to a no activity stage.

Now, how do you justify that activity is duhkha? You were more burdened when you sat. Pressure that developed when you sat quiet, is the horrible activity inside compared to the state when you were mobile. In a small shell you are trapping these forces which build up pressure which is movement of the mind. If you go a little further, _shabda_ and _drushya_ are the activities of the mind. Minus these two also, there can be activity which is called general activity which we call pressure or emotion like anger jealousy etc. Thinking is a movement. Prana moves from other centers to the _ajnachakra_. The prana that is _sarvavyaapi_ gets into a constricted mode in the area of _ajnachakra_ and thus focusing starts.

So there are three aspects. One is shabda, sound. Another is drushya, picture formation and the third is the **भावनारूप**, bhāvanārūpa. These three constitute the mind. Boredome also comes under the bhaavana-roopa. Thinking posture is itself a state of minding which is ending in a thought. It shapes itself in to thought called examining phase or the questioning phase. My spread version or diffused version is localized and collected into a point at Ajnachakra.. Every attention or thinking or minding or seeing or an action starts from Ajnaachakra. This is called _spaṁda-śaktiḥ** **_what the sage Vasishta is referring to.

_jagadāḍaṁbaratmikām_ - So this jagat vyaapaara is this movement. So _citshakti_ is mind, minus of this is Self - what a useful definition!

Q. What does it mean when one says that one has to sit like saakshi or witness, watching the three states of jaagrat swapna and sushupti?

A. It means that when you come to that state of seeing, much of the vyavahaara in the _citta_ has come down. But there is still something more to see. Suppose I am watching the three states mentalising the process, then that seeing itself is pressure. This is the difficulty in the model when you apply this method.

When someone says ’imagine your toe relaxing, imagine your feet relaxing’ this very imagination itself is a burden. So the next question that arises is, should we not do soft relaxation! It is alright if you are capable of observing with utter casualness. Watching is also a burden. It is a torture. When a suggestion is given to you that you should watch the breath, to calm the mind, it means that the activity of the breath is a neutral one and it does not stir emotions or drift you away. But, care needs to be taken here also that the watching should not be keen. In that case it becomes a torture. Whereas when you watch the thought itself, there is every possibility of the drifting of the mind. You have to understand this clearly when you apply this model. There is no _priya_ or _apriya_ when you watch the breath, with the result the mind loses its strength of wandering to a great extent. This is the lesson we have to learn. Calmness puts you automatically in _Saakshi-Bhaava_ not in the seeing process itself.It is to be noted that casual or leisurely seeing is saakshi-bhava.

Q. Just as in the waking state, so also in dream, the nature of objects remains the same, the only difference being the limitation space in the dream phase, Then, what about the argument of Gaudapaada in the swapna portion of the Kaarika (Man Upa Ka 2-4)?

A. The person who lights up the swapna, (dream) is the person who created the dream. The drama that unfolds in a dream is a mere spandana. The person is a mere watcher. He has released pictures and sounds and is not involved at all in the operation. He is not choosing since he is not an involver. The person who is enjoying or suffering in the dream is a different person! All the action that is being endured is by a different person. So, there is a more fundamental stuff in ME that is rehearsing all these pictures etc .The meaning of the word pashyati in the mantra is in that context. By seer we mean, the Creator who releases the vyaapara is the creator himself..

The same thing applies in the case of Vaishwaanara in the jaagrat, wakeful state. You just watch that there is a window, a fan, a table, people around you, not involved in the details of the objects that are being watched. Once you start detailing, then you no longer become a mere seer. So, when you go to such a state where there is pure observation then that ‘seer’ becomes the creator. Looking or watching that way will be your _bhavya swaroopa_. This is the aspect that one has to contemplate in saadhana. You have to sit in such a mood that you are a witness to so many activities that are going on without the effort of observation and thus become a pure observer or **साक्षि**, _sākṣi_. The sage is showing that the spandana shakti that is dormant, is Brahman. _Yaa esha _- is the point to be remembered.

Most of the pundits say that avidya is the cause of this entire problem, but are unable to explain what this avidya is. We have to know that even this avidya is also a shakti. We call this by many names - maaya, manas, avidya, shakti, avyaakruta, mahattatwa - having different degrees of the spectrum which are very gentle. Whatever is the **चित् शक्ति**, _cit śakti _that is stationed in the _moolaswaroopa_ is the **आश्रय,** _āśraya_, shelter_ _for this shakti.

yā eṣā hi caṁccalā spaṁdaśaktiḥ cittatva saṁsthitā – _Cit_ is the _ashryasthana_, place of shelter for this spaṁdaśakti. My state is **महा मौन_, mahā mauna, _**utter silence or _moolashaktisthiti_.

tāṁ viddhi mānasīṁśaktiṁ jagadāḍaṁbaratmikām - But it can project all activities. Even the projection aspect is the aspect of this _citshakti_.

Let us move to the next mantra.

**यत्तु चंचलताहीनं तन्मनो अमृतं उच्यते,**

**तदॆव च तपः शास्त्रं सिद्धान्तोमोक्ष उच्यते**.

yattu caṁcalatāhīnaṁ tanmanō amr̥taṁ ucyatē,

tadēva ca tapaḥśāstraṁ siddhāntō mōkṣa ucyatē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-25)[^27]

Devoid of or without this fluctuation, the mind ceases to exist and that is one’s state of liberation or immortality or svaroopa. This state is the aim of all kinds of tapas or penance, study of scriptures and spiritual doctrine, etc.

_yattu caṁcalatāhīnaṁ tanmanō amr̥taṁ ucyatē_ – Suppoose you tame the mind and it loses or ceases its _chanchalata_. Then mind has become _amr̥taṁ_. A mind without its movement is _amr̥taṁ _or _svaroopa_ or _cit_.

_tadēva ca tapaḥ_ - the process by which one softens the spandana of the mind or characteristic quality of the mind is tapas or penance.

_Shaastarm tadēva_; This is what we have to understand from shastras. That is, to remove the chattering of the mind. This is what we have to do.

_tadēvasiddanta;_ That is the conclusion also.

_mōkṣa tadēva;_ The so called moksha or duhkha raahitya is to achive calmness of mind which is **_spandana rahita sthiti_** or that state of no vibrations.

Q. What is it that takes us to _spandana rahita_ state?

A. Any suggestion to achive the spandana rahitya state itself creates a spandana - even that is mind in a controlled state. If anyone asks whether one spandana can kill another spandana, the answer is, yes. It is the experience of a sadhaka and experience cannot be questioned by logic. By vichara or counseling we calm down the mind. And the cunsellor is the mind only. So, mind is capable of calming or killing mind. It is just like removing one thorn by another. We ourselves would have experienced this on any number of occasions.

Duhkha by itself is a spandana or a movement. Absence of this is moksha. Even the shaastra says the same thing. This is also called tapas. One has to sit calmly and reduce the mind to a spandana rahita state. But the one that is responsible for this spandana rahita state is also a spandana. It comes in the form of sound. That is also manas. How do we say this? Of course, by experience. Logic cannot question the anubhava or experience. By your own admission and experience, you say that you have put the mind to a quieter state. The decision to advise the mind to calm down rests with me, which is again mind. When we say that we have no hurry at all, the hurry element disappears in the mind. So, emotion also comes down. How can one advice the mind to calm down? The mind is constructed that way itself and one cannot question the property of the mind. You cannot question as to how a _cit_ which is silent is able to project itself and generate the strength required to be able to project itself. This is a big lesson in Vedanta.

There are two examples of how mind can dissolve mind. One is to take the case of removing the thorn that is stuck on your body. Remove the thorn by using another thorn and then throw away both the thorns. Both of them become useless once the job is done. Similarly the cancelling mind and the cancelled mind or the removed mind and the removing mind are both lost. This is what happens in saadhana.

When I say that I have to sit quiet, then I should also give up the _sankalpa_ that I should sit quiet. Otherwise that itself becomes a burden. It is not possible to come out of the difficulty otherwise.

To achieve this, you need the support of shastra, sampradaaya and above all a guide or a guru as you may call it. Even the notion that you should give up something has to be dispensed with.

That is what we saw in Shikidwaja’s case. He goes to the extent of arguing with Choodala that he has given up everything in life to achieve moksha. Choodala says - _Yena tyajasi tat tyaja_ – drop also the intent or shradhaa to get liberated. Unless that is also given up, there was no question of swaroopa siddhi. So, that alertness, that watchfulness also has to be given up. You must be like a child and throw away things in a jiffy. That tightness of giving up has to go. The indulgence forces were only replaced by checked forces. This is one aspect of nigraha, self control. But, the force of restraint in us is also a pressure just as the force of indulgence at a higher level of sadhana.. It may be a mild one. But it is still a pressure. So, relax yourself from that also. J K’S famous words ‘childlike innocence’ has to be remembered. Plenty of shastra vaakyaas are there to support this. That is what the rishi says - _tadeva ca tapaḥśāstraṁ siddhānto mokṣa ucyate_ - These clear definitions help us to become subtler than the subtle buddhi vyaapaara. Even the effort of moderation in buddhi vyaapaara is a burden. You have to get out of them also. Please note that it is not the agitation of the mind. Agitation itself is the mind. Mind has no existence without agitation. It is difficult to describe the agitationless mind.

Q. What is the difference between _sat_ and _cit_ then?

A. Both are same. Shankara gives a clarification. **सत्ता**, _sattā_ also can mean _vastusatta_ where the inertness aspect may come. To recognize the statement that _cit_ is not a _jadavastu_, inert object, the word _sat_ has been used. In _satyam jnaanam anatam_ it is shown that _jnaanam_ is not jada, inert. _Jada niraakarana_, denial of inertness is the main idea here. _Sat_ means the imperishable – and not _a-sat_. _Anantam_ is one having no edges or no contours or boundaries. Jnaana implies that there is no _khandatwa_. Then only it becomes ananta. One follows the other.

We will go to the next sloka.

**तस्य चंचलता यैषा त्वविद्या राम स उच्यते,**

**वासनापरनाम्नीं तां विचारेण विनाशय**

tasya caṁcalatā yaiṣā tvavidyā rāma sa ucyatē,

vāsanāparanāmnīṁ tāṁ vicārēṇa vināśaya.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-26)[^28]

The fluctuating power of the mind is called by several names such as avidya, ignorance, vasana, tendency and others. The flirting mind is no other than the fluctuating Shakti itself. It is this fluctuating potency of the mind that you should destroy through ceaseless Atma-vicara, Self enquiry.

_tasya caṁcalatā yaiṣā tvavidyā rāma sa ucyatē_ -Another name of this chanchalata is avidya. It is also known as maya, shakti, avyakruta or spandana. It is not the avidya as explained by the pundits.

_vāsanāparanāmnīṁ_ - another name for that is vasana

_tvāṁ vicārēṇa vināśaya_ - By simple vichara, deliberation we have to get rid of all these vasanaas We are all doing vichara only. I am chit swroopa. I need not be disturbed by the circumstances. Nothing can touch me. By such vichaara things become very clear. I need not excite myself by slipping away from my swaroopa to chanchalata. Our natural conviction is to encourage the movement state and we are not ready to give up. So, the Rishi asks us to give up chitta. This is a very big recommendation. Unless one gets convinced that he should give up chitta there is no remedy. In one mantra it was summerised as to why one should give up the chitta and in another mantra it is made clear whether it is possible to give up chitta.

Shastra says that there is an undisputable proof in your nidra stithi and you should examine that. In nidra, there is no sound or picture and also no emotion whatsoever. It is clear from Nidra that one has the facility to stay in the non-doing dharma. This is beyond the suggestion of Pantajali sutras and is a strong pramaana or proof in Vedanta. A mischievous question could be as to why one should give up chitta. For this, Vedanta says that your nidra-swaroopa is a cure or solution to your duhkha since it is your anandasthana when you are in sleep.

**अत्र माता अमाता भवति पिता अपिता भवति स्तेनो अस्तेनो भवति भ्रूणहा अभ्रूणहा भवति अनन्वागतं पुण्येन अनन्वागतं पापेन तीर्णो हि तदा सर्वाञ्छोकान्हृदयस्य भवति.**

<p style="text-align: right">
(Bru.Upa.4-3-22)[^29]

atra mātā amātā bhavati pitā apitā bhavati stēnō astēnō bhavati bhrūṇahā abhrūṇahā bhavati ananvāgataṁ puṇyēna ananvāgataṁ pāpēna tīrṇō hi tadā sarvāñchōkānhr̥dayasya bhavati.

In Nidra you are rid of all the limitations and constrictions that encompass you while you are in jagrat.



* There is absolutely no grief of any kind while in sleep. There we have found a meaning for the sutra - _chitta vrutti nirodha,_ in a sense that Pantajali’s aphorism is also supported by the Upanishad.

All aspects that we have covered in the whole Upanishad are condensed in eight lines of Lavanopaakhyaana. Vaasana, avidya, chaanchalya, spandana and mind are one and the same. The absence of these is chit which is ananda itself. Maaya, shakti, avidya are different layers. The mind without spandana is Brahman. When spandana is there, Brahman is mind.

Q. What is the difference between Kumbhana, Dhaarana, and Ekaagrata?

A. All three are similar group of words. Ekaagrata only organizes the unruly hellish activity into an organized activity. During Yajna or Pooja all random activities are moderated into or directed into organized activity. Chanchalata has come down in ekagrata. So, Ekaagrata gives a slightly softer state of mind. But even that becomes a burden. To break this position a lot of karmakaanda activities are to be followed.

A person who is dedicated to karmakaanda has got almost ninety percent of chittashuddi. One has to only understand the how and why of Karmakaanada. You can get to a level of balanced mind. But, if one takes to karmakanda practices very seriously by going into every detail, even this becomes a burden to him since this can also become a curse. A karmakandin is better placed than a kaamuka who rushes for bhoga.

We should not forget that, most of the time we do not even have the sukha that is generated by the activity of vijnaanakosha. We have understood that the vijnaanakosha is the one that gives us all the happiness. But we have not reached that level to retain the samata or equilibrium in our actions and performance.

**विज्ञानं यज्ञं तनुते. कर्माणि तनुतेपि च. **

vijñānaṁ yajñaṁ tanutē. karmāṇi tanutēpi ca.

**«eÁÕ£ÀA AiÀÄdÕA vÀ£ÀÄvÉÃ.PÀªÀiÁðtÂ vÀ£ÀÄvÉÃ¦ ZÀ.**

Here, (Tai.Upa.-2-5) the phrase karmaani means vaidika karma, not any other worldly karma. Vijnaanakosha is equated to Brahman by the demigods. It is very much glorified by them. It is necessary for getting the needed penetration in to saadhana. Plenty of rush to bhoga is dropped when you are in Vijnaanakosha, because of the vichaara. This is the main characteristic of vijnaanakosha. So, in order to get rid of even the ten percent of the bhogavasana, one has to dwell deep into Vedanta.

When one reaches vijnaanakosha, sufficient amount of _manonairmalya_ or purification of mind has already happened. Even this is itself a great boon to us. But continuation of the process of this purification leads us to Brahman. So we should not stop at this kosha if we want to soften the mind further.

Q. What about prema and bhakti?

When you adopt prema and tyaaga, the mind almost reaches a pure stage. It is so much softened. There are degrees of softness as you all know by now. Lot of further softening is necessary and for this we have to practice the removal of selfish attitude constantly and continuously. Selflessness is the root of prema bhaava.

**_Tat sukha sukhitwam_** – Finding happiness in others happiness, is the principle to be followed. I always remember the relationship of Radha and Krishna as the finest example for this statement. In the aspect of sukhaanubhava, Radha really merged herself in the happiness of Krishna. She was waiting to give Krishna all the support needed to make him happy. His happiness is what all she wanted always. Whereas, Satyabhama’s prema was quite the opposite. She wanted to use Krishna as a tool to come out of her boredom and she used him as a means of getting happiness. Her actions were only aimed at that. Compared to this, Radha and Rukmini’s prema towards Kriishna was one of giving solace to him.

We as scientists should not question the facts of the universe. It is better to accept selfishness as a natural trait in human nature and make sincere effort to eliminate it rather than taking selfishness, as hate is a negative force. When you take things with a reverential attitude, then faults in you drop down. In fact everything in this world is pooja worthy. By careful analysis tamas can be dropped or at least brought to a minimal level.

There are two aspects of prema - prema that arises towards the God where you tend to be worshipful, which is called bhakti and the prema that originates among friends and relatives follows the principle of _tat sukha sukhitvam._ Selflessness is the yardstick of one’s growth. While bhakti has a poojyabhaava, prema has an element of excitement which is absent in bhakti and that leads to a pure mind and that leads to Brahman.

Q. What is vaasana?

A. When the svaroopa which was in the restful or _vishraanti_ state takes to spandanashakti, (started vibrating) it is called as avidya, vaasana, maya, etc. Hence, vaasana is also a dormant shakti in swaroopa. Let us not confuse ourselves. Forgetting its true nature, this Me or Self got conditioned to various forms. This is beautifully depicted in Chamaka Prashna of Krishna Yajurveda and Devi Bhagavata wherein it is declared that both good and bad aspect of life is ME only. If one continuously encourages anger, over a period he becomes a mass of anger. We are all conditioned one way or the other. Whatever type of shakti in the infinite varieties the Self has encouraged, it becomes that shakti. Hence one should not demean any one. Good, bad, ugly, everything is that Stuff only. Hence, everything is to be approached and treated reverentially. How can one hate anybody then? This is called _sarva brahmadrushti or sarva pavitra drushti_. There is nothing good or bad in this world. If one develops this attitude then it results in _samatva_ and _atma- samaadhaana_. This leads us to recognize the bad or negativities in us and accept them without repulsion. By accepting selfishness than detesting it, one has got great chance of crossing it because hate is a stronger version. As ardent saadhakaas we are developing relaxation or vishraanti or manas samaadhaana. After ten years what are you? You are a relaxed person.

To sum up: If there is no movement inside there is no mind.Activity is mind and and in the broader sense activity is also Self as there is only Self in the whole universe. In Gaudapaada’s language:

**चित्तं निर्विषयं नित्यं असंगं तेन कीर्तितम्**

cittaṁ nirviṣayaṁ nityaṁ asaṁgaṁ tēna kīrtitam

**avÀÛA ¤«ðµÀAiÀÄA ¤vÀåA C¸ÀAUÀA vÉÃ£À QÃwðvÀªÀiï.**

<p style="text-align: right">
(Ma.Upa.Ka-4-72)</p>




* If you think of chitta in its paramaarthata or in its purest sense, it is Brahman.
* Vijnaana or Consciousness is Self.

**विज्ञाने स्पंदमाने वै नाभासा अन्यतो भुवः.**

vijñānē spaṁdamānē vai nābhāsā anyatō bhuvaḥ

**«eÁÕ£ÉÃ ¸ÀàAzÀªÀiÁ£ÉÃ ªÉÊ £Á¨sÁ¸Á C£ÀåvÉÆÃ ¨sÀÄªÀB.**

<p style="text-align: right">
(Ma.aUpa.Ka-4-51)</p>


The Jagat is Self in the vibrating phase. The noise, the sound, everything is spandamana vijnana.

**अस्पंदमानं विज्ञानं अनाभासं अजं तथा**

aspandamānaṁ vijñānaṁ anābhāsaṁ ajaṁ tathā.

**C¸ÀàAzÀªÀiÁ£ÀA «eÁÕ£ÀA C£Á¨sÁ¸ÀA CdA vÀxÁ.**

<p style="text-align: right">
<strong> </strong>(Man.upa-ka-4-48) </p>


Whereas, Vijnana in the non vibrating phase is Self or Brahman only.

Consciousness, when not in motion, is free from all appearances and remains Changeless. Energy is spandana. We have already discussed three types of motion. To recollect, they are linear motion, circular motion and simple harmonic motion. Even at the micro level of atoms, electrons and protons there is terrible movement. The entire creation is spandana only. In this spandana phase we can call it mind. We can also call it _ajnaana, vaasana, avidya, shakti, chanchalata, _avyaakruta_ and mahattatva_.

Q. What is jagadaadambara?

A. It is activities of jagat. Modern way of defining Jagat is, that it is nothing but matter and energy. In Vedanta jagat is defined as naama, roopa and karma or vaak, chitta and praana. So jagat is mere activity. Jagadaadambara means activity and it is a derivative of the mind.

Taking the argument further that happiness is what is needed and you must find out how to get it. You think that money and objects give you that. How do you get money? Through activity, through professional work and you conclude that doing is a must for that. Even if doing is not my true nature or necessary nature, I still tend to support it because it gives me joy in the end.

Next sloka:

**अविद्यया वासनया तयान्तश्चित्तसत्तया,**

**विलीनया त्यागवशात्परं श्रेयः अधिगम्यते.**

avidyayā vāsanayā tayāntaścittasattayā,

vilīnayā tyāgavaśātparaṁśrēyaḥ adhigamyatē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-27)<sup><strong> </strong></sup>[^30]

By virtue of renunciation, the avidya which is vaasana, inside the mind stuff gets dissolved thereby resulting in one’s liberation. Having said that one has to clean the mind by vichaara, Sage Vasishta goes on to expand the idea.

_paraṁśrēyaḥ adhigamyate_ - shreya means moksha or total comfort or liberatioin from bondage.

_avidyayā vāsanayā_ - Here avidya is vaasana and vice versa. _tayāntaścittasattayā,_ - chitta or satta, the mind stuff that is inside for which another name is avidya or vaasana.

_Vilinaya_ - If that chitta-satta which is in all of us gets dissolved.

_tayāntaścittasattayā_ - We dissolve vaasna by tyaaga, by giving up. The rushing after things has to be reduced. Abhimata _vastu tyaagavashaat_ - interest for things or in the things of the world is to be dropped. And it is not vastutyaga. Withdrawing the outgoing forces is tyaga.If you can quieten the mind,you get parama shreyaha - means total comfort or liberation from bondage.

How _Vilinayaatyaagavashaat_? It is only tyaga of tendencies towards bhoga. That is, one has to stop the outgoing forces. Tyaaga has the meaning that the outward going senses have to be stopped.

**यत् तत् सदसतोर्मध्यं यन्मध्यं चित्तजाड्ययोः,**

**तन्मनः प्रोच्यते राम द्वयदोलायिताकृतिः. **

yat tat sadasatōrmadhyaṁ yanmadhyaṁ cittajāḍyayoḥ,

tanmanaḥ prōcyatē rāma dvayadōlāyitākr̥tiḥ.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-28)[^31]

Mind is that which is associated with and oscillating between both Cit and jada, that is self and inert matter, is in between Sat and a-sat.

He is giving another excellent definition. There is chit which is my swaroopa and which has the power of seeing or becoming. (_jagadaadabrratmika_), Brahman has become jagat svaroopa in the form of nama, roopa and karma through spandana. Three things are involved in looking at an object.



* Cit, that is, sat is the Seer and Cētya, that is, a-sat is the object seen. The object is jada. It cannot change as It is pure.
* The stuff in between Cit and Cētya or sat and asat is manas or mind. It is the process of becoming a specific object. It is not quiet like Cit or insensitive like the objet.

_sadasatōrmadhyaṁ_ - In between sat and asat is the MIND. In the process of becoming a specific thing the mind has become jaadya. That is, when the mind is in the process of seeing, it has lost its freedom. In every seeing of an object the chit has become that particular, sensual, unthinking stuff. So chit and jada are the limits of the mind. This oscillating stuff between sat and a-sat called mind, does not take the jaadya dharma, hence it becomes swaroopa. By forgetting the swaroopa dharma it takes on jaadya dharma - _dolāyitākr̥tiḥ_. So, mind is the mid stuff which can become the jada if it falls. Otherwise it can become the pure thing, chit

If you drop the thinking process it is svaroopa. If the thinking process is involved in creating an object it becomes the object. The **संकुचित**, s_aṁkucita_ or shrinking phase of svaroopa is mind. If shrinking takes place, then it becomes is table, chair, etc. Creation of a specific object is jaadya srushti.

Mind is the process of becoming entities of the jagat. Not the entity itself. It is the mid stuff. It can become jada formation or if it does not become it remains as sat or ananda. What becomes the specific thing is jada. The process is the mind.

By thinking continuously, a vastu can be created. If the thinking is dropped it becomes swaroopa. The mind is the material that is undergoing sankochata If that happens, then it becomes a table,a chair, book etc. A definite vastusristi is called jaadyasristi. Between chit or sat, that is, the non doing phase and the jada or a-sat the mind rests. Between sat and a-sat is the mind. A sadhaka has to take cue from this and reduce looking outworldly. Then this becomes a wonderful tool for saadhana.

**जाड्यानुसंधानहृतं जाड्यात्मकयेद्धया,**

**चेतो जडत्वमायाति धृढाभ्यासवशेन हि. **

jāḍyānusaṁdhānahr̥taṁ jāḍyātmakayēddhayā,

cētō jaḍatvamāyāti dhr̥ḍhābhyāsavaśēna hi.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl. 3-9-29)[^32]

Chit gets corrupted or vitiated and itself becomes inert by prolonged contemplation of the inert matter.

Fools and non saadhaka we are, we are encouraging the quality of looking here and there. Endlessly we are doing _jaadyaanysandaana_. This is the cause of human suffering and it is his _dourbhaagyam_ is misfortune. When you are sitting alone, you go on thinking about something or seeing one thing or the other. You begin to invite details. That is, you are engrossed in naama, roopa, karma. Creating a vastu means creating a form or roopa. It is also an aspect of jaadya. _jāḍyātmakayēddhayā_ - Because of this practice of ours -_cēto jaḍatvamāyāti_ – Cit imbibes jadatva. We do not create one thing and stop there. But, are continuously jumping from one to another creation of thought. We hop from one scene to another. The mind is doing the anusandhaana of jaadya in various forms. The only consideration is that we have the ability of freedom from this practice. We have the ability to ignore so many things which are in our field of vision and thought.

The consciousness, having lost its freedom of everywheweness, takes upto only one sankalpa intensely and thus becomes jada. That is known as _eka roopa drusti - _having lost the independence of even enquiring on another object. This has resulted in the formation of material. We are not able to hold on to the chit swaroopa for a long time mainly for two reasons. One is the fear and the other is that we do not know the trick or technique of holding on to it. That is where _dhyaana, dhaarana, samaadhi_ aspect comes into being.

If the mind is watching a particular thing, it should not occur that ‘I’ am the one watching and you should become that thing itself. Our ekaagrata is so feeble that we cannot hold on to any one object or form even for a second. One would be observing a thing even without seeing that the observer is watching. It should be like:

**स्वरूपशून्यमिव प्रत्यामात्रा निर्भासम्.**

svarūpaśūnyamiva pratyāmātrā nirbhāsam.

**¸ÀégÀÆ¥À±ÀÆ£Àå«ÄªÀ ¥ÀævÁåªÀiÁvÁæ ¤¨sÁð¸ÀªÀiï.**

In that state there should be nothing when I am observing an object. I immediately infer that I saw the object instead of becoming the object. I have created a dual stage at that point of observation.

I have always given that instance of my experiments to some senior sadhakaas only. When I wished to think of a child like Krishna and do the dhaarana, he would remain for long periods in my mind and even move along with me. It became so much that he would even jump on the platform in front of me. This amounted to almost creating stuff. If it were hallucination the object cannot remain for long. This is a case of volition and not helplessness. Suppose it is possible to keep this image for long period it might sometimes become terrifying for you. The mentally created shakti can walk to your house and even talk to you. If the stability of that praana is so powerful then it is possible that you can see the object created by me.

Any stuff that is created should have a main characteristic of impenetrability and should be opaque. That is how shristi happens. I was told that Allama prabhu had that type of creating power. For devataas since it is manodeha sukshmataya karana - creation of mental objects is easy. If this idea is expanded too large, then one can create the jagat itself. (Sl.3-9-30)[^33]

**विरोध एक अनुसंधानात् चिदंशात्मतया मनः,**

**चिदेकतां उपायाति दृढाभ्यासवशादिह.**

virōdhaēka anusaṁdhānāt cidaṁśātmatayā manaḥ,

cidēkatāṁ upāyāti dr̥ḍhābhyāsavaśādiha.

By contemplation or reflection of one’s spiritual nature, by intense practice and by its natural or instinctive spiritual tendency chitta becomes one with Chit.

_Virōdha ēka anusaṁdhānāt_ – This is what we are required to do as sadhakas. I am not the mind. I am the pre mind stuff. I can think, focus or defocus. The mind is a mid stuff and thus can worsen itself by encouraging minding or purify itself back to Self by not encouraging the minding business. Mind is continuously creating. It is in the narrowing mood..Suppose I don’t do that as it is the mid stuff and can work both ways.

_cidaṁśātmatayā manaḥ_ - This mid stuff or this attention I is not there inside at all. If you come to a situation where there is no ’I’ at all– then you reach your chit svaroopa,

_cidēkatāṁ upāyāti dr̥ḍhābhyāsavaśādiha_ – If you reverse the process the process which gave you the jaadya and apply it to swaroopa, you become swaroopa maatra. An utter relaxation on your part leads to chinmaatrata. That is why the mid stuff is important. You can spoil yourself and become jada or get back to your source. This was the case with Nisargadutta Maharaj. His Guru told him to hold on to that state. That put him into jnaana swaroopa. It was an extraordinary attainment. Even UGK was like that. This is called Jnaana siddhi. (Sl.3-9-31)[^34]

**पौरुषेण प्रयत्नेन तस्मिन्नेव पदे मनः,**

**योज्यते तत्पदं प्राप्य भवत्यभ्यासतो हि यत्. **

pauruṣēṇa prayatnēna tasminnēva padē manaḥ,

yōjyatē tatpadaṁ prāpya bhavatyabhyāsatō hi yat.

Through effort unite the mind to that Supreme State. With practice that State is certainly attained. Therefore one has to use _purusha prayatna_ all the time, all the twenty four hours to attain that state. If you are able to stay on in that vistaarata,(expansive state) then you touch the source.

**अतः पौरुषमाश्रित्य चित्तयाक्रम्य चेतसा,**

**विशोकं पदमालंब्य निरातंकः स्थिरो भव. **

ataḥ pauruṣamāśritya cittayākramya cētasā,

viśōkaṁ padamālaṁbya nirātaṁkaḥ sthirō bhava.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-32)[^35]

Therefore, by overcoming the mind by the mind, attain to that state untainted by sorrow and remain established in IT.

You have to conquer the realm of chit with the help of chitta itself Then you can remain steady in that state If you take care to see that Bhaavanas or emotions are controlled, then both the chintana and bhaavana will die. If chintana is carefully contained, both chintana and bhavana disappear. When there is no subject where is the problem of developing raga and dvesha? So, if you drop the sankalpa, both bhavana and sankalpa vanish. You should keep on practicing to remain in that peaceful state or samaadhaana sthiti for longer periods_. pauruṣeṇa prayatnena tasminneva pade manaḥ**. **_So, if you are able to sit in that swaroopa state for at least five or six hours in a day it will be a great sadhana. There is no mystery at all in Vedanta! Hence: _cittayākramya cētasā** **_- **you control the mind by the mind and there is no other separate entity here. Both the controlling and the controlled parts are mind only.**

_viśōkaṁ padamālaṁbya_ - You get to a state of no shoka (grief) or _ayaasa rahita_ (tireless) - vyaapaara rahita sthiti. Vyaapaara is synonymous with shoka which is in turn sukha and duhkha. _nirātaṁkaḥ sthirō bhava_ - remain in that no anxiety state. Yogavasishta thus, is a manana grantha as we can ponder over one sloka at a time for long periods of time.

**मन एव समर्थं हि मनसो दृढनिग्रहे,**

**अराजा किं समर्थं स्यात् राज्ञो राघव निग्रहे. **

mana ēva samarthaṁ hi manasō dr̥ḍhanigrahē,

arājā kiṁ samarthaṁ syāt rājñō rāghava nigrahē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-33)[^36]

It is only mind that is capable of decisively vanquishing or conquering the mind as nobody else other than a king is capable of defeating another king.

_mana ēva samarthaṁ hi manasō dr̥ḍhanigrahē_ - mind only is capable of firmly controlling the mind, Like:

_arājā kiṁ samarthaṁ syāt rājñō rāghava nigrahē_ - Just as anyone else other than a king is incapable of conquering another king. One has to apply one’s mind to conquer the mind till quiet state is reached.

**तृष्णाग्राह्य गृहीतानां संसारार्णव पातिनाम्,**

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-34)[^37]

For those drowned in the ocean of samsaara, caught in the grips of the crocodiles of desires and carried far by the current, one’s mind alone is the boat which can save them.People who are caught up by endless desire and caught up in the vicious circle of bhoga vaasana are completely drowned in the _samsaara saagara_. For such people it is impossible to control the mind.

**मनसैव मनश्छित्वा पाशं परम बन्धनम्,**

**भवादुत्तारयात्मानं नासावन्येन तार्यते. **

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-35)[^38]

manasaiva manaśchitvā pāśaṁ parama bandhanam,

bhavāduttārayātmānaṁ nāsāvanyēna tāryatē.

You have to cut the mind which is in the form of a tight rope from the mind itself and _bhavāduttārayātmānaṁ_ - lift oneself from this worldly bondage. _nāsāvanyēna tāryatē_ - it is not possible for anybody else other than you to come out of samsaara. This is not possible either by performing a pooja or surrendering to a guru. You must control it yourself. What else can be the suffering except this non stop thinking of so many things which are trivial in nature, yet giving rise to repeated duhkha. When the mind focuses on any subject, immediately a state of fear or anxiety is reached. Then raga and dwesha develops. This leads to a lot of strain. Focusing is a torture, a burden. Moment one changes to a lighter mood, then the burden goes. This is called understanding what misery is. To go after a thing or to run away from a thing is what happens to us generally all the time. So, for survival, every man shifts from a focusing mood to a lighter mood and this facility is available to everyone. (Chandogya upa)[^39]

**विप्र: दरिद्रशोः सत् संपत्तिः समानानपि,**

**विद्वान् जान्येव गच्छति, अविद्वांस्तु अजानन् गच्छति.**

vipra: daridraśōḥ sat saṁpattiḥ samānānapi,

vidvān jānyēva gacchati, avidvāṁstu ajānan gacchati.

Even though for an ordinary man and a jnaani, sleep phase is common, a vidwaan goes to sleep with a clear understanding that the sleep phase is a great opportunity to touch Brahman (a conscious entry into a no mind state). Whereas, an ordinary person goes to sleep without any thinking only to relieve himself from the burden of jagrat. Jnaani knows that it is the mukti sthaana and thus conciouslly enters into no mind state. It is a calculated carefree state. For an idiot his sleep is only a recovery to get back to his mundane activities.

**ययोदेति मनोनाम्नी वासनावासितान्तरा,**

**तां तां परिहरेत् प्राज्ञः ततोअविद्याक्षयो भवेत्. **

yayōdēti manōnāmnī vāsanāvāsitāntarā,

tāṁ tāṁ pariharēt prājñaḥ tatōavidyākṣayō bhavēt.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl3-9-36)[^40]

Whenever the mind is activated by vasana, counter the vasana. That will destroy avidya.

_yayōdēti manōnāmnī_ **– **As and when sankalpas or volitions crop up in the mind,

_tāṁ tāṁ pariharēt prājñaḥ_ - the person of right understanding recognises that the sankalpa needs to be dropped then and there itself. Mind wakes up, Once a thought comes and it has to be immediately understood that it is likely to create vaasana. So, the moment you get to focusing state, you have to let go the same. Whenever mind gets fickle a person with understanding has to solve it by introspection. For a person of that type - _avidyākṣayo bhavet_ - avidya naasha happens. Avidya here means that it is a force that is pulling you down. We have already seen many times as to what avidya is. Many synonyms are there for that word -vaasna, shakti, maya, chanchalya. All these lead to focusing. Stopping of this leads to swaroopa.

**भोगैकवासनां त्यक्त्वा त्यज त्वं भेदवासनम्,**

**भावाभावौ ततस्त्यक्त्वा निर्विकल्पः सुखी भव. **

bhōgaikavāsanāṁ tyaktvā tyaja tvaṁ bhēdavāsanam,

bhāvābhāvau tatastyaktvā nirvikalpaḥ sukhī bhava.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-37)[^41]

bhogaikavāsanāṁ tyaktvā - After dropping attractions and pulls towards worldly enjoyments

tyaja tvaṁ bhedavāsanam - Drop also the notion that I am the enjoyer

bhāvābhāvau tatastyaktvā - Moment you feel that you are the person who is enjoying the bhoga, you at once are different from swaroopa. So this has to be carefully monitored. You have to give up bhaava and abhaava also. Conceiving of things is known as bhaavana. Non conceiving things is known as a-bhaavana. If one is conscious of either of these then it is burdensome. Even the concept that I am doing vastu grahana and I need to leave it becomes a burden and becomes a bhaavana. Therefore you have to give up even the conceiving of things. You are watching that you are doing nothing. That is the paradox. What is the remedy?

_bhāvābhāvau tatastyaktvā_ - you have to give up both grasping and non grasping. Watching the non watching is also a burden. Non doing becomes very much doing when you watch. Watching that you are not watching not doing anything is also attention. The approach that I will take care not to watch is also wrong. That is what Shkhidhwaja did. What to do?

**JUST BE. LET GO.**

**_YENA TYAJASI TAT TYAJA - _DROP MINDING**.

So, you have to give up even that. You neither watch nor avoid watching.

**मा गृहाण विमुंच मा**

** **mā gr̥hāṇa vimuṁca mā

**ªÀiÁ UÀÈºÁt «ªÀÄÄAZÀ ªÀiÁ.**

You neither capture nor reject. Do not encourage the notion that you are doing a wrong thing and it is a-dharma. At the same time do not give in to _aaswaadana_ or urge for enjoyment.

The best method is to cultivate a habit to go slow as much as possible in _bhogaaasana_. The forces of chitta have to be toned down. Even the **निग्रह**, nigraha, controlling or withdrawing activity has to be done slowly without any rush to eradicate. Then both will become pavitra, sacred. Pavitra karma is to cleanse yourself. Once this starts peace automatically sets in. One who does not have this knowledge will go on avoiding rather than slowing down the forces. Once you know the trick then you are always in swaroopa as far as sadhana is concerned.



* Shanti before - shanti during - shanti after any action is the way a sadhaka should go after.
* Speed before - speed during - speed after is the one that leads to misery or duhkha. The same applies to focussing also. So your aim should be towards shanti always and this becomes a success for your sadhana.

avidyāmānaiva naṣṭaprajñēṣu vidyatē,

nāmnaiva aṁgīkr̥tākārā samyak prajñasya sā kutaḥ

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-40)[^42]

_avidyāmānaiva_ – The avidya forces (mind, spandana, shakti, maya, vaasana, etc) that construct the universe do not really exit. Then where do they exit? _naṣṭaprajñēṣu vidyatē _- It is there for those who have forgotten their true nature. Here, we have to forget creation outside and think of creation inside. My thoughts, my emotions are not there when you keep in mind always my ultimate position. There is no mind at all for those who are convinced that they are a non thinking stuff, are _aakashamaatra_, there is no concept of _aham, Idam division(vibhajana), _splitting into ‘I’, this, that, etc.

If you accept thoughts are there, that shraddha keeps the thoughts intact. This has to be dropped for saadhana. We can conquer avidya also by cultivating the _udaasinabhava_.

_Nashta prajneshu vidyate_ - one who has forgotten his true nature, avidya forces will always be rising.

_nāmnaiva aṁgīkr̥tākārā_ - Existance of avidya is naamamaatra. They have accepted avidya or are having shraddha of the existence of the world and hence for them world is very much there. This shraddha keeps avidya going.

We have to look at how this can help us in sadhana. Avidya is reversible and steps are replaceable. It is a droppable stuff. If you maintain avidya it stays. It vanishes if you drop it - Avidyamānā eva avidyā vartate_samyak prajñasya sā kutaḥ_ - For a realized soul where is it?

You will get into difficulty when you apply this principle to x y z objects. Think of avidya as mental activity. Then, the point holds very well. If you maintain thinking, it is there. Otherwise it is absent. Generally we go on inviting thoughts which may become anger and it remains and you develop on that. That should be avoided. It vanishes if you dismiss it. My emotions, my reaction to the outside world may be kept on or dismissed. Our saadhana relates to the inside stuff. We have to exercise our freedom in dealing with outside world with the conviction that every mental activity has the option carrying element. We have got the option either to invite or dismiss/reject.

Prana and other positions of swaroopa are activities released by ‘Self’ but are reversible in nature. They can be absorbed back into that great silence again. These forces are released with the property of reversibility. That is our concept of jada in Vedanta. They can be re absorbed if we so decide. For example, curd cannot be re converted to milk. Whereas, water can be turned into ice and vice versa. This property sets the basis for our saadhana.

**The most important sloka which I always quote: **

**अनास्थैव हि निर्वाणम् दुःखमास्था परिग्रहः,**

**अनेनैव प्रयत्नेन ब्रह्म सम्पद्यते क्षणात्. **

anāsthaiva hi nirvāṇam duḥkhamāsthā parigrahaḥ,

anēnaiva prayatnēna brahma sampadyatē kṣaṇāt.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-39)[^43]

Absence of craving for pleasures is the state of liberation. Craving is fillled with misery. Through this practice Brahman is realised immediately.

The entire vedanta is condensed in the first line of this sloka. What is liberation? What is mukti?

**_Anāsthāēva hi nirvāṇam_ – **It is** **indifference of higher type, being casual. Whereas, aastha is interestedness - aasakti. Duhkha is the burden you have taken on yourself.

**_āsthā parigrahaḥ_ - **Feeding interest into the transactions we are in is āsthā. Minus of this is comfort.

See the second line of the sloka.

**_anēnaiva prayatnēna brahma sampadyatē kṣaṇāt - _**By such a resolve, _brahmasparsha_ takes place in one kshana or moment. If you practice this you are liberated in split second. Although it looks like an overstatement, it is true. Udaasina bhava is the key which has to be cultivated.

We will go to sloka 43.

**अविद्या यावत् अस्यास्तु न उत्पन्ना क्षयकारिणी,**

**स्वयमात्मावलोकेच्छा मोहसंक्षयदायिनी**.

avidyā yāvat asyāstu na utpannā kṣayakāriṇī,

svayamātmāvalōkēcchā mōhasaṁkṣayadāyinī.

<p style="text-align: right">
 (Sl.3-9-43)[^44]

_Svayamātmāvalōkēcchā_ - avidya stays till the urge for self introspection sets in. This urge to stay in self even annihilates the delusion caused by fake identification. Avidya will not go as long the interest to see inside does not arise. This is called _subheccha_ in the _Sapta Bhoomika_. When one gets this inclination all other steps of shravana, manana, etc follows and Vasishtha affirms that liberation is assured.

**अस्याः परं प्रपश्यन्त्याः स्वात्मनाशः प्रजायते,**

**दृष्टे सर्वगतेबोधे स्वयं हि एषा विलीयते. **

asyāḥ paraṁ prapaśyantyāḥ svātmanāśaḥ prajāyatē,

dr̥ṣṭē sarvagatē bōdhē svayaṁ hi ēṣā vilīyatē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-44)[^45]

_asyāḥ paraṁ prapaśyantyāḥ svātmanāśaḥ prajāyatē_ – The moment one realizes his true nature, avidya gets destroyed.

How did movement set in? How did outgoing forces come in? Because you forgot your true nature of restfulness. Moment the interest to know the self comes; outgoing forces start \to calm down. One is mutually exclusive but complimentary to the other. Moment you say that you are peaceful and there is nothing to get disturbed or distracted the true nature in you springs up.



* If you become a manonishta, mind oriented person, aatmanishtata, search for Self gets dropped.
* If aatmanishtata is encouraged then the mind gets dissolved – manonishtata gets dropped.

By looking at the _paratatwa_, Self, avidya naasha happens. Outgoing forces sets in, the moment you go off the track. Without going to sleep if one is able to sit, then that is sadhana. Remember the teaching of Yama to Nachiketa in Kathopanishad - _paraanchakhaani vytrunat svayambhuhu tasmaat --- na antaraatman_.

In a slightly expansive state thought cannot exist. Pictures and sounds vanish there when aakaasha dharma or spredness is established. This is exactly what happens when the nidra, sleep forces pull up, leaving you in _amaneebhaawa_, no mind state. When this is practiced in jaagrat, waking phase one is very peaceful and silent although there will be some movement in the minimal way, it does not disturb the peace that is already set in.

Being wakefully relaxed is the practice one needs to cultivate in sadhana. This is brahmaabhaayasa. Stopping manovyaapara and indriyavyaapara induces one towards the Self.

**अहं मनः, अहं इन्द्रियाणि, अहं व्यापारवान्.**

ahaṁ manaḥ, ahaṁ indriyāṇi, aham vyāpāravān.

**CºÀA ªÀÄ£ÀB, CºÀA E¤ÝçAiÀiÁtÂ, CºÀA ªÁå¥ÁgÀªÁ£ï.**

I am mind, I am the sense organs, I am activity are all anaatma dharmaas, non-Self qualities which are to be dropped. The false notion that, I am the knower - _Jnaatru_, I am the doer – _kartu _and I am the enjoyer-_bhoktru _has to be overcome and dropped. LET GO. Drop narrowness and go towards anantata.

As per Vedanta, jagat is just _naama, roopa karma_ – sound, picture and activity components If we stretch naama and roopa a little further then the creation itself crashes.For example, if picture formation is slowed down (a slow motion film) we cannot have a picture. If, say, pronunciation of _Ramaha gacchati_ is slowly done by pronouncing each letter like - R  a  a  m  a  h  a,  g  a  c  c  h  a  t  i - it loses its meaning. You get picture and sound when there is the right speed. If shabda is slowed down and drishya is slowed down mind dies and what remains is aakaasha, which is svaroopa. This means that it is expansive nothingness.

_dr̥ṣṭē sarvagatē bōdhē svayaṁ hi ēṣā vilīyatē_ - When one gets established in the knower (_jnana_) which has not become known (_jneya_) and thus is not localized and is all encompassing Self, the jagat of naama, roopa, karma gets dissolved. When naama and roopa disappears, the expansion sets in. The subtlest and the one without attributes sets in. There will not be divisions and segments. Then it becomes _sarwavyaapi_, all encopassing. Pundits and scholars say that one should catch the _brahma-atma ekatwa_. What do they mean? When you see explanation for this, one notes that giving up anaatma dharma is important than joining the Brahman and Atman. Shankara says this in his bhashya a hundred times. One should give up wrong understanding That means discarding the notion that I am the _kartru, jnaatru and bhoktru_ is Brahma abhyaasa.

We will try to understand _sookshmatva, niravayavatva and sarva vyaapakatva,_ a little better. If we say content of space, it is to say, here and there. Whenever you think of an object, you have to give a spacial link. But when you apply vyaapakatwa, khandatwa goes. So, Brahman by definition cannot have a-vyaapakatwa, but is only sarwavyaapi. Sukshmatwa is negation of _indriya gocharatwa_. A special localistion becomes _indriyagochara,_ characteristic of sthula, a matter. Shnakara continuously asserts that every indifferent mood carries this element of anaastha., Knowingly or unknowingly, we touch Brahman. LET GO is the only solution.



* For a fool, this let go is a matter of convenience and not a conviction. For him it is only escapism.
* But for a sadhaka, let go is a tool and is the essence of his sadhana. So, the two are poles apart. One can never be mistaken for the other.

For a jnaani let go is a precious treasure. It is a saatvic state. It is born of pareeksha supported by a strong theoretical base. It is a calculated response. For us, we have reached a new stage. We have turned the corner and we have to spend a lot of time to achieve a level of a jnaani. So, fear is impossible in that expansive state. This is a point to be noted between a taamasic and a sativic person.

That state is called as _sarvagata_, where you are awake but not perceiving khandatva, division. Every minding is localization. When you say it is here and there it pre-supposes localization. Moment you get that contour, you lose that sarvagata vyaapakatva.

The famous statement of Chandogya upanishad_– _

**यत्र नान्यत्पश्यति नान्यत् शृणोति ......**

yatra nānyatpaśyati nānyat śr̥ṇōti ......

and the one from Taittiriya

**कोहि एव अन्यात् कः प्राण्यात्..........**

kōhi ēva anyāt kaḥ prāṇyāt..........

are to be remembered here. If we had not touched the aakaasha dharma we would not have even lived! That let go is the main point for the sustenance.

Who complains about heart beat? Is anyone thinking about it? If all your transactions in life become like that, then the whole life is enjoyment. All the actions of praana and other activities can be reduced to such a situation that they do not bother you at all. Even if you remain for thousands of years it is not a burden for you. This is called saakshi bhava. In an expansive mood whatever you do does not burden you. This is the reason that Vedanta repeatedly says that one does not have to give up family for attaining the state of expansion where you are always happy. All reflex actions are in this saakshi bhava. This is called is called jeevan-mukti.

Memory is possible when the shell is small because the impression causing forces operate in a small shell. That is why we are able to recall. When you are in a expansive shell things do not gather to give you the memory. The expanded ego cannot take the impressions in a way that it can be recalled from memory.

Nidra cannot come if you do not drop minding. Only when you let go all the forces, then only you surrender to sleep. What is the dosha, defect? The expansive state that you get is also limited to a big shell and after a length of time a small pressure is built up which will put into that knowing mind and looking for details. For a jnaani this does not happen. Nidra has limitedness about vistaarata, where a sadhaka can break those edges and goes forward. There can be no comfort without vistaaarata. That is why the following famous saying is relevant here._ _

**योगरतो वा भोगरतो वा ,,,,,,,,,,,नन्दति नन्दति नन्दत्येव.**

yōgaratō vā bhōgaratō vā ,,,,nandati nandati nandatyēva.

A jnani is always in the expansive state whatever be the situation. Lord Krishna always remained in that situation. This is the yard stick for you to determine the state of being. Do you become incapable of focusing when you are in that expansive state? No. The power will not go. One can focus more at the periphery. When I focus, I become that part which I focus. But, for Ishwara that does not happen. Even a jeevanmukta is in that state. So the Vedanta’s greatness lies in the shell expansion giving rise to casualness. Jnaana can give you the vision, but cannot remove the speed element because this speed is a crystallized force. That is why we struggle more than the ordinary people. In the expansive state,forces do not bother you.

**इच्छामात्रं अविद्येयं तन्नाशो मोक्ष उच्यते,**

**स च असंकल्प शस्त्रेण सिद्धो भवति राघव.**

icchāmātraṁ avidyēyaṁ tannāśō mōkṣa ucyatē,

sa ca asaṁkalpa śastrēṇa siddhō bhavati rāghava.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-45)[^46]

_icchāmātraṁ avidyēyaṁ_ - Here one more definition for avidya is given. To desire is avidya.

_tannāśō mōkṣa ucyatē_ - What is moksha then? Dropping desiring or eradication of desire is moksha or liberation.

**यदा सर्वे प्रमुच्यन्ते कामा ये अस्य हृदि स्थिताः,**

**अथ मर्त्यः अमृतो भवति अत्र ब्रह्म समश्नुते**.** **

yadā sarvē pramucyantē kāmā yē asya hr̥di sthitāḥ,

atha martyaḥ amr̥tōbhavati atra brahma samaśnutē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Ka.Upa.2-3-14)[^47]

When all the kaamanaas or desires in you become zero or subside or become subtle, then you will attain the brahmic state even when you are alive.

_sa ca asaṁkalpa śastrēṇa siddhō bhavati rāghava_ - So, to get to that state one has to give up the sankalpa, wishing or volition itself. For example, if you do not wish to have your rasagulla, then the desire to get it does not arise at all. A sankalpa is a pre requisite to the appearance of the emotions such as likes or dislikes. So don’t invite pictures or situations in the mind. Then, on what can emotions play? They die down. This is the path to be followed. These are local hints for saadhana

**मनागपि मनोव्योम्नि वासनारजनीक्षये,**

**कालिका तनुतामेति चिदादित्य प्रकाशनात्.**

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-46)[^48]

manāgapi manōvyōmni vāsanārajanīkṣayē,

kālikā tanutāmēti cidāditya prakāśanāt.

_manāgapi manōvyōmni cidāditya prakāśanāt_ - When the light of the cit shines on you the darkness called vasana of the samsaara goes away. We have to continuously develop equanimity of mind.

_kālikā tanutāmēti cidāditya prakāśanāt_ - Even if forces of vasana reduced to a small extent, to that extent aatmabodha happens. Even if the intensity of outgoing forces comes down by ten percent, comfort increases to that extent. So, it is a gradual process and not instantaneous. And comfort or samaadhaana, shanti is equal to Brahman. That is the reason that one should not put oneself into deep vairaagya. Apply leisureliness to all external transactions and move slowly towards the goal.

Why do we say that taking things slowly is satva and not tamas? All of us agree that tamas is always there. But all those forces are volitional in the wakeful state. Satva, Rajas and Tamas are all forces with different intensities. We cannot call those forces as tamas which puts you in a rush for objects. They are only raaga or dwesha forces. But, nidra force is tamas. That is, Vedanta suggests not to hate the forces like irritability, sex pulls, jealousy. When such forces erupt in you, notice it and try to conquer it.

The famous Devi Stotra should always be on your mind_. _

**या देवी सर्वभूतेषु चेतनेत्यभिधीयते, बुद्धिरूपेण, निद्रारूपेण, चायारूपेण, शक्तिरूपेण, तृष्णारूपेण, भ्रांतिरूपेण......संस्थिते नमस्तस्यै, नमस्तस्यै, नमस्तस्यै नमो नमः.**

yā dēvī sarvabhūtēṣu cētanētyabhidhīyatē, buddhirūpēṇa, nidrārūpēṇa, cāyārūpēṇa, śaktirūpēṇa, tr̥ṣṇārūpēṇa, bhrāṁtirūpēṇa......saṁsthitē namastasyai namastsyai namastasyai namō namaḥ.[^49]

The force of hate that develops in you is more violent than the forces already in you. So we have to reduce the intensity of such forces residing deep in us. The aim is to reach moksha and the pressure that is built up because of that sankalpa is itself a severe one. Vedanta does not classify forces as noble force or ignoble force. The speed with which you go towards the object is the only matter of concern. If you rush to go to a temple, that very rush leads to suffering. It may be a noble thought never the less it is the speed that bothers you.

That was exactly what happened to Shikidwaja. His concern that he should give up everything is no doubt a divine thing, but he took it so seriously that the pressure became hundred times more than the concern he had on mundane things. So his chitta got spoiled a hundred times more. The factor is not that he had a very noble cause. But, his going into details and the speed with which he went, was the burden he had to go through since he was always in the mood of conquering the unruly forces. This aspect had to be put into his mind and this was successfully done by Choodala.

If one reads Upanishads casually, that does not give him the peace he needs. If the purpose of reading upanishad is to only satisfy or increase the already disturbed knowledge, then the whole purpose is defeated. Unless the internal forces are not conquered, peace will not set in. Even the desire to attain moksha has to slow down and the process has to happen gradually. When avidya – that is, _vaaasna, shakti, spandana, maya, aatmavismruti_ - is washed away, the Self reveals itself and vice versa. By knowing one’s expansive nature, all these violent or unruly forces get washed away. If one reduces the unruly forces, he touches the Self.

Sri Rama asks Sage Vsishta to describe more about the aspect of that ’Self’:-

**यावत् किंचिदिदं दृश्यं साविद्या क्षीयते च सा,**

**आत्मभावनया ब्रह्मत्यात्मासौ कीदृशः स्मृतः. **

yāvat kiṁcididaṁ dr̥śyaṁ sāvidyā kṣīyatē ca sā,

ātmabhāvanayā brahmatyātmāsau kīdr̥śaḥ smr̥taḥ.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-47)[^50]

_yāvat kiṁcididaṁ dr̥śyaṁsāvidyā_ - Whenever you cognize things, you are in the doing phase and that is avidya.

_kṣīyatē ca sāātmabhāvanayā_ - The avidya has to go by repeated remembrance of ones swaroopa as mere-ness or expansive non doing stuff. If by staying in ‘Self’ avidya goes, how to recognize Atma? How to identify ourselves with Atma? Vasishta replies_ _-

**चेत्यानुपातरहितं सामान्येन च सर्वगं,**

**यत् चित्तत्वमनाख्येयं स आत्मा परमेश्वरः. **

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-48)[^51]

cētyānupātarahitaṁ sāmānyēna ca sarvagaṁ,

yat cittatvamanākhyēyaṁ sa ātmā paramēśvaraḥ.

_cētya anupātarahitaṁ_ - cētya is a shrinking tendency resulting in taking note of things. Cit is swaroopa. A non-doing, mere wakefulness is svaroopa. When it comes to the focusing mood, the output of that focusing is the result of the watching process which is to know more about things like table chair etc. The result of a watching process is cētya. The pre watching state is cit. If the seeing process does not crystalise itself into objects, sounds and situations, then mind is in the pre state. Not going after these details, you tend to reach the cit.

_Sāmānyēna_ - It is a generality. Mind means localization into objects, activities, details, etc. Minus this localization, it is the general version of yours.

_ca sarvagaṁ_ - everywhere-ness means specialsations not having happened. Specialisation is opposite of Sāmānyatva. Localisation does not happen means sarvagaṁ or you are everywhere.

_yat cittatvam_ - This is your swaroopa principle. _anākhyēyaṁ** - **_This cannot be described. It is that which is there even before the words formed. So words cannot describe that! If I try to describe that state it means that I have come to the lower state because description is a localization affair. Talking, seeing, etc are all instances of localization. That is the subtlest point in Vedanta. One only gets to that state when cognizing stops.

_sa ātmā paramēśvaraḥ_ - That is Atma or Parameshwara.

**सर्वं च खल्विदं ब्रह्म नित्यं चिद्घनं अव्ययम्,**

**कल्पनान्या मनोनाम्नी विद्यते नहि काचन. **

sarvaṁ ca khalvidaṁ brahma

nityaṁ cidghanaṁ avyayam,

kalpanānyā manōnāmnī vidyatē nahi kācana.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-49)[^52]

_sarvaṁ ca khalvidaṁ brahma_ - If specialization does not happen then it is Brahman,. In other words the world or any pattern is spandana shakti of Brahman. We can remember Devi Bhagavata here which salutes Brahman vibrating in all kinds of forms wherein there is nothing like superior or inferior, meaning that it is pure spandana. All our problems are to choose and prefer, differentiate between likes and dislikes. Not to cognize is the way of sadhana as per first line of the sloka.

The second way of sadhana is if you have to see at all, then see the ekatwa or pavitrata in everything.That silence in me has another quality. It is dormant power of Self. But, it can manifest itself into activity. Jnaani’s emptiness is not idiot’s emptiness. The silence has immense power available but it is yet not revealed. We have to remember the famous sloka. (B G -3-22)[^53]

**न मे पार्थास्ति कर्तव्यं त्रिषु लोकेषु किञ्चन। \
नानवाप्तमवाप्तव्यं वर्त एव च कर्मणि. ** \
Na me pārthāsti kartavyaṁ triṣu lokeṣu kiñcana, \
Nānavāptamavāptavyaṁ varta eva ca karmaṇi.

There is nothing in the three worlds, O Partha, that has to be done by me nor is there anything unattained that should be attained by me, yet, I continue to engage myself in work.

The forces like kama, krodha, selfishness, selflessness, ego,etc emanate from either liking or disliking.They are all manifestation of spandana shakti of Brahman. All our attributes, whether good or bad, are developed over a period and thus have become our second nature.How can you hate that? One has to have universal compassion.

_kalpanānyā manōnāmnī vidyatē nahi kācana_ - If you emphasize the non doing aspect, chitta becomes empty and there is no world at all for you. Even if you cognize the world, such cognition should not bother you. When the samatwa of the mind is disturbed by the emotions which play on you, you get spoiled or disturbed.

Q. Is not compassion also an emotion?

A. Compassion has a small tinge of soft emotion, but it is very neutral in nature. Compassion is _adoora kevali bhaava. Prema, preeti. Bhakti, poojya bhava_ etc are all aspects of compassion. These are all very near to shanti or bliss. Growth in compassion is a sign of your not getting excited at all. At the highest level of compassion even that soft emotion to feel also dies down. Compassion arises when you do not prefer a choice. But chitashuddhi is happening. This is our wrong notion. Chittashuddi is nothing but swaroopanishta. A no chitta state is svaroopa.

Q. Either there is a desire or no desire. How can there be grades in that?

A. The shastra permits it and wants us to take it in that light. In fact Shankara goes to a higher level at this point.

**अकामः तत्त्वस्य उत्कर्ष अपकर्ष अनुस्मृत्य**

akāmaḥ tatvasya utkarṣa apakarṣa anusmr̥tya

**CPÁªÀÄB vÀvÀÛ÷é¸Àå GvÀÌµÀð C¥ÀPÀµÀð C£ÀÄ¸ÀäöÈvÀå.**

Science students know that the decrease of resistance is the increase of conductivity. So, both could have degree of variation since one is reciprocal to the other. A reduction in desiring can be taken as increase in non desiring to that extent.

Q. Can you desire to be non-desiring?

A. In the ideal way, NO. The desire for liberation is a stumbling block for liberation itself, though it is a noble desire. And liberation is that when this desre for liberation also gets dropped. It is a very big suggestion in advanced Vedanta. Any type of force is a problem. You must understand that rejecting is as much involving as capturing. One will be equally foolish in rejecting as the desire force is converted to disgust force with equal intensity,thus the force is not eliminated. How do you drop a desire without trying to drop it? Indifference is neither interest nor rejection. Gaudapaada has put this excellently:

**ग्रहो न तत्र नोत्सर्गश्चिंता यत्र न विद्यते,**

**आत्मसंस्थं तदा ज्ञानमजाति समतां गतम्. **

grahō na tatra nōtsargaściṁtā yatra na vidyatē,

ātmasaṁsthaṁ tadā jñānamajāti samatāṁ gatam.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Gau.ka.3-38)[^54]

_grahaha na tatra utsargaha na ciṁtā yatra na vidyatē_ - Going after things is not there. And, going away from the things is also not there. If there is no grahana or utsarga there will not be any chitta.

_ātmasaṁsthaṁ tadā jñānamajāti samatāṁ gatam_ - This is your samatva and this is your Atma.

**अहंकारं असत् विद्धि मा गृहाण विमुंच मा**

ahaṁkāraṁ asat viddhi mā gr̥hāṇa vimuṁca mā

**CºÀAPÁgÀA C¸Àvï «¢Þ ªÀiÁ UÀÈºÁt «ªÀÄÄAZÀ ªÀiÁ.**

We always cling to the ’I’, giving importance to that ‘I’. This is called _gr̥hāṇa. vimuṁca_ - At the same time we are also continuously thinking of giving up ‘I’, the ahankaara. That means you are again watching or taking notice of that ahankaara. Drop both. Let us say that you are taking the attitude of not becoming selfish. This is not the right way of saadhana. The focussing is intact. Selfishness focussed upon is there and a rejecting force is there. So, force never went and focussing never went. You are inviting the idea of selfishness and also the idea of rejecting it. What is to be done? Take neutral attitude. Be indifferent to both. Do not even take notice of that. A sloka from Kalidasa wherein he describes Vishnu just coming out of yoganidraa is worth quoting here;

**योगनिद्रान्त विषदैः पावनैःअवलोकनैः.**

yōganidrānta viṣadaiḥ pāvanaiḥ avalōkanaiḥ -

**AiÉÆÃUÀ¤zÁæ£ÀÛ «µÀzÉÊB ¥ÁªÀ£ÉÊBCªÀ¯ÉÆÃPÀ£ÉÊB**.

When Vishnu comes out of yoga nidra, the very sight of at that point, is sacred since the samaadhi stiti is a peaceful one. In the presence of Ramana maharshi and the sages of that calibre, one’s mind gets dissolved and all the questions get dropped. Even the list of questions that haunted Paul Brunton when he came to ask and corner the Maharsh, vanished in his very presence. These are the prescription for a man who is not in tamas. Coming to our discussion –

_sarvaṁ ca khalvidaṁ brahma nityaṁ ciddhanaṁ avyayam_. If you practice to sit quiet without disturbance for about six months, pictures and sounds hardly come. Thoughts lose without details. Mind becomes empty. You get the conviction that thoughts are mere swaroopa taking to specialization. That is all. _sarvaṁ ciddhanaṁ avyayam_. He is so much established in that non doing, that doing hardly happens. So how do you see the _kaarya kaarana sambandha?_ It is born out of swaroopa. The shaanti has begotten that activity and that activity is drowning into that shaanti again. _kalpanānyā manōnāmnī vidyatē nahi kācana_. - there is nothing called mind. It is svaroopa taking the shape and soon dissolved.

**न जायते न म्रियते किंचिदत्र जगत्रये,**

**नच भाव विकाराणां सत्ता क्वचन विद्यते. **

a jāyatē na mriyatē kiṁcidatra jagatrayē,

naca bhāva vikārāṇāṁ sattā kvacana vidyatē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-50)[^55]

When you move to that stage, you understand the value of these tools. He will be declaring about the non existence of mind. Mind just comes out of silence and dissolves into that silence. It has no sattaa. That is, the mind has no independent existence. Till now you continuously maintained the existence of mind. With this realisation you become casual with udaasina bhaava and finally even that dies.

**केवलं केवलाभासं सर्वसामान्यं अक्षयम्,**

**चेत्यानुपातरहितं चिन्मात्रमिहविद्यते. **

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-51)[^56]

kēvalaṁ kēvalābhāsaṁ sarvasāmānyaṁ akṣayam,

cētyānupātarahitaṁ cinmātramihavidyatē.

This is the description of Brahman. You do the _anusandhana_ of that stuff then the vaasnas will go.

_cētyānupātarahitaṁ cinmātramihavidyatē_ - once again objects are not forming at all, pictures are not forming and sounds are not forming. That state is called cit – inside it is mere wakefulness. Mind is nothing but self in the thinking mode or seeing mode. There is nothing like two entities, self and mind. Mind is Self in the functioning phase, that is, in the formation phase of picture, thought and sound.

**तस्मिन् नित्ये तते शुद्धे चिन्मात्रे निरुपद्रवे,**

**शान्ते समसमाभोगे निर्विकारोदिदात्मनि. **

tasmin nityē tatēśuddhē cinmātrē nirupadravē,

śāntē samasamābhōgē nirvikārōdidātmani.

<p style="text-align: right">
(SL.3-9-52)[^57]

Excellent adjectives are given. It is _nitya,_ because it is everlasting. _Śuddha_ - It is pure. _nirupadravē_, means there is no taxing or efforting phase. _śāntē samasamābhōgē_ - peaceful and absolutely steady, without any variation. _Nirvikārōdidātmani_ - in that pure, peaceful and non - efforting phase.

**या एषा स्वभाव अतिगतं स्वयं सन्कल्प्य धावति,**

**चित् चेत्यं स्वयमम्लाना मन नाम्न न उच्यते. **

yāēṣā svabhāva atigataṁ svayaṁ sankalpya dhāvati,

cit cētyaṁ svayamamlānā mana nāmna na ucyatē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-53)[^58]

Somehow in that state, thoughts start coming and once thought comes, it becomes mind. Otherwise it is so pure and so effortless, which means ananda. In ananda the labour or toiling of creating is not there. In the normal course, we keep on creating sound and pictures endlessly. That is, creating inside the counterpart of jagat in the form of naama, roopa, karma. So, effortlessness is the principle of ananda. Ananda is non doing and doing is burden. That is why it is said:

**प्रपंचोपशमं शान्तं शिवं अद्वैतं**

**चतुर्थं मन्यन्ते स आत्मा स विज्ञेयः**

prapaṁcōpaśamaṁśāntaṁśivaṁ advaitaṁ

caturthaṁ manyantē sa ātmā sa vijñēyaḥ.

<p style="text-align: right">
<strong> </strong>(Man.Upa.7)[^59]

_prapaṁcōpaśamaṁśāntaṁśivaṁ advaitaṁ_ - not the outside cognizing, not the inside cognizing as in a dream, not the mere vyaapaara as in ndira. Having given up the three aspects of the prapancha, the world, such a swaroopa has been considered ultimate.

_Sa aatmaa -- satu vijneyaha_ – you have to re understand that forgotten Self of yours.

Always mind is in the toilsome phase. But it can become less and less toilsome, if you incorporate slowness and defocusing in your day to day work resulting in removing fatigue aspect. Shastra never says that one should give up karma. Yoga is naidhaanya. Both eating and working are considered as aahuti. Feed that restlessness so that it becomes relaxed. Any force is a damped oscillation. Unless subsequent feeding is there it dies. Left to itself any vyapara dies down in anantata unless feeding is done. Neglected, it dies. Not fed anymore and having neutral attitude it dies. The feeding has to be reduced so that relaxation sets in. A diffused version of any localization is peace. We should become light hearted so that it can manage speed. If bhoga and karma are approached in a leisurely way with defocusing then it becomes adhyaatma sadhana or brahma saadhana.

**एतस्मात् सर्वगताद्देवात्सर्वशक्तेर्महात्मनः,**

**विभाग कल्पनाशक्तिः लहरीवोथिताम्भसः**.

ētasmāt sarvagatāddēvātsarvaśaktērmahātmanaḥ,

vibhāga kalpanāśaktiḥ laharīvōthitāmbhasaḥ

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-54)[^60]

_ētasmāt sarvagatāddēvātsarvaśaktēh_ - He is always powerful in the potential and in the latent way. _mahātmanaḥ _- that great stuff.

_vibhāga kalpanāśaktiḥ laharīvōthitāmbhasaḥ_ - then divisioning sets in. How? He gets power. Here, there, this, that, I, you are all divisions. This is the mechanism of creation. The undivided stuff, the everywhere stuff starts localizing which means gets divided. Special confinement has occurred. That is jagat. Here and there has set in due to its power. The whole of Yōgavāsiṣṭha talks in this language throughout its narration. Whatever power it releases, those units of powers start growing/ - _mananaat mana uchayte_. _Vivechanaat buddhiruchyate._ The respective indriya capabilities get strengthed. Tamas, rajas, karmendriya vyaapaara, any number of combinatins start building up.

**अतः संकल्पसिद्धेयं संकल्पेनैव नश्यति,**

**येनैव जाता तेनैव वन्हिज्वालेव वायुना. **

ataḥ saṁkalpasiddhēyaṁ saṁkalpēnaiva naśyati,

yēnaiva jātā tēnaiva vanhijvālēva vāyunā.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-55)[^61]

Now this is interesting. If this creation is because of the volition/decision or sankalpa of attention and doing, it can also be dissolved by non doing which is the counter sankalpa. It needs to be understood that we are discussing about the inner world and not the outer world. Let us say shraddha is helpful for creation. Atah- therefore

_saṁkalpasiddhēyaṁ saṁkalpēnaiva naśyati_ - since it is born of sankalpa (to watch, to take notice of, to worry, to solve, to excite). If you give the opposite of this sankalpa, it dies. If you make asanlakpa that you need not bother, not listen etc then the whole thing gets dropped. What a wonderful prescription for a saadhaka! As a saadhaka, you learn the uselessness of thinking or the unnecessary aspect of thinking. We have to ponder over these two things. The one that supports thinking is the notion that everything is useful because it gives me sukha. Therefore we keep on thinking. The other reason why we go on thinking is that I cannot help thinking as it is my very nature. Vedanta says –why don’t you examine these things? Is it a must? If so, thinking has to go on all the year round, day and night. If it is a nitya dharma, it cannot be dropped. But we do not think that always. So thinking is not a must for me. We have an option on the act of thinking. The two notions that thinking is a must and thinking is useful are smashed. Then you get the courage to sit quiet. The concept of usefulness of thinking is called _vipareeta Jnaana or ajnaana_.

Our first ajnnaana is to label ourself as a functioning stuff and the other is, it gives happiness and is useful. Vedanta suggests you to study both the aspects and come to a clear conclusion. You will see that happiness lies in non doing. Non doing is a part of my Self. Karma is a burdensome phase. So to drop this act, you have to develop _udaasena bhaava_. This is vichaara as per Vedanta. That is the best way for vaasnaakshaya.

**नाहं ब्रह्मेति संकल्पात् सुदृढात् बध्यते मनः,**

**सर्वं ब्रह्मेति संकल्पात् सुदृढात् मुच्यते मनः. **

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-56)[^62]

nāhaṁ brahmēti saṁkalpāt sudr̥ḍhāt badhyatē manaḥ,

sarvaaṁ brahmēti saṁkalpāt sudr̥ḍhāt mucyatē manaḥ.

_nāhaṁ brahmēti saṁkalpāt_ - Now he explains it further. As long as you keep on saying that, I am body, I am mind, etc. then you are caught.

_sudr̥ḍhāt badhyatē manaḥ_ - The mind is enslaved, imprisoned.

_sarvaaṁ brahmēti saṁkalpāt sudr̥ḍhāt mucyatē_ _manaḥ_ On the periphery all these ideas and sankalpaas can be created or destroyed. When they vanish it is Brahman. So,the non doing stuff inside me, is basically Brahman. What a beautiful explanation! When you decide that everything in you is Brahman, then you get liberated.

**कॄशः अतिदुःखी बद्धः अहं हस्तपादादिमानहम्,**

**इति भावनारूपेण व्यवहारेण बद्धते**.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-57)[^63]

kr̥̄śaḥ atiduḥkhī baddhaḥ ahaṁ hastapādādimānaham,

iti bhāvanārūpēṇa vyavahārēṇa baddhatē.

What are we doing all the time? Thinking that I am _kr̥̄śaḥ atiduḥkhī baddhaḥ ahaṁ_ - I am thin, I am obese, I am losing my eyesight, etc. We live in our lives always complaining about one thing or the other.This narrow outlook and approach in our living binds us.

**नाहं दुःखी न मे देहो बन्धः कस्यात्मने स्थितः,**

**इति भावनारूपेण व्यवहारेण मुच्यते. **

nāhaṁ duḥkhī na mē dēhō bandhaḥ kasyātmanē sthitaḥ,

iti bhāvanārūpēṇa vyavahārēṇa mucyatē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-58)[^64]

_nāhaṁ duḥkhī_ - I have no reason to be miserable. I am fine even in my old age and with all the shortcomings and debilities, I need not suffer. I am always happy. This type of attitude and argument gets you peace. I am not the body. Where is the bondage for the ‘Soul’? If the ‘I’ thought goes, all other things disappear. I need not suffer means that I can drop my thinking ‘I’ also. A residue may remain, that is permitted. Apart from the participating ‘I’,if the minding ‘I’, the focusing ‘I’or watching ‘I’ is not there, even the residue gets dropped. If you do not encourage the thoughts the watching ‘I’ gets dropped. If watching I is not there the thoughts are also not there. So, one has to drop the thoughts. Vasishtha declares that there are three ways of touching or reaching the origin:

1. You go by the process of neti neti, I am not this, I am not this (_a-kartrutva_), not the body, not the mind, etc

2. _Sarvam brahmeti sankalpaat_ – Conceptually look at everything as Brahman and hence the chitta looses separate identity and what remins is CIT.

3. Ultimately he says drop both _sarva kartutwa, akartutwa_. _Akartr̥tvaṁ_ is, taking a stand that I am not the doer of all this. _Sarva kartr̥taṁ_ - Everything is pure. Everything is His power.

Vasishta puts arguments for the three methods. Suddenly he suggests Rama to drop all these methods once for all and be steady in Self. (Y.V.4-5-14)<sup> </sup>[^65]

**अथवा सर्व कर्तृत्वं अकर्तृत्वं च राघव,**

**सर्वं त्यक्त्वा मनः पीत्वा योसि सोसि स्थिरो भव.**

athavā sarva kartr̥tvaṁ akartr̥tvaṁ ca rāghava,

sarvaṁ tyaktvā manaḥ pītvā yōsi sōsi sthirō bhava.

Why bother about _sarva kartr̥tvaṁ or akartr̥tvaṁ_? Drop both and swallow the mind, to be steadily established in the ‘Self’. So you can open the lock with any key you like. One shuld not insist for a particular method as superior. Coming to the sloka we were discussing.

_iti bhāvanārūpēṇa vyavahārēṇa mucyatē_ – If you think on these lines you get freedom. Note that watching tendency is itself a division and you can nip it in the bud itself.

I wish to mention a small point here to show as to how originality can count.

Let us say one gets into a sort of dream and strange things happen. That is about creation and to show that how powerful a dream world is! There can be a matching between my dream and actual parts of the world. My dream can be exact replica of the world (Refer to the story of Gaadhi in upashama prakarana). On verification, whatever dream he had, Gaadhi) a counter part was there in the world. So, one should infer that the impressions were so strong that this was imposed on the chitta and gave a dream version here. This world may be the ethereal world equivalent impressing on the mind of king Gaadhi. This can be a matter of discussion. Unless we have proof, like yogi pratyaksha then only we can infer on such statements.

One cannot see the world with both open and closed eyes. If you can attain such a degree of vistaarata as aakaasha dhrama, then strange things happen. The world appears to one, in accordance with corresponding order of mind where co vibrations are possible! Even then, we cannot say that this is unreal.

We cannot say that the world is unreal. One can only say that this world appears to those who work on the same level of vibration. If your vibration is more gross, this world is mere andha-tamas (blind faith). If your vibration level is more subtle, then the world has no details for you. If the matching order is disturbed you may not see the world at all.

For example, there are many types of sounds here, supersonic subsonic etc. If the frequency of a particular sound is less than or more than the stipulated level human system cannot report it as sound. Whatever is the capability of the human ear, only those frequencies are heard. Similarly, pictures and objects are visible which are in the frequency range between ultraviolet and infra red. Our range is only between that. So objects and picture form only in this range. If the indriyaas were different we would not see the world at all in this way. If our eye had the capacity to see ultra violet and infra red regions this world does not appear to us in this pattern. Our report of the world would be entirely different. If we had X ray eyes, we would be only seeing skeletons and not the muscle portion of human beings. Despite this, there is a particular pattern with every object. Otherwise differences should not have been there between objects.

When we say that everything is Brahman, we should know that all are not in that state. Otherwise, I could imagine someone and he would appear in front of me! Why do I see some form in front of me and none elsewhere? We can only infer that everything is the modification of Brahman because of there is intrinsic difference between two pints in space. Ancient thinkers did not know this. Even today many say that it is an undifferentiated Brahman. If Brahman were to be undifferentiated then everything would have been identical. If the content of the beings were to be identical at all points, then they must be having the same distortion. But the fact is that they are different. That is why I see X and Y differently, not the other way.

So there is some order in the pattern of vibration that my eye catches. When the kaarya dharma is cancelled then we can infer that everything is Brahman. Some specialization has happened and it has to be undone. But at different points, different types of specialization have happened. That is the vaaasna visheshata. I do not think how you think. You may not think like what X, Y or Z thinks. My associations are different. Your associations are different. Before the thinking process begins, you and I are identical - Brahmamaatrata. But once thinking has started, I could have abc thoughts and you could have xyz thoughts. Prior to that there is identity_, jiva brahma ekatwa_ due to aaakaasha dharma. When there is fall or change in aakasha dharma, jiva brahma ekatwa disappears. There is a disturbance in resonance. As long as both are in aakasha dharma there is coincidence.

All these variations are brought about by praana which are nothing but vibrations. But, vibrations can be different when it comes to details. Are they not all vibrations? The answer is yes. But that does not rule out the difference. Their intensity may be different. The content of spandana can vary. As per the definition, if you call spandana as Brahman then the least spandana is Brahman as per our Calculus model. One cannot think of zero spandana. The softest version of spandana is Brahman.

Energy can be in a general form or in a specialised activity. Energy is in general form in sleep and energy has a special activity in wakefulness. Never the less energy has to exist. This model proposed is very easy for an Indian thinker. Whether there is God or not, if you take to the act of surrender, the whole saadhana path becomes so simple. But when it comes to creation, then problems arise and a saadhaka should not worry about tackling the universe and creation. That is how parampara puts it.

Shankara repeatedly stresses this point. _Srustou aadharaha na kartavyaha. Paramaartha chinta eva aadraha kartavyaha_. So the idea of maya can be easily understood since maya is nothing but energy. Everything inside is spandana, is energy. It is very well known that even electrons, nucleus, etc is energy only. This has been very well proved in science. A real impenetrable object can be had by a specialized type of spandana. Our ancient people did not know the matter and energy are interchangeable. For a scientist, this is not a surprise.

<strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p>


<p style="text-align: right">
<strong>SAPTAPADĀM</strong></p>


<p style="text-align: right">
<strong> (SEVEN DESCENDING STEPS OF IGNORANCE)</strong></p>


After a detailed account on the play and control of the mind, sage Vasishta explains the seven states of ignorance, Saptapadām and also the seven states of ascent to wisdom, Saptabhūmikām. The first seven attempts are to clearly define the path to be avoided and the next seven are ascending paths to be nurtured leading one to the attainment of liberation from the shackles of life. It should not be literally taken as the stges one has to pursue to attain libeation. It is purely a guide or a marker to show where a sadhaka stands in his path of sadhana.

<p style="text-align: right">
                              - EDITOR</p>


L

ET US NOW GO INTO DETAILS AS TO WHAT SAGE Vasishta says on seven descending steps of ignorance or ajnaana.

**अतः परं प्रवक्ष्यामि शृणु राम यथातथम्,**

**अज्ञानभूः सप्तपदा ज्ञभूः सप्तपदैव हि.**

ataḥ paraṁ pravakṣyāmi śr̥ṇu rāma yathātatham,

ajñānabhūḥ saptapadā jñabhūḥ saptapadaiva hi.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-89)[^66]

He is now giving a model. ajnaana can be considered in seven steps. Similarly jnaana can also be considered in seven steps. This is a famous chapter in Yogavasishta which most of the people quote. Jnana till moksha is considered in seven steps. Similarly ajnaana can also be conceived in seven layers.

**पदान्तराणि असंख्यानि भवन्ति अन्योन्यमेतयोः,**

**एते प्रतिपदं बद्धमूले स्वं फलतः फलम्.**

padāntarāṇi asaṁkhyāni bhavanti anyōnyamētayōḥ,

ētē pratipadaṁ baddhamūlē svaṁ phalataḥ phalam.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Y.V.3-9-90)[^67]

_bhavanti anyōnyamētayōḥ_ - There can be any number of steps till the end point. A mile is having 8 furlongs. This is not final. A furlong can be divided into yards, feet, etc. _padāntarāṇi asaṁkhyāni_ – In between levels or grades, there can be many sub divisions. We often go by definitions and get caught in the definitions. For example, gunas are divided into three main divisions. But, Satva guna itself can further be sub divided into three levels. There is Ga (gandhaara) in music scale which can be sub divided in to slightly higher and lower levels in the scale. There is no rigidity in these sub divisions.

There is no sanctity that _mahattatwa_ and _avyaakruta_ are the only necessary steps between buddhi and swaroopa. Bhagavad-Gita has jumped one level while discussing these steps. In Kathopanishad also, while giving hints for sadhana one such step is jumped. It is only a matter of convenience. While considering spandana we can have any number of subdivisions. We have to see how they are helpful for a saadhaka. Importance is to be given in sadhana moving from coarser to finer and then still finer. Attention should always be as to how to reach softer states. Moving from regions of severity to softer and softer states should be the common theme for all sadhakas. You can work out this principle with any path of your choice.

_ētē pratipadaṁ baddhamūlē svaṁ phalataḥ_ _phalam_ – The steps are there to guide you to the end point.

The God you worship may not exist at all. Assuming that he exists, he may not give you or grant you any favours. In spite of this, Bhaktibhaawa works since you surrender your planning and scheming and pourusha. All your pourusha stops once you say that He will take care of you. Then nirmalata, serenity sets in the chitta, mind. So nirmalata is the target and the end point also. So bhakti is a wonderful tool. Whether one permits this or is outside its concept is of no concern to a saadhaka. For a student pursuing a Ph.D programme such dedication is necessary. But for a saadhaka it is a very easy method. So all the paths take you to the goal and give you the same result.

**स्वरूप अवस्थितिः मुक्तिः तद्भ्रंशः अहन्त्ववेदनम्,**

**एतत्संक्षिप्य तत्प्रोक्तं तत् ज्ञात्वा ज्ञत्वलक्षणम्**

svarūpa avasthitiḥ muktiḥ tadbhraṁśōhantvavēdanam,

ētatsaṁkṣipya tatprōktaṁ tat jñātva jñatvalakṣaṇam.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-91)[^68]

He starts showing the steps of avidya.

Zero avidya is _swaroopa avasthiti_ - that is liberation - that is mukti. _tadbhraṁśaḥ_ - A slip or tilt from that state or a fall from that is _ahantvavēdanam._ To me _ahantva_ (which is Mahat-Tatva) is a state where I cannot say that I am in a particular place. This is the first symptom of localization. This is a special placement in the antariksha. I can never say that I am there. I can say that I am here (Shastriji pointing to his head) as I am thinking here. My prana is working in this region of space.

There is no continuity at all in the world. Every object in the universe is undergoing expansion into nothingness and localistion into somethingness. Since this make and break is too fast, that it loses the continuity. A sub minimal softening has not even begun in many of us. We may have conquered the _arishadvarga_. That is the starting point for decomposition. Then the universe ceases to end. Praana ceases to be. Let us not worry much about these things.

I was explaining _ahantva _- The attitude, “to know” is localization. That is the subtlest state of mind, the sprouting stage of buddhi. _Vishaalata_ or expansiveness of mine has been now turned into minding. This means localisation has set in. Minding can be done at some point.This is _ahantvavēdanam_. This is in a very subtle version. Ahankaara, etc are later diluted versions. This is the prerequisite for formation of later course of steps. I have to narrow my vision, that means, narrow my ‘I’-ness to enable me to cognise a thing observed. This is called focussing. Focussing, means narrowing down of your wider version. This is ahantva-vedana. Brahman does not have that quality. If this localisation is smashed I become the akaasha. The entire creation is the performance of that power or shakti or force by which multi detailed universe is produced.. But it is the same process of minding – to know, to take notice of.

_ētatsaṁkṣipya tatprōktaṁ tat jñātva jñatvalakṣaṇam:_ I have condensed the whole thing and have said this. If you can note this you are in _jñātva_, you are in swarooapa. You note the difference between the process of individualization whether it is on the object or myself. If the object is nothing and mere focusing then, I can call it my ‘Self’. If the object is a book or flower, then it is only an object. That is all. But the process is common. I can narrow in to a flower or narrow in to nothingness. If I narrow into an object it is ahantva-vedana. This understanding is _jñātva jñatvalakṣaṇam_. If you can catch this point then watching automatically gets dropped. But, it is to be noted that, if you try to watch swaroopa, then swroopa is gone, since you have come to watching phase which is ahantva-vedana. This is the last subtlety in the sadhana. Mind has this dosha with a tendency to know and hence indulges in watching. When watching stops it is svaroopa. An excellent sloka of kenopanishad brings in clarity.

**यन्मनसा न मनुते एनाहुर्मनो मतम्,**

**तदेव ब्रह्म त्वं विद्धि नेदं यदिदमुपासते.**

yanmanasā na manutē ēnāhurmanō matam,

tadēva brahma tvaṁ viddhi nēdaṁ yadidamupāsatē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Kena.Upa.1-6)[^69]

What cannot be conceived or cognized by the mind is svaroopa. What is it? Whatever you are before you start functioning or conceiving. It is the power by which mind functions. That is Brahman. Brahman cannot be worshipped or meditated by mind. Vishaalata or expansiveness got lost when the mind starts seeing. All indriya vyapaaraas, activities are just matters of focusing. All the activities of sense organs are doing in a specialized respective way. Non doing is therefore Brahman.

Being established in Self or svaroopa is mukti. The sprouting of ‘I’ ness is a slip from the svaroopa. The divisioning of knower and the knowing that happens is ‘I’ resulting in creation of this jagat. The centre which sees is aham and the object that is seen is idam. This division is _bhramsha. _If one is set in the undivided pre-state, causal state or unmodified state it is mukti. _Vastu grahana_, catching the details or objects is bhramsha and it is an _ayaasasthana_, tiring phase. You may question what is so big about remaining in swaroopa. Shastra shows us the futility of remaining in _dvaitabodha_, duality, by mirroring our own suffering experiences. Unless we have the experience of swaroopa we will not be able to understand the uselessness of karma. Even working and involving without emotion also is ayaasasthana as it is labeling and seeing process. Without the help of shaastra it is not possible to get to a state of decomposing.

We have got the definition of mukti as well as swaroopa. It is surmised that the act of coming to the ‘I’ phase is a fall from swroopa. The absence of ’I’ is swaroopa. The path towards svaroopa or the destruction of ‘I’ through a thinning or softening process over a period can never be sudden. Severely concerned centre is becoming casual itself. Through softening the density of ‘I’ gets reduced whereas his existence gets increased resulting in ‘I’ getting merged in anantata, infinity or eternity. This is the only way we should take it. When the density is reduced or becomes less the volume automatically increases. I have given you in two lines everything about Vedanta.

**The seer is synonymous with seeing. When, seeing does not take place that is Swaroopa. Be causual inside or soft inside. Practice this day and night. **

Bulk of you can be in the diffused way or resting when you are focusing. Then it does not become a burden. Earlier my entireness was put on the job. Now in the expanded state, a little bit of focusing is there at some point because of the training I have gained. When it comes to sadhana, we need to diffuse the moment minding sets in. Catch this non focusing aspect and hold on to it. That is your _Jnatwalakshana_ or _moolalakshana_ of the seer.

**शुद्धसन्मात्र संवित्तेः स्वरूपान्न चलंति ये,**

**रागद्वेषादयो भावास्तेषां नाज्ञत्वसंभवः.**

śuddhasanmātra saṁvittēḥ svarūpānna calaṁti yē,

rāgadvēṣādayō bhāvāstēṣāṁ nājñatvasaṁbhavaḥ.

<p style="text-align: right">
 (Sl.3-9-92)[^70]

_śuddhasanmātra saṁvittēḥ svarūpānna calaṁti yē_ – To whom this mereness or non focussing has become steady or those who do not get disturbed from svaroopa they do not fall from that state. He will never be an ajnaani. Raga and dvesha, attraction and repulsion do not bind him.

Who so ever steadily positions himself in that state, for such a person there is no appearance of raaga or dwesha. If the moola or origin is handled, the others are automatically handled. When an upsurge of energy, that is released, hits the knot of ajnachakra it gets deflected. It moves to different indriyas and gives rise to any number of problems including ill health. When expansion takes place at that chakra any amount of upsurge in energy gets distributed into infinity. For such a person, how can there be raga and dvesha. In fact the forces of tamas and rajas get melted and dissolved in satva. Tackling focusing amounts to directly cutting the root and hence conquering the life.

**यत् स्वरूप परिभ्रंशः चेत्यार्थचितिमज्जनम्,**

**एतस्मात् अपरो मोहो न भूतो न भविष्यति**.

yat svarūpa paribhraṁśaḥ cētyārthacitimajjanam,

ētasmāt aparō mōhō na bhūtō na bhaviṣyati.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-93)[^71] 

Cit becoming cētya is known as _svarūpa paribhraṁśaḥ_. When chit starts to see objects then it is cētya. Cit becomes cētya on its own. Reminds one of the Upanishad mantra - _tadeva anupravishat_. That is the theme here. In one section of Vedanta it is said that if I see an object it amounts to creation. But, the object is already there and hence how that is created? In a more subtle way or in a cleverer way I can say that the moment I see the object I become that. That is, I vibrate in resonance. But, the object is already there. Focussing mechanism or localizing mechanism is involved in creation. In mukti or liberation de-localisation or diffusing mechanism is involved. In creation the fastness is brought in. In the path to upashanti or tranquility slowness is brought in.

**अर्थादर्थान्तरं चित्ते याति मध्ये तु या स्थितिः,**

**निरस्तमननाकारा स्वरूपस्थितिं उच्यते.**

arthādarthāntaraṁ cittē yāti madhyē tu yā sthitiḥ.

nirastamananākārā svarūpasthitiṁ ucyatē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-94)[^72]

_ardhāt arthāntaraṁ cittē yāti madhyē tu yā sthitiḥ._ – The state between two objects of grasping in the mind is _nirastamananākārā_ – if there will be nothing or no object to focus upon._svarūpasthitiṁ ucyatē_ – that is recognised or verily called svaroopa sthiti. It is the state of _chintanarahitya_, absence of thoughts or _a-sankalpa sthiti_, absence of desires.You have invited one picture. Then you are inviting another picture. Between the two what was the mind? After the elimination of one picture and before the arrival of the next picture what were you? **That is Swaroopa or Self**. **Between one thought and another thought there is a silent gap. You do the inquiry there. That gap is Swaroopa**. When you tone down the chetyonmukhata the gap becomes very soft.

**The transition point or kumbhana after inhalation and before exhalation or kumbhana after exhalation and before inhalation is Svaroopa**.

In language of time it is difficult to catch because thoughts are coming very fast to fill the gap. When nadhaanya sets in, one can be in the gap which is _akaashatva, amanaskata sankalparaahitya, svaroopa, Brahman_., If the crystallizing step or grossification of thought is discouraged or undone, then you are reaching Brahman. Then it is the pre state of mind. It is aananda because there is no toiling there..There is no picking of details. Gaudapaada’s famous statement can be remembered.

**निवृत्तस्य अप्रवृत्तस्य निश्चला हि तदा स्थितिः,**

**विषयः स हि बुद्धानां तत्साम्यमजमद्वयम्.**

nivr̥ttasya apravr̥ttasya niścalā hi tadā sthitiḥ,

viṣayaḥ sa hi buddhānāṁ tatsāmyamajamadvayam.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Ma Upa., Gau.Ka.4-80)[^73]

Chitta will be without any movement between two thoughts. What is so big about it? That is the transacting region of all yogis and jnanis. All jnaanis hover around that place and remain in the advaya stage. This is a mahaavaakya for saadhana. One has to constantly look out for the gap between two thoughts. Every saadhaka’s goal should be that.

We always go to that mood to know about an object. That mood is a prerequisite to the grasping of things. Every indriya vyapara or activities of sense organs are possible if the inside goes to that attention mood. The eyes start attending, the ears start listening, etc. This mood is a pre requisite for us to grasp these thoughts. All those details are got only when you pay one pointed attention to that particular property. On the same lines we proceed to know Brahman also. But it is a big NO, as it is your parama moola svarooppa. Hence this method of knowing is futile. Brahman is the cause for all your activities including your attention mood or minding process. It is quite natural that we go for searching that swaroopa. This is the biggest knot we have to untie. In the case of swaroopa that is not possible. But we get a doubt.

When we think of Brahman as a primordial swaroopa or state, then this method cannot be applied because your minding happens due to that swaroopa only. We always defined Brahman as a kaaranasthana, the causal state

One can argue as to why Brahman cannot be known through minding. In that case minding becomes paramasthana. If we posit that minding itself is the parama-sthana there should not be any other state prior to that and we should be minding all the time without a break. But shastra says that it is not correct since one is not in the minding state always. There are many times when one stops minding and capturing details. One has to do examination to see if the non seeing or non listening state is present or not. The example is nidra, sleep. Here, there is no seer, no attendee and no seeing. If we did not have the proof of nidra it would have been impossible to posit moolastithi by logic. Otherwise one would have thrown away the shastra. The entire essence is here. Brahman cannot be got by search done through the mind - _yan manasa na manute_, etc.

In minding we have the specifics of time and space. As long as you have this, there could be many minding states. It has a locus. You are minding your system here. She is minding her system there! Once you get a locus in the expanding state, the minding starts functioning. The state which one does not get into specialisation should be more fundamental. So we have got the evidence that there is a no minding state. Anything that has not picked up specialisation must be more fundamental. Physics also agrees and argues in this direction.

One cannot be minding always. Your own experience shows that minding is a taxing phase, efforting state. Whereas, a no mind state is a peaceful state, _anandasthana, vishraantisthana, madhurasthana_. Why do we come back to minding again when we are in that peaceful state? The best answer is that we take more time for the pressure to build up in the state of vistaarata or expansive state to come to that state. For a jnaani who is always in the peaceful state the tool is let go or _udaaseenabhawa_ and non attachment to mundane things, but still participating in all the activities.

Why does not the minding go to the less minding state than the peaceful state? This is because of our conditioning and _abhyaasabala_, force of habit. That means, we have not learnt the art breaking that aperture when we stretch ourselves. When you are in a specified speed, stretch does not happen is the main point of discussion. The capability of the individual system has to be taken into account for this type of problem. You can do minding in the soft way. At that point, the advising mind is also at the same speed. Once you develop udaaseena-bhaawa the barrier can be broken. So, a trick like japa for a short period to cut down the forces that might have developed is needed to get the required stretch. If you want to be in peaceful state without expenditure, it is through naidhaanya. I take the route of slowing down the breath. Any route which cuts down speed and helps one to go towards shanti is fine.

(My Lord, I make my prostrations to You. You are the One who has entered into me as my inner soul making me speak. My speech has been dormant all along. You are the One who makes my ears hear, my hands work, my feet walk, my tactile senses to feel, my life to vibrate - all by your Glory, my Lord, who wields Infinite Power.)

I salute The One who is directing my mind the ultimate centre which is stimulating my vocal organs or vaak, organs of karmendriyaas, organs of action, All are forces acting in different ways.

We have had a detailed discussion as to why minding is not the paramasthiti, but the penultimate state. We have also noted that minding state is duhkasthaana. It is a taxing phase. Whereas, the ultimate state is a comforting state. Here, we can once again recollect the sloka of Kenopanishat, _Yan manassaa na manute_........You come to the minding state the moment you fall from Brahman. The very first fall from Brahman is the minding phase. If you bring in naidhaanya in every karma you do, by adopting neutral activities like sweeping the floor, dusting the room, soft activities like japa, repetition of manrtraas which does not excite the mind, then it is possible to retain that vistaarata.Even if a research scholar, were to mentally decide to adopt this naidhaanya then his performance capabilities increase many folds. LET GO-ing or non minding is very much my nature as fixing. I had to struggle for ten years in my course of knowing Brahman finally to know the futility of focusing or minding.

Whatever you were prior to hearing, seeing, etc, know that as Brahman. Focusiing was the blunder I was doing during all those years. Minding does not take one to tne _moola_ or the source. In minding one is in the creativity phase. So what is to be done?

**सर्वस्यैव करणकलापस्य यदर्थप्रयुक्ता प्रवृत्तिः **

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-95)[^75]

(The state in which all the desires have become extinct, in which one remains motionless like stone, in which one is free from inertness of sleep or dream, is known as the state of abidance in Consciousness.)

A definition has been given regarding the mind which is without any sankalpa at all. To give more importance they give the comparison of a stone -- _śilāvat avsthtiḥ _- there is no chitta in any inanimate object. Chitta is very small in plant kingdom. It is slightly improved in animals and exclusively in humans. Although he is a human he remains like a stone (amanaskaha). As far as mind is concerned he is non-functioning as a stone. A saadhaka gets a hint that he should go to that much of non doing like a stone. There is no trace of any sankalpa at all in a stone.

_jāḍyanidrā vinirmuktā_ – But his state is rid of the inertness or jaadyaamsha found in the stone. Though there is no sankalpa, there is a very small spandana in the stone. Science postulates that there is nothing in the universe which is in no motion state. Everything vibrates. This is an undisputed concept. In a static stuff there are so much of held up forces which are at extra ordinary speed. Why is not visible then? It is not in the displacement way. There is only terrible to and fro motion without any displacement and thus is not visible. We cannot say that movement is not there, if there is no displacement.

Take the case of a ’Top’. It rotates against an axis. Earth’s motion around the sun is displacement, but the axial motion of the earth is not visible. Simple harmonic motion and axial motion are the two best examples we come across every day. Similarly the forces of the mind are like that. Jaadya is the characteristic of jagat and not of Brahman. That means in jagat there is a movement in the form of prana. There is a movement in the world which is not visible to the naked eye. That is called tamas or jaadya which is a held up spandana. Whereas, in swaroopa there are no vibrations, neither forces of motion as in rajas nor held up forces like in tamas. A sadhaka has to note and recognize this point. That is, softening of pranic vibrations should take place resulting in emptying of chitta. With this development the confinement should go. Our sadhana should be to defocus and merge in the expanse. Then all possible types of activities are eliminated. Does it mean that we should just vegetate? No there is a world of difference. Matter has a more horrible state of existence than mind. Mind has some capability to move back and forth and is not totally caught as matter. It is the mid state. It is not utterly helpless either. But, it is still not released from bondage like that of svaroopa. Chitta which has the quality of expansion is sliding towards coning resulting in confinement. From the view point of saadhana we have to see these two which are compliment to each other. Since we are always in the need to know, there is a confinement which is getting us into a focal point. That is the difficulty of the mind. _Prajna, praana, aakaasha_ are all synanimous.

**यो वै प्राणः सा प्रज्ञा या वा प्रज्ञा स प्राणः.**

yō vai prāṇaḥ sā prajñā yā vā prajñā sa prāṇaḥ.

**AiÉÆÃ ªÉÊ ¥ÁætB ¸Á ¥ÀæeÁÕ AiÀiÁ ªÁ ¥ÀæeÁÕ ¸À ¥ÁætB.**

<p style="text-align: right">
(Kaushitaki Brahmana)</p>


The Upanishad is asking us to understand that, wherever the word prajnaa is used, infer it as prana. Similarly, wherever the word prana is used take it as or understand it as prajnaa. These are softer and softer states. Prana spandana is there in minimal levels in akasha. It is the least activity state. Thus it is still kaarya brahma. A very soft spandana of prana is called as _aakasha_. Let us not go deep into the aspects of creation, etc, which will be of no help at all in our sadhana. These details in no way reduce our duhkha.One should always keep in mind that we have to go from gross to subtle. A saadhaka has to keep this in mind. To bear with the unpleasant responsibilities without getting disturbed, perturbed, irritated, etc. is Yoga and that purifies the mind to a great extent. Even when you are in karma, keep up the expansion and slowness in that state. The whole purpose is to reduce the spandana that gives rise to speed and focusing. This means that manas is going towards satva.

Let us try to understand the meaning of:

**तत्सृष्ट्वा तदेवानुप्राविशत्**  \
tatsr̥ṣṭvā tadēvānuprāviśat

**vÀvÀìöÈµÁÖ÷é vÀzÉÃªÁ£ÀÄ¥Áæ«±Àvï**

A more freedom carrying Self has tagged on with a less freedom carrying element that is the body. Body is made up of matter. There is static motion which does not carry the element of displacement. It is taamasic in nature. .Scientifically taken there is hectic activity in our body cells which is nothing but pranic vibrations which are confined and there is no displacement. The more freedom carrying element in us is my mental plane and the plane of prana. When compared to svaroopa this is a coarser, fallen level as I have entered minding phase. We also need to get the three dimensional spread.



* The movement of prana is purely linear with just up and down movement in the prana sharira.
* With a certain degree of chittashuddhi the feeling of linear movement of praana will be replaced with the feeling of spreadness or a wider coverage.
* That is, when prana comes to manas tatva it looses its confinement and gets diffused and spread.
* The activity in chitta is not linear. It is everywhere. My coverage or existence in chitta is everywhere. So, the praana of chitta is more superior to praana of praana.
* The praana of Mahattatwa is still diffused.
* When you touch Avyaakruta it is much more diffused.
* But when you touch SWAROOPA the diffusion is so much that it is not even aware of the praana movement.

See this point. Vyaana is attached to the body. But chitta is everywhere not connected to the body alone. If I conceive a mountain my chitta or mind has become the mountain. The whole panorama I view is my chitta. Cittashuddhi has already started in the vijnaanakosha because of the capability of discrimination. Therefore a controlled chitta is vijnaana. A purified chitta is vijnaana.

_Tasya shradhiava shiraha_ is the most important statement of the Upanishad. But mellowing of raaga, bhaya, krodha is happening inside although focusing is there to a degree. Scattered attention has come to a single point action because of the purification. In addition to the one pointed way, it has acquired certain virtues. Uncontrolled thinking has become controlled thinking. The western world thinks that performance is the best way of displacement. They do not know that it can lead to burdensome state, although their mind is regulated or channelised. They have not understood the point that non doing is a better state than doing state. The notion that one has to give up the action of mind has not occurred to them at all. This is most important to note that chittashuddhi is very important. Any mechanical work should not displease you once you remove the aspect of irritability attached to it. Vaasanaa kshya is very long drawn process.

You have come to a minimal level of purification if you have given up kaama, krodha etc. But the purification has to happen at a sub minimal level. You have to bring down the existence of mind and even you have to reduce the level of turbulence of prana. When we say minimal level of praana, it means the extra pressures like the hurry and impatience which are the acts of praana, and also the fretting and fuming have to be done away with. When that happens, the rate at which the praana movement is taking place becomes subtle. One has to try for that. Even the no minding is a softer state of minding. It is going to the purification of mind rather than going to a no mind state. If you jump from trupti to no mind level it amounts to forgetfulness, since trupi naasha cannot happen so quickly. The removal of the aspect of quickness is trupti naasha. You have to watch the seer and tell yourself that even the seer should see slowly. Then you can say that even the act of seer has come down.

Instead of dismissing abruptly the focusing and go to a non focusing stage tell yourself that the act of focusing shall also happen slowly. Everything that is arising in the chitta, if done in a toned down way by reducing the hurry element to conquer it, you are in real saadhana. It is not going from thought to no-thought state. This, we are doing in sleep already. A quick shifting does not eliminate or soften the forces. Why should you feel helpless when you sit in non doing way? Tell yourself that you should be able to tone it down slowly or absorb it. Then the growth takes place. You annul the focusing tendency as it is shaping. Such type of diffusion gives you a relief that you feel so happy and relaxed.

This is very nicely shown in Taittiriya Upanishad in that saama veda chant - _haaavu haaavu haaavu ahamannam ahamannam ahamannaado_ etc One need not go Himalayas. Wherever you are and in whatever posture you are, you have to diffuse. It is not your wife and children who are responsible for the burden that you are carrying inside you. Learn to sit peacefully leaving the urge to get that peace. Niadhaanya is the tool you have to apply and adopt everywhere including your karma. Bhagavad-Gita again comes to our rescue.

**यत्रोपरमते चित्तं निरुद्धं योगसेवया, \
यत्र चैवात्मनात्मानं पश्यन्नात्मनि तुष्यति.**

**सुखमात्यन्तिकं यत्तद्बुद्धिग्राह्यमतीन्द्रियम्, \

yasminsthitō na duḥkhēna guruṇāpi vicālyatē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(BG..6-20,21,22)[^76]

(In the stage of perfection called trance, or samadhi, one’s mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga. This perfection is characterized by one’s ability to experience the self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness, realized through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.)

It is a wonderful statement for saadhana. Even in the midst of terrible un-abatable forces of duhkha, one do not move out during sadhana. Such a person remains steady. Even if he is cut with a knife or sword he does not get perturbed. This exactly is the state when anesthesia is administered in a surgical operation. This is a test for jeevanmukta. Such a person gets himself unrelated to the body to such an extent that he remains in the state of anesthesia effect. It is possible to wake up a man who is sleeping, but the one who is under anesthesia effect it, is impossible to wake him up. This is the yardstick. The _deha abhimaana raahitya_ is not a notion. It is a psychological fact. We are getting a number of hints to understand swaroopa. Let us now see one more aspect.

**अहन्तांशेक्षते शान्ते भेदे निष्पन्दचित्तता,**

**अजडा या प्रकचति तत्स्वरूपमिति स्थितम्.**

ahantāṁśēkṣatē śāntē bhēdē niṣpandacittatā,

ajaḍā yā prakacati tatsvarūpamiti sthitam.

<p style="text-align: right">
(SL.3-9-96)[^77]

(When the ‘I’ notion has been erased and when the duality has been got rid of by the restraint of the mind, the illumining consciousness that manifests is known as Self.)

_ahantāṁśēkṣatē_ - When the spurana of I, gets destroyed - The I in us exists in three forms _kartru, jnaatru and bhoktru _(the doer, the knower and the enjoyer). The state of mind as a cogniser or perceiver is jnaatrutwa, to grasp the details of the vastu. This is one aspect of ‘I’. The other aspect of ‘I’ is to like and dislike cognized stuff and act emotionally. This is bhokrutwa. In order to get it or reject it one has to involve in karma or activity. This is kartatwa. These three aspects of ‘I’ need to get extinct.

_śāntē bhēdē_ – Then the division of experience and the experienced dies. One becomes akaashamaatra, staying in a very care free, expansive and spread region. When cognizing stops the other two stop. To look for details is the burden state that one should smash as it is not the road to ananda. But, unfortunately the world glorifies capturing of details which is ridiculed by shastra. What a tragedy? What a folly?

<strong>SAPTA BHŪMIKĀ</strong></p>


<p style="text-align: right">
<strong>(SEVEN ASCENDING STATES OF WISDOM)</strong></p>


A

FTER GIVING DETAILED ACCOUNT OF SWAROOPA IN different ways Yogavasishta takes up the discussion on the aspect of sapta bhoomika, the seven steps or stages of evolvement of a peson. We will try to know about these seven steps in the path of yoga sadhana or svaroopa praapti, knowing ourselves. How these steps can be identified and adopted in the process of saadhana is the subject matter of discussion.

**इमां सप्तपदां ज्ञानभूमिं आकर्णय अनघ,**

**नानया ज्ञातया भूयोमोहपंके निमज्जति.**

imāṁ saptapadāṁ jñānabhūmiṁ ākarṇaya anagha,

<p style="text-align: right">
(3-9-110)[^78]

_imāṁ saptapadāṁ jñānabhūmiṁ ākarṇaya anagha_ - Oh Rama listen to these seven steps that lead to jnaana praapti. _anayā jñātayā bhūyō mōhapaṁkē nimajjati na_ - By this you will get the clarity and confidence that you will not fall into the path of moha or delusion again.

**वदन्ति बहु भेदेन ज्ञानिना योगभूमिकाः,**

**ममः स्वभिमता नूनमिमा एव सुखप्रदाः.**

These steps have been told by many people in different ways in the sampradaaya. Many schools have different paths all of which are duly accepted by others. Here Vasistha accepts the variety. He says that, he prefers these steps which are capable of giving happiness.

**अवबोधं विदुर्ज्ञानं तदिदं साप्तभूमिकम्,**

**मुक्तुस्तु ज्ञेयमित्युक्ता भूमिका भूमिकान्तरे.**

_avabōdhaṁ vidurjñaanaṁ_ - Learned people have taught ways to understand Brahman. _tadidaṁ sāptabhūmikam _– This develops in seven steps.These seven steps lead to mukti as per sampradaya. In another method there are eight steps.

**ज्ञानभूमिः शुभेच्छाख्या प्रथमा समुदाह्यता,**

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.115)[^83]

After the seven bhoomikaas there is mukti. One who touches that state does not return to samsaara. There is no further conceiving for him. It is a non doing wakeful state. Rama, I will now elaborate these states which please listen.

These are the seven stages you have to recognise when you try to become an advanced sadhaka or try serious experiments inside. That is the introduction to the seven stages of development one has to go through to get to the Turiya stage. We will now go into the definitions and details of the seven steps of bhoomika.

The seven steps start from the first one called **_śubhēcchā_**. That is the turning point. A shift of interest towards the search for peace is a very important step. It does not come to millions of people. When one considers that life is stale and uncomfortable and he wants to go in search of that state which liberates him from the anxiety is the first step.

**किं मूढैव तिष्ठामि प्रेक्षे अहं शास्त्र सज्जनैः,**

**वैराग्यपूरमिच्छेति शुभेच्छा इति उच्यते बुधैः.**

kiṁ mūḍhaiva tiṣṭhāmi prēkṣē ahśāstra sajjanaiḥ,

vairāgyapūramicchēti śubhēcchā iti ucyatē budhaiḥ.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.116)[^84]

(Why do I remain a stupid person? Let me try to know the Self with the help of scriptures and wise persons. When such a resolve is made and is associated with vairagya detachment, that is the plane called subheccha desire for beatitude)

The first stage is shubheccha, an auspicious desire or wish. Even to get the first bhoomika man should be lucky. Nobody is interested now a days in the satsang in this world.

_kiṁ mūḍhaiva tiṣṭhāmi_ - Why am I wasting my time, my precious days like a fool?

_prēkṣēahśāstra sajjanaiḥ_ - I would rather go to the noble persons who are experts in the shastra and discuss with them about ultimate things. That is shubeccha. If the sankalpa were to occur in your mind, you have the first stage in spiritual progress. It does not come to everybody. No one is interested even in Vedanta classes. A turn in this direction is shubheccha. A fortunate person gets this interest.

_vairāgyapūramicchēti śubhēcchā iti ucyatē budhaiḥ_ - This is backed by an indifference to bhoga. When bhoga becomes stale (as everything became stale to Rama) – Rama got vairagya as the life became insipid. Life becomes stale and insipid. That is the turning point. Why does that happen? Achievements, flattery all look drab. All become silly. The best of the mundane achievements looks trivial when vairagya sets in. The charm for flattery and recognition are lost. A self conscious person cannot do that since everything becomes stale for him. You get to a situation where importance to living is of no meaning to you.

For Rama – hunting became stale (it is a necessary requisite for a Kshatriya, otherwise his valour, to face and kill a lion or tiger is at stake) and he did not show interest in affairs of the kingdom. As a Kshatriya he should encourage art, music dance etc. but this was all stale for him. That is the requisite for getting into this state for him. Repetitive and familiarity becomes a burden. Turning point to vairagya starts at this point. In our lives also we have seen that, if one builds a most modern house with all facilities, it becomes stale in eight days. This is very common with all the mundane achievements. This is the property of a bhoga. What is the solution? When one gets into the first bhoomika, he makes a sankalpa and turns towards teachers. All other things become useless and this investigation becomes a priority.The vairagya of Rama thus produced this classic work Yoga Vasishta. Visvamitra’s suggestion to Dasaratha to put the Guru Vasishta and Rama into a dialogue and thus YogaVasishta was born.

Psychiatry only suggests sedation when vairagya sets in and there is no answer to such problem in the regions of science. But a top psychiatrist is what a vedantin is. Advanced chapters in psychiatry are what spiritual texts are. After recognizing the melancholy of Rama and accepting his arguments the very first question that Sage Vasishta puts to Rama is – While appreciating your point that all life becomes stale, why should it make you sad and depressed as if everything is on your shoulders? Why should that make you depressed? One can be joyful even in monotony. - Rama realises this point which was very subtle. How does a viraagi behave in such circumstances?

**यॊगरतो वा भोगरतो वा संगरतो वा संगविहीनः,**

**यस्य ब्रह्मणि रमते चित्तं नन्दति नन्दति नन्दत्येव. **[^85]

yogaratōvā bhōgaratō vā saṁgaratō vā saṁgavihīnaḥ,

yasya brahmaṇi ramatē cittaṁ

nandati nandati nandatyēva.

Whether one is immersed in yoga or is reveling in bhoga (i.e., outward enjoyment), whether he is enjoying himself in social company or has retired into solitude, true happiness certainly cannot be his; but who alone is reveling inwardly in Brahman, (wherever he be), he alone will be truly happy and will verily enjoy. Nandati is a powerful word. He dances in ecstasy, joy, because that is his nature. How can his staleness affect his relaxed state?

To a curious question of Maitreyi, sage Yāgnyavalkya is forced to tell that any amount of money does not provide amrutatwa. She refuses the money and seeks the direction for liberation. The ten mantras that follow give us an extra ordinary insight into the way as to how one should approach the truth. The conclusion is the famous statement - _aatmaa vaa are shrotavyaha srotavyaha and nidhidhyasitavyaha._

It is also said that Mukti is assured for a person who has gone in to the first stage of subhaccha since he has turned the corner. This is called _mumukshatwa_. _Nigraha is upashama_, softening, mellowing or calming down the mind and not forced rejection.

**शास्त्र सज्जन संपर्को वैराग्य अभ्यास पूर्वकम्.**

**सदाचार प्रवृत्तिर्या प्रोच्यते सा विचारणा.**

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.117)[^86]

Investigation is the next stage. With the help of shastra and learned people one develops vairaagya. The most important is the _sadaachaara pravrutti, _bent of mind to follow right path, which can be called as _dharma-anushstaana_ and control of indriya. After one gets shubheccha the investigation should not be done rashly or without any controls. Dharma is indriyanigraha, controlling the senses.

**मनसश्च इन्द्रियाणां च ऐकाग्र्यं परमं तपः.**

manasashca indriyāṇāṁ ca aikāgryaṁ paramaṁ tapaḥ

**ªÀÄ£À¸À±ÀÑ E¤ÝçAiÀiÁuÁA ZÀ LPÁUÀæ÷åA ¥ÀgÀªÀÄA vÀ¥ÀB**.

** **(Bhishma to Dharmaraya in Shanti parva, Mahabharata.) Keeping mind and senses, indriyaas, under control is tapas.

**तद्धर्म: सर्व धर्माणां स धर्म पर उच्यते.**

taddharmaha sarva dharmāṇāṁ sa dharma para ucyatē.

**vÀzÀÞªÀÄð: ¸ÀªÀð zsÀªÀiÁðuÁA ¸À zsÀªÀÄð ¥ÀgÀ GZÀåvÉÃ.**

It is the nobler dharma of all other dharmas. This means that indriya nigraha itself is dharma. And is taken as _para-dharma_ or dharma of all dharmas. The same thought is reflected in Shankara bhashya on Bhruguvalli as to how Brahman is attained.

**एवं तपसा विशुद्धात्मा प्राणादिषु साकल्येन ब्रह्म लक्षणं अपश्यन् शनैः शनैः अंतः अनुप्रविश्य अंतरतमं आनंदं ब्रह्म विज्ञातवान् तपसैव साधनेन भृगुः.                       **(Tai.Upa.SB – 235)[^87]

ēvaṁ tapasā viśuddhātmā prāṇādiṣu sākalyēna brahma lakṣaṇaṁ apaśyan śanaiḥ śanaiḥ aṁtaḥ anupraviśya aṁtaratamaṁ ānaṁdaṁ brahma vijñātavān tapasaiva sādhanēna bhr̥guḥ.

Bhrugu realised through tapas that ananda itself is Brahman by way of negating and dropping one by one all his attributes. That is, whatever you conceive is the after position of Brahman. And thus chittashuddhi has to happen and the pramaatru or the observer also needs to get dissolved as observing is also a vyapara or activity. This is to be done through udaaseena bhaava or an attitude of neglect. How to adopt it?

**प्राणाश्चलन्तु तद्धर्मैः कामैद्वा हन्यतां मनः,**

**आनन्द बुद्धिपूर्णस्य न मे किंचित् भविष्यति.**[^88]

prāṇāścalantu taddharmaiḥ kāmaidvā hanyatāṁ manaḥ,

ānanda buddhipūrṇasya na mē kiṁcit bhaviṣyati.

Raga-dvesha or emotion centre is called as prana, Let the pranaas act according to their nature. In their accoustomed way let them keep going on. I need not worry. Let the mind be attacked by any number of desires. Then what? I am not at all minding any of these things. Those centres are functioning as a matter of their habit conditioning. I need not bother at all. This attitude takes one to the pre states.

The parental vasana for all vasanaas is, to know, to tackle, to attend, to solve, which is the general function at the ajnachakra – all come under minding. A general dis-comfort can be noticed at _bhrumadhya staana or ajnaana sthana_ which has no specificity. This is also called _moola-avidya or anaadi-avidya_ - Fundamental burden - Fundamental element of mortality or bondage. The sookshma vasana should go. All the other vasanas are specific to their respective indriyas which are elementary and get dropped when once you get diffusion or lightness. The confinement should go. _Jnana, svaroopa, naishkarmya, appeasing of prana, pramaatru hani, pramatru nasha_ are all identical. Defeat moolavasana by adopting udasina bhava or defocusing. This is vasanakshaya of the subtlest order. What is to be done in the name of _jnananishthe_? Shankara clarifies as under/

**अनात्म धर्म निराकरणमेव कार्यति.**

anātma dharma nirākaraṇamēva kāryati

**C£ÁvÀä zsÀªÀÄð ¤gÁPÀgÀtªÉÄÃªÀ PÁAiÀÄðw.**

Anatma means the forces, activities. These are to be eliminated so as to be in svaroopa. What is tapas?

**तस्मात् ब्रह्म विजिज्ञासुना बाह्य अन्तःकरण **

**समाधान लक्षणं तपः साधनं अनुष्ठेयम्.**

tasmāt brahma vijijñāsunā bāhya antaḥkaraṇa samādhāna lakṣaṇaṁ tapaḥ sādhanaṁ anuṣṭhēyam.

**vÀ¸Áävï §æºÀä «feÁÕ¸ÀÄ£Á ¨ÁºÀå C£ÀÛBPÀgÀt ¸ÀªÀiÁzsÁ£À ®PÀëtA vÀ¥ÀB ¸ÁzsÀ£ÀA C£ÀÄµÉ×ÃAiÀÄªÀiï.**

Therefore an ardent seeker of Brahman, has to control both sense organs and the mind as saadhana and do the tapas or penance. The state wherein the severe forces gradually become calm and soft is your svaroopa. Becoming quiet is the road to swaroopa praapti.

It is not sufficient if you just have subheccha. Have in-depth discussions, involving exchanges and question answers, with experts in the field. Also delve deep into shaastraas. Exchange your views with people who know the truth. The search has to be in a specialised style as indicated in the adhyaatma parampara. Do aatma pareekshna and also sukha-duhkha pareeksha. This type of enquiry leads one to an expanded state. Your mind becomes so pure that it cannot collect into a thought, unless there is a minimum potency fed to the mind. It cannot even begin to think. Therefore going to shaastra is very important in the method of vichaarana. One should go to a teacher who is a brahmanishta and a shotriya. Vicharana is a key point for continuing saadhana. Shastra gives a spectrum for sadhana. We have to judge ourselves where we fit into that and then follow that line of thought. Everyone is getting into the current of acquiring more and more comforts. For vicarana, vairagya is necessary. Otherwise you cannot do leisurely analysis. Interest for bhoga will pull you into the rat race.

Whatever vairagya that has begun is getting strengthened. This interest for mundane thing is weakening, not that he cuts his duty. In fact no saadhaka should cut his duty. Duty should never be compromised, just because you are spiritually oriented. You cannot make concessions. That is not permitted in Vedanta sampradaya. Vedanta sadhana cannot be an excuse for kartavyabhanga. Even Yaagnavalkya had to ask both his wives their permission before he took up sanyaasa. He had to explain to his second wife Maitrayi who was very keen on learning the truth about the ‘Self’. He gives the essence of Brahmavidya, how by constant practice only one could reach the ultimate.

_sadācāra pravr̥ttiryā prōcyat**ē** sā vicāraṇā_ - Contact with the text and contact with the teachers is an essential part of vicarana. This is a very important step. Otherwise how would you ever go beyond vijnanakosa which is an essential pre requisite in search of ananda. Supposing Upanishads were not there, how would it occur to you as to how to do atmapariksha and sukhadukha pariksha. That is why we should be grateful to the parampara, to the acharyas and the texts of the Upanishad. This vichara goes with sadācārapravr̥tti. It is to follow duties and responsibilities as laid down in shastra. It is nothing more than dharmaanustana. I was not strong on this aspect. I was not regular in performing daily rituals as laid down in shastra. One may ask as to whether it is not a loss. In fact Vasistha gives an exception in this regard as:

**सर्व सामग्र्यहीनापि तीक्ष्णप्रज्ञा यदि भवति.**

sarva sāmagryahīnāpi tīkṣṇaprajñā yadi bhavati.[^89]

If the urge is there terribly and if the intellect is there to grasp the substitutes, you can go ahead. Without these eligibility factors and qualifications if a student is truely earnest and has the capacity to do atamapariksha then he can go ahead. This is an unusual exception given. But, one needs to follow sadaachara. You cannot take liberty with life conduct.

Shbheccha is just change of direction, whereas, vicharana is the most important step. In my view, the best way of vichaarana is to proceed in the following lines which was enunciated by Chudala to Shikhdhwaja. **(**Y.V. 6-9-252)[^90]

**कोहं। कथमिदं जातं।**

**किं वा मरण जन्मनि।**

**कथं शाम्यति वेत्ति भो**॥

Kōhaṁ? Katham-idaṁ jātaṁ?

Kiṁ vā maraṇa janmani?

Kathaṁ śāmyati vētti bhō?

_Kōhaṁ**? - **_Who am ‘I’?

_Kathamidaṁ jātaṁ? **– **_What is this creation with its multiplicity? Does it have a single cause? These questions in cosmology and theoretical physics are haunting the scientists. Can we reduce the whole universe into one or two terms? Physicists of today are still with the four basic forces. Such questions, which are now being thought of by theoretical physicists, had already been raised by our Rishis, ten thousand years ago.

_Kiṁ vā maraṇa janmani?** -**_ What is life? What is death? Does anything survive death? Is there anything which is everlasting? Is there a residue after death?

_Kathaṁ śāmyati vētti bhō?_ - Tell me how this world subsides?

**कथं बन्धः कथं मोक्षः.**

Kathaṁ bandhaḥ kathaṁ mōkṣaḥ?

<p style="text-align: right">
(Y.V. 6-9-253)[^91]

What is this suffering? What is this helplessness? What is the solution? What is liberation?

**इति प्रश्नानुदाहरन् पारावारविदां पादान्कस्माद्राजन्न सेवसे.**

Iti praśnān-udāharan pārāvāravidāṁ

pādān-kasmāt rājan na sēvasē.

Posing such questions, go to the experts who have solved them. Go to a teacher not in a challenging way, but in a very modest way, with full faith and acceptance of the teacher's ability, by serving him, by looking after his comforts**.**

**साधूनां समदृष्टीनां परिप्रश्नेन सेवया,**

**संङ्गमेन च सा युक्तिर्लभते मुच्यते यया.**

Sādhūnāṁ sama-dr̥ṣṭīnāṁ paripraśnēna sēvayā,

saṁṅgamēna ca sā yuktiḥ labhatē mucyatē yayā.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Y.V.6-9-254)[^92]** **

It is not that the teacher gives some magic wand and the problem is solved or the teacher gives some blessing by which the solution is in sight. None of such things is quoted anywhere in _vedāntic_ texts. What does the teacher give you by way of _parihāra _(solution)? He gives you a style of logic, a line of investigation, a line of thinking by which your doubts are cleared. You don’t have to accept the teacher even. He gives you a fresh direction of investigation the result of which is an answer to the problem. That is what precisely _Vedānta_ does. You don’t have to accept anything. The student can argue with the teacher. This is what we saw earlier in the case of the post doctoral student who did not agree with his teacher and posed serious doubts. It is not possible to understand _Vedānta_ by listening to a lecture, but by repeated introspection and clarifying the doubts that arise in the mind - by one to one dialogue - by cross questioning the teacher - sometimes not agreeing to what he says and expressing freely one’s own point of view. In my case itself, I could get out of the torture in matter of moments on accidentally coming across the following sloka on my uncle’s suggestion.

**द्वित्वैकत्वदृशौ चित्तं तदेवाज्ञानमुच्यते,**

**एतयोर्यो लयो दृष्टयोस्तज्ज्ञानं सा परा गति:.**

Dvitva-ēkatva-dr̥śau cittaṁ tat-ēva-ajñānam- ucyatē,

ētayōryō layō dr̥ṣṭayō-tat-jñānaṁ sā parā gatiḥ.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Y.V.6-9-418)[^93]

That itself is ignorance if either the mind cognises several objects at a time or concentrates on one object only. If both these modes of the mind dissolve then that is the highest exalted state.

If _cāncalya_ (disturbance of mind) is a _bandhana_ (bondage) then _ēkāgratā_ (concentration or focusing) also is a bandhana. When these are put an end to, then that is liberation. Our usual way of thinking is that Brahman is attainable through searching. Till you get the right direction that one need to totally drop searching as otherwise we will be suffering. The searching mood should be undone. The prior state of this searching mood or the un-happening or the non occurrence of searching is Brahman. What is to be done? LET GO. Stop minding. Absence of the careful state, the minding state, the focusing state is the Causal state and that is Brahman.

_Tanumanasa_ is the next stage.

**विचारणा शुभेच्छाभ्यां इन्द्रियार्येषु अरक्तता,**

**यत्र सा तनुताभावात्प्रोच्यते तनुमानसा.**

vicāraṇā śubhēcchābhyāṁ indriyārthēṣu araktatā,

yatr sā tanutābhāvātprōcyatē tanumānasā.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-118)[^94]

When after these two states are fully developed in him, he abandons the natural desires and his mind is concentrated on one object at its will, then it (the mind) is rendered lean like Tanu (fine thread) and the third stage is reached, On realizing that ananda or happiness is not there in the mundane, worldly things one develops detachment, He starts his journey towards eternal happiness. In the third stage softening of mind takes place and gets into soft state. At this stage itself 50% of duhkha would have gone and equal amount of sukha would have come. An average person frets and fumes, gets confused and confuses others, he gets upset and upsets others. The mind of a person who is in this stage is a governed or half controlled mind. Bhoga is not totally dropped. But it is_, tanu manasa_ – mind has become thinner, softer, gentler.

It is thinning of the crude mind. Since vicara has already started and vairagya has set in mind which is calming down. The intensity of the unruly forces in the mind has visibly come down. He is leisurely and soft.

Tanu means a diffused mind or reduced speed of the mind or the oscillation of the mind or thinning out of the mind by a deep practice indicated above. The opposite of _bruhat is tanu_.

Satvaapatti is the next stage.

**भूमिका त्रितयाभ्यासात् चित्तार्थविरतेवषात्,**

**सत्वात्मनि स्थितिः शुद्धे सत्वापत्तिरुदाहृता.**

bhūmikā tritayābhyāsāt cittārthaviratēvaṣāt,

satvātmani sthitiḥśuddhē satvāpattirudāhr̥tā.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-119)[^95]

All desires being eliminated from the mind through the above three processes, Tatwa Jnana is developed and this is the fourth state of Truth.

Fourth stage is _satvaapatti_. In this stage the mind becomes more and more calm and when alone and left to himself thoughts do not come at all. Mind gets expanded. The thre aspects of jagat being - nama, the sound, roopa, the picture and karma, the movement come down. It becomes akaashamaatra.

Whenever mental aberrations come to rest, one reaches a stage of satva or soft vibration where the tamasic and rajasic fores have come down. Sattvaadhikya has increased because of vairagya and shradha. Chittashuddha sthiti or satvasthiti. Just soft vibrations. This is also because of the vichara. In fact, the vedantic position is that vichara or logic defeats the forces more powerfully than the discipline and all that. An absurd idea is simply dropped because one is convinced about its absurdity. Asamsakti is the next stage.

**दशा चतुष्टयाभ्यासात् असंसर्गफलाय च,**

**रूढसत्वचमत्कारा प्रोक्ता असंसक्ति नामिका.**

daśā catuṣṭayābhyāsāt asamsargaphalāya ca,

rūḍhasatvacamatkārā prōktā asaṁsakti nāmikā.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.3-9-120)[^96]

Beyond these is the fifth state when he disconnects himself from all Sankalpas by merging into the blissful enjoyment of true Jnana without association with objects.Where the aasakti is gone.

_asamshaktii naamika _- Lack of interest in the transactions or the vairagya sthiti. The different stages or degrees of development are being described in these bhoomikas. One is much more relaxed. Life is bearable and complaining has come down.

**भूमिका पंचक अभ्यासात्वात् आत्मारामतया दृढम्,**

**अभ्यंतराणां बाह्यानां पदार्थानां अभावनात्.**

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl,3-9-121)[^97]

bhūmikā paṁcaka abhyāsātvāt ātmārāmatayā dr̥ḍham,

abhyaṁtarāṇāṁ bāhyānāṁ padārthānāṁ abhāvanāt.

When these five states are fully developed in an individual, he is drowned in the bliss of Atma-Jnaana and then he loses all affinities for objects. After the ripening of these five states and the development of quiescence through merging into one’s own Self, all perception of objects, external and internal, is lost and the person, if at all he has any perception of objects, has it only through sheer external compulsion.

_padaartha abhhavani_ - is where one sits quietly not even seeing a picture or hearing a sound. In tanumaanasa pictures and sounds are thinning out and they do not get destroyed where as in padaartha abhaavani, the naama, rupa, karma does not appear at all inside the mind. The chitta becomes aakaasha maatra.

You don’t see the details of the world with eyes open. Drushya has gone and it is only akasha everywhere, very casual. One yogi who had done lot of sadhana used to tell me that he would recognise people only by their voice; he could not see them in flesh and blood. That means he may be seeing but, is not taking details at all. The world is getting destroyed for him. The sixth stage itself is very high wherein he on the way of an avadhoota.

In this stage one does not cognize objects, sounds, thoughts both internally and externally. Even in the wakeful state, he does not recognize details. The coherence goes when the mind becomes so silent.

When the practice intensifies there is no internal pictures and sounds also. This is called padaartha abhavani. By that time avadhoota sthiti develops in the person. He does not even recognise that he is sitting in his house or some one’s house. Sadaashiva Brahmendra was the only living avadhoota that we have heard.

**We, in this world, glorify the concept of sequential thinking. According to sage Vasistha, this is a defect and not a virtue.** But, world does not exist for a person who is in the sixth stage. There is nothing for him to report. Language fails to come out at this stage. You can compare this to a situation in a movie theatre, when the picture is projected in a slow motion, so slow that the whole picture disintegrates. One sees the parts appear in a completely disjointed way and not in unison. This is called utter decomposition of the world for a jnaanni - hence it is paddrtha abhaavani.

The seventh one is turiya sthiti. And in the seventh stage he just stays and at that stage he is free. The above is just to see the levels of highrarchy. Sadhana has to happen at the lower levels.

The first three planes pertain to the realm of sadhana or practice as the sense of duality has not been eliminated. For this very reason, the three planes together constitute the jagrat among the jnaana bhoomis.

The fourth plane, called svapna stage represents the state in which there is immediate cognition of Self. It is not combined with the first three planes which constitute the realm of sadhana.

The fifth plane correspondence to sushupti stage in the jnana bhoomis and at this stage, the person gets rid of notions of duality and experiences the advaitic state.

As aforesaid, the first three planes belong to the realm of sadhana. In the fourth plane there is immediate realization of Self. The planes 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> represent different levels in the experience of jivan-mukti, liberation-in-life. The seventh plane is akin to videha-mukti, liberation after separation from body. The distinctions in the level of jivanmukti arise on account of the differences in the degree of spiritual poise.

CHAPTER SIX</p>


<p style="text-align: right">
<strong>PRAHLĀDŌPĀKHYĀNAM</strong></p>


W

E WILL TAKE UP A CHAPTER FROM UPASHAMA prakarana from Yōgavāsiṣṭha for our discussion and deliberate. The chapter is that of Prahlada.The purpose of our study is limited to the saadhana part and we are not interested in the story as such. How the text deliberates on the aspect of liberation and search for ‘Self’ is more important.

There is an interesting story of Prahlaada who is an established Vishnu bhakta and his bhakti, devotion was of that order that whenever he thought of the Lord, the Lord would appear before him. He notices that his mind is absolutely at peace and serene during the hours of worship. Subsequent to this he observes that his mind getting unsettled – **किंचित् डोलायितम् मनः** - kiṁcit ḍōlāyitam manaḥ, mind is disturbed a little. Although he is fine and peaceful, there is still unrest in some corner of the mind. There is an oscillation and he tries to ask his Master Vishnu for a solution. He was having doubts about mystery of creation. Even devotion to God cannot give us paramaśānti – **परमशान्ति**, eternal bliss as there is some mystery which does not get solved. In the blank hours after pooja, he starts thinking about this status as what is “he”? What is the purpose or goal of this life? Such questions come to all of us. Imagine the plight of a सात्विक् - sātvik, a pious man, who is unable to solve doubts about the aspect of creation during his leisure hours.

When Vishnu appears at his call, he puts this question before him. Vishnu gives him a solution that he has to do ātmaparīkṣa - **आत्मपरीक्ष**, Self introspection to get rid of this type of oscillation of mind and till all questions get dissolved. He says.

**सर्वसंभ्रमसंशान्त्यै परमाय फलाय च**

**ब्रह्मविश्रान्तिपर्यंतो विचारोस्तु तवानघ.**

(YV.5-4-49)[^98]

(The Lord said, “O fearless soul, that which puts an end to all delusions ,that which confers on one, the supreme good, is attainable only through enquiry which culminates in the experience of oneness with Brahman and let this kind of enquiry manifest in you”)

Prahlada, may you be endowed with the spirit of enquiry till you rest in the infinite Brahman, so that all your delusions might come to an end and you may attain the highest fruit (blessing).Vishnu, only instructs him to do the pariksha, but, he does not give him details.

**पद्मासन स्थितः अपि मुदा ह्युपविष्ठः अधरासने**

**स्तोत्रपाठविधिप्रान्ते चिंतयामास चिंतया.**

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.5-4-52)[^99]

The Lord had commanded me to continually be engaged in enquiry. Hence, I shall engage myself in enquiry into the self. After Vishnu’s departure Prahlada sits in comfortable seat and starts investigation during the stotra pathana hours or during pooja. Muda is a significant word here which has to be noted.

stōtrapāṭhavidhiprāntē ciṁtayāmāsa ciṁtayā - He is leisurely. One should not worry as to how to do the investigation, but should remain relaxed. That is why after adherence to karmakaanda ways, you develop a minimal leisureliness. The advantage of going through the phase of karmakaanda is that, sufficient **चित्तशुद्धि**, cittaśuddhi happens during that period. Mind is sufficiently disciplined. One is trained into soft ways of performance. But sub minimal developments have not yet happened. Prahlada decides to do **विचार**, vicāra, enquiry as prescribed by Vishnu.

**किमहं तावदेव स्यां यः अस्मिन्भुवनडम्बरे**,

(This world, comprising of trees, mountains, grass, etc., is not myself. How can I be that which is exterior and insentient?)

Surely, I am not this world which is outside of me and which is inert, composed of trees, shrubs and mountains. I cannot be this plant, this tree etc .I am the cognisor, so I cannot be those objects which I am cognising. That is itself is a good step in locating “I”. I cannot be whatever I perceive. If I am the perceiver, I am something other than the object I perceived.

tatsyāṁ kathamahaṁ kila - Why I am not this? It is because they are jada – inert and inanimate. I am consciousness I am animate, I am chetana. Whereas, these are all a-chetanas – inanimate. We have discussed this earlier. Inanimate has a property that it cannot change itself. It is totally governed by Newtonian Laws; it is utterly helpless as per the law of inertia. There is not even a streak of self manipulation and is impossible and unknown in inanimate objects. An object kept in a place will remain there for any number of years unless acted upon by an external force. But, consciousness can change itself. There is an element of flexibility, self manipulation. By its own choosing, it can alter itself. That is why Prahlaada declares ‘how I can be that?”

(I am not the inert body which has manifested through the action of vayu and which gets destroyed in a short period of time.)

Nor am I the body which was born on account of the movement of the life-breath, and which seems to live for a very brief moment.

Next he thinks he may be the body. Since the body is short lived, I am not that. The body by itself is a-chetana,. A dead person’s body is unmovable by itself. So it is inanimate. Variation of the system is possible with me.

(I am not the inert sound which is perceived by the organ of ear momentarily which is of the nature of void and which arises from void.)

I am not sound (word or name or expression) which is apprehended by the inert substance known as the ear, which is but a momentary movement of air and which is devoid of form and devoid of existence.

Then he takes upon activities of sense organs one by one. This is to be assumed. I am not the śabda, the sound. This is one of the activities of senses. You can listen to shabda. You talk through shabda and again this is a-chetana. If I was identical to shabda, I should not be able to change. But, I can change. It may be an outcome of me. This is an important position in Vedanta. In the Saankhya philosophy, they have the position, that janya janaka saṁbandha - **जन्य जनक संबन्ध** or kārya kāraṇa saṁbandha – **कार्य कारण संबन्ध**, between pursha and prakriti is not possible. Purusha is different and prakriti must be something independently different. Therefore consciousness cannot beget jada, inert object. But, in Vedanta the Conciousness is the ultimate cause of the whole universe.

Sound is a jadavastu. If a light pulse is there, it is of a specific frequency. It cannot change by itself. It has to be monitored. So I can convert myself into a thing of fixation type, with specificities. I can produce a jadavastu. Sound is a jadavastu. When I produce a jadavastu, I can be that. Therefore jada is also an outcome of the multiple possibilities. So chetana has infinite possibilities. Fixing oneself repeatedly on a particular thing, it becomes jada.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.5-4-58)[^104]

I am not the sense or experience of touch, which is also momentary and which is able to function only on account of the infinite consciousness.

Even the sparśa, sense of touch, belongs to this category of inanimate. So, I cannot be that. A touch which is recognised is once for all jada. I have been responsible for the touch. Hence I cannot be that. So, I am more fundamental. If indriya vyaaparaas are not there still I could produce. The other argument could be my existence without sound or touch. Therefore, I cannot be identified with vyaapaara. Any scientist should agree to this logic and argument. I could produce a vyapaara or I could stay without that. I could exist without touch.

(Sl.5-4-59)[^105]

Nor am I the sense of taste based on the ever changing and restless tongue ever devoted to its objects.After sparsha, coming to rasa, sense of taste, it is unsteady. It means, a taste relished and you drop it. It has a dropping quality. So it is chanchala – wavering. It depends upon the taste carrying substance. So I am not the rasa.

**दृश्यदर्शयोर्लीनं क्षयिक्षणविनाशिनोः,**

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.5-4-60)[^106]

I am not the sense of sight (or form) which too is momentary and which is absorbed into the seer.

I am not the rūpaṁ or form also, by the same argument. So a big component of the jagat is rejected. While I am producing jada entities, but I am not that, because if I were that then I should always be only that way. I can cognise a picture or stop cognizing the picture. I can exist without the work called grasping a picture. One can close the eyes and invite a picture. What are the defects of such a picture? It gets reabsorbed in my **मूलस्वरूप**,** **mūlasvarūpa Therefore, it is क्षणिक - kṣaṇika or momentary. Where from the picture comes? What am I before I project a picture? When I close my eyes, there is nothing visible. Then that state is the pre-state (nothingness). Then you invite a tree. So you have created a jada. Can you be equated to the tree? No. Because, it can be reabsorbed – kēvalē draṣṭhari kṣīṇaṁ - It is absorbed into the observer. So how can I be the picture? These are after positions of me, cancelling which I shift back into pre-position. So, I am not anything of the jada type of jagat.

Nor am I the sense of smell, which is an imaginary creation of the nose and which has an indeterminate form. I am not the smell either by the same argument.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.5-4-62)[^108]

(I am indeed pure consciousness, bereft of the illusory five sense-perceptions, without the notion ‘mine’, without mentation, conception and imagination.)

Hence, I am devoid of all these imaginary qualities. I have nothing whatsoever to do with the functions of these senses. I am pure consciousness. I am peace beyond thought.

I am minus of the activities of roopa, rasa etc. When one penetrates to see what is thinking, it is replica of the indriya vyaapaara inside. Thinking is nothing but shabda formation or drushya formation. It is only inner talking or inviting pictures. Whatever the bahir indriyas or sense organs do in the world outside, if it is done inside, it is **मनोव्यापार**, manōvyāpāra. So it is nothing but **इन्द्रियव्यापार**, indriyavyāpāra, without the aid of the indriyaas. A duplicate, a replica, a **सूक्ष्म**, sūkṣma, subtle version, also called as **तन्मात्रा**, tanmātrā, (mind is indriyatanmatra), a subtler version of the pancha jnaanendriyas (sense organs), which the body is provided with.

nirmamōmananaḥ śāntō – a peaceful state without activities. Just because pictures have vanished, you are still not at peace, since the tendency of the urge to know, keeps us haunting all the time. The urge to do any activity is chetyonmukhata. That is the main suffering inside. One is in the questioning mood, the searching mood most of the time. We keep on searching. That is the subtlest version of human suffering which is chetyonmukhata. If you can recognise it and drop the folly then it is MUKTI (liberation). Absolutely effortless and no toiling state is aananda. Dukha is efforting, labouring and toiling. Vyaapaara is duhkha. Minus that is aananda. It is as simple as that. (Sl.5-4-63)[^109]

**चेत्यवर्जितचिन्मात्रम् अहमेव अवभासकः,**

**सबाह्याभ्यन्तर व्यापी निष्कलामलसन्मयः.**

cētyavarjitacinmātram ahamēva avabhāsakaḥ,

sabāhyābhyantara vyāpī niṣkalāmalasanmayaḥ.

I am the all pervading reality which is devoid of objectivity and therefore precepts and concepts. I am pure consciousness. It is by this consciousness that all things, from a little pot to the mighty sun, are perceived.

After these deliberations, Prahlada comes to a big conclusion and ponders over thus. What am I? I am Cit transformed into the details of the world called cētya. The preposition of cētya is cit. So cētya varjita - before the formation of thought takes place, I am nothing but cinmātram. The locus is gone, when pin pointing is dropped.

For example when I see, you, my citta has gone there. I have localised myself. The truth is, I have become ‘you’. I have become the other person. Every picture I see is my chetana only which is all pervasive and without any confinement. My citta, which is sarvavyaapi (all pervasive) cētana vibrates in resonance with the other person’s body. I become you when I see you. Every seeing is becoming, vibrating in parallel resonance at that centre. I can withdraw the resonance in vibration. That is MUKTI. When I do not vibrate in resonance with the things around me, I am at peace with me and fine.

Although the world exists, I stop vibrating, that is all. So cit, my consciousness, is everywhere. It is not one’s inside. That is why, when I see you. I can at once recognise you as I am able to become ‘you’.

sabāhyābhyantara vyāpī niṣkalāmalasanmayaḥ - niṣkala – no locacalisation, amala –pure, sanmayaḥ - chinmaatra.

So, I am pure consciousness. Now after he discovers this, Prahlaada wonders and says Ah! I have got it, I have got it!

This looks to be a simple study, but it is a tremendous study. It can simply reshuffle your values and tells what you really are! We think this deep involvement in doing all these activities is a must for all of us to live. But shaastra shows you that you are a pure stuff. That is why this exclamation on the part of Prahlaada.

We get this similar expression in Taittiriya Upanishad also. In Ananda Meemaamsa the Rishi dances in excitement. “I do not want to rejoice over something else; I rejoice over myself. I am wonderful”. ‘O Wonderful, O Wonderful’.

‘Ha-a-a-vu, ha-a-a-vu, ha-a-a-vu’

One goes on making sounds like this; that is, ecstasy is boundless; make any sound because one does not know how to express ecstasy!

_Aham annam, Aham annam, Aham annam._

_Aham annaado Aham annaado Aham annaadah_.

‘I am the eater of food; I am also the food that is eaten because this ‘I’ is sitting in the food also. I am the eater of the food; I eat myself as the food.’ These are Upanishadic statements. These are ecstasies of great Masters of yore. This is something wonderful to hear for everyone who would like to meditate for the sake of the realisation of Brahman.

It was similar wonder like when Archimedes, forgetting that he is nude, wonders, that he got the answer to the King’s problem - says eureka, eureka – I found it and runs to the street.

**आ इदानीं स्मृतं सत्यमेतत्तदखिलं मया,**

**निर्विकल्प चिदाभास एश आत्मासि सर्वगः.**

ā idānīṁ smr̥taṁ satyamētattadakhilaṁ mayā,

nirvikalpa cidābhāsa ēśa ātmāsi sarvagaḥ.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.5-4-64)[^110]

Ah, I now recollect the truth that I am the Self which is omnipresent, in which there is no conceptualisation.

Prahlaada says, Oh! I know! I have found that: I am nirvikalpa – I am changeless. I am without the vikalpa – without formation of roopa, shabda, etc. Cinmātra means mere awakeness, consciousness, nothingness, mereness but not having any लक्षण, lakṣaṇa, attribute of the indriya vyaapaara type. This whole world is nothing but the appearance of my own cinmātra. Hence it is Cidābhāsa.

ēśa ātmāsi sarvagaḥ – I am everywhere.

One of you, the other day was asking me, a question as to what is diffusion and how to culture diffusion? Shastra says, our swaroopa is diffusion. I am everywhere, but when I see entities, I become this small, this small and pick up the lakṣaṇa available here in the present (Shastriji demonstrating by hand). Otherwise I am everywhere. I am kēvala caitanya, pure consciousness. I have not become anything of the roopa, shabda type when I am not taking details. Therefore, I am pure caitanya. Since there is no effort and transformation, I am pure, happy Self. Why don’t we get that feel always? Even if object formation is not there, we will be in the state of cētyonmukhata. There is a small movement in all of us. That is **प्राणव्यापार** prāṇavyāpāra. So even **प्राणस्पंदन**, prāṇaspaṁdana, vibration of vital force has to quieten, then only it is Atma. It is difficult for sadhana, but for appreciation of this position, it makes very good study.

If you try to read between the lines, when sound is not produced and roopa is not formed, I must be fine. Isn’t it! No, there is still a prāṇavyāpāra! Suppose I am clever enough to avoid picture and sound, I am still in the spandana phase (chetyonmukhata phase). To the extent the measure of this mere general activity decreases, the measure of joy increases. In a virtuous person it will be like this way – He will be for a majority of time in the general version of the specialised activity, not coming under any indiryavyapara like seeing, listening etc. It is a mere vyaapaara. This is the first phase of growth. Then one has to keep telling oneself that even this general vyapara is not necessary. Then that general vyapara calms and starts coming down.

Till now, we encouraged the evil quality in us which had become natural tendency. One will realise now that, he has become a different person. One will say to oneself that he will not allow the prāṇavyāpāra going. He starts settling down. Then the joy of bliss, the comfort, the relaxation comes to him. Every cell starts vibrating in resonance. This अनाद्यविद्या, anādyavidyā or the मूल अविद्या, mūla avidyā, the general prāṇavyāpāra is the main culprit.

Vedanta says that it is not necessary for you to stay in the moola avidya phase. In nidra, deep sleep, one did not have the praana vyaapara of the visible type and that is also a coming and going type of thing. It is, in a sense, a perishable thing because praana can be manipulated. First of all, you have to kill the forces at the argument level itself, so that saadhana is possible. The forces have to die down by suggestion and implementation. That is the vedantic contribution. The whole world is of the opinion that one has to be active and thinking for achieving happiness. Vedanta says it is not necessary. Nirvikalpa is a good adjective for explaining this phase. (Sl.5-4-65)[^111]

**मयिएव चेतनेनेमे सर्वे घटपटादयः,**

**सूर्यांता अवभासंते दीपेनोत्तमतेजसा.**

mayi ēva cētanēnēmē sarvē ghaṭapaṭādayaḥ,

sūryāṁtā avabhāsaṁtē dīpenōttamatējasā.

It is by that ‘Self’ that all the senses and their experiences are made possible, for it is the inner light. It is because of that inner light that these objects acquire their apparent substantiality.

Prahlada concludes that he is becoming all the objects as they get existence because of his projection of them right up to the Sun. I conceive and cognise the sun, therefore the sun is there. ghaṭapaṭādayaḥ - all x, y, z objects. All these objects originate in my mind due to my creation. It is difficult to say that all this is born of me. But, we can apply the argument internally and note that we can create anything. I can create a sun in the dream! But, Katha Upanishad declares that:

**न तत्र सूर्यो भाति न चन्द्र तारकम्**

**नेमा विद्युतो भान्ति कुतोयमग्निः**

**तमेव भान्तमनुभाति सर्वम्** **तस्य**

**भासा सर्वमिदं विभाति.**

<p style="text-align: right">
(Ka.upa.2-2-15)[^112]

na tatra suryō bhāti na caṁdra tārakam

nēmā vidyutō bhānti kutōyamagniḥ

tamēva bhāntamanubhāti sarvam

tasya bhāsā sarvamidaṁ vibhāti.

(There the sun shines not and the moon has no splendor and the stars are blind; there these lightnings flash not, how then shall burn this earthly fire? All that shines is but the shadow of this shining – of Self; this entire universe is effulgent with his light)

In that world of self illumination, there is no Sun. How did the object become visible? Under the illumination of Atma, the sun and hence all other objects get illuminated. I can become any type of object in the roopa or shabda format. Indriya vyapara of all types is possible. Shankara in his bhashya opines as:

**तस्यैव भासा दीप्त्या सर्वमिदं सूर्यादि विभाति.**

tasyaiva bhāsā dīptyā sarvamidaṁ sūryādi vibhāti,

**vÀ¸ÉåöÊªÀ ¨sÁ¸Á ¢Ã¥ÁÛ÷å ¸ÀªÀð«ÄzÀA ¸ÀÆAiÀiÁð¢ «¨sÁw.**

sūryāṁtā avabhāsaṁte dīpenottamatejasā.- So,Prahlada says that he is light itself, brilliance itself.

Because it is formless and because it is the cause of all effects, this universe has arisen in it, with all its diversity

All the indriya vyaaparas that everybody constantly do are all projected from me.tējasāntaḥ prakāśēna – by the tejas, radiance that is inside me, by my property of creative power - agnikaṇapaṁktayaḥ.

**विरिंचिसदनात्पारे कल्पान्ते अपि अहरत्पदम्,**

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.5-4-67)[^114]

It alone is the cause of the manifestation of the trinity - Brahma the creator (Virinchi is Brahma), Vishnu the preserver and Siva the redeemer; But, IT is itself not the cause. Prahlada got such an expansion that he could only say that he could see the unlimited space and all the worlds are his projection. They exist because of his taking note of them.

When you sit for meditation, you are not comfortable on the first day because in spite of your closing the eyes and not cognisiing the world, there is movement inside with pictures and sounds. Suppose you drop them, then the real saadhana starts. You should sit like a child. You need to have conviction that nothing could bother you. Nothing should exite you. It is not your natural dharma. It is your aaropita, super imposed dharma. Slowly things begin to calm down. On that day, you begin to see all pervasiveness around you. Diffusion results when specification does not happen. It is the negative way of putting.

**अयं नामाहमित्यन्त:कुतो निरवलम्बनः,**

**अपर्यान्ताकृतेरेषा किलासीत्स्वल्पता मम.**

ayaṁ nāmāhamityantahakutō niravalambanaḥ,

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.5-4-68)[^115]

(When my being is unbounded and unconditioned, how could there be the limited identification caused by the notion ‘I’)

My true nature is not this small ‘I’, the cognizing ‘I’ (chetyonmukhata person is not me). I am just expansive and so the lower ‘I’ does not exist now at all. Lower ‘I’ corresponds to the focusing state. Bigger “I” is सर्वव्यापी sarvavyāpī, all pervasive. Smaller “I” is a struggling person and is in duhkha sthaana. Not encouraging the lower I should be the sadhana inside. Diffusion happens by discouraging the focusing attitude. Negating finiteness is the only way of understanding infinity. Moment you make effort to know infinity, you are already reducing it to finiteness.  Getting involved in the searching phase is the opposite of diffusion. Letting go is the one that guides you to diffusion. Shankara while defining Brahman uses the three phrases as follows:

**सूक्ष्मत्व**,** निरवयत्व**,** सर्व व्यापकत्व.**

sūkṣmatva, niravayatva, sarva vyāpakatva**.**

**¸ÀÆPÀë÷ävÀé, ¤gÀªÀAiÀÄvÀé, ¸ÀªÀð ªÁå¥ÀPÀvÀé.**



* sūkṣmatva is undifferentiated or subtle or atomic.
* Niravayatva means having no contours or edges as objects have, no khandatwa. Anything in the world has edges. Not having edges means it is everywhere. Not having contours is aatma.
* Uniformly spread stuff is sarvapyāpakatwa. A pure aatmic state. In the words, Satyam jnanam anantam brahma. Ananta is not to be thought of. It has to happen.

aparyāntākr̥tērēṣā kilāsītsvalpatā mama - Prahlada wonders that he unnecessarily took to searching, getting details of objects by inviting this viewing “I”.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.5-4-71)[^118]

All these activities, forms, general vyaapaaras and everything, are coming out of the pure stuff.

There is a proof for the above statement. Suppose you are relaxed, calm and quiet and there is no activity. A thought comes or a stroke of anxiety spring up. Where from it originated? How did the activity spring up? What was the source? It is a no-activity state. This activity has come from a prior position which is an ocean of silence. This is the missing element in physics. They do not know where this energy is from. My answer to them is here is a proof for the missing region of science. Activity is born of the previous silence state and gets back into the same - Utptadyantē_,_ vileeyantē, **उत्पद्यन्ते, विलीयन्ते**. The whole universe is projected and absorbed. So the Vedantic model can explain the universe.

Q. Is this state of silence called Hiranyagarbha?

A. Hiryangarbha, though correct in a way, is not the ultimate position. It is the penultimate position. There is still a very small spandana or vibration. A jnani outgrows Hiranyagarbha. Hiranyagarbha is a very expansive state with a gentle spandana and is the penultimate position. This you can call as avyakruta or hiranyagarbha or the bija of the srusti (creation) and all that. When the severity of vibration is sufficiently brought down and therefore a very big expansion takes place, we call it, avyakruta. If this also sinks into immeasurable space, then it is swaroopa. Hiranyagarbha is still a part of creation, A jnani goes beyond hiranyagarbha. In Hiryanagarbha there is still a spandana which is the bija or seed of all the details.

Q: Could Jnani be one of those spandanas?

A: jnani dissolves even that spandana. First of all in the fitness of things, he should identify. There is one identity and that is in the soft state. But jnani works beyond. He rejects the participation with the universe even to the level of Hiranyagarbha.

In fact there is a sloka in Yogavasishta which is terrifying! A question arises as to what is Self, when you go beyond Brahma, Vishnu and Iswara. These trinities are toiling to some extent. One for creating, one for sustaining and one for dissolution. Looking at them, the jnani says “poor fellows, they are still caught up” They are worthy of our compassion as per the jnaani. But, the level of hiranyagarbha is a holy level. Each higher being in the cosmic structure, is hundred times more in Aananda due to the stretch he is having. Slowness and expansion qualities are continuously increasing as we go up in the hierarchy. This is enumerated well in Taittriya Upanishad while dealing in the levels of samadhaana, equanimity of man, devaas, Indra, Trinities, etc. Less of vega or speed and more of expansion is our measure stick. The maximum level of expansion is of Brahman. He is in satta samanya koti. Not even pulse of movement whatsoever. We should take this in the Calculus language. Otherwise how can one come back when he goes into samadhi?

(When the three periods of time, past, present and future are ignored, when the bondage caused by the chetya, object, is erased, when the object itself is totally un- cognised, there is only the residual equanimity.)

kālatrayaṁ upēkśiṇyā - Present, past and future are gone. hīnāyāḥ cētya bandhanaiḥ – Cit got liberated from the limitations of becoming cētya.

citaḥ cētyamupēkśitryāḥ - This cit, minus the cētya, the corruption, samataiva avaśiṣyate – then that state of samata only remains – undifferentiated state.

(Since that state is beyond description of words, it is as though non-existent. It is identical with the state where there is no self, as it were.)

sā hi vācāmagamyatvāt – What is that state? How can you describe that state? It is beyond words. The moment you think of sitting quiet, it is difficult even to describe that state. You have no positive description for consciousness. That is – not this, not this – is the best definition of Brahman. Shankara says that satyam, jnanam, anantam Brahma is an approximate definition of Brahman, because there is no positive lakshana for brahman. Absence of all that you can describe is svaroopa.

Iha is desire. Heya upadeya - desire and hate. īhānīhamayaiḥ – man is full of that quality. We are continuously selecting and rejecting. This is called raga, dwesha, heya-upaadeya, ishta-anistatha. If you can stop this inner dialogue, the commentator inside, you are a MUKTA. We always classify things as good or bad, likeable and dislikeable, beautiful or ugly. This is the nonstop internal dialogue. What is the way out? Stopping this itself is a maha saadhana. Ten days of this type of saadhana you can come to a neutral state. The inner dialogue has become almost a second nature for man. Unknowingly he is doing it like a – pāśabaddhēva pakṣiṇē - like a bird in the cage or a bird tied to a loop, the person moves about in this universe.

(Human beings because of the delusion caused by the pairs of opposites like desire and aversion, become in-distinguishable like creatures thriving in the holes of earth)

What a tragedy? We are caught continuously by icchā dvēśa – desire and hatred, raga and dwesha, attraction and repulsion, pair of opposites, kīṭānāṁ samatāṁ gatāḥ - caught up in a hole like a worm.

**आत्मने अस्तु नमो मह्यम् अविच्छिन्न चिदात्मने,**

**लोकालोकमणे देव चिरेण अधिकतो अस्मि अहं.**

ātmanē astu namō mahyam avicchinna cidātmanē,

lōkālōkamaṇē dēva cirēṇa adhikatō asmi ahaṁ.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.5-4-76)[^124]

(I salute the expansive, unbounded consciousness, which is my Self. A jewel of this and the transcendental world you are, O God, I have realized the Truth after a long time.)

Once again salutations to this pure stuff inside me. avicchinna cidātmanē - means without division – a-khanda. Divisioning is creating objects, pictures and sounds - vikṣipti (**विक्षिप्ति**).

lōkālōkamaṇē cirēṇa adhikatō asmi ahaṁ – Oh! I discovered myself this pure God after a long time. I got my true nature. In Vedanta, names of Vishnu, Iswara, etc are not mentioned anywhere. Even a student comes to a teacher and asks: **औपनिषदं पुरुशं पृच्छामि** - aupaniṣadaṁ puruśaṁ pr̥cchāmi.

I am interested in that purusha as enunciated in the Upanishads. I am not interested in other gods. We are only interested in the consciousness which can become anything. If it does not become anything, it is pure and resting. That is the source of this universe.

**परामृष्टोसि लब्धोसि प्रोदितोस्यचिराय च,**

**उद्धृतोसि विकल्पेभ्योयोसि सोसि नमोस्तुतॆ.**

(I have reflected upon you, attained you, realised your ultimate form, understood you distinctively from imaginary entities and my salutations to you who is of such nature.)

(Salutations to my Self who is infinite. Salutations to you, the auspicious Being. Salutations to God of Gods, to the Supreme Self)

I can call IT, the pure stuff, mahyan as I can call IT tubhyam. Thinking about Vishnu it is tubhyam. Thinking of me is mahyam. Anantāya - both of us are limitless.

namō dēvādhidēvāya parāya paramātmane - Oh you are the God of the gods. You are the supreme, salutations to you!!


    **तिष्ठन् अपि हि न आसीनो गच्छन् अपि न गच्छति,**


    **शांतः अपि व्यवहारस्थः कुर्वन् अपि न लिप्यते.**

śāṁtaḥ api vyavahārasthaḥ kurvan api na lipyatē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.5-4-80)[^127]

(Though he remains standing, he is not there. Though he moves, he moves not. Though calm, he is active. Though acting, he is untainted.)

We give definitions in various ways. What is the Atma? I am stationary and I am working there.

Even when IT is in the functioning stage, it has not lost its Brahma-hood. Co-existence is possible. Like the famous mantra:

**पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेव अवशिष्यते.**

pūrṇasya pūrṇamādāya pūrṇamēva avaśiṣyatē.

**¥ÀÆtð¸Àå ¥ÀÆtðªÀiÁzÁAiÀÄ ¥ÀÆtðªÉÄÃªÀ CªÀ²µÀåvÉÃ.**

Even after a big slice is taken out of the terrible infinity, a big slice still remains. It is a valuable point for saadhaka. I could come to a level where even while I am doing any number of activities, as they are happening so distant as it were; my silence is not affected at all. This is a growth that a person in vyavahara has to have. Ex. Janaka’s way, Janaka was a jeevanmukta. He could rule kingdom even after attainment of Brahmajnana. Most of him is resting in Self. Whereas, at the indriya level he can perform. If you are silent and expansive inside, amount of work that you do outside is of no concern at all. The indriya vyapara is not affecting me at all.

**इन्द्रियाणि इन्द्रियार्थेषु वर्तन्त इति धारयन्**.

indriyāṇi indriyārthēṣu vartanta iti dhārayan.

**E¤ÝçAiÀiÁtÂ E¤ÝçAiÀiÁxÉÃðµÀÄ ªÀvÀð£ÀÛ Ew zsÁgÀAiÀÄ£ï.**

There is a stimulus, there is a response. I am not doing anything but remain quiet and fine. My balanced state of mind is not at all upset by this doing. That is the way in which jeevanmuktas or people who have got this trick do their profession as doing the obligation warrants them. This is called the phase of co existence. If you just relax, a little more, it is a wonderful position. World will be different to us, complaining stops. (Sl.5-4-90)[^128]

**जयप्रोड्ढामराकार जय शांतिपरायण,**

**जय सर्वागमातीत जय सर्वागमास्पद**.

jayaprōḍḍhāmarākāra jaya śāṁtiparāyaṇa,

jaya sarvāgamātīta jaya sarvāgamāspada.

Jaya means praise, hail. Having realised the aatman Prahlada goes on to praise the Purusha in many ways.

**इति संचितयन्नेव प्रह्लादः परवीरहा,**

**निर्विकल्पपरानन्द समाधिं समुपाययौ.**

iti saṁcitayannēva prahlādaḥ paravīrahā,

nirvikalpaparānanda samādhiṁ samupāyayau.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.5-4-92)[^129]

iti saṁcitayannēva - Now it is a deep flash, thinking in this way Prahalada, must have touched the state of satta samanya koti and reached steadiness state. When a steady state is reached, there is nothing to come back from it. The larger the expansion of the shell, the lesser the time it takes for steadiness. Prahalada touched that state because of the chittashudhi he had attained in Mahaa Samadhi.

**निर्विकल्प समाधिस्थः चित्रार्पित इवाबभौ,**

**पंचवर्षसहस्राणि पीनांसोतिष्ठदेकदृक्.**

nirvikalpa samādhisthaḥ citrārpita ivābabhau,

paṁcavarṣasahasrāṇi pīnāṁsōtiṣṭhadēkadr̥k.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.5-4-93)[^130]

citrārpita ivābabhau – In nirvikalpa samaadhi, the whole body became steady like a picture. Pancha varsha sahasra - This is fear causing and is impossible is our position. How blood cannot coagulate if somebody is in that state for 15000 years! We have to humbly accept shaastra vaakya in this context. Chudala supports this;

**सर्वथात्मनि तिष्ठेत् चेत् त्यक्त्वा ऊर्ध्व अधो गमागमौ,**

**तत् जन्तोर्हीयते व्याधिः अन्तर्मारुत रोधतः.**

sarvathātmani tiṣṭhēt cēt tyaktvā

ūrdhva adhō gamāgamau,

tat jantōrhīyatēvyādhiḥ antarmāruta rōdhataḥ.

<p style="text-align: right">
(YV 6-9-81)[^131]

(If prana remains in all circumstances within the body, abandoning all upward and downward movements, the diseases of the person perish, since prana is totally restricted within.)

There is a wear and tear in us because of nonstop up and down movement of breath. tyakta ūrdhva adhō gamāgamau - Supposing you can suspend this up and down movement, tat jantōrhīyatē vyādhiḥ - then all your disease goes, meaning that you become everlasting.

What is the programme? The up and down movement in us is suspended. What are we? This pranic movement – so there is wear and tear. Suppose you can do a mahaa kumbhana and suspend that movement (antar marnta rodhata) then aging stops.

antarmāruta rōdhataḥtiṣṭhēt tadaa jantōrhīyatē vyādhiḥ – a terrible dreadful conclusion in Chudala Upakhyana and Bhushunda Upakhjana. I cannot agree – I cannot disagree. That s why, when I talk of Vedanta, being a careful scientist, I do not touch creation at all, for want of proof. But, so for as ananda chintana is concerned, I can prove it in two minutes and convince you. Let us treat creation aspect reverentially. The whole Yogavasishta is full of such anecdotes which are difficult to digest.

Q. How is it that this has become a part of Valmiki Ramayana?

A. I do not know. Somebody in his anxiety to get fame might have tagged this with Ramayana. Shankara has not quoted a single line from Yogavasishta, whereas, Vidyaranya profusely quotes the text in Jeevanmukti Viveka. Virtually every second line in the book there is a quotation from Yoga- vasishta.  Should we say that the text is in the time between Shankara and Vidyaranya, or we say may be Shankara had his own way of putting Vedanta not depending upon texts other than Upanishads. Yogavasishta has much more slokas than in Ramayana itself.

We would be more concerned with the wisdom than history. At the sravana level one may feel that Yogavasishta is repetitive and jarring, but if one goes to the manana phase after exposure to vedantic ideas, then the book may be of immense help. Manana is a long drawn programme before nididhyasa. Nididhyasa is crystallising the idea concluded in the manana process and settling down to experience.

Extremely contrary to our conviction, here is a shastra which says that you are a non doer.  Happiness does not lie in involvement. Happiness does not lie in object and sense organs and indriya making a contact,.  But we are bound to that thinking and it looks seemingly happiness lies there.  On deeper probe, you realise that this contact was only an agency in giving you a state of happiness and that state of mind is an empty state of mind.  A life time conviction is shattered in one stroke. The logic of Vedanta is so powerful, even scientist cannot help appreciating it.  It is so correct that one has to agree. That is what happened to me.

CHAPTER SEVEN</p>


<p style="text-align: right">
<strong>BHUŚUṆ Ḍ ŌPĀKHYĀNAM</strong></p>


H

ERE IS A CHAPTER WHICH SHOWS THE GROWTH OF spiritual level until one touches nirvana levels in the path of sadhana or even attain the state of jeevanmukti Jeevanmukti is a concession to the position of nirvana. When a jeevanmukta winds up, whatever is the state of self or soul is nirvana, or liberation, never to get into the cycle of birth and death as sampradaya puts it. Of course I have an extreme view of mukti, being daring and radical. I would say why we should even bother or think about mukti or think of coming out of the cycle of life and death!

Suppose I am always comfortable with this body with its limitations, a position where there is no reason for me to complain, any time of the day with friends, without friends in ekaanta (solitude or seclusion), in ailments and neglect, with bodily difficulties, no burden of time on me, then why should I think of closing myself? Whatever may be the environment in which one is placed, if one is happy, he is a mukta. This is itself mukti. This is what I want to encourage. Think about this seriously. Do you require mukti in the classic definition way! A special condition of death and no birth situation is called for if one is having a slightest complaint here. Suppose one is very comfortable in this world and is possible for him not to have the end in the classical way and then what is the problem? That was Bhushunda, the crow, who was a Brahmajnaani. We will now try to know a little more. Here is the brief story of Bhushunda as narrated by sage Vasishtha.

**Sage Vasishtha** - I once heard a great sage's discussion on an ancient story of long-lived beings. On a tree in a far away distant land dwells a crow known as Bhusunda, free from attraction and aversion. He has lived longer than any I know. Inspired at hearing Bhusunda's story I set out to meet him personally. Bhusunda had lived many world-cycles. It was incredible to be in his presence. He had perfect memory of ages gone by, free from 'I-Ness'. He was a friend to one and all. He remained silent unless needed to speak

**Meeting Bhusunda - **I humbly approached this ancient one. He recognized me instantly as sage Vasishtha. Explaining the purpose of my visit I asked for his wisdom to my questions. I wanted to know a little more about him as to how long he had lived and its secret, important things about ages past, and what was ordained about his life.

**Bhusunda's Reply - **Listen attentively to the story I narrate. It will destroy the sins of all who listen. Very long ago a female deity existed who had for her vehicle a powerful crow. The crow mated with other crows and had many off springs. I was born as one of the little crows. We approached our wise father one day for his sagacious council and guidance. The female deity had already instructed us on self-knowledge and the way to liberation. We practiced and attained both of them. We wished to know where best to dwell. In accordance with our father's instructions we came to this tree, making this as our abode. Ages have passed, my brothers have left, all ascending to the heavenly realm. Through ages of time I continue to dwell here. I remain established and immersed in the self, ever content with whatever comes naturally and cheerful under all conditions or calamities having abandoned vain and self-centered activity. Useless activities drain body and mind. Anxiety is a great drain and thus one has to abandon it. You can do this if you avoid seeking anything but accepting things that which comes naturally.

**Shastiji** - Bhushunda outlives Hiranyagarbha’s (the Creator) life! Every mukta should end the cycle during pralaya (the dooms day), as Hiranyagarbha winds up at pralaya. Then, a new creation happens – (**यथा पूर्वमकल्पयत्**, _yathā pūrvaṁ akalpayat_) – just as the world was before pralaya. But here is a crow named Bhushunda which outlives the **सृष्टिकर्ता**, _sr̥_ṣṭikartā_ _the Creator. The explanation detailing as to the eternal living of Bhushunda is a big chapter of more than thirty pages in Yōgavāsiṣṭha.  You have a series of shocks and surprises in this chapter.

The pointed question that sage Vasishtha asks is:

“Why is that you keep on living even after the time has elapsed and what you gain out of it? Why don’t you wind up?”

Bhushunda says – “I don’t know. At that time when even Hiranyagarbha is winding up, I get a special _vaasana or _desire without my knowledge. If it is _jala-pralaya,_ I get the vasana of the opposite force and do dhaarana on that and outdo the effect of _jala-pralaya._ If there is _agni-pralaya_, I take an opposite **तत्व**, _tatva_. If there is _vaayu-pralaya_, I become the mountain which cannot be moved by anything. Those forces come to me without my volition and magnifies and I hold on to them. The forces of the pralaya cannot touch me.”

When asked by the sage as to why he does that and why that _āsakti_ (interest) spring up in him, the answer is that he does not know.

**ब्रह्मन्नियतिरेषा हि दुर्लंघ्या पारमेश्वरी,**

**मयेदृशेन वै भाव्यं भावमन्यैश्च तादृशैः**

brahmanniyatirēṣā hi durlaṁghyā pāramēśvarī,

mayēdr̥śēna vai bhāvyaṁbhāvamanyaiścatādr̥śaiḥ.

<p style="text-align: right">
(6-1-142)[^132]

‘O’ knower of Brahman, this is due to the Cosmic Will set in motion by the Supreme God and cannot be transgressed. I have to contemplate the way I do. Others contemplate in a different way.

_brahmanniyatirēṣā hi durlaṁghyā pāramēśvarī_ Does that mean that you are bound by a vaasana? No! I am liberated. I don’t know why it happens. It is a cosmic law. But that sankalpa comes from somewhere and enters my system. But, I am not fond of anything. I have no vasanaas whatsoever.

**न शक्यते चालयितुं अवश्यं भवितव्यता,**

**तद्यथा तत् तथैतद्दि स्वभावै:एष निश्चयः.**

na śakyatē cālayituṁ avaśyaṁ bhavitavyatā,

tadyathā tat tathaitaddi svabhāvaihiēṣa niścayaḥ.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.6-1-143)[^133]

That which has to happen cannot be made to alter the course. This is the way of nature. _svabhāvaihiēṣa niścayaḥ_ - Whatever has to happen, ultimately happens.

Here, one has to ponder. Are we not talking in terms of a mechanical universe could be anybody’s objection as there is no volition or freedom or consciousness. Both are accommodated here. It is a strange story. Outcome of the story is that even Bhushunda is not liberated as he has a vasana that enters at that time without his knowledge and he does the necessary changes though he is not interested in holding on. He is again on the top of a new tree created for him. Each time he is stationed at the top of a tree by his sankalpa, and he declares that he stays there in ‘Self’.

So one need not die! Look at the subtleties involved and the courage of the Indian thinker. There is a clash in a way, but it is accommodated. There is an objection and there is an answer within the objection.

When you do sadhana sitting on a sofa at home without inviting a problem or thought, then you should not have any difficulty or problem. Two hours of sitting should not be a problem. What is lacking in one in terms of mukti? Mukti is not to be sought after. If chitta could be that much empty, what is the problem even for us! Of course, praana samaadhaana needs to happen. But, a growth to this level could be remarkable. We could also live in ‘Self’ like Bhushunda.

However, I have a very rigorous definition of mukti. Many modern Vedantins have oversimplified by saying that if the truth is known, then there is mukti. They quote a convenient line from Chandogya Upanishad –

**तस्य तावदेव चिरं.**

tasya tāvadēva ciraṁ.

**vÀ¸Àå vÁªÀzÉÃªÀ agÀA.**

According to them the only delay is till death. That is all. At the time of death, the body-_vasanas_ and _mano-vasanas_ disappear and that is the end. This is a debatable position according to me. It can trick you into a convenient position not to do **वासनाक्षय_, vāsanākṣaya_**. Why should one purify the mind? As per a few Vedantins, once you know the truth that you are sat-chit-ananda, the _vasanas_ go without any prop. According to me unless the _vasanas_ are washed away here when you are living or when you are alive, where is the mukti? In that case everybody can be a mukta if along with mind the vasanas also vanish.

The rigorous test of a brahmajnani is stated in the mantra.

**तस्य प्राणः न उत्क्रामन्ति अत्रैव अस्मिन्नेव**

**परेणात्मना अविभागं गच्छन्ति.**

tasya prāṇaḥ na utkrāmanti atraiva asminnēva parēṇātmanā avibhāgaṁ gacchanti.

<p style="text-align: right">
<strong>(</strong>Bru.Upa.SB.3-2-1)[^134]

Even here, unless the saadhaka discourages localisation and point formation, then only, diffusion starts till anantata is reached. Until re-mobilisation processes are totally discouraged, there is every possibility of reconnection.

Vasishta was interested in knowing from Bhushunda only two things about ‘Self’. He approaches him and asks him to clarify his doubts. Why does he hold on even after pralaya? What is the mechanism by which he has achieved this chiranjeevitwa. While the Hiryanagarbha himself dies each time what is this chiranjeevitwa of Bhushunda. That was the particular question, for which he wanted an answer.

Bhushunda, the crow, offers pooja to Vasishta, an honourable guest, a Maharishi.

**संकल्पमात्र जाताभ्यां कराभ्यां कुसुमांजलिम्.**

saṁkalpamātra jātābhyāṁ karābhyāṁ kusumāṁjalim.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.6-1-82)[^135] 

Since he is a crow and a crow does not have hands he invites his hands by a mere sankalpa and the hands are there and thus he offers pooja and then discusses prana- vidya with the Maharshi.

**आत्मचिंतासमस्तानां दुःखानां अन्तकारिणी,**

**युष्मदादिषु सुप्रापा दुष्प्रापा च अस्मदादिषु.**

ātmaciṁtāsamastānāṁ duḥkhānāṁ antakāriṇī,

yuṣmadādiṣu suprāpā duṣprāpā ca asmadādiṣu.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.6-1-192)[^136]** **

_ātmaciṁtāsamastānāṁ duḥkhānāṁ antakāriṇī_ - He humbly tells Maharshi that atmachintana and other methods which annihilate duhkha are all for intellectual people like the Rishis.

_yuṣmadādiṣu suprāpā duṣprāpā ca asmadādiṣu_ – He pleads that he was a simple and small fellow and does not have that jnana and as such could not dare to go for atmachintana, etc and thus took an alternate route for his saadhana.

**आत्मचिंता समानानां विविधानां मुनीश्वर,**

**आत्मचिंता वयस्यानां मध्यात् एकतमा मया.**

ātmaciṁtā samānānāṁ vivdhānāṁ munīśvara,

ātmaciṁtā vayasyānāṁ madhyāt ēkatamā mayā.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.6-1-194)[^137]

Of the various methods identical in nature to contemplation of Self, I have adhered to the contemplation of **प्राण, **prāṇa.

_ātmaciṁtā samānānāṁ ātmaciṁtā vayasyānāṁ_ - Equal in productivity to atmachinta, standing at a compeer level to atmachinta, there is what is called _prāṇaciṁtā** **_and I chose that. Among the list of various practices, adopted by people who engage in atmachintana and those who are following methods equal to atmachinana, I chose _prāṇaciṁtā madhyāt ēkatamā mayā._

**सर्वदुःखक्ष्यकरी सर्वसौभाग्यवर्धिनी,**

**कारणं जीवितस्येह प्राणचिंता समाश्रिता**.

sarvaduḥkhakṣyakarī sarvasaubhāgyavardhinī,

kāraṇaṁ jīvitasyēha prāṇaciṁtā samāśritā.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.1-6-195)[^138] 

The contemplation of the life-force or prana enables one to overcome sorrow and to promote auspiciousness. I have adopted this contemplation

_Prāṇavyaapaara_ is going on in all of us. Pushing the pranavyapara to its moola or the origin is _prāṇaciṁtā_.

In _atmachinta_, you can do nidra pariksha and panchakosha - viveka and come to a conclusion. All the achievements of the world are due to **विज्ञानकोश**, _vijñānakōśa_ and its performance. Therefore man attributes his success to _vijñānakōśa_. All the scientists and philosophers of the west stopped at _vijñānakōśa_ since they could achieve the best. They glorified this kosha and the discussion ended. But here is a daring Vedantic science which says that you are still at the penultimate level of search. That leads us to further vichara, investigation.

Bhushunda says this self introspection is for people like sage Vaishta. One can go to the origin by examining mind and its pre states. As far as he (Bhusunda) is concerned, he decides to do the study of pranavyapara, activity of the vital breath. He could go to the origin, by softening the pranavyapara. That is, lessening the movement of prana, till one reaches the origin.

Let us see what this means. We are born with a cluster of activities - mind and prana put together. Both are aspects of vyapara. When you soften the mind, you touched the vijnanakosha and softer than that, you reach the **महत्तत्व, _mahattatwa_**, and the mind slips to **अव्याकृत**, _avyākr̥ta_ and even that vanishes afterwards in Self. Where as, in prāṇaciṁtā we start at the level of respiration which is a visible movement in us. It is a movement on which we have some mastery. It is not possible to start with a heartbeat, since it comes under involuntary mechanism of operation. A point comes when you can do manipulation of prana but respiration will be going on. That is to show that prana is ulterior or more fundamental to respiration. Respiration is an after position or manifested version of inner prana. You come to know of this after a few days of practice that you can manipulate the inside prana which has nothing to do with respiration. The necessary inhalation of oxygen and exhalation of carbon dioxide can go on, where as one can hold somewhere else (do kumbhana).

I will give an example. I have seen in my chemical industry, where a load of 50 kgs. has to be unloaded from the lorry. The labourers who do this job are almost thin and rickety. I have observed one such person who is short in height and lean. He is also is able to lift a 50 kg load on his back so easily. If the load was put on him when he lay down on the ground, it would be very heavy on him and his ribs will get crushed. But he does **कुम्भन**, _kumbhana_ or holding the breath and accepts the load on his back and releases kumbhana when the load is withdrawn. Ribs are not carrying the weight. He holds the back muscle so that _pranashakti_ is carrying the weight. He does that with ease. The posture of slightly bending forward when load is applied on his back makes him do the _kumbhana_. So he manipulated the prana. But, respiration is going on otherwise. That is, one has to tackle the prana and soften it to touch the origin by softening.

In Bhagavad-Gita also, a mention has been made in the following sloka:

**अपाने जुह्वति प्राणं प्राणे अपानं तथा अपरे**

**प्राण अपान गती रुद्ध्वा प्राणयाम परायणाः.**

apānē juhvati prāṇaṁ prāṇē apānaṁ tathā aparē

prāṇa apāna gatī ruddhvā prāṇāyāma parāyaṇāḥ.

<p style="text-align: right">
(B G 4-29)<strong> </strong>[^139]

Some offer as sacrifice the outgoing breath, apaana, in the incoming breath, prana, while some others offer the incoming breath into the outgoing breath. Some arduously practice _prāṇāyāma _and restrain the incoming and outgoing breaths, purely absorbed in the regulation of the life-energy

It is considered as one of the _yajnas_. One is in upward motion and the other downwards. When you surrender one into the other, by slowing down or leisurely then it becomes a yajna. Yajna is any bhoga done with patience, done with reverence or done with piety, **यज्ञदृश्टि**, _yajñadr̥śṭi_ itself is a _mahaasadhana_ being one of the practices ordained in karmakanda. It is a trick to conquer the unruly forces inside. Every **व्रत,** _vrata_ one does is a yajna. One is  required to follow restraint to conquer the urges.

How? All temptations are curtailed in the name of pooja or vrata. The principle involved is to conquer the urge which is so strong in all of us and we rush to them, without even thinking. This is almost animal behaviour. The whole conquest is to conquer the unruly forces inside. Our ancestors integrated these in our routine, to practice **समाधान,** samaaadana.Yogavasishta declares:

**ग्राह्य ग्राहक सम्बन्धे सावधानो भव त्वं.**

grāhya grāhaka sambandhē sāvadhānōbhava tvaṁ.

**UÁæºÀå UÁæºÀPÀ ¸ÀA§AzsÉÃ ¸ÁªÀzsÁ£ÉÆÃ ¨sÀªÀ vÀéA.**

In this process, the _grāhya_, the object and the _grāhaka_, the indriyas coming into contact try leisureliness. Then you would have conquered the world. That is, one will be conquering the impulses or forces. This will give you mahaa-svasthata, (well being) resulting in peace and ananda. All karmakaanda rituals are for purifying the chitta – **चित्तशुध्यर्थं,** _cittaśudhyarthaṁ, _as Shankara puts it. The last point of chittashuddhi (**अत्यंत शुद्ध चित्तं**, _atyaṁta śuddha _cittaṁ) **is Brahman. **Conquering of forces can also be effectively done through control of pranavyapara by slowing down.

You ask me as to my way of sadhana. Sometimes I adopt the method of diffusion or let go. And sometimes I resort to **प्राण विद्या, _prāṇa vidyā._** By slowing down breathing I hold the flow of prana to **आज्ञाचक्र, _ājñācakra_** which was resulting in buildup of boredom forces. Thus, as further feeding of prana is curtailed, expansion at _ājñācakra_ centre takes place.

Why and how?

**चित्तोन्मेष निमेषाभ्यां संसार प्रलयोदयौ,**

**वासना प्राणसंरोधात् अनिमेषं मनः कुरु.**

cittōnmēṣa nimēṣābhyāṁ saṁsāra pralayōdayau,

With the slightest movement in the mind, when the mind blinks, the saṁsāra, (world appearance) arises and ceases. Make the mind free from movement of thought by the restraint of the prana and also the latent tendencies (vasana).

**चित्तं प्राणपरिस्पंदमाहुरागमभूषणाः,**

**तस्मिन्संरोधिते नूनमुपशान्तं भवेन्मनः.**

cittaṁ prāṇaparispaṁdamāhurāgamabhūṣaṇāḥ,

tasminsaṁrōdhitē nūnamupaśāntaṁ bhavēnmanaḥ.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Y.V.5-9-73)<sup> </sup>[^141]

Movement of thought in the mind arises from the movement of prana. And movement of prana arises because of the movement of thought in consciousness. They thus form a cycle of mutual dependence, like waves and movement of currents in water. The wise ones declare that the mind is caused by the movement of prana; and hence by the restraint of the prana, the mind becomes quiescent.

Movement of mind needs movement of breath. Fast movement of mind needs fast movement in breath. That is why when you are in anger, breathing becomes fast. If you get angry, your breathing will suddenly change. Your breathing will become irritated, chaotic. A trembling will get into your breathing; you will feel suffocated. When you are in a happy mood breathing pattern will be different.

In Chandogya Upanishad (4-10-4) the following declaration is made by the Agni.

**प्राणो ब्रह्म कं ब्रह्म खं ब्रह्म.**

Prāṇō brahma kaṁ brahma khaṁ brahma.

**¥ÁæuÉÆÃ §æºÀä PÀA §æºÀä RA §æºÀä.**

Prāṇa is the general activity. You can also have prāṇa as the activity of the jagat - like emotions and feelings which are not coming in the _śabda_ format or the _dṛṣya_ (pictorial) format. To soften these, you have to do _prāṇopāsana _(meditation on prāṇa) - by softening the _prāṇavyāpara_ (pulsation/vibration of prāṇa) to such a level as to reach the no mind state. This is _Prāṇo hi** **Brahma_. _Prāṇopāsana_ is to quench the _śabda_ version of the jagat. Śankara explains the state of nidra or dreamless sleep thus in Śankarabhāṣya 22 on** **Kārika 2 of Māṇ.Up.1[^142]

**दर्शनस्मरण एव हि मनः स्पंदिते। तदभावे **

**हृद्येव अविशेषेण प्राणात्मना अवस्थानम्.       **

Darśana-smaraṇa ēva hi manaḥ spanditē, tadabhāvē hr̥di-ēva aviśēṣēṇa prāṇa-ātmanā avasthānam.

When the dream phase is not there, when the _jāgrat_ (wakeful state) phase is also not there, how do you exist?** **You are merely in the pulsating phase in _nidrā_. Chāndogya Upaniṣad (4-3-3) declares -

**स यदा स्वपिति प्राणमेव वागप्येति, चक्षुःप्राणं, श्रोत्रं प्राणं मनः प्राणं, प्राणोह्येवैतान् सर्वान् संवृङ्क्त इति. **[^143]

Sa yadā svapiti prāṇaṁ-ēva vāk apyeti, cakṣuḥ prāṇaṁ, śrotraṁ prāṇaṁ, manaḥ prāṇaṁ iti- Prāṇo-hi-ēva-ētān sarvān samvṛṁkta iti.

In _nidrā_, every activity has gone in to that general activity. Each specialized activity has taken a general version but has not been eliminated. Prāṇa (life force) has absorbed in its womb all the specialized activities like seeing, listening, talking, and thinking. But activity has not gone in nidrā. Therefore it comes back in the _jāgṛt_ phase. It can be clearly seen that, consciously taming the _Prāṇa_ in _jāgṛt_, results in _chittashuddhi_. The softening, mellowing or slowing down can be achieved by mere observation of our breathing sitting in a leisurely way. This automatically results in softening of all our other activities ultimately merging in Brahman. Therefore, a person practicing pranavidya cannot become angry again, since anger has been conquered consciously - boredom has been conquered consciously - focusing has become diffused, over a phase of sādhana.

You may ask me as to my way of sadhana. Sometimes I do diffusion or let go. I also practice pranavidya. If you observe breathing, you will notice that the direction of inward and outward breaths shifts its course. The shift from upward movement to downward movement and vice versa happens almost sudden and quick. One can slow down this shifting by volition by sitting leisurely and by just observing the breath. You will be thereby conquering the forces through pranavyapara. This is the trick I employ. Many people talk very high of this practice. The main content of Bhushunda upakhyana is on pranavidya. Let us know a few general things about prana.

Prana is the vital force that sustains not only the body, but also creation at every level. Prana is not exactly breath; it is a subtle life force energy that pervades the breath of varieties of animate and inanimate objects. And that helps regulate various physiological bodily functions. The Sanskrit word prana_ _is a combination of two syllables, **_pra _**and **_na, _**and denotes constancy, a force in constant motion. Prana exists in sentient beings as the energy that drives every action, voluntary and involuntary, every thought, every level of the mind and body. Scientific research describes prana as a complex multidimensional energy: a combination of electrical, magnetic, electro-magnetic, photonic, ocular, thermal and mental energies.

Prana also exists in the insentient world, causing motion, growth and decay at this level. Prana is, indeed, the basis of manifested creation. It is the force that emerged out of the 'original willing' of the primal consciousness to bring about creation. The Chhandogya Upanishad (1:11:5) says:

“In prana all moveable and immoveable beings merge (during dissolution) and rise out of prana (during creation)”.

The breath being the medium of pranayama, the system is based on the three stages of respiration - inhalation (pooraka_), _retention (kumbhaka) and exhalation _(_rechaka_). _By permuting and directing these three stages, the different practices of pranayama are obtained. Technically speaking, pranayama is actually only retention. Maharshi Patanjali's Yoga Sutras_ **(**_2-49**) **state:

**तस्मिन्सति श्वास प्रश्वासयोः गतिविच्छेदः प्राणायामः.**

tasminsati śvāsa praśvāsayōḥ gativicchēdaḥ prāṇāyāmaḥ.

**vÀ¹ä£Àìw ±Áé¸ÀÀ ¥Àæ±Áé¸ÀAiÉÆÃB UÀw«ZÉÒÃzÀB ¥ÁæuÁAiÀiÁªÀÄB.**

Prāṇāyāma is the pause or cutting off the course of breathing in the movement of inhalation and exhalation. Conscious control to break the involuntary breathing by slowing down the inhalation and exhalation is the key feature of pranayama. _Vicchēda_ is commented by Vachaspati Mishra and Bhoja as reduction in speed. Vasistha has also expressed the same opinion that Prnayama is accomplished through slowing down inhalation and exhalation. Effortless stoppage of breath or _Kevala-kumbhaka_ occurs on elongating the breathing process. Patanjali refers to the kevala kumbhaka as the fourth component of pranayama in Yoga Sutra 2-51.

**बाह्याभ्यन्तर विषयक्षेपी चतुर्थः.**

bāhyābhyantara viṣayakṣēpī caturthaḥ.

**¨ÁºÁå¨sÀå£ÀÛgÀ «µÀAiÀÄPÉëÃ¦Ã ZÀvÀÄxÀðB.**

That which has no reference to or transcends inhalation and exhalations is the fourth.

We will take up the following important slokas from Bhuśuṇḍōpākhyānam.

**प्राणापानमिति ख्यातौ प्रकटौ तौ वरानिलौ,**

**तयोरनुसरन्नित्यं मुने गतिरहं स्थितः.**

prāṇāpānamiti khyātau prakaṭau tau varānilau,

tayōranusarannityaṁ munē gatirahaṁ sthitaḥ.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.6-1-200)[^144] 

The breath going up and down in the body is known by two names, _prana_ and _apana_. By contemplating always on their courses, I remain alive. In fact, it is only prana that undergoes a modification and appears as apana. The incoming breath is prana and the outgoing breath is apana. You inhale prana and exhale apana.

**प्राणभक्षोन्मुखः अपने प्राणे वा अपान भक्ष्के,**

**उभयोरंतरालस्थं न भूयो जायते नरः.**

prāṇabhakṣōnmukhaḥ apanē prāṇē vā apāna bhakṣkē,

ubhayōraṁtarālasthaṁ na bhūyō jāyatē naraḥ.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.6-1-230) [^145]   

If one keenly observes the exact spot where prana is consumed by apana and where in turn apana consumes prana, the mind becomes peaceful and free of grief.

**प्राणक्षयसमीपस्थ अपानोदयकोटिगः,**

**अपानप्राणयोर्मध्यं चिदात्मनमुपास्यते.**

prāṇakṣayasamīpastha apānōdayakōṭigaḥ,

apānaprāṇayōrmadhyaṁ cidātmanamupāsyatē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.6-1-231)[^146] **  **

That principle of Chit which is in between apana and prana and between the disappearance of apana and the appearance of prana is the Self which I adore. Watch within yourself directly where inhalation turns to exhalation and where exhalation turns to inhalation

**अपानोस्तं गतो यत्र प्राणो नाभ्युदितः क्षणं,**

**कलाकलंकरहितं तत् चित्तत्वमुपास्यते.**

apānōstaṁ gatō yatra prāṇō nābhyuditaḥ kṣaṇaṁ,

kalākalaṁkarahitaṁ tat cittatvamupāsyatē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.6-1-232)[^147]  

That precise moment at which the prana has just ceased to move and the apana has not yet begun to move is the supreme state. That is the Svaroopa or Self which is untainted. I adore and contemplate that infinite consciousness. Similarly;

**न अपानो अभ्युदितो यत्र प्राणश्चास्तमुपागतः,**

**नासाग्रगगनावर्तं तत् चित्तत्वमुपासते.**

na apānō abhyuditō yatra prāṇaścāstamupāgataḥ,

nāsāgragaganāvartaṁ tat cittatvamupāsatē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.6-1-233)[^148]   

I adore that principle of Chit manifesting when apana has not risen and prana has subsided.

For that precise moment at which the apana has ceased to move and the prana has not begun to move, there arises a kumbhaka which is effortless. When there is effortless suspension of breath, it is the supreme state. This is the Self, it is pure infinite Consciousness.

Bhushunda is talking about the **संधिकाल_, saṁdhikāla_**, the transition point between prana and apana. It is the gap between two breaths. The threshold – absorb the forces there.

Lakshman Jha was a very big Kashmiri saadhaka. He was referring to a text called Vijnaana Bhairava Tantra where Parvati was given instructions by Eshvara. It was a very small book containing 112 hints. It is a story where Pavati wanted the tricks to come out of duhkha and Eshvara has accordingly given the techniques. The first four techniques relate to breathing. What we discussed above is reflected there. They are:

**ऊर्ध्वे प्राणो ह्यधो जीवो विसर्गात्मा परोच्चरेत्, \
उत्पत्तिद्वितयस्थाने भरणाद् भरिता स्थितिः. \
**ūrdhve prāṇo hyadho jīvo visargātmā paroccaret, \
utpattidvitayasthāne bharaṇād bharitā sthitiḥ.

**HzsÉéÃð ¥ÁæuÉÆÃ ºÀåzsÉÆÃ fÃªÉÇÃ «¸ÀUÁðvÁä ¥ÀgÉÆÃZÀÑgÉÃvï,**

**GvÀàwÛ¢évÀAiÀÄ¸ÁÜ£ÉÃ ¨sÀgÀuÁzï ¨sÀjvÁ ¹ÜwB.**

Radiant One, this experience may dawn between two breaths. After breath comes in (down) and just before turning up (out) or vice versa is the Supreme State. At that moment you are in **स्वरूप,** _svarūpa_.

**मरुतोऽन्तर्** **बहिर्** **वापि** **वियद्युग्मानिवर्तनात्। \
भैरव्या** **भैरवस्येत्थम्** **भैरवि** **व्यज्यते** **वपुः॥**

As breath turns from down to up, and again as breath curves up to down – through both these turns, realize.

Or, whenever in-breath and out-breath fuse, at this instant touch the energy-less, energy-filled center.

**कुम्भिता** **रेचिता** **वापि** **पूरिता** **वा** **यदा** **भवेत्, \

Or, when breath is all out (up) and stopped of itself, or all in (down) and stopped – in such universal pause, one’s small self vanishes. This is difficult only for the impure.

When your breath comes in, observe. For a single moment, or a thousandth part of a moment, there is no breathing, before it turns up or before it turns outward. One breath comes in; then at a certain point breathing stops. Then the breathing goes out. When, the breath goes out, then again for a single moment or a part of a moment breathing stops. Then breathing comes in. Before the breath is turning in or turning out, there is a moment when you are not breathing. In that moment you are in the Supreme State or Svaroopa or Self. When you are not breathing you are not in the world.

**प्राणोन्मेष निमेषाभ्यां संसृतेः प्रलयोदयौ,**

**तमाभ्यासप्रयोगाभ्यां उन्मेषरहितं कुरु.**

prāṇōnmēṣa nimēṣābhyāṁ saṁsr̥tēḥ pralayōdayau,

tamābhyāsaprayōgābhyāṁ unmēṣarahitaṁ kuru.

<p style="text-align: right">
(YV-6-3-8)[^149] 

By the movement or blinking of prana, the samsara or jagat arises and ceases. By diligent practice make the prana free from such movement.

So, how to do this?



* First, become aware of the breath coming in. Watch it. Forget everything, just watch breath coming in. When the breath touches your nostrils, feel it there. Then let the breath move in.
* Move with the breath consciously.
* When you are going down, down, down with the breath, do not miss the breath.
* Do not go ahead and do not follow behind, just be with it.
* Do not follow it like a shadow.
* Be simultaneous with it. You are not to train the breath.
* **LEAVE IT JUST AS IT IS**.

Breath and consciousness should become one. The breath goes in – you go in. Only then will it be possible to get the point which is between two breaths. It will not be easy. Move in with the breath and then move out with the breath: in-out, in-out. If you go on practicing breath consciousness, breath awareness, you will come to the interval. As your awareness becomes keen and deep and intense, your awareness will become bracketed – the whole world is bracketed out. Your breath coming in or going out will be your world. When you are moving with breath minutely, when there is no breath, how can you remain unaware? You will suddenly become aware that there is no breath, and the moment will come when you will feel that the breath is neither going out nor coming in. The breath has stopped completely. **That is the Supreme State. You are in your Svaroopa or Self.** On this path, the small self vanishes and you attain to the higher Self, the Supreme Self. It can be seen that the above sutras refer to the same gap between breaths wherein _kevala_ or _sahaja_ kumbhaka happens effortlessly.

**अपानोस्तंगते प्राणो यावन्नभ्युदितो हृदि,**

**यावत्सा कुम्भकावस्था योगिभिर्यानुभूयते.**

apānōstaṁgatē prāṇō yāvannabhyuditō hr̥di,

yāvatsā kumbhakāvasthā yōgibhiryānubhūyatē

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.6-1-211)[^150] 

When the apana has ceased to move and when the prana does not arise and move out of the heart, and till these begin to happen, it is known as kumbhaka. (retention as of a filled pot). That is, the pause or effortless state of retention happens when exhalation is complete and the inhalation is yet to begin is known as kumbhaka. Shankara, commenting on the sloka of Bhagavad-Gita about prana - _prāṇa apāna gatī ruddhvā prāṇāyāma parāyaṇāḥ_.** **-** **mentions like this -

**कुम्भकाख्यं प्राणायामं कुर्वाणः.**

kumbhakākhyaṁ prāṇāyāmam kurvāṇaḥ.

**PÀÄªÀÄãPÁRåA ¥ÁæuÁAiÀiÁªÀÄA PÀÄªÁðtB.**

Retention of breath is kumbhana. At that moment at which the prana has ceased to move and the apana has not begun to move, there arises a kumbhaka or pause which is effortless. Breathing stops naturally. This is called Sahaja kumbhaka or kevala kumbhaka or a-prayatna kumbhaka. When there is effortless suspension of breath, it is the Supreme State. This is the self. It is pure infinite consciousness. By just watching the breath without any volition you can arrive at the gap and get established. You really go to the origin. Do not do it rashly. Just be with the breath. Then nothing happens. I did that all by myself. Gurus who teach these techniques are so rare. Unfortunately very few are serious sadhakas. Anyway, no harm will happen provided you are careful. You can just melt the forces by natural neutral kumbhaka. In fact this is pranayama. Mukti is in your hands if you can catch the point. All other exercises in breathing are meant to cleanse the channels through pranic energy flows in the body.

**एषा हि चिति विश्रांतिर्मया प्राणसमाधिना,**

**क्रमॆण अनेन संप्राप्ता स्वयमात्मनि निर्मले.**

ēṣā hi citi viśrāṁtirmayā prāṇasamādhinā,

krameṇa anēna saṁprāptā svayamātmani nirmalē.

<p style="text-align: right">
(Sl.6-1-235)[^151] 

This is the tranquility in Chit that is practiced by me through the means of pranayama. In this way one is led to the abidance in pure Self and gets liberated. The following sloka in Yōgavāsiṣṭha reflects the above.

**असंवित्स्पन्दमात्रेण याति चित्तमचित्तताम्,**

**प्राणानां वा निरोधेन तदेव परमं पदम्.**

asaṁvitspandamātrēṇa yāti cittamacittatām,

prāṇānāṁ vā nirōdhēna tadēva paramaṁ padam.

<p style="text-align: right">
(YV.6-3-10)[^152]

This world illusion has arisen because of the movement of thought in the mind; When that ceases the illusion will cease, too, and the mind becomes no mind. This can also be achieved by the restraint of prana. That is the supreme state.

**LET US ATTAIN THAT STATE.**

<strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>


To attain purushaartha, one has to give up ahankaara. The only way to do that is to control the chattering and outgoing mind which is solely responsible for all the misery.Shastriji concludes his lecture series, by dwelling on this aspect.

F

OR THE SORROW CAUSED BY THE TORMENTING worldly life, there is only one cure and that is the control of one’s mind.

The author almost makes a ruling that there is only one trick to come out of sorrow. The trick is **मनसः निग्रहः** - manasaḥ nigrahaḥ - **ªÀÄ£À¸ÀB ¤UÀæºÀB** – controlling the mind. He further declares that there is no other remedy and any other remedy to come out of sorrow will amount to this. Thereby he declares that mind in the agitated or exited state is duhkha. Otherwise, if duhkha were not the disturbed state of mind, how can quietening the mind be the remedy? Thus we get the definition of duhkha. The disturbances are speed and focussing. I admire Yōgavāsiṣṭha because, it simply goes to the fundamentals without any reservation or inhibition. How I wish that Vedanta abhyasa also develops in the same way without the overtone of tradition. Any number of new models may be developed. New definitions may be developed with the background of science we have. We can work with better models and better explanations. Then Vedanta will be acceptable to all. This does not result in any deviation from tradition or sampradaya. Basic truths are there.

The explanatory part may change from person to person and from decade to decade and era to era. What is wrong when Upanishad themselves permit such thinking. A method of investigation or prakriya tried in one Upanishad is different from that conceived in the other. For example, Panchakosha Viveka, Avasthatraya Pariksha, Sthoola Sookshma Vichara, etc. In Narada Sanatkumara Akhyayika a style of investigation is followed where the disciple questions his Master to give him something greater than the one that exists. When the Guru gives him a proposition, the disciple asks him if there is something greater than that. The questions can go on this way. Investigation style could differ from person to person.

In fact, there is an excellent method of enquiry revealed by Shankaracharya in his Ekasloki. It is in the form of question and answer between teacher and the taught. In five stages you are drawn to the swaroopa.


        **किं ज्योतिस्तव भानुमानहनि मे रात्रौ प्रदीपादिकम्**

* What is the light with which you do your transaction in day time? It is Surya, the Sun.
* What about night? When it is darkness in the night with the help of what you transact? Moon light, lamp and the like.
* In the absence of that with what do you transact? By the help of vaak or sound – that is by way of recognizing the sound and doing transaction.
* Tell me, in seeing the sun, the moon and the lamp, what is the source of illumination? O that is the eye!
* What then, when that (the eye) is closed? O, it is the intelligence or buddhi!
* What reveals the intelligence - its functions? Ah, coming to that, it is my own Self, the ‘I’!
* Well, your own Self is then the supreme brilliance, the Ultimate Light, the first and the last source of illumination! Is it not?

**YES, O LORD, IT IS SO – “I AM THAT”.**

This is a very unique method of reaching Brahman.

**आत्मैव ज्योतिः** - ātmaiva jyōtiḥ - **DvÉäöÊªÀ eÉÆåÃwB.**

You are jyoti swaroopa and so, the

ILLUMINATING CENTER for all actions.

At my own level I discarded all these models and proceeded in my own way of search. That is not anti tradition. I took refuge in science where the whole universe is divided into two components – matter and energy. Science goes further to show that both these are also inter convertible. Science has gone still further to assert that matter is nothing but packed energy. In the whole universe there is nothing but energy both qualitatively and quantitatively.

How do we go about from now? We have to look at where from the energy, which may be in any form, comes? See, to what extreme level the question is simplified. If this is solved, then everything is over. In only one step we have finished Vedanta.

My question was where from the energy in me comes and into where the energy sinks? And the only answer is in my own stuff inside. One has to dwell inside to get the answer. Nowhere else in the universe you can conduct this experiment because you cannot try it outside of you. There are energy strokes like light pulses, thermal pulses, magnetic pulses. We cannot search from where they originate sitting on this earth. When a light pulse is released in to the earth what happens? It scatters and attains a lower energy because it gets distributed into a vast space.

Coming back to our experiment, I was disturbed, but now I am calm. That means, into calmness or the garbha of calmness the energy has absorbed itself. How did this happen? It is through my personal autonomy. I have borrowed this phrase from a former director of NIMHANS. What is that? I can decide that I will quieten myself and the mind becomes quiet. Where did the extra energy, which was till then existing, go? The only answer is that it went into that quietness. How can energy go into quietness? But, here it is a fact which cannot be questioned in the light of logic. Logic should sub serve fact. Logic is a general statement of fact. I can increase the activity level or I can soften it. Everyone does this in his own way. The energy that is accumulated in me can thus be judiciously used by me. So activity becomes quietness. But, applying our calculus model it can be said that no activity can be extinguished. It became less and less and less in localization or in other words it got scattered or spread or distributed. Every activity merges into its complementary term called resting or silence. So, quietness is the source for all the activity. Both are complementary terms. When I become active all this scattered energy gets focused into a point. This is the art of localization of the Self. Thus the different centers like talking, seeing, hearing can be activated. Thus energy is either in the potential form or diffused form. This is the facility available in all of us. It is process of going back or re-tracing for which one can have his own method. The aim is to soften the unruly forces and reach the ultimate. This is your guru inside you who gives you the power to relax until you touch the origin one day. It is not shastra or Shastri or even Shankara for that matter. The whole of Vedanta is the act of watching the forces inside to see how they are born, how they are sustained and how they get dissolved _– yato va imaani bhootani jaayante, .....Anando brahmeti vyajaanaat, anandena khalu imaani bhootaani._.......That extreme state of relaxation is from which energy is born, sustained and into which it dissolves.

Why do you call the source as ananada?

According to Indian thinking peace is aananda or a joyful state. Silence is ananada. Relaxation is ananda. Every ananda is of relaxation type only. But one can point out that in ananda one is excited. In the moment of enjoyment it is obvious that there is excitement. With this one shuld not conclude that excitement is ananda. On careful examination one can note that because of the very excitement another centre is emptied of its extra energy. Excitement has brought a stretch elsewhere. It has brought a change in the mental activity because energy shift takes place. So, excitement is the element of joy not the agency of joy.

Let us see the text.

Do thou hear about wisdom in its fullness. After hearing about it, contemplate on it. The desire for worldly happiness is bondage. Renunciation of such desire is liberation.

I am giving the whole wisdom of the Upanishads. After listening to it, contemplate on that. What is that ultimate single truth? _bhōgēcchāmātrakō bandhaḥ_ - Wanting is bandhana or bondage. The force of desire for bhoga causes bondage more than the bhoga itself. One is caught up in going after things and thus getting into duhkha.

_tattyāgō mōkṣa ucyatē_ - Drop it. Mind becomes empty and is beautiful. Bhoga, raaga and dwesha forces are all one and the same. Both, going away from an object or going towards an object are the same. What an excellent hint for saadhana!!!!

Lot of people around us do number of vratas. Some even give up food for three or four nights in a week. There are others who do not do this. However they resort to a method by which they partake food or any bhoga for that matter as a yajna, a sacrifice. So we have to make this as a yajna by approaching bhoga without the speed and focussing element always haunting within.

**श्रोत्रादीनि इन्द्रियानि अन्ये संयमाग्निषु जुह्वति,**

**शब्दादीन् विषयानन्ये इन्द्रियाग्निषु जुह्वति.**

śrōtrādīni indriyāni anyē saṁyamāgniṣu juhvati,

śabdādīn viṣayānanyē indriyāgniṣu juhvati.

<p style="text-align: right">
(B.G.4-26)[^156]

Some offer their hearing and other senses into the fire of the controlled mind, while the grihasthas, householders, offer sense objects, such as sound, into the fire of the senses.

These are nothing but approaching any bhoga with the attitude of waiting patiently. For example, when food is served watch how the mind acts or reacts. There will be so much of temptation that one is driven by a mad rush and does not wait for the entire menu to be served.

How does it become yajna by waiting?. It is a havis offered to the restlessness inside to cool it down. Every indriya has a restlessness element of the corresponding type. Keeping them under control is a mahasadhana as admitted by shastra. Any professional work, ego increasing work, has to be approached in this way. Don’t hate it but observe with this difference. An agitation has to be treated with poojya bhava and should not be hated. Craving will slowly and slowly die down when a touch of respectability is given to that.

**ब्रह्मार्पणं ब्रह्म हविः ब्रह्मग्नौ ब्रह्मणा हुतम्.**

**ब्रह्मैव तेन गन्तव्यं ब्रह्मकर्मसमाधिना.**

brahmārpaṇaṁ brahma haviḥ brahmagnau

brahmaṇā hutam.

brahmaiva tēna gantavyaṁ brahmakarmasamādhinā.

<p style="text-align: right">
(B.G.4-24)[^157]

Brahman can be attained by one who performs yajna in which the sacrificial instruments, the ghee, the fire, the offerings and the priest (agent) are all Brahman. Such a person is qualified to attain Brahman because he is fully absorbed in karma which is of the same nature as Brahman. The evil forces are the fires. I am the offering person. The bhoga or karma is the havis offered. Casualness is the element of vistarata. Slowness or leisureliness is an element of naidhyanya. We should not injure the system in vedantic sadhana. Indians never thought that bhoga was foul. The cheapness of indulgence and the enslavement in that is the foul element. Minus that, it is brahmasadhana and every vyapara fed to the relative centre gives you brahmasparsha.

The locked up centre expands. Why did parampara insist on holding things? Because things are done in excess due to the rush to that bhoga which injures the system. Holding is not starvation. Conduct the programme in a gentle way. Rashness in Bhoga is the element of dukha, element of suffering and element of bondage

**मनसश्च इन्द्रियाणां च ऐकाग्र्यं परमं तपः.**

manasaśca indriyāṇāṁ ca aikāgryaṁ paramaṁ tapaḥ.

**ªÀÄ£À¸À±ÀÑ E¤ÝçAiÀiÁuÁA ZÀ LPÁUÀæ÷åA ¥ÀgÀªÀÄA vÀ¥ÀB.**

This is Bhishma’s statement in Mahabharata Anushasana parva. Shankara quotes that in his commentary. It is accepted that control of the mind and the indriyas is the best tapas. It is also accepted that any agent which ends up in quietening the mind is within the definition of dharma. Whatever act that brings about the purification of mind, is dharma. This is an excellent definition for Dharma. So indriyanigraha gently done is dharma. Bhoga-aaswadana very gently done is also dharma.

You know now very well Shankara’s statement.

**लौकिकोपि आनन्दो ब्रह्मानन्दस्य एव मात्रा.**

laukikōpi ānandō brahmānandasya ēva mātrā.

**¯ËQPÉÆÃ¦ D£À£ÉÆÝÃ §æºÁä£À£ÀÝ¸Àå KªÀ ªÀiÁvÁæ.**

So, even the Bhogasukha is a touch of Brahman. But then, the general public who are not into Vedanta do not accept it. Therefore Shankara had to get the support of shruti. He supports his statement by the mantra of Bruhadaarankyaka Upanishad - etasyeva anandasya anyanibutani maatram upa jivanti - So, everyone in the world is able to live only because of their getting a bit of brahmasukha.

Everytime you are happy, you are in the no mind state. (Amanibhava). In the truptasthiti the speed has gone down, the vistaarata has set in.That is swaroopa anubhava. When it is appetite, it needs to be approached as feeding the panchaagni. The objection to this is, that one is giving a license to bhoga. If you want to be hypocritical, you can always justify irrationally. It is not pretension. One has to satisfy himself. One should have a measure of indulgence.

If the desires are strong, you can overcome them in two ways. One is to suppress them gently or fulfill the desire. If you suppress the desire too much, a break point is reached. You can slow down the bhoga. Still you can be part of the system. Bhoga within the framework of dharma is permitted. Otherwise it would become destructive to him and to the world. There are certain bhoga-vasanas which are to be conquered. An unnatural desire and a desire which causes injury to the cosmic order, is not permitted. Otherwise you will become a victim of the desire itself.

I am Brahman is a theory that I knew till now. I am not yet purified to a level to really practice the same. That cannot apply to me as long as I have pulls of the indriaays. At that level, I should feed them in a gentle way until a point is reached where the conviction becomes so strong, that I can drop them. When the hunger to fulfill the desire is strong, you have to feed them.

I was wondering why in Rudramantra the rishi always asking for so many things when you have to have vairaagya. But, the answer to this could be, that a dignified desire is not a taboo, unless you snatch them away from someone else.

Taking liberties does not mean that you should indulge in bhoga. The rush to bhoga should drop helping you to give up the bhoga itself. Even then the pull will be there in a small measure. At that point, discrimination helps you to take it or reject it. What is the test for this? Even when you indulge in bhoga, there should not be any rush. Then, slowly the hankering for that bhoga disappears. Shanti before, shanti during, and shanti after the bhoga moment is the watch word. If you catch this point you will never falter during sadhana. This care is important.

**किमन्यैः शास्त्रसंदर्भैः क्रियतामेतदेव तु,**

**यद्यत्स्वाद्विह तत्सर्वं दृश्यतां विषवन्हिवत्.**

kimanyaiḥ śāstrasaṁdarbhaiḥ kriyatāmētadēva tu,

yadyatsvādviha tatsarvaṁ dr̥śyatāṁ viṣavanhivat.

<p style="text-align: right">
(4-4-3)[^158]

Of what use are the extensive scriptures? Let this alone be accomplished. Whatever is thought of as pleasing be known to be like poison and like fire.

Ultimately, I would like to say that sadhana is very essential for the internal progress. So, why worry about studying Yoga vasishta. There are hundreds of such texts. Saadahana is the only tool for you

Physics has helped us to reduce the whole universe into one aspect. We should thank them. Matter and energy were thought to be independent. With the Einsteinian concept that matter is nothing but locked up energy, the question as to whether the whole thing is spandana or a movement or an activity gets strengthened. This is called conservation of mass-energy totality. Once that is done, then the question arises as to where from this energy arises. Vedanta being a peculiar science says that this energy is from silence. The attack on spirituality is to show the evidence for this one. This has to be practically experienced. But the scientific fraternity does not accept this in the absence of a proof. This was a trouble for me for a long time as I was to find the proof from Shastra which was necessary. So I had to do a lot of research.

The proof stands on the three regions of evidence - Shastra, Upapatti and Anubhava. See the accuracy again. In my own field of experience, I have gone to shastra repeatedly whenever there is a knot in the thinking. A well accepted science tradition says that shastra pramaana is nothing but the research findings of the previous research done by a rishi. A PhD student understands this aspect. Any person who registers for a PhD has to spend six months in the library for doing detailed study in the concerned area in which he is interested. Whatever earlier study that has been done has to be accepted and one needs to continue from that landing point. Whosoever researcher reported his findings in the identical area is called shastra. We trust the previous researchers. We do not say that they are dishonest or not clever. The same thing applies to Vedanta also. This is called shastra.

Upapatti is the logic or inference. Ultimate confirmation is anubhava. Shankara makes a point here by not agreeing to most of the schools who say that shastra is the ultimate. As per him, it is a tentative pramana or proof. But pramana culminates in anubhava. That is the courage of vedanta. It has the courage to say that unless a proof is there, there is no need to agree to a postulate.

**आनुभवान्तं शास्त्रानुभव पर्यवसाने श्रुतिः.**

ānubhavāntaṁ śāstrānubhava paryavasānē śrutiḥ

**D£ÀÄ¨sÀªÁ£ÀÛA ±Á¸ÁÛç£ÀÄ¨sÀªÀ ¥ÀAiÀÄðªÀ¸Á£ÉÃ ±ÀÄæwB.**

The sruti reports on findings which must culminate in any one’s experience. Then only one can accept the shastra.

My own study told me that while I am quiet, I get a stroke of anger or, I get a stroke of fear. How did I get that when the prior state was very gentle? Where from that burst of activity come from? It came from silence, an experience not available in science. Yōgavāsiṣṭha describes the structure of mind in this way.

**स्वयमेवाशु भवति स्वयमेव विलीयते,**

**स्वयमेव प्रसरति स्वयं संकोचमिति च.**

svayamēvāśu bhavati svayamēva vilīyatē,

svayamēva prasarati svayaṁ saṁkōcamiti ca.

<p style="text-align: right">
(6-19-19)[^159]

He rises spontaneously of himself, and then subsides in himself, he expands hi own essence all over the universe, and at last contracts the whole in himself.

Mind has acquired that freedom to will, to change by itself. Some of the statements from Yoga Vasishta are extremely helpful to clear some fundamental misgivings. In human beings, there is a chetana which can magnify or thin out. This facility is not available in Jadavastu. We will be coming across such situations in our daily life. So, activity can come from silence. You can also absorb the anger as soon as it comes. Where did that activity go? Back into silence of course!

The pulling elements are ego, nidra, self importance, pressure of the senses. One needs to introspect as to whether one is possessed by these elements of obstacles for sadhana. With the background of Vedanta we can easily see whether these are the hindrances in our becoming quiet. If they are the factors, then a correction has to be done externally. When you are at the desiring level, why not take them in their stride. Take bhoga in the dignified way. Work for it and fulfill those desires. If you become a parasite or if you steal someone’s money, it is wrong and unacceptable.

Q. What was the difference between the attitudes of Shikidwaja and Viswaamitra?

A. The moment Shikidwaja came to know this secret, he was set in swaroopa. But, for Viswamitra, this swaroopanishta came at the end only when he realised that there was no point in getting the praise from Vasishta. Whether Vasishtha called him Brahmarshi or not, why should he bother was the stand taken by him at the end. Till the time the mind got thinned out to that level, Vasishta was calling him only Rajarshi. When Viswamitra stopped bothering about the title, Vasistha called him Brahmarshi. In this episode we have to see these points. One is the ego part and the second is the determination that he should be called Brahmarshi. When indifference took the upper hand his shaanti was restored. At that point Vasishta himself goes in search of vishwamitra.

Q. Is not activity not our inherent nature?

A. We can accept this to an extent that we have two activity filled phases of wakeful and dream states. And there is the sleep state without any activity, excepting the general pranic activity. We can accept that we exist in these two phases. It is also possible for a person to exist in the non doing state. If we take zero as the .point of reference, 1, 2, 3, cannot accommodate zero. That is, Variety cannot accommodate nothingness. But, nothingness, taking a bit of an activity can accommodate hundreds of activities. Variety can be an outcome of generality. But generality cannot be the outcome of variety. Swapnadehi and mano- dehi are two characteristics of dream. But duhkha has not gone even in the dream, because the world one sees in a dream also becomes a bhogasthaana. In dream also, you have likes and dislikes. You are not happy when you do not get what you want. Even in imperishable dream body fear is built in. To get out of the fear you have to have aakaasha deha, just as you are in sleep, a state without any transaction. Every day we go into the sleep state. Suppose you don’t get the right sleep, the whole mind gets agitated. This proves that the mind is the only state where duhkha phase is created.

It is the fickleness of the mind, chanchalata, which is responsible for duhkha. If we accept that the material state of the mind is the chanchalya phase then why do we complain all the time? The meaning of nidra from the vedantic point is not the rest for the body. It is the rest for the mind. Therefore we have a moral from our dreamless sleep state. The whole Vedantic structure is built on the foundation, the experience called dreamless sleep state. But even this state is not considered holy.

Q. What is wrong with too much of bhoga?

A. Let us take the example of enjoying music. Not only are you directing the energy bothering at the aajanachakra, when you are listening to music, you are also dissipating the energy through shabda. Naada is next stage of aakaasha dharma in terms of bringing in expansion and so is the highest and nearest. But the problem is you are seeking more and more of music since you think you are in the happy state because of it. When indulged in excess it brings in more excitement, and when it stops, urge to have it again increases. Therefore there should be moderation of indriya bhoga.

**न जातु कामानां उपभोगेन शाम्यति.**

na jātu kāmānāṁ upabhōgēna śāmyati.

**£À eÁvÀÄ PÁªÀiÁ£ÁA G¥À¨sÉÆÃUÉÃ£À ±ÁªÀÄåw.**

It is not possible to control the kaamanas or desires by repeated enjoyment of them all the time. It is like pouring ghee into fire. It increases the hunger since you are destroying the normal way of releasing the energy from the respective centers. Such person succumbs to pressure and the normal mind cannot tolerate this pressure and gets destroyed.

In Yōgavāsiṣṭha, at one place Vasishtha talks of shamasukha and brahmasukha. He says that brahmasukha is hundred times more than the other sukha. In shamasukha, we retain the confinement of ’I’-ness. We moderate all activities like eating, talking, and others which disturb the mind and we are always watchful. There is a limit to the benefit. The observer is always there watching the actions. You have not tampered with that center where confinement still exists. Though purification is going on, this sukha is limited to brahmasukha minus the focusing burden. That is the limitation of shamasukha, since the correcting centre is active and operating. We do not know how to undo this notional correction. Why not smash the correction centre itself? A Jnaani does away with the correction centre itself and the sukha that he gets at that point is brahmasukha.

That was s the difference between Shikidwaja and Choodaala. Choodaala understood the non importance of the controller. But, Shikidwaja was constantly monitoring the same. This cautious approach itself became the burden as it involved confinement.

**येन त्यजसि तत्यज - **yēna tyajasi tatyaja - **AiÉÄÃ£À vÀåd¹ vÀvÀåd**

**- IS THE KEY FOR THIS PROBLEM.**

The drushya or the scene is alive because of the drashtu, the seer. When we do away with that fellow, there is nothing to think. It drops off by itself. It is ‘aham’ tyaaga that is important.

Let us see this way. Karmakaanda gives us the methods of moderation in performing our activity and thereby adherence to dharma. Therefore why should we not end here? This is the argument of some people. The answer to this is that we did not get the peaceful state even after careful control. We go on searching for new things like japa, pooja dhyaana etc. You are continuously searching for giving up things or reducing the burden. Where is the limit for this? For a person who is trying for perfection which is elusive, this is not sufficient and such person should go to Aatmavidya.

That was the case with Naarda Maharshi. And the famous statement – shokam tarati aatmavit - has to be kept in mind always. This is how one should take life and its disturbances. It is trying to show that even the highest qualified person has some soft problem still disturbing him. In Puraana they refer to the case of Vishnu going to a yoga nidra for getting rid of the burdened state.

Another argument is that while working one is more comfortable than when one sits without work. When we sit quietly, all the external indriyaas including the talk center have become quiet. But, in the same proportion, the internal disturbances increase and the mind does not calm down resulting in burden. Meditation is one which reduces this burden which pushes the mind not to chatter.

One should sit quiet with the understanding that he has to be in a peaceful state. Let the veekshaka or the observer reshape himself into relaxed watching without the strain. The forces should not be killed instantaneously. Every centre has to calm down to weaken the attentive mood.

Q. What is the difference between knower and Brahman?

A. The knower cannot be described. Knowing activity is personified and is being called a knower. Knowing is wrongly stated as knower. The difference between the knower and Brahman is that with the latter there is sarvavyaapakatwa, all pervasiveness. Whereas, knower is stationed as MIND and has a locus in space. The owner of an activity is bound in a local point.

Q. What does Patanjali’s sutra **(**1-2):

**योगश्चित्तवृत्ति निरोधः.**

yōgaścittavr̥tti nirōdhaḥ.

**AiÉÆÃUÀ²ÑvÀÛªÀÈwÛ ¤gÉÆÃzsÀB.**

specially mean? Does it suggest nirodha for practice?

A. That is one way – see the sutra (1-34).

**प्रच्छर्दन विधारणाभ्यां वा प्राणस्य.**

pracchardana vidhāraṇābhyāṁ vā prāṇasya.

**¥ÀæZÀÒzÀð£À «zsÁgÀuÁ¨sÁåA ªÁ ¥Áæt¸Àå.**

Optionally, mental equanimity may be gained by the even expulsion and retention of vital force or prana or breath. Or by pausing after breath flows in or out - which will give you the answer.

OR

**ईश्वर प्रणिधानाद्वा.**

īśvara praṇidhānādvā.

**F±ÀégÀ ¥ÀætÂzsÁ£ÁzÁé. **(1-23).

**Or by surrender to God.**

This is another method adopted by some. Surrender to a higher force. But Iswara pranidhana is easier. Similarly pranayama by itself can be a tool. By slowing down prana, chittavrutti can be mellowed. Surrender to God can be a single tool. You can reject all other tools. Surrender does two jobs at the same time, slowing down and vistarata or expansion. When you thrust all your problems on Him, then the whole mind gets to a peaceful state.

But, so far as I am concerned, I cannot accept a God (personal) of that type. People who are logical cannot accept the concept of God unless there is tangible evidence. I have to get two evidences:

1) That there is a GOD (personal) – a doubtful case.

2) That he is all powerful and compassionate.

If he is all powerful, he will not create this hellish world - a person highly diabetic at 30 years, a widow at the age of fifteen or twenty, an orphan of ten years of age! See another example, a very good saatvic man with too much of poverty. If He is a sarvashakta, he should monitor this. If he is a karunamayi, he should not create such a bad world. Either he is not compassionate or sarvajna. See the difficulty when science comes in.

The whole thing of life can be explained by the law of accident says science. Because of a thermal difference between the earth and sun, water vapour goes up and drops down as rain, resulting in germination etc. Anything in the world can be explained by science. Why should there be a GOD for this? Forces and variations in them are sufficient to explain the whole movement and even the flux in the universe can be explained.

But if you have shraddha, you can accept it – that is where iswara pranidhana comes into picture.
