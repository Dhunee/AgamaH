### Acknowledgements

A work of this type cannot happen without the effort of a group of dedicated persons. My brother Rangarajan, Prof. Naagabhushan, Mr. Gopal who had an intimate and long association with Shastriji have been the prime movers of this programme.   All the three have spent many hours with me   for realising this project by helping me with the transcription, by putting it into a readable format. They spent hours of their precious time by going through the pages line by line and made the necessary correction keeping in mind, the Shastriji’s style of narration.    My school mate Sreenivasa Murthy spent his time with me correcting the proof.  My thanks goes to all of them.

Recording of these lectures were done at Detroit, U.S.A.at the residence of Smt Aruna, daughter of Shastriji in the year 2002.  Our sincere thanks to her for providing the tapes for transcriptions.

Dr Nagendra, Vice Chancellor of Sri Vivekānanda Yoga Anusandhāna Samsthāna (SVYASA) has been a motivating force behind the project. My special thanks to him.

Transliteration work of the book was done by Dr Ishwarprasad.  My sincere thanks to him.

I have a long list of students of Shastriji to acknowledge. I cannot   forget them for their support. Prominent among them is Mr. Vinayak Joshi who has relentlessly worked to keep the record of Shastriji’s talks and shared the same.

Mr. Ranganath Prasad did the transcription work related to the talks and typing work of Sanskrit text also.   He has been a helping hand whenever I wanted him and stayed with me till the book took a final shape.  I am indebted to him.  Prof K S Shreedharan who took all the pains to correct the Sanskrit texts needs special mention here.   I thank him profusely.

Dr Lata Hemchand**,**Professor of Psychology, Richmond Fellowship Post Graduate College, 40-1/4, Vajpeyam Gardens, Bangalore who incidentally is an ardent follower of Shastriji, supported our work and very eagerly agreed to write a foreword to this book.  My sincere thanks to her.

My   publishers--------took enough pains to bring this to a  happy end within a very short time given to them.

Lastly I thank my wife Rukmiṇi whose patience I tested by working into late nights and disturbing her sleep for quite a long time.


### Preface to the second edition

In our enthusiasm to bring out the book as quickly as possible, we hurriedly rushed through the first edition in which some small but relevant aspects were left out.  In spite of this deficiency the appreciation of the contents were valuable and prompted us to take a second look at the editing work. The suggestion from the readers who were mostly the Shatriji’s core group came in handy to look at the whole manuscript again. It is prudent to mention here that the first edition saw only a hundred copies circulated among the enthusiasts.

Many changes have been made in this edition, by revising the pattern of presentation, keeping in mind not to disturb the flow of thought so that the reader gets a clear glimpse into the subject matter.  Sanskrit** **verses which were added as an appendage to each lecture has been taken off and introduced wherever the need came about along with the references to the original texts.  I hope this will be of use to the reader.  Dr Lataji’s preface has been added in this edition.  The lectures on Māṇdūkya Upaniṣad have been revised and redrafted.

I am sure the reader will benefit by these changes. Suggestions are welcome for a better presentation of future editions.

Happy Reading!

Editor.


### Editors Note

My association with this great teacher was for a very short period. I heard him directly six or seven times.  But the impact of that listening was so great that it prompted me to listen to many of his taped lectures several times.  More than six hundred hours of taped talks covering various aspects have been put into an mp3 format for better storage at the request of Mr. Vinayak Joshi who had recorded them using his little recorder. I could feel the presence of Shastriji always during that period of my listening and recording.

While I was reading the edited works of a great Mystic, a sudden inspiration came to me that I should also do some serious efforts to take up the task of bringing the audio version of the talks of Shastriji into a book form, the reason being Shastriji’s direct approach to the problem of happiness and sorrow (sukha and duḥkha), should reach many aspiring practitioners in the path of sādhana. Shastriji himself was a very serious sādhaka and was well known guide for many aspirants.  His Monday lectures at Śankarakrūpa in Bangalore was well attended and well received.

While working on this book, I was informed that Shastriji himself had expressed his intent to get these ideas brought out in the form of a book to reach out to a larger readership. His wish has now become a reality.

These lectures were delivered by Shastriji in Detroit U. S. A. during the period 2001-2002 at the request of a group of psychiatrists, doctors of medicine and doctors of science who were all in to the study of Vedānta and were longing for a deeper understanding of the siddhānta and sādhana

It was most appropriate that he took up the title of the lecture series as ‘Message of Upaniṣad-s” as he had done a deeper research into the aspects of lasting happiness which has been dealt very widely in the Upaniṣad-s.  These messages formed the nuggets to be condensed into a scientific model.  He described his own model as –calculus model-which took him a long time to develop after an in depth study into Upaniṣad-s, Śankarabhāṣya, and Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha.

Shastriji always preferred an interactive session and wanted more searching questions from his listeners and even encouraged them to throw any type of question however trivial it might look. He always used to stress that Vedānta should be introduced at a very early age of fifteen or sixteen, as that was the right age to sow the seeds of culture in young minds.  He always recommended everyone to develop a scientific temper of questioning any hypothesis till a satisfactory answer came forth and not to study Vedāntic texts in a goody goody way.

For the sake of a better understanding of the various aspects of the message of the great master, the book is divided into three major parts individually named as Siddhānta**,** Sādhana and lectures on Māṇdūkya Upaniṣad.  These are only broad sub divisions.   The concept of   Omkāra upāsana for deeper levels of spiritual advancement is the highlight of these lectures. A Few Gems from Gauḍapāda Kārikā-s which Shastriji always used to quote and asked his ardent sādhakā-s to do manana on them have been added for the benefit of the reader.  The concept of Dharma as propoununded by our R̥ṣi-s** **and misquoted by many, have been very scientifically analysed and this can be used as a tool of sādhana.

The Sanskrit śloka-s often quoted by Shastriji have been given in Devanāgari script along with references to their texts   for the benefit of reader.  The transliteration of the śloka-s have been put in bold font instead of the usual italics type for a clear reading.

If the reader is benefited from these talks, I feel the effort and pain was worth the trouble. I hope that the reading will push to inner peace and tranquility.		                                                           G.S.Radhakṛṣṇan

### Foreword	

I write this foreword with a sense of humility and gratitude to Shastriji, my Guru. He is the inspiration and spirit of this book which contains his message on wisdom from the Upaniṣad-s.

There exists a myriad of commentaries, interpretation and treatises written on Upaniṣad-s. The reader may wonder as to the significance of one more such exposition. The uniqueness of this book lies in the scientific approach to concepts like happiness and sorrow (Sukha & Duḥkha), demystifying the concept of enlightenment and liberation (Mukti) as espoused in Vedanta. Shastriji through his intense research into Upaniṣad-s and Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha found answers for the universal quest of reducing misery and enhancing lasting happiness. His objective was to bring forth this knowledge hidden in Vedanta to every spiritual seeker. Vedanta for him was an applied science which could help in realising the vagaries of our mind and bring it under conscious control. He truly believed that the psychologists of today had a lot to learn from our ancients. Having been in this field as a professional I fully validate his words.

The present book is an effort to bring together Shastriji’s seminal contributions in understanding Vedanta. His lecture series recorded in 2002 have been painstakingly transcribed and edited by Sri Garani S. Radhakrishnan, Prof. Nagabhushan, Gopal and Rangarajan. Some of the important themes which are contained in this book are the analysis of Sukha and Duḥkha using a new methodology (Prakriya) which was entirely original on Shasrtriji’s part. The association between Bhogasukha and Brahmasukha, the quintessential meaning of Omkāra and the concept of Dharma in Hindu thinking are rarely touched upon by other scholars.

The discourse that has existed so far on these concepts has predominantly confined itself to scholarly expositions and debates with little emphasis on its application to the daily life of an individual. Shastriji on the other hand took the Sadhakā-s (practitioner’s) perspective. He showed that the validity of this knowledge was established through experimenting and experiencing it oneself. For example, he showed that the quietened state of mind or “no-mind state (Amanī-Bhāva)”, is the true state of happiness or joy. This “no-mind state” can be attained through Japa, Meditation  Śubhakarma or by contemplation of one’s true nature.

Happiness or well being in psychological research has focused on two general perspectives: the hedonic approach which defines happiness in terms of sensory pleasures or attaining valued outcomes in varied realms. The second perspective is the Eudaimonic view emphasizes on meaning of life and self realization. The two perspectives are often thought of as opposing viewpoints and there is no convergence between the two approaches.

Shastriji’s analysis of happiness bridges this gap through establishing the relationship between the hedonic (Bhogasukha) and the eudaimonic (Brahma- Sukha). He explains how the content of happiness is basically reaching the ‘no-mind’ state in both the approaches, the difference lies in the fact that the bhogasukha is short lived and is dependent on external objects while Brahma-Sukha is an internal state independent of external agencies which the person can experience at will and hence, long lasting. **This extraordinary message of making a notional shift from focusing on the agency (what brings happiness) to the content (the mental state during the happy experience) has not been conveyed by any other scholar of Vedānta thus far.**

His research on human suffering lead him to simplify the understanding of sorrow in two phases of the mind namely speed and intense focusing or ‘Coning’ as he called it. He clarified that all the disturbances of the mind are caused by its constant gyrations and fast vibration (spandana). He quotes from the Bhagavad-Ġīta to prove this point (chapter-5, verse-23), “man can be happy only when he is able to drop the speed arising out of desire, fear and anger”. Thus the common factor present in all moments of distress is speed, agitation and unruliness of forces inside.

The second dimension of sorrow he summarized as intense focusing where one reduces oneself to a single point or the mental posture acquires ‘coning phase’. When a person is experiencing a deep loss or constant worry, the mind acquires highest density and the person feels burdened. He loses his expansive and diffused state which is his true nature.

Such piercing clarity in the understanding of sorrow and happiness has not been achieved by any scholar before Shastriji. This vision can have great impact not only on the field of spirituality but in the mental health field where scientists are grappling with this eternal quest of reducing distress and promoting greater happiness. Hence, this book can be a resource for all those different fields of knowledge like philosophy, psychology and spirituality which delve into man’s quest for happiness.

As a practioner in the field of clinical Psychology, I have applied these principles with several of my clients who are receptive to such ideas and found them highly effective. The suggestion of reducing speed and slowing down mental activity to reduce distress has had the maximum impact on clients with anxiety and depression. One of the tormenting symptoms of these two conditions is an incessant, forceful rush of irrational and often negative thoughts. Creating awareness in them that pain and suffering is nothing but mental speed, the negative thoughts lose their intensity due to slow down. Clients find great relief after practicing this method.

A second category of clients who benefit using Shastriji’s suggestions are those suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder. Their obsessions are associated with certain religious beliefs and rituals which they follow to an extent that it starts harming them and affects the quality of their life. Exploring the true meaning of all these rituals as ‘Śubhakarma’ and showing the aim of Śubhakarma is to quieten the mind (Cittaśuddhi), they are freed from the torture of guilt and fear of being punished by God. This results in a reduction in their symptoms.

These examples are only a few among many more such applications of intervening effectively to resolve mental health problems. Rather than following western models of therapy which is generally the norm among professionals, Shastriji’s wisdom and insights inspire us to be innovative and create an Indian model of Therapy. It would be culturally more appropriate and Indian clients would probably internalize it more easily.

Omkāra Upāsana is extolled repeatedly in the Upaniṣad-s and prescribed as a superior path towards enlightenment. However, it was Shastriji who unraveled the hidden meaning about how the utterance of ‘Om’ represents the microcosm and the macrocosm of the universe. Further, he indicated that the Sādhaka could merge into deep silence through Omkāra Upāsana.

The concept of enlightenment or self realization has been demystified by Shastriji using the calculus model which has an appeal to modern scientific mind.

Finally, Shastriji’s brilliant exposition of Dharma in Hindu thinking is a jewel in the crown. He relates different episodes in Hindu mythology which seemingly appear inconsistent with ethical considerations but have a deeper meaning of achieving a calmer and quietened state of mind,  thus, resulting in** **śāśvata sukha. He differentiates between concepts of nyāya and Dharma. He propagates a new definition of Dharma based on his research as;’ an act done in the background of ‘Cittaśuddhi ‘or for the expansion of citta is Dharma’.

Shastriji’s message contained in this book endeavours to communicate deep spiritual wisdom from the Upaniṣad-s without the overload of academic discourse. It has been rendered in a scientific manner with an emphasis on the experiential and Sādhana perspective. It can quench the thirst for higher spiritual wisdom among readers from across different disciplines of knowledge and different continents.

### Why read this book?

In what way this book is special in content and quality is a natural question that arises in the mind of any reader.  Hence it is the responsibility of the editor to highlight the salient features of this book.

Shastriji, with a strong scientific temper, began to question the orthodoxy in respect of certain vedāntic truths cherished by traditional scholars.  This led him to do intense research in Upaniṣad-s and Yoga- Vāsiṣṭa in order to find practical solutions to the problems encountered by the modern mind.

Some of his important findings which form the theme of this book are listed here:



* <u>Analysis_ _of Mind_:_</u>  All modifications of the mind are nothing but mere Spandana (movement). Human suffering can be reduced to only two aspects of mind--speed and focusing.
* <u>Happiness_:_</u> Mystery regarding happiness is removed by identifying and equating the quietened state of mind itself as happiness glorified in the Upaniṣad-s.
* <u>Sukha-Duḥkha Parīkṣa</u>:  A prakriya is a methodology which guides a person to understand and arrive at the true nature of the Self or Ātmān. There are traditional prakriyā-s like Avasthā Traya Parīkṣa, Pañca Kośa Viveka, Sthūla Sūkṣma Viveka etc.  Shastriji devised the prakriya called Sukha-Duḥkha Parīkṣa by which one can understand his   true ‘SELF’
* <u>Bhogasukha--Brahmasukha</u>: Quoting from Śankarabhāṣya and Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad-s, the role played by bhoga (enjoyment through the senses) in the experience of happiness is explained.   It is shown that CONTENTWISE Bhogasukha is essentially the same as Brahmasukha. Seeking magnified version of this happiness or Ānanda, sans the agencies, is Brahmābhāyasa.
* <u>Energy shift mechanism</u>: This explains why and how one experiences joy or happiness when sense organs come in contact with sense objects.
* <u>Omkāra Upāsana</u>:   Perhaps, Shastriji is the only one who has taken the logical explanation of Omkāra given by Adi Śankara in his commentary on Māṇḍukya Upaniṣad.  He shows how this upāsana can lead a sādhaka to slip into deep silence.
* <u>Śubhakarma_:  _</u>Shastriji classifies all mundane, mechanical, neutral, non exciting activities like sweeping the floor, washing dishes etc as Śubhakarma and explains how these activities can help in attaining purification of mind.
* <u>Freedom element_:_</u>  He identifies that freedom is a unique and special quality of a human mind and this facility can be used to overcome the feeling of helplessness and bondage.
* <u>Boredom forces</u>:  Identifies boredom as anādyavidyā. By using the energy shift mechanism it is shown how boredom is generated and how it can be overcome.
* <u>Concept of Brahman</u>: Demystifies the concept of Brahman and concept of enlightenment. The modern scientific mind cannot appreciate the traditional model of creation according to which the universe has come into being by an utterly non doing principle called Brahman.  An attempt has been made by this scholar in overcoming this hurdle by using Calculus model.  This needs careful consideration by modern scientists.  According to Shastriji, enlightenment cannot happen overnight as it is a gradual process.
* Siddhānta and Sādhana_:_  It is shown that vedāntic truths need not remain as traditional jargons.  Most of them can be applied as a means of sādhana to reach the goal.

Quoting examples from day to day problems faced by men and women  in their daily life, he goes on to show how everyone  can lead a happy life if one were to understand how and why of the rules laid down by our ancestors for living one’s complete life.  Drawing many quotes from Upaniṣad-s, Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha and Bhagavad-Ġīta, he has shown that by sādhana one can attain bliss in this very life itself.




## SIDDHĀNTA - THEORY



### INTRODUCTION

Having been trained in the ways of science, I was simply drawn to Upaniṣad-s when I started reading them in view of the meticulous way the subject is dealt with. The more and more I read the Upaniṣad-s along with commentories of Adi Shankara, an extremely powerful commentary on the original text of Upaniṣad-s, I as a scientist could not but wonder and appreciate them.

A scientific approach to any matter/ problem demands the following:



* A free, frank and fearless approach.
* An intimate one to one interaction between the teacher and the taught.
* The skill of penetrating into the fundamentals.
* Sweeping generalisation through the suggested methods.
* Availability of experimental support and verifiability of the methodology suggested in the Upaniṣads.

All the above requirements are to be fully   satisfied while dealing with the subject matter in question. A scientist of today can have all the admiration for such an approach. I am of the firm opinion that no one can excel the scientific penetration, accuracy and courage of Adi Śankarachārya’s approach to the subject while dealing with the Upaniṣad-s. This is one of the aspects why I was drawn to the Upaniṣads.

The other aspect which attracted me into the study of Upaniṣad-s was that it tackled the question of suffering – suffering at the psychic level. Every one, right from a child to an old man, from the rich to the poor, complains of suffering. The cause may be anything – inferiority complex, compatibility in family, question of non-recognition, nagging boss, dissatisfaction at profession, etc. Man is suffering in a grosser way or subtler way. But, here is a Vedic Science which with utter confidence declares that it can give an everlasting or permanent remedy.

The present day living is full of tension, hurry, rat race, severe competition, exploitation, etc. which can be called as negative forces. These negative forces are bad to oneself, bad to others and ultimately bad to the society. We are witnessing teen aged boys and girls going to the extent of committing suicide even for trivial reasons unable to handle or manage or face these negative forces. But, here is a science which assures permanent remedy to these. Unfortunately, in India, it is a general notion that spirituality is only for persons beyond sixty years of age. But, I sincerely feel that these concepts should be introduced at a very young age of sixteen itself so that he or she will never face helplessness, desperateness, depression, etc. instead, they grow with strong minds and in turn build a strong and healthy society.

As an introduction to understand what the source of these Upaniṣad-s are, where they are from, what is the larger text of which this is a portion, let us understand some fundamental phrases that are in use. Everyone would have heard the word Vedā-s. Vedā-s are the most ancient religious texts of the Hindus. That is the source of inspiration for all the cultural, religious, ethical,values. It is so ancient that historians place them as far back as 5000 years or 8000 years. The Indian thinking is that it is not manmade. In fact Śankara (Ādi Śankarācārya) says that it was  co released along with creation,in his introductory reference to Bhagavad-Ġīta

The Vedā-s are four in number and we all know them very well. They are Rigveda, Yajurveda, Sāmaveda and Atharvaveda. All these four Vedas have their own sub divisions. They are the prose forms of chanting pertaining to the method of performing many  sacrificial rites. These have been devised by many sages. These rituals are conducted for attaining specific benefits for daily living. Another division also contain rituals to be performed by men who are moving into forests as retires and settle down there. The end portions of  these contain the philosophical treatise seeking answer to some fundamental questions of life and life after death. These portions are called the Upaniṣad-s.

For the purpose of our study, we will broadly look into the classification of Vedā-s as two major portions called,religious treatise and** **philosophical treatise.

Tradition accepts this subdivision. It is honoured that way. The question arises as to why this subdivision at all? What are the distinctive features of these two portions? How do they differ from each other? The difference lies both in the subject matter and in the structuring,difference in methodology and content.

We will restrict ourselves to some of the practical aspects of these great teachings from the end portion of the Vedā-s, as we are mainly concerned with the practice than the theory. But, a study of how and why of some of the rituals and practices that are carried out in our homes even till date and those which have been handed over to us from our forefathers is necessary for a better understanding of the intentions behind them.

We shall broadly look into what this religious  methods( Karmakāṇḍa) means to us in our daily life. I do not wish to cast a shadow on these practices nor condemn them while I detail out some of the practices that are in vogue. In fact, a proper understanding of them will help us and strengthen our own practice and clarity will come to us as to how our ancestors had designed them with a purpose. However, during the following few minutes I would like to put before you the facts as to how the practices of Karmakāṇḍa are losing ground with the advent of science and due to the inability to defend itself the onslaught of especially younger and materialistic generation. We will be discussing in due course that the very same practices of Karmakāṇḍa rise to the heights of glory if practiced with an understanding of the purpose for which they were designed.

This portion envisages a number of Gods and demigods. You can call them power centres- manipulating the various powers of the cosmic activity. That is a position in karmakāṇḍa. Indra, Varuṇa, Yama, Agni, Aświni devatā-s, the three forces called the Brahma, Viṣṇu, Maheśwara( generator,operator and destroyer)and their spouses- all these Gods are envisaged in this part of vedic literature. And Karmakāṇḍa has a position that you can approach these Gods through prayers, through offerings. There are different aspects in Karmakāṇḍa structured in a very sophisticated and detailed way. There are many ways of appeasing these Gods. Chosen mantras are there for each God. The chnatings are to be uttered in a very specific way- with right intonations** **without deviations. Any offering to these God-s through sacrifies., are for getting some favour or the other.

Some examples could be given:

In India there is what is called, an **Upākarma-उपाकर्म** - programme. In this ceremony during the Virajāhoma mantra chanting (Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad) many blessings are sought from the Gods. The student is asking for five prāṇā-s to be purified.

**प्राणोपानव्यानोदानसमाना मे शुद्ध्यन्ताम् ज्योतिरहम् विरजा विपाप्मा भूयासम् स्वाहा ॥**

**Prāṇa-apāna-vyāna-udāna-samānā mē śuddhyantām jyōtiraham virajā vipāpmā bhūyāsam svāhā.**

I am offering into the fire, the homadravyā-s so that my pañcaprāṇā-s be purified. Let my several vital organs be purified. All this goes to show that very dignified wishes were sought from the Gods with the belief that, when properly approached, they would give the necessary favours.

After initiation into the ritualistic ways through **Upākarma-**i.e., after **dvijatva svīkāra-द्विजत्व स्वीकार -**the student** **who performs Agni Upāsana seeks from Gods the following blessings-



* **मेधावी भूयासम्**  -  **Medhāvī bhūyāsam -**Let me become an intellectual.
* **तेजस्वी भूयासम् -** **Tejasvī bhūyāsam -**Let me have the intellectual resplendence.
* **वर्चस्वी भूयासम् – Varcasvī** **bhūyāsam -**Let me have exalted stature in the society.
* **आयुश्मान् भूयासम्**- **Āyuśmān bhūyāsam –**Let me have long life.
* **अन्नादो भूयासम् -Annādo bhūyāsam -**Let me have strong digestive power.
* **सर्वसमृद्धो भूयासम्** -**Sarvasamṛddho bhūyāsam -** Let me have all physical wants at my disposal- i.e.- food, clothing, shelter, etc**.**

The above are not mean or cheap desires. They are highly dignified. These blessings were sought from the Gods with the belief that they would bestow the necessary favours. In the same tone many Mantras are there in Medhāsūktam:

**मयि मेधाम् मयि प्रजाम् मय्यग्निस्तेजो दधातु।**

**मयि मेधाम् मयि प्रजाम् मयीन्द्र इन्द्रियम् दधातु।**

**मयि मेधाम् मयि प्रजाम् सूर्यो भ्राजो दधातु।**

**Mayi mēdhām mayi prajām mayi agniḥ - tējō dadhātu.**

**Mayi mēdhām mayi prajām mayi indra indriyam dadhātu.**

**Mayi mēdhām mayi prajām sūryō bhrājō dadhātu.**

May Agni render in me intelligence, continuity of progeny and splendour born of Vedic study. May Indra render in me intelligence, continuity of progeny and virility. May Surya render in me intelligence, continuity of progeny and prowess that strikes fear in the hearts of enemies.

This is one part of Karmakāṇḍa. But the question arises now under the second part of Karmakāṇḍa, under which the **kāmya-karmā-s** are listed. Karmakāṇḍa takes a stand where certain mantras with corresponding homadravyā-s, when offered through a combination of chanting and offerings to Agni, can bring desired results. Under kāmyakarma we have for example;** **



* **पर्जन्यहोम - Parjanyahoma -**where rain can be sought after
* **मृत्युञ्जयहोम**- **Mṛtyuñjayahoma‍ -**where the mortality could be extended**.**
* **पुत्रकामेष्टि याग**- **Putra-kāmeṣṭi yāga**- where progeny can be sought after.

But the whole question is this**. Is there any experimental support**to this aspect of Karmakāṇḍa which declares that we can win over the Gods and get their favours and have these dignified wishes fulfilled? Whatever palatable or interesting things one may say on this aspect of Karmakāṇḍa, the question posed by today’s generation is, whether these are born out of experimentation. This was the counter I had in my days of studentship also. By that time the country had moved in the direction of scientific thinking. Fifty years ago, science really started capturing the imagination of man. We became a scientifically oriented community. Being scientific in temperament, we would put questions why, what and how, for the things which we had no proof or justification. We would accept a thing only if it was reasoned out. We would not accept a thing on the basis of **śraddhā - श्रद्धा -**(pure faith) alone. The above aspect which looks so glorious is incomplete in the sense that the followers of karmakāṇḍa accepted them with blind faith with all its deficiencies because it was a dignified thing according to them and they had been so ordained.

When I became a brahmacāri (when I was initiated into the sandhyā) a dilemma arose in me whether I should repeat this practice simply because my forefathers did it on the basis of the commands from their gurus and the scriptures. As long as śraddhā was there things went well. For generations people respected Karmakāṇḍa rituals and went by them.

To cite another example, in **śrāddha-prayoga-श्राद्धप्रयोग**- (ceremony performed for the departed souls) the deviation of the slightest order was not accepted. It was looked down as sacrilege. Unquestioned adherence to details of karmakāṇḍa rituals went on for almost thousand years till we entered into the age of science when pure faith was washed away due to questioning the very basis of the need of such rituals. During this scientific age questions arose from every quarter as to which idea had to be accepted or which idea had to be rejected.

Let us take the example of the utility of Vitamin C for human consumption. The argument that it gave immunity against infection could be proved by its usage. So the idea was accepted as it had been tested and tried and results were the proof for that. Similarly, the argument that saturated fats and animal fats were harmful for humans due to its high percentage of cholesterol and its effect on the circulatory system was accepted since there was sufficient proof available. It was also reasonable, as it was proved by facts, that a wholesome diet must contain vitamins and minerals in minute proportions because of their special properties. Everywhere we started adopting this scientific spirit once it appealed to us as reasonable.

Our forefathers did not have this attitude of rebelling against the practices of karmakāṇḍa. While we in our generation questioned the practice, our children and grand children are questioning its legitimacy.

That is how Karmakāṇḍa suffered neglect when science came on the scene. I would say Agni upāsana is a forgotten thing. An apology for Sandhyā is tried by those whosoever is practising it. Most of us have given it up. The civilization that stood the test of time for more than thousand years, omitting no details in its practices, was just set aside over the last fifty years. This is not the case only with Hinduism. I was looking in detail as to how other religions also are suffering the same way. Can we save these religious practices from this attack? Karmakāṇḍa promoters cannot give an answer to such attacks even today as it went by authority, went by dictation-**इदं कुरु, इदं मा कुरु**  -  **'Idaṁ kuru,** **Idaṁ mā kuru-**Do this. Don’t do that.

Another aspect of karmakāṇḍa pertains to various tenets-** **

**मातृदेवो भव, पितृदेवो भव, आचार्यदेवो भव, अतिथिदेवो भव ।**

**'Mātṛdevo** **bhava' 'Pitṛdevo bhava' ‘Ācāryadevo Bhava’ ‘Atithidevo Bhava’.**

It was a mandate that one’s mother, father, guru and a guest should be treated Godly. A youngster asked me the other day, 'If my father is bad, should I worship him as God?' He put forth an argument that Daśaratha (of Rāmāyaṇa) was unreasonable when he asked Rāma to go to the forest for no fault of his. Therefore Rāma should not have obeyed him. This 'Matṛdevo bhāva' 'Pitṛdevo bhāva' should be conditional and cannot be generalised. The argument and reasoning given by this youngster seems justified. When we come into the age of science, many religious values weaken. That is what has happened to karmakāṇḍa in the scientific age.

When I was the Head of the Department of chemistry, twenty years ago, an incident occurred which I would like to share with you now. One of my junior colleagues, who was equally disposed to fundamental thinking, came to me one day with a booklet. It was a forty page performance that was an edited version of a series of talks given by a professor of Theology from a prestigious American university. The professor was teaching Theology to the post doctoral students giving ethical values, moral values, religious values, in a very gusto way. One of the students listened carefully and at the close of the lesson expressed his total disagreement with whatever professor had narrated and termed all of them as illogical.

He questioned the professor as to-why should he not steal? Why should he not walk away with neighbour’s wife, if she agreed? If he robbed or stole, he would get more money and that money he could exchange for joy and for comforts. Joy was the pursuit of life for anybody whether religious or irreligious. The student went on to say that the religion was a joy killer and restricted the scope of one’s joy. It curtailed one’s happiness. He concluded that such a value system could not be accepted and deserved to be rejected outright.

Can you see the ruthless attack on religion in two directions! It has no self defence by way of arguing itself as the right thing. Everyone wants to have a free life of indulgence and thinks it as his right. <u>Indulgence gives him joy. More indulgence is more joyful. It is quite a natural demand as the purpose of life is happiness. No religion can probably defend itself against such a reasonable attack</u>.

We cannot call that student foolish, deserved to be dismissed or ignored, as he is a post doctoral student. The student in question says that unless the religion, the advocates of religion, gives a justifying answer he is not satisfied. The best part of the booklet was that the teacher confessed that he had no answer nor he could find any answers in the religious texts. Does any one of you have an answer to this touchy question? Every attack of that student is reasonable. Karmakāṇḍa in itself has no answer to this question. No religion, as I can perceive, can give a satisfactory answer to this question.

I subscribe to the view that everybody is in need of joy. That cannot be questioned. But then, <u>I can show you that by applying restraints, which is the best factor of every religion,**indriyanigraha**-self restraint- governing oneself is the only way of getting **śāśvata-sukha - - शाश्वत सुख** - everlasting joy. Religion does not take you away from joy as complained by that post doctoral student. Religion can help you reach a lasting joy. Bhogasukha or worldly pleasure gives incremental, segmental, admixed joy</u>. <u>This joy is preceded or succeeded by restlessness. Religion gives you complete stretch of joy</u>. Once that is accepted, the whole world can turn religious. The great ethical, moral, religious, dhārmik values simply get restored through this.

The whole world is now turning materialistic. It is not that Christianity is losing; it is not that Hindu religion is getting lost. It is the triumph of materialism over spiritual and ethical values that we should be anxious about. Is it defective in its content? Can there be a holistic model? If so what are the defects? Can we justify the religious values? Can we restore the religious values, ethical values, spiritual values? Otherwise where is the answer to the problems of today's culture which caters to the materialistic world? Is man happy with all this technology, this hurry, this rat race? Every moment we are in a state of hurry. Are we comfortable? Are we happy? If not, then where does happiness lie? We have taken a superficial truth as the ultimate position. We have automatically assumed the stand without examining in detail all the factors that are responsible for the joy. Materialism goes on the basis that objects give joy and the way of life should be more and more of ungoverned indulgence which yields more and more of sukha. Re-examination of our value system is exactly what Vedānta does.

This is exactly where **Jñānakāṇḍa**comes to our rescue. Jñānakāṇḍa is that part of Vedas which constitute the philosophical treatise. Let us try to know a few things about them.



* It is called **Jñānakāṇḍa—ज्ञानकाण्ड** -because it emphasises knowledge, it emphasises parīkṣā, it emphasises investigation, which is the true way of a scientist.
* **Upaniṣad** –**उपनिषत्-**means to sit near the teacher and absorb his knowledge in order to kill one’s ignorance.
* It is also known as **Vedānta- वेदान्त -** - the end portion of Vedas, the best portion of Vedas, the peak of Vedas, the cream of Vedas, the essence of Vedas.
* It talks about the causal stuff of this universe- therefore it is **Brahmavidyā- ब्रह्मविद्या -** - Brahma is the name for the original substance, whose transformed state is jagat. Vedānta discusses that principle, therefore it is Brahmavidyā.

It is a knowledge where the 'I' entity is investigated. 'I' has another name ‘**Atman**’-**आत्मा.**



* Therefore it is**ātmavidyā- आत्मविद्या -**ātmāparīkṣā is done here, therefore it is ātmāvidyā.
* It is a science which gives you the secrets of ānanda, therefore it is called **ānanda - vidyā**, **madhu - vidyā- आनन्दविद्या, मधुविद्या.**
* It is **adhyātma-** **अध्यात्म -** - the science of the inside- **Ātmānam adhikṛtya- आत्मानम् अधिकृत्य -** means studying the inside stuff of man or the **antaḥkaraṇa-** **अन्तःकरण -** -therefore **adhyātma.**

Why did I go to Upaniṣads? If you ask me that question my answer would be that I went to the Upaniṣads desperately as I was suffering. I needed it most. I was miserable. What was my misery? I had a good wife, a good job, recognition in society. I was a very good teacher. But I was suffering. What was I suffering from? I was **<u>fast</u>**... **<u>Speed</u>** had overcome me. What was my other suffering? I was always **<u>focussing</u>**, studious, researching on anything and everything. I used to ponder over trivial topics like, why the American President is fighting with the Russian President? Why not they live and let live? I used to find out the reasons for such things which were not at all important to my life. That was my problem. Every problem on earth was my problem. Why are they piling up nuclear weapons? A press of a button can destroy either America or Russia. That means I was too much awake - research in context and out of context.

Although I was a chemistry professor, I studied civil engineering as if to excel a civil engineer. I learnt fundamentals of medicine as if to excel a conventional doctor. I knew more of carpentry than the carpenter himself, like the stability of a chair? What should be the extent of inclination to give comfort? But I was miserable. I lost the skill of resting.

See how human skills, when pushed to measures beyond tolerance limits, can injure the person. I thought these were my best points--researching, being studious, focussing and concentrating. I lost my sleep. I lost my appetite. Instead of being in the company of my wife where I should relax and enjoy, I would be always serious. I became a case for psychiatry. Even Dr. Govindaswamy, the then director of NIMHANS in Bangalore, could not help me. I could not sleep continuously for half an hour. No one could help me at that point where as Vedānta alone came to my rescue.** **

Arjuna, the hero of Mahābhārata suffered this way:

**गाण्डीवं स्रंसते ह्स्ताद्वाक्चैव परिदह्यते ।**

**न च शक्नोम्यवस्थातुं भ्रमतीव च मे मन:॥**

**Gāṇḍīvaṁ sraṁsatē hstāt-tvāk-ca-ēva paridahyatē,**

**na ca śaknōmi-avasthātuṁ bhramatīva ca mē manaḥ.** (Bhagavad-Ġīta, 1-29 & 1-30)

Arjuna tells Krishna that he is unsettled and is confused. It has become a malady for him whether to fight for one value system or another value system. How to overcome the clash of interest between his relatives and gurus on the one side and his duty, as a Kşatriya, on the other side. He is at a loss to understand what course of action he should take. This situation gave birth to the most valuable vedāntic treatise, **Śrīmadbhagavadgītā –श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता.**

Similarly Sri Rāma (of Rāmāyana) also went into melancholy as he found that everything in his life became stale. Kingship became stale. Honour-recognition-status became stale. King Daśaratha lost his cool and was in tears. He almost came to the conclusion that he had lost his son. He was all the while under the impression that Sri Rāma would be an excellent king, representing the Raghu dynasty. When Sage Viśvāmitra visited him, King Daśaratha asked for a solution for Rāma’s depression. Sage Viśvāmitra assured that the problem was very simple and the solution was available in his own court yard. He suggested the King to put Rāma into a dialogue with sage Vāsiṣṭa who was an expert in Brahmavidyā as he felt that it was only with the help of Vedānta such a problem could be solved. That was how **Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa – योगवासिष्ठ -** was born. In that big discussion, Rāma asked all the questions that haunted the people of the world and sought for an answer from the Sage. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha is one of the best texts I have come across in vedāntic literature. Many of the difficult questions that we encounter have been comfortably answered.

In another context in the **Chāndogya Upaniṣad- छान्दोग्य उपनिषत्**, an interesting situation comes where Maharṣi Nārada is the student and Sanatkumāra is the teacher. Nārada comes to Sanatkumāra and announces his credentials, his worthiness to become a student as under:

**यजुरध्येमि, ऋगध्येमि, क्षात्रविद्याम्, नक्षत्रविद्याम्, गन्धर्वविद्याम् ।**Chāndogya Upa. 7-1-2)



* **Yajuradhyemi, ṛgadhyemi -**I know all the four Veda-s.
* **Kṣātravidyām –**I know the science of valour.
* **Nakṣatravidyām –**I know the science of Astronomy**.**
* **Gandharvavidyām-**I know the art of music and dance.

Despite the above, I have come to you to seek solution to my problem as I am in distress and I am not comfortable with myself.

A R̥ṣi of devaloka, is declaring or swearing that he is in distress and discomfort. It is very much interesting to note that, the affected persons in the instances mentioned above were no ordinary people. But, all of them complained that they were suffering, getting dejected in life, had depressed state of mind etc.

There are hundreds of intellectuals in present day world who are suffering this way. They have lost their sleep, they have lost their appetite. They have come to a stage of nervous breakdown due to too much of focussing, too much of problem solving and too much of attention on the matters which are trivial.

At this point of impasse, at this point of deadlock, Vedānta, a beautiful piece of literature which is an integral part of the Vedas, can simply come to our rescue. All religious values in this world can be defended, through the insight of Vedas, through the explanations found in Vedas.

What a wonderful contribution the Indian thinkers have made, to what fundamental levels they have gone, what ingenuity they had displayed in their studies, how powerful their researches were. That is the greatness of Vedānta, which we are going to study in the course of these lectures culminating in the grand revelation as to how Vedānta is a tonic for all the suffering in this world.

In order to find out a real solution to Duḥkha, we have to turn only to the Upaniṣad-s. They are the only source of comfort to a person in distress. Repeatedly our sages are asserting that if one wants real liberation from duḥkha, one should examine himself and find out his true nature. This is the declaration in Chāndogya Upa.(7-1-3)

**शोकम् तरति आत्मवित् इति ।**

**Śokam tarati ātmavit iti.**

(The one who has realized SELF overcomes grief.)

This Duḥkha or grief is everybody's problem - be it of Christians, Europeans, Americans, Hindus, Chinese or Japanese. That's why Upaniṣads deserve to be called as the universal philosophy.

Upaniṣad-s, the religious text which is divested of all the overtones of Karmakāṇḍa, directs its student not to indulge in the external world which is responsible for Duḥkha but to start looking within himself and find out his true nature. The right answer to this problem lies in finding out who is this ‘I’? Who is it that is saying again and again-I am rich-I am poor-I am depressed-I am helpless-I am suffering? Where from this pulsation is getting generated? Is it possible to tame them? Is this ‘I’ a reference point for all our activities? Such questions have not been either thought of or discussed in other schools. This is the true beginning for a student of Vedānta.

We will now take up a few questions posed in the Vedānta Sampradāya:

**कोहं। कथमिदं जातं।**

**किं वा मरण जन्मनि।**

**कथं शाम्यति वेत्ति भो**॥      (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha 6-9-252)

**Kōhaṁ? Katham-idaṁ jātaṁ?**

**Kiṁ vā maraṇa janmani?**

**Kathaṁ śāmyati vētti bhō.**

**Kōhaṁ? -**Who am ‘I’?

**Kathamidaṁ jātaṁ? –**What is this creation with its multiplicity? Does it have a single cause? These questions in cosmology and theoretical physics are haunting the scientists. Can we reduce the whole universe into one or two terms? Physicists of today are still with the four basic forces. Such questions, which are now being thought of by theoretical physicists, had already been raised by our Rishis, ten thousand years ago.

**Kiṁ vā maraṇa janmani? -** What is life? What is death? Does anything survive death? Is there anything which is everlasting? Is there a residue after death?

**Kathaṁ śāmyati vētti bhō?** Tell me how this world subsides?

The whole thinking of the modern biologist is that life is a refinement of matter, an after position of evolved matter. Man has still not settled the basic question whether life is more fundamental or matter more fundamental. It is still an unanswered question in science even today, as all of us know that. Such a question was taken up for study by our ancient Rishis.

**मनुष्येऽस्तीत्येके नायमस्तीति चैके**। (Kaṭha Upa. 1-1-20)

**Manuṣyē-astī-iti-ēkē na-ayam-astī-iti ca-ēkē**.** **

Whether something outlives death or death is the end of everything? Some say yes, some say no. Which is right? This question was posed by Naciketa (student) to Yamadharmarāja (Guru).

**कथं बन्धः कथं मोक्षः-**(Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha, 6-9-253)

**Kathaṁ bandhaḥ kathaṁ mōkṣaḥ?**

What is this suffering? What is this helplessness? What is the solution?

**इति प्रश्नानुदाहरन् पारावारविदां पादान्कस्माद्राजन्न सेवसे**।** **(Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha-6-9-253)

**Iti praśnān-udāharan pārāvāravidāṁ pādān-kasmāt rājan na sēvasē.**

Posing such questions, go to the experts who have solved them. Go to a teacher not in a challenging way, but in a very modest way, with full faith and acceptance of the teacher's ability, by serving him, by looking after his comforts**.**

**साधूनां समदृष्टीनां परिप्रश्नेन सेवय। ।**

**संङ्गमेन च सा युक्तिर्लभते मुच्यते यया ॥**

**Sādhūnāṁ sama-dr̥ṣṭīnāṁ paripraśnēna sēvaya,**

**saṁṅgamēna ca sā yuktiḥ labhatē mucyatē yayā.** (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha 6-9-254)

It is not that the teacher gives some magic wand and the problem is solved or the teacher gives some blessing by which the solution is in sight. None of such things are quoted anywhere in vedāntic texts. What does the teacher give you by way of parihāra_ _(solution)? He gives you a style of logic, a line of investigation, a line of thinking by which your doubts are cleared. You don’t have to accept the teacher even. He gives you a fresh direction of investigation the result of which is an answer to the problem. That is what precisely Vedānta does. You don’t have to accept anything. The student can argue with the teacher. This is what we saw earlier in the case of the post doctoral student who did not agree with his teacher and posed serious doubts. It is not possible to understand Vedānta by listening to a lecture, but by repeated introspection and clarifying the doubts that arises in the mind-by one to one dialogue-by cross questioning the teacher-sometimes not agreeing to what he says and expressing freely one’s own point of view.

In fact, our Upaniṣads contain such serious dialogues where in the teacher is not disturbed by the nature of the question but answers the student very calmly. In **Praśnopaniṣad - प्रश्नोपनिषत् -**the student asks his master- - (Q 3-1)

**भगवन् कुत एषः प्राणो जायते**।

**Bhagavan kuta ēṣaḥ prāṇō jāyatē.**

Where does this prāṇa originate from? This is a question which is very difficult to answer. And the teacher instead of scolding the student says - **Ati praśnān-pṛcchasi** **brahmiṣṭosi - अति प्रश्नान्पृच्छसि** **ब्रह्मिष्टोसि.**You are asking difficult questions, extraordinary questions-that is all the reason why I should discuss with you. That was the attitude of the teacher. How scientific the whole tradition was! Any disturbing or difficult question could be posed and the teacher welcomed it. That was the true scientific spirit.

I would like to mention about an incident which took place some years ago in our house. It was in the case of a professor of a famous institute in Bangalore who was very much into western thinking that he swore by Sartre’s existentialism and his big ideas. One day he came along with his wife accidentally to one of the Sunday Classes going on in my house. We were discussing the ‘ānanda’ mechanism as detailed in the Upaniṣad-s He was moved so much by that one single day’s discussion, he returned the very next day in the morning and said that he was totally convinced about the line of thought we were discussing the previous day. A person who disowned Hinduism so much and called all ritualistic things as meaningless and foolish, started learning Rudra and Puruşasūkta under a teacher for three years and now he is spending his time for three hours every day in the morning chanting mantra and performing the ritualistic programmes.

The importance of Karmakāṇḍa comes to the forefront once Vedānta is studied and understood in this way. Vedānta therefore doesn’t differ with karmakāṇḍa. It strengthens karmakāṇḍa. <u>Whatever **cittaśuddhi-**cleansing of mind-has to happen which is a pre requisite in Vedānta, is possible only through karmakāṇḍa.</u> Reciting aṣṭottara, sahasranāma, performing different pūja-s, earns a meaning with this broad understanding. What is looked as very primitive ideas in the eyes of the modern man become very significant as sādhana progresses. Thus, the role of japa and the role of repeating gāyatrīmantra can be explained. Everything fits in here. A student of Vedānta in the earlier phase of sādhana really goes to karmakāṇḍa and its details. In the later phase a standard process of **śravaṇa, manana** and **nididhyāsana** -**-श्रवण-मनन-निदिध्यासन -** has to take place. Then he has to sit and diffuse himself and workout alone.

Thank you for listening.



### IN SEARCH OF OUR TRUE NATURE - AN OVERVIEW

In our last talk we tried to bring out the differences between karmakāṇḍa and jñānakāṇḍa. It is possible that I have spoken lightly of karmakāṇḍa, but karmakāṇḍa is a very valuable part of Vedas. I was just showing the differences in the content, rather than emphasising the superior ways in which jñānakāṇḍa takes us in the realm of spiritual study. Whosoever has that śraddhā and devotion to karmakāṇḍa details is certainly a superior person. Please do not slacken that śraddhā, as it pays in the long run. All religious activities conceived by the Indian**R̥ṣi-s  - ऋषि**- have a very big significance in creating peace in our minds.**Śankara - शङ्कर**makes a conclusive statement about it, calling that all the religious activities are aimed at**Cittaśuddhi - चित्तशुद्धि -**cleansing of the mind. The whole of karmakāṇḍa is highly valuable because it purifies the mind and very soon we come to the realization that purified mind is**ātmā - आत्मा** **or** **Brahma - ब्रह्म.** I will be wrong if I underrate karmakāṇḍa rituals. The worship, the **pūjā - पूजा**, the **prārthanā - प्रार्थना** and the **vrata - व्रत**that every Indian home does, is equally important in the attainment of peace of mind.

Once at a couples' camp at Kanyakumari in India where eighty people had participated, I was observing a Maharaṣṭrian lady, a doctor by profession, who was constantly doing **Japa - जप** while listening to the lectures. Out of curiosity, I asked her whether it was the Maharaṣṭrian way. She replied that she always did Japa whenever she found time during the day, irrespective of the place and time. So her mind had become **Japamātra - जपमात्र**. Imagine the cittaśuddhi that could have happened to that lady when all unwanted thoughts are simply replaced by the japa. Once the mind is purified, then that is the seat of peace. A purified mind is ānanda or ātmā or Brahma.

**निगृहीतस्य मनसो निर्विकल्पस्य धीमतः।**

**Nigr̥hītasya manasō nirvikalpasya dhīmataḥ.**

(Māṇ. Up.3-Kā.34)

An assertion from a famous thinker Gauḍapāda, the grand preceptor of Śankara, **Nigr̥hītaṁ manaḥ ēva nirbhayaṁ brahma  - निगृहीतं मनः एव निर्भयं ब्रह्म  -**the fully conquered mind, the fully tamed mind is verily Brahman, the seat of bliss, the seat of ānanda.

Coming back to our point, jñānakāṇḍa is remarkable because it is scientific in every sense of the word and you all know that it appeals to us more, as we are scientific by disposition and by training. Therefore there is a good deal of matching in our thinking process. One does not have to take things for granted. Everything goes by investigation. If the points stated are established, one accepts them or else one rejects them. That’s the courage shown in jñānakāṇḍa reflecting a typical scientific temper.

Fundamental questions are posed and answers sought in Jñānakāṇḍa. Questions which are relevant to day to day life of mankind are tackled. It is a universal science catering to the needs of anybody and everybody irrespective of caste, creed, religion, nation, race etc. It need not be stressed that everyone is suffering with one or the other problem. Anyone can swear by this. Vedānta comes to the rescue of one and all and assures a total and everlasting solution to one’s suffering. It is for this reason that we should go to this science. **Ātyantika duḥkha nivāraṇa, niratiśaya sukhaprāpti - आत्यन्तिक दुःख निवारण, निरतिशय सुखप्राप्ति**(cessation of perennial suffering and attainment of unbounded happiness)** **is the motto of that science. Upaniṣad-s themselves declare this point. A person after self examination can actually discover his true nature and come out of sorrow automatically. A student comes and asks the teacher:

**कस्मिन्नु भगवो विज्ञाते सर्वमिदं विज्ञातं भवतीति ।**

**Kasminnu bhagavō vijñātē sarvaṁ-idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati-iti.** (Muṇḍaka Upa. 1-1-3)

O master, give that knowledge knowing which everything is known. This jigsaw puzzle is completely solved once you are a sādhaka as enumerated in Muṇḍaka Upa. (2-2-9) thus:

**भिद्यते हृदयग्रन्थिश्छिद्यन्ते सर्वसंशयाः।**

**क्षीयन्ते चास्य कर्माणि तस्मिन् दृष्टे परावरे॥**

**Bhidyatē hr̥dayagranthiḥ-chidyantē sarva-saṁśayāḥ,**

**kṣīyantē ca-asya karmāṇi tasmin dr̥ṣṭē parāvarē.**

**Bhidyatē hr̥dayagranthiḥ _-_**

The pressure at the **Ājñācakra**, at the optic centre (space_ _between the eye brows) is totally relieved.**_ _**

**Chidyantē sarvasaṁśayāḥ**

To a student of Vedānta, this knot of bondage is completely cut. All doubts are cleared.

And, what else?**kṣīyantē cā asya karmāṇi.** Everybody has a load of karma on his shoulders. Upaniṣadic wisdom shows that karma is not the ultimate. We are under the belief that only money fetching and objects of enjoyment thereof, brings us sukha. Śāstra proves that all this is not necessary for the end point. Kṣīyante chāsya karmāni-the load of karma simply gets dropped here.

When? **tasmin dr̥ṣṭē parāvarē-**When you know the mechanism by which the phenomenon turns into non phenomenon, when you can catch this reversible reaction, the creation phase versus the dissolution phase - **ātmasthiti - आत्मस्थिति**, all the gains come to you. So this philosophy by which this **duḥkhanāśa - दुःखनाश** – eradication of duḥkha happens is the main feature of Vedānta. If we keep this in mind, yesterday's objection on karmakāṇḍa can be forgotten.  As Nārada puts it-

**शोकम् तरति आत्मविदिति ---**

**Śōkam tarati ātmaviditi ---**Chāndogya Upa. 7-1-3)

With the knowledge of Self one can overcome grief.

Let us now try to understand how Vedānta goes about the above subject. It asks the person to investigate - do Parīkṣa. Whatever the inside forces are and whatever the inside phenomena are, observe them. The following beautiful stanza from Kaţhopaniṣhad (2-4-1) is worth elaborating and contemplating**.**:

**पराञ्चि खानि व्यतृणत्स्वयंभूस्तस्मात्पराङ्पश्यति नान्तरात्मन्।**

**कश्चित् धीरः प्रत्यगात्मानमैक्षत् आवृत्तचक्षुः अमृतत्वमिच्छन्॥**

**Parāñci khāni vyatr̥ṇat-svayaṁbhūḥ-tasmāt parān-paśyati na-antarātman.**

**Kaścit dhīraḥ pratyagātmānam-aikṣat āvr̥tta-cakṣuḥ amr̥tatvam-icchan.**



* Parāncikhāni_ _vyatṛṇat_ _svayambhuḥ_ _tasmāt_ _parān_ _paśyati_ _na_ _antarātman - The Creator has created the indriyā-s in man which are directed outwardly. He has structured them as if they go out always, look for things of pleasure. Hence we are always thinking of the outside world transacting through the Jñānendriyā-s.
* Kaścit dhīraḥ-** **Once in a way, a bold person is born who takes the centre stage. What does he do?
* Āvṛtta cakṣuḥ pratyagātmānam aikṣhata- He reverses the process. He turns the Indriyā-s** **inwards with his intellect. The tool of investigation turned inside, he conducts the search. Why does he do that?
* amṛtatvam icchan - To get everlasting happiness.

Such a hero was Nachiketha of Kaţhopaniṣad, who at his sixteenth year seriously sought answers from Yama to such deeper questions. This also goes to show that one has to search for truths at a very early age. Mainly two methods of investigation are suggested for this purpose. We will look at them one by one.

**1.Ātmaparīkṣā-आत्मपरीक्षा**–**Self Examination.**

I will narrate an incident from Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad -**बृहदारण्यक उपनिषत्**.

Yājñavalkya **– याज्ञवल्क्य** - is the great preceptor, the hero of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. He** **decides to take formal sanyāsa to enable him to do the sādhana for attainment of the reality he has theoretically und -erstood. To take sanyāsa, one should seek the permission of the wife. So naturally Yājñavalkya also had to do the same. He had two wives**Kātyāyanī - कात्यायनी**,** **and**Maitreyī- मैत्रेयी**. He goes to Kātyāyani, the elder wife and assures her that he will equally divide his wealth acquired from King Janaka so that both of them could be happy. Kātyāyani permits him to take sanyāsa** **as she is happy with the wealth provided for. Then he goes to Maitreyi and repeats the assurance given to the other wife and asks her permission to take sanyāsa. Maitreyi,** **on the other hand, questions him if the riches given by him would fetch permanent happiness. Yājñavalkya** **tells her the truth that riches cannot give permanent happiness.

**अमृतत्वस्य न आशा अस्ति वित्तेन**। - (Bṛha. Upa. 2-4-2)

**Amr̥tatvasya na āśā asti vittēna**

Riches can give comfort, but amṛtatva is impossible. Permanent joy, unbroken joy, undiluted joy, uninterrupted joy is not possible. Maitreyi says that she wants permanent happiness, if he can give her, other than the money. She wants the method by which she can get the**śāśvatasukha.**

The answer given by Yājñavalkya is the very famous vedāntic thought and also the method by which one can gain undiluted happiness. If one wants to be happy always, the only way is to know oneself.

**आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः श्रोतव्यः मन्तव्यः निदिध्यासितव्यः।**

**Ātmā vā arē draṣṭavyaḥ śrōtavyaḥ mantavyaḥ nididhyāsitavyaḥ.** (Bṛha Upa. 2-4-5)

My dear (Maitreyi), Self should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon.

The gist of Vedānta has been condensed into one sentence and a prescription is given. Are you really interested in Sukha? Total Sukha? Then why don’t you do ātmāparīkṣa? But, what is ātmā and why parīkṣa? A wonderful explanation is given by Yajñavalkya as under ((Bṛha Upa. 2-4-5)

**न वा अरे पत्युः कामाय पतिः प्रियो भवति, आत्मनस्तु कामाय पतिः प्रियो भवति। न वा अरे जायायै कामाय जाया प्रिया भवति, आत्मनस्तु कामाय जाया प्रिया भवति। .............. न वा अरे लोकानां कामाय लोकाः ...... न वा अरे सर्वस्य कामाय सर्वं ...**

**Na vā arē patyuḥ kāmāya patiḥ priyō bhavati, ātmanastu kāmāya patiḥ priyō bhavati| na vā arē jāyāyai kāmāya jāyā priyā bhavati, ātmanastu kāmāya jāyā priyā bhavati| .............. na vā arē lōkānāṁ kāmāya lōkāḥ ...... na vā arē sarvasya kāmāya sarvaṁ...**

Verily, not for the sake of the husband is the husband loved, but he is loved for the sake of the self. Not for the sake of the wife is the wife loved, but she is loved for the sake of the self. Not for the sake of the sons, my dear, are the sons loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self.

Likewise, not for the sake of wealth, animals, world, everyone... are all loved. But, they are loved for the sake of the self.

Husband is dear to the wife not for husband’s sake, but for her own sake. Similar is the case with the husband. Wife is important as long as she satisfies him. Husband is comfortable because of his wife since she is interesting to him. If each says that the other is important for other’s sake, it is self deceit. One holds Vedas high not because they are reverential, but because they give one the comfort. Activities like social service, scientific research, etc. are noble and beneficial to the society. People involved in such activities seem to be under the impression that they are doing so for the sake of activities. In reality, these activities are dear to the persons involved as they give comfort, joy, satisfaction and happiness to them personally. If any activity does not contribute to one’s stock of happiness, one will not do that. Therefore, what is that atman (self) to which all your concerns are really directed? This atman or this reference point, for whose delight you are seeing worthwhileness in all things/activities, is to be found out.

So the first method of investigation is ātmaparīkṣā under the guidance of a competent teacher. Who is a competent teacher? Scriptures are very careful in prescribing the rules for that.

**तद्विज्ञानार्थं स गुरुमेवाभिगच्छेत्।**

**समित्पाणिः श्रोत्रियम् ब्रह्मनिष्ठम्॥-**Muṇḍaka Upa.1-2-12.

**Tat-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum-ēva-abhigacchēt,**

**samitpāṇiḥ śrōtriyam brahma-niṣṭham.**

For the attainment of knowledge of SELF one has to approach the teacher who is not only a scholar but also is established in Brahman.

A competent teacher is one who should have double qualifications. There are two eligibility factors. What are they? He must be well versed with the śāstrā-s. That alone is not sufficient, because he may be repeating the śāstra in a parrot like way, without himself being a brahmaniṣṭha_,_ without having touched the source. So, while śrotriyatva_ _is necessary, brahmaniṣṭhatva is also necessary. He must have known the truth, not only by śāstrarūpeņa but also by anubhavarūpeņa_. _The two factors put together are necessary to be a teacher**.**

**2. Sukha-Duḥkha Parīkṣa- सुखदुःखपरीक्षा ।**

This is the second method suggested by the śāstra. As already discussed in the introductory talk, every person craves for more and more happiness or sukha. At the same time, he wants to get rid of suffering or duḥkha. He is continuously and constantly struggling for sukha-prāpti and duḥkha-nivṛtti. In order to know the truth, Vedānta asks the student to do the parīkṣa of duḥkha or sukha, as the case may be, in greater depth. That is, one has to delve deep into the problem itself and find the solution by analysing the same to its minute details.

Before we get into the discussions it should be clearly borne in mind that our entire deliberations relate to **Mental Level** or the Psychic Level or Citta Level or Intellectual Level and not at physical level.

### SUKHA-DUḤKHA PARĪKṣA 
(AN ANALYSIS OF HAPPINESS AND SUFFERING)

The credit of discovering this path definitely has to go to me. In my days of intense suffering, I was frantically searching for solutions in Vedānta śāstrās by thorough study of the texts along with the invaluable commentary by Śankara on them. This in-depth search of mine led to the discovery of the above path. When presented in the public, many took it with disbelief and they naturally wanted sanction in Vedāntic Texts or Śāstra Pramāna. In Chāndogya Upaniṣad (7-22)** **Sanatkumāra (the teacher) tells Nārada (the student) that:

**यदा वै सुखं लभतेऽथ करोति।**

**Yadā vai sukhaṁ labhate atha karōti.**

One will involve oneself in that activity only which gives him Sukha or happiness.

**सुखं लब्ध्वा करोति - Sukhaṁ labdhvā karōti.**

One will not venture into that activity which will not result in happiness.

**सुखमेव लब्ध्वा करोति।**

**Sukham-ēva labdhvā karōti.**

One is goaded into an activity if he gets only happiness.

**सुखंत्वेव विजिज्ञासितव्यमिति ।**

**Sukhaṁtvēva vijijñāsitavyam-iti.**

Hence, we have to investigate or do the parīkṣa of sukha only. Therefore the student requests the teacher:

**सुखं भगवो विजिज्ञास इति॥**

**Sukhaṁ bhagavō vijijñāsa iti.**

Oh my Lord, let me know about the secrets of Sukha.

In Taittirīya Upaniṣad, (2-8) the aspect of Ānanda or Happiness or Sukha is discussed in detail:** **

**सैषानन्दस्य मीमांसा भवति।**

**Sa-ēṣa-ānandasya mīmāṁsā bhavati.**

The teacher calls the student for an investigation of ānanda.

When the teacher suggests sukha-duḥkha parīkṣa, the student immediately reacts, saying that everything about sukha and duḥkha is known already. What more is there to be studied? Look at the reaction of the student. He can categorically tell what his knowledge about sukha-duḥkha is. He declares that he knows about sukha in the sense that music gives him joy, a sweet dish gives him joy, company of welcome friends gives him joy, and a very understanding wife gives him joy. If these are not available, then he is not happy. He further elaborates that if his son/daughter is not studious, he is not happy. Pleasant situations give him joy. Indriya āsvādana gives him joy. The contact of five indriyā-s with the corresponding viṣayā-s, give him joy. The minus of that puts him into sorrow. So, he declares that he knows everything about sukha and duḥkha.

The teacher sets aside the conclusions drawn by the student. He wants the student to investigate Sukha and Duḥkha **content wise and not agency wise.** Here one should pause a little, contemplate and try to catch the difference between knowing the thing agency wise and the same thing content wise. The general opinion is that certain things put one in a happy mood and certain other things put one in an unhappy mood. This was not the study the teacher wanted the student to go into. **He wanted the student to closely watch his state of mind when the student declared that he was happy. Similarly, the teacher wanted the student to study the Cittasthiti (mental state) when he felt he was unhappy.**

This type of investigation, none of us have tried when we are in moments of sukha or duḥkha. Instead, we had restricted our studies of happy or unhappy state at the indriya level all the time. That is all the study we made. Content-wise we have to examine what is sukha and what is duḥkha. We should observe this difference. What was my mental state when I said that the whole of Sunday was a bad day? What is my mental state when I say that it is beautiful, I am so fine? This parīkṣa may look very simple, but it has not occurred to anybody in the world to do the parīkṣa this way. It is exclusively the suggestion from the Upaniṣads. No philosopher, no system of philosophy could give it in such simple terms. In no religion or practice it has been emphasised that sukha-duḥkha parīkṣa should be on the lines where you examine the state of the mind when you are happy and the state of the mind when you are not happy.**The suggestion is unique to the Upaniṣads**. What is the psychological state, what is the psychological posture when you are happy and when you are not happy? A very simple examination but it is a very profound one. It can take you to a new discovery. That’s why I mentioned yesterday that Vedanta is a difficult science, but when properly understood, it is the easiest of all the sciences.


#### DUḤKHA PARĪKṣA (EXAMINATION OF SUFFERING)

Let us take up duḥkha parīkṣa to start with and later on go to sukha parīkṣa. What is Duḥkha parīkṣa? Take any duḥkha moment and see what the cittasthiti is. That’s all. Every day we have many moments of duḥkha. Observe what is the state of the mind at that time? Take the case of the day previous to the examination results of a student. The parents of the person are anxious and the student is anxious. The student’s interest is either to get into the computer science course or to get into the medical course, because they are the highest paying jobs. Just imagine the state of parent’s mind or the student’s mind and identify yourself with that situation. Oh! Would I get my first class? Will I lose that? All my plans will be broken if I don’t get it. Would it be a donation seat? Or would it be a seat earned on merit? What then? What are the alternatives? I have such high expectations about the result.

What's the nature of mind at that time? Anxiety! Insecurity! Fear! Doubt! The student wants to relax, but he cannot. He or she is agitated, disturbed. See the revised way of studying duḥkha, not constituent-wise, not ingredients-wise, not characteristics-wise,

The most powerful example that I always remember to illustrate, is to imagine the mental state of your wife or daughter or your sister when a baby is about to be delivered in the family. Admitted to the hospital/ nursing home, the lady is moved to the operation theatre. Watch the husband or father or the mother of the lady in question. They are all anxious, moving up and down the corridor of the hospital. Would it be a simple labour case? Would it be a forceps case? Would it be a caesarean case? Would the child and the mother be safe? The state of mind of the concerned person, when observed, points to **Uncertainty, Anxiety, Impatience, Fear,**which are all attributes of duḥkha.

Similarly, Rāga-attraction,** **Dveṣa-repulsion, Bhaya-fear, are also facets of duḥkha. Jealousy comes when you have only one car and your neighbour has more than that. You grudge him. You feel small. It's that inferiority complex that bothers you- this is a duḥkha attribute. Mind is agitated, excited and troubled. You try to further see the common factor through a scientist's eye-that is, to reduce many things into as few things as possible.

It is a well established fact in Vedānta that the entire set of activities of a human being, both physical and psychological, are nothing but Prāṇic Activity only. Prāṇa is defined as ‘Gatiḥ Prāṇaḥ’-** गतिः प्राणः**. Movement is Prāṇa. Movement is vibration or pulsation. Chāndogya Upaniṣad** **declares that:

**…स यदा स्वपिति प्राणमेव वागप्येति । प्राणं चक्षुःप्राणं श्रोत्रं प्राणं मनः प्राणोह्येवैतान् सर्वान् संवृङ्क्त इति।**

**…sa yadā svapiti prāṇam-ēva vāk-apyēti.  prāṇaṁ cakṣuḥ prāṇaṁ śrōtraṁ prāṇaṁ manaḥ prāṇō-hi-ēva-ētān sarvān saṁvr̥ṅkta iti.**

 (Chāndogya Upa. 4-3-3)**  **

When a person is in deep sleep his speech gets merged into general prāṇic activity. Likewise his seeing, hearing, thinking, etc. - i.e., all his physical and psychological activities - merge into a single prāṇic activity or a general vibration.

The above can be easily grasped if we think of a person who is in coma. Except the beating of the pulse there is no other activity in him. All other physical and mental activities stand merged in this mere pulsation- general prāṇic activity.



* Our thinking centre (centre of our mind which is called as Citta) is filled with Prāṇaic Activity, Vibration or Movement.
* Any activity involves variation in its occurrence – it may be very slow, slow, normal, fast, very fast etc.

As already discussed above, the teacher’s direction of investigating Duḥkha is to watch the state of mind when one says that he is not happy or is suffering. Accordingly, if one examines his own mind or Citta Centre when he is angry it is highly agitated, the level of activity is at a very high speed, there is fastness, there is restlessness, citta is filled with throbbing prānic activity. Although he is not in a position to watch his state of mind at the peak of his anger, he can do so when he calms down a little. We would have seen people physically disturbed and even trembling during such angry situations. When we analyse this, we can say that Rāga, Krodha (Anger), Jealousy, Bhaya (fear), Anxiety, Uncertainty, Impatience, Hurry etc., are all synonyms of **SPEED** only. All these situations amount to fastness or hyper activity of the mind (citta) called **VEGA** in Sanskrit. Thus, all such moments are moments of Duḥkha or suffering. Let us take up the following Śloka of Bhagavad-Ġīta (5-23).

**शक्नोतीहैव यः सोढुं प्राक्शरीरविमोक्षणात् ।**

**कामक्रोधोद्भवं वेगं स युक्तः स सुखी नर:॥**

**Śaknōti-iha-ēva yaḥ sōḍhuṁ prāk-śarīra- vimōkṣaṇāt,**

**Kāma-krōdha-udbhavaṁ vēgaṁ sa yuktaḥ sa sukhī naraḥ.**

One who is able to withstand the impulse of lust and anger before death is a yogi, and a happy person.Man can be happy only when he is able to control or drop the speed arising out of Kāma (desire), Krodha, and Bhaya etc. which are the moments of Duḥkha.

**दुःखेष्वनुद्विग्नमनाः सुखेषु विगतस्पृहः।**

**वीतरागभयक्रोधः स्थितधीर्मुनिरुच्यते॥**

**Duḥkhēṣu-anudvigna-manāḥ sukhēṣu vigata- spr̥haḥ,**

**vīta-rāga-bhaya-krōdhaḥ sthitadhīḥ- muniḥ-ucyatē.** (Bhagavad-Ġīta, 2-56)

A person whose mind is unperturbed by sorrow, who does not crave for pleasures, and who is completely free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called Sthitaprajña --- a sage of steady intellect.

In Bhagavad-Ġīta, while dealing with the characteristics of a balanced person or Yogi it is said that – such a person will not get disturbed, his mind does not get agitated or his mind is rid of Vega during the moments of Duḥkha. That is, he has conquered the speed of Rāga, Bhaya, and Krodha in all such situations.

When examined, one can see that any disturbance, any misery, and any pain amounts to violence inside- it can be an excited mind, an agitated mind with unruly forces operating inside. If you apply the cleverness of a scientist, all these can be brought under one term –**speed or vega** or fastness. That’s the advantage the scientist has over the others. He can bring all these things into a few minimal terms. Hundreds of nearly different things can be brought into one term, so that handling is easy. So,**duḥkha is speed**. What a permitted conclusion!

**Hence, the solution** is, wherever there is fastness, replace it by slowness. It is our experience that an agitated person instead of walking will almost be running. A speed at one point is a speed revealed everywhere. If he is fast inside and is chewing, it can be fast chewing. If he is swallowing, it is fast swallowing. My relative who was a specialist in cancer layer study in Cincinnati, USA, had the habit of chewing the gum. When he focussed and when he was fast, this speed of chewing also increased. He had observed this and shared with me. He was not a student of Vedānta, but look at the observation.

<u>Speed felt at one centre is revealed at all centres. Speed corrected at one centre, purifies all other centres</u>. Now that you have the answer-walk slowly- talk slowly-think slowly. Try to get angry slowly. Then it is no anger at all! Softness brought at one centre induces softness at other centres like the thinking centre, the walk centre, the talk centre and the respiratory centre. Try to apply slowness and see the difference. Comfort sets in immediately. I have tried this experiment and got results. You can best appreciate this truth when you start applying them. You can see the difference and appreciate the śāstra then. If you want to walk, do it slowly. Walking slowly starts purifying all these centres. Then one is very much relaxed.

There is another component of duḥkha, which we have to study. In fact it is a subtler aspect. Once you become an intellectual, you begin to think seriously. And what's that thinking - to know, to understand, to grasp. That’s again another burden. Why do you call it a burden? Is it not the power in you? Intellect is the best tool in the hands of man. All this technology is because of his intellect. Employing that intellect, the medical science has advanced. Anaesthesia itself has become so sophisticated that it is very convenient to surgery. A roof can be bent in any direction because of the combination of concrete and reinforcements. All this technology is the result of focussing_. _But the point is that it is burdensome and that is the reason why focussing is turned down by śāstra. One is naturally disturbed with this position of śāstra and this can be anybody’s objection to the śāstra. Focussing is the most powerful tool in the hands of man due to which the advancement of technology is possible. But the point is that this attention or focussing is burdensome. Fortunately, we are making and breaking this focussing. Nobody is continuously concentrating for more than half an hour, even the most studious. Even the big researcher reaches the break down point very early. The fatigue point is reached and he shakes off. That’s a natural safety mechanism built in man. Otherwise, man would have broken himself down, would have turned mad, and would have hit himself against a wall! You shift from the serious mood to a lighter mood. But once you start encouraging this quality of overdoing this focussing, the balance is tilted. Generally, we err in the wrong direction and we begin to suffer.

Imagine the fatigue experience of such a person. We must know the goodness or badness of a thing in its exaggerated version. Otherwise it becomes difficult to appreciate! You must push the pendulum to the extreme point and then see the momentum it carries. But, once you exploit this intellect and start doing much of it, you begin to suffer. Excitement, fear, desire for objects of enjoyment, desire for fame; can be managed to certain extent. But the endless pursuit for creativity is difficult to manage. If you watch the professors in any research institute, either they are in the laboratory doing research or they are stuck in their home also preoccupied with the same thought of research. They cannot come out of this focussing. Hence, subtler version of suffering is **focussing.** Basically we are ‘all-pervasive’ beings or** sarvayvāpī- सर्वव्यापी.**



* When you are not in suffering state you are expansive, unloaded, diffused, very light, and non-dense and hence you are in a state of Vistārata- all-pervasiveness.
* But when you are in a moment of Duḥkha, you are sacrificing your everywhereness and coming to a pinpoint.
* In the language of a Quantum Physicist – you are in a **CONING**phase- tending towards pointedness.
* If one observes a cone, the tip of the cone is pointed and the base is wide.
* Focussing is coning into a point. Reducing to a point or to an aperture.
* Since you are a burdened stuff, your mind acquires the highest density because it has limited volume- That is why you feel the load on you.
* We have sacrificed our true nature of expansive state and are badly caught up in searching, trying to solve, trying to know etc. We have shrunk ourselves into a narrow stuff.

Unaware of this obvious truth, I made a mess of my life for 20 years, always focussing, to a point that I lost my sleep, I lost my appetite, and no medication would help me. I went to a very famous doctor only to be told that no medicine would help me and I had to gain balance of mind through control of aspirations. I was always researching on something or the other. I was having a firm faith and conviction that I was doing a very big thing or a noble act.

I am showing a very big aspect of human being, especially that of an intellectual. I was proud of my research skills. I thought I was a big fellow because I could easily focus on various things. All the while I was under the impression that I was doing the best thing - solving problems – such as, how to give a simpler house for the villager with which I was not concerned at all as I was a chemistry professor. My research was to device a method to simplify a house construction and make it cost effective. How to avoid a beam for the door and have only the shutter, how to avoid plastering for the wall so that it could save 20% of the total cost, how to build a house without foundation? It was not my field at all. Even then, I had designed all carpentry work. You may say that it is a wonderful research for society's benefit and for one’s own delight, but it was exhausting for me.

I owe everything to Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa because I was able to open the knot of suffering. I deeply understood the vedāntic solution when no teacher could tell me what my problem was and where I erred. Most of the teachers went by vedāntic definitions Satyam Jñānam Anantam Brahma, Anoranīyān Mahatomahīāyn, etc. Once again, if you become a serious student and start studying these declarations you will end up confused. What does one understand by saying ‘you are smaller than the smallest, bigger than the biggest’ (Anoranīyān, Mahatomahīyān)? To a scientist that is a very big inconsistency. How can anything simultaneously be smaller than the smallest and bigger than the biggest?

One of my friends was a director of a computer science research centre. He was in his fifties, heading twenty top scientists and was the chief of the unit. While we were discussing one day, he said that he had become prematurely ten years older due to pressure of work and focussing. An American, who was a big researcher, head of a team of researchers, confessed to the fact that he was 10 years older than his actual age. Then why not give it up? See the difficulty. How can he give up, as the investor of money into that research unit is demanding results? The investor or money giver claims results. Otherwise there is a fear of the funds being stopped. So, that leads to more and more focussing. What next? How to complete this research in one or two weeks? Though it can be a remarkable achievement from one point of view it is alarming from the other point of view.

We cannot say that focussing - **ēkāgratā- एकाग्रता,**is a wrong thing, but ekāgratā was my cause for suffering when I overdid it although it gave me good credit for an extraordinary performance.

I want you to appreciate this point. The world of technology and the civilization has missed this big point. While we may glorify it from one point of view, we should condemn it from the other point of view. The urge to over perform through attention or concentration is a killer of peace! You are paying a big price for your technological achievements. Why should not people here in America realize this one? Look at the wisdom from the East? At what cost are you getting these achievements-new discoveries, especially in the medical field and in the engineering field. If there is adequate rest for the **buddhikośa- बुद्धिकोश –**the intellect**- **it is okay. This is the missing element in the 21<sup>st</sup> century civilization. And what is the technique that can complement that missing element? It is the Indian wisdom- the Vedāntic wisdom. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (3-9-39) asserts-

**अनास्थैव हि निर्वाणम् दुःखमास्था परिग्रहः।**

**Anāsthā-ēva hi nirvāṇam duḥkham-āsthā parigrahaḥ.**

While attachment (focussing) is sufferring, detachment (diffusion) alone leads to liberation.

Focussing, pinpointedness, concentration, coning, etc. all result in untold suffering or Duḥkha. Whereas, Vistārata or diffusion or expansive state of mind gives you Sukha or happiness or deliverance from Duḥkha. Therefore drop burdensome/tiresome focussing and concentration and adopt a**Let go** **attitude** as far as possible. This is called **Udāsīnabhāva- उदासीनभाव.**

This focussing is the main aspect of Duḥkha for an intellectual. The duḥkha of a non intellectual or worldly person is to hanker for small things such as satisfaction of the tongue, attainment of status and recognition etc. Even the role of the social worker is to think about the ways of serving the society. What about the householder then? He worries about the children, about the wife, about the bank deposit? How does it help him to come out of duḥkha? As said in Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (6-9-418)-

**द्वित्वैकत्वदृशौ चित्तं तदेवाज्ञानमुच्यते।**

**एतयोर्यो लयो दृष्टयोस्तज्ज्ञानं सा परा गतिः॥**

**Dvitva-ēkatva-dr̥śau cittaṁ tat-ēva-ajñānam- ucyatē,**

**ētayōryō layō dr̥ṣṭayō-tat-jñānaṁ sā parā gatiḥ.**

That itself is ignorance if eirher the mind cognises several objects at a time or concentrates on one object only. If both these modes of the mind dissolve then that is the highest and exalted state.

If cāncalya is a bandhana then ēkāgratā also is a bandhana. When these are put an end to, then that is liberation.

Anyway, **speed and focussing** are the two aspects of duḥkha. It is a very big piece of research whatever we have discussed in these ten minutes. Duḥkha is completely understood through these two words- speed - **vega- वेग**and focussing (Lakshya). Thus, duḥkha is either an agitated state of mind or a focussed state of mind. <u>If agitation is replaced by **naidhānya- नैधान्य**, gradually and consciously it will result in less and less of duḥkha. Whenever focussing becomes burdensome, replace the same by de-focussing or diffusion (‘let go’ attitude - udāsīnabhāva).</u> And again the result will be elimination of duḥkha. More you diffuse, more will be the expansion of your shell. Ramaṇa and R<u>ā</u>makṛṣṇa would often say 'I don’t know where I exist. I am not centred.' The point here is that they did not even know where they were. To that extent the diffusion had taken place. We identify ourselves with some place or work as a reference point when we ask ourselves as to where we are. Whereas, a Jñāni would say that he cannot see himself and confirms that he has lost his focus. That’s the experiential announcement of a jñāni.

As doctors put it, half the remedy is achieved by proper diagnosis. So if you are convinced that the points raised above are the symptoms of Duḥkha, then replace**Vēga by slowness** **and focussing by expansion**. This is the solution to the problem of duḥkha. That was our research to come out of duḥkha. Sankochatā or constriction or narrowing down is replaced by Vistāratā-**विस्तारता** -everywhereness, spreadness.

That’s where a scientist is at an advantage over the pundit as far as Vedānta is concerned. We are at a distinct advantage than our forefathers who did not know this vocabulary. They did not know this scientific phraseology because they didn’t know aspects like density, potential etc. Duḥkha is localization. Non localized- spread version is the solution for the state of burden. So once you know this, you have the answer.

**<u>Role of One’s Freedom Element</u>.**

The student appreciates the whole point and expresses that he is fully convinced about the solution for duḥkha. But, he urges that not to be fast and not to focus is not under his control. The main objection is that situations drive a person mad. There are a number of problems to be attended to simultaneously within limited period of time and this cannot be avoided. Logically, this is a valid point to consider. In the language of psychology, one is determined by the stimulus-response theory. There is the stimulus, there is the situation and one has to respond helplessly. Many examples can be considered. Take the case of a household lady. She is suffering because her husband is very indifferent to domestic work. How do you expect her to be comfortable and relaxed? It is an attack on the whole study we made here.

Psychological transactions are not just governed by the law of stimulus and response. A new factor comes into the study and it is the**freedom** element. You have a choice, you have a freedom, and you have an option. It is not deterministic. Till now, you never thought so. In fact this is the ignorance on the part of man. Everyone thinks that the situations are so demanding that they drive one to suffering. Although one knows the answer, still it cannot be applied. This is a very important objection.

It is here that I did a bit of deeper research. It is here that text books in psychology can take a fresh lesson from Vedānta. One is the theoretical aspect and the other is the application part of it. Śāstra says man is not a creature of circumstances. He can react or he can refuse to react. The situations cannot thrust themselves on him. The option is with him, the freedom is within him, the choice is with him.

Śankara’s brilliant research gives us the truth. What is mind? Mind is a very peculiar thing and it has this capacity:

**कर्तुं अकर्तुं अन्यथा वा कर्तुं शक्यम् ।**

**Kartuṁ akartuṁ anyathā vā kartuṁ śakyam.**

(Śankara, Brahmasutrabhāṣya)

A person has an inherent freedom to do, not to do or to do it differently.

What a wonderful truth! The mind can do this way, it can do the other way, it can do neither this way nor that way, it can stay quiet .For example, one can be harsh to one’s parents or one can be soft, thinking that they deserve his respects since they are elders. Alternatively, one can be neither harsh nor soft and can be neutral.

Here is the difference between the **jaḍa** and the **cetana,**the inanimate and the animate. In the case of a **jaḍavastu** like football- it cannot manipulate itself. When left in a place for fifty thousand years, it stays there. It cannot vary by itself. If one pushes, then it moves. It is a helpless mass, it has no choice. It is governed totally by the stimulus and response.

**Cetana**on the other hand, has the freedom of action, a facility not available with jaḍavastu. Let us say – a fellow has hurt me. I have a reason to get into depression or hit back with anger. Or, I can as well say ‘let him have his own opinion, why should I bother?’ **The evil forces dissolve by applying the second suggestion.**This is the available freedom** **in us.

To say that the external situations determine one’s mental state is a wrong thing. With the recognition of the freedom element in him, a person can have a strong volition, will or autonomy. Everyone’s home becomes beautiful if he can grow as wise as this. Any difference of opinion can be accepted. An opinion suggested by the other person may be foolish. But one need not be disturbed by that because of the freedom element human beings have. Look at the contribution of Vedānta to individual suffering and therefore to global suffering!

I can put this one argument into the textual language. <u>This freedom of choice can be applied even with regard to my three natural phases of existence namely, jnāt</u>ṛ<u>tva or perceiving, bhokt</u>ṛ<u>tva or selecting and ka</u>r<u>tṛtva or doing. I could use these qualities or I could be without them.</u> Śāstra is not forcefully thrusting something on you. This is the result of an investigation which we have done. Hence, I am pure consciousness, chinmātra svarūpa- not disturbed, not affected by situations. The individual should recognise and apply this freedom element inbuilt in him to come out of suffering.


#### SUKHA PARĪKṣA (HAPPINESS ANALYSED)

Now let us examine the concept of Sukha as understood by our** **R̥ṣi-s. One may say that Duḥkharāhitya or absence of Duḥkha is not Sukha. It is the general notion that Sukha is positive and comes from:



* Objects of enjoyment – Bhogasukha- Enjoyment derived through the five senses – sense of vision, hearing, smell, taste and touch.
* Social Service – serving the poor, disabled, economically challenged etc. It may be any activity – either trivial or profound.
* Job satisfaction.
* Satisfaction in one’s profession.
* Achieving name and fame in society.

All the above give you positive feeling. So, what is there to examine? Why at all we should bother about investigating Sukha? The experience of almost all of us, especially the persons who are internally sensitive, is that there is saturation in every kind of worldly Sukha/happiness. Everything becomes stale at some point of time or the other. Hence, the search for everlasting happiness or pure ānanda or śāśvatasukha becomes necessary. Unfortunately we are all searching for this in the outside world. Here comes Vedānta to our rescue and asks us to investigate any moment of happiness, <u>content wise and not agency wise.</u>

The observation or watching is to be done at the thinking centre i.e., Citta or mind Centre, as we had done with Duḥkha Moments**.** We have to observe the mind as to what happens at the moments of sukha and observation has to happen at the ājñāchakra or the space between the eyebrows.

Sip a cup of coffee or tea or listen to music of your choice or taste a sweet dish and see what happens at the thinking centre. **Shift your attention from the agency, that is, coffee or music or sweet dish**to the **thinking Centre** and just **Watch.** For the first time in your life you will experience a wonder. Bulk of the mind does not exist during that moment, the mind cannot think of any problems, the mind refuses to think, the mind doesn’t want to think, the mind is incapacitated to think at that moment of joy. World doesn’t exist for you. Your problems are thrown out and you are carefree- you are free of any responsibility. The burning problems that you had all along cannot touch you now in the enjoyment of coffee, or sweets or whatever.

You have touched your pūrvasthiti/amanī- bhāva/manorāhitya/cittaviśrānti. You are in your**ātmāsvarūpa- आत्मस्वरूप**. You are set in your brahmasvarūpa. You are in your no-mind state. You are in your thought free state which is your **nijasvarūpa- निजस्वरूप**. Here, you may disagree to accept that Bhogasukha is**Brahmasukha- ब्रह्मसुख**. But śāstra and Śankara mention it in a different way. Now you listen to bhāṣhya from Śankara.

**Laukikōpi ānandō brahmānandasya ēva mātrā.**

**लौकिकोपि आनन्दो ब्रह्मानन्दस्यैव मात्रा॥**

(Taittirīya Upa, Śankarabhāṣya, 2-8-197)

Don’t you see that this bhogasukha is only a fraction of that brahmasukha? What a daring statement! Is it not obvious? This means that every moment of sukha is an empty state of mind which is--Your kāraṇasthiti-Your advaita sthiti- a non dual state- a no-mind state. There is nothing like noble sukha and ignoble sukha. The agency may be noble, or ignoble. But sukha per se is Brahma. And Śankara actually adds a line from Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upa -4-3-32

**एतस्यैवानन्दस्यान्यानि भूतानि मात्राम् उपजीवन्ति ॥**

**Ētasya-ēva-ānandasya-anyāni bhūtāni mātrām upa-jīvanti.**

Tom, Dick and Harry or anyone in this world, can experience this ānanda which is the pure expansive state and a state of utter nothingness. One is touching that no mind state and is getting the feel of joy. Every experience of happiness is a state where mind for a moment has become empty-rid of its problems, rid of its anxieties, cares and worries. Can sukha be this simple? I fought with the truths of Upaniṣads for two years. That was my struggle. That was my research. Can it be this simple? But every time I tried an experiment using some bhogavastu, sukhānubhava is very much felt by me. I am confident in saying that every one of you will get this experience also. Śāstra puts this as amanībhāva. Gowḍapāda in his kārika (Māṇ.Up.3, Ka.32) of Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad has this beautiful thing to say:

**आत्मसत्यानुबोधेन न सङ्कल्पयते यदा।**

**अमनस्तां तदा याति ग्राह्याभावे तदग्रहम्॥**

**Ātma-satya-anubōdhēna na saṅkalpayatē yadā,**

**amanastāṁ tadā yāti grāhya-abhāvē tat-agraham.**

While modifications of mind stop having realised Self, no mind state is attained due to the absence of graspable phenomenal world.

What is the meaning of realizing yourself?--you have to touch that no-thought state.-you get into that no-mind state. A no-mind state is verily brahma. The śloka from Kaṭha Upaniṣad (2-6-10) is proclaiming this very same truth.

**यदा पञ्चावतिष्ठन्ते ज्ञानानि मनसा सह ।**

**बुद्धिश्च न विचेश्टते तामाहुः परमां गतिम्॥**

**Yadā pañca-avatiṣṭhantē jñānāni manasā saha,**

**buddhiḥ-ca na vicēśṭatē tāmāhuḥ paramāṁ gatim.**

When the five sense organs are not functioning, when the mind is not functioning, when even the buddhi is not functioning, that is your holy state. That is your exalted state. That is your true nature. That is your blissful state. The terminal śloka of that Nārada Sanatkumāra ākhyāyika (Chāndogya Upa 7-24) says-

**यत्र नान्यत्पश्यति नान्यच्छृणोति नान्यद्विजानाति स भूमा॥**

**Yatra na-anyat-paśyati na-anyat-śr̥ṇōti na- anyat-vijānāti sa bhūmā.**

When you do not perceive anything, when you are not hearing anything, when you are not in the knowledge of anything that is your expansive state. The meaning of the word Bhūma is that of vyāpakatva- a state of expansion.

**यो वै भूमा तत्सुखं नाल्पे सुखमस्ति भूमा वै सुखम्॥**

**Yo vai bhūmā tat-sukhaṃ na-alpe sukham-asti bhūmā vai sukham.** (Chāndogya Upa 7-23)

Bhūma state is really the blessed state, the blissful state as against the confined state which is not blissful and profound. Man considers that watching details is the right action. Actually it is ‘alpatva swīkāra’- that is, a constricted state of mind. All the research work that we are into is the work of scrutiny which is a toiling phase. Indriya vyāpāra means capturing details. Bhūma vai sukham- **that let-go state is sukha**. Vedānta is not brainwashing you.

**नापूर्वं वक्षति श्रुतिः**। **Na-pūrvaṁ vakṣati śrutiḥ.**

Śruti** **doesn’t tell you anything that is not within the zone of your experience.

**ज्ञापकमात्रम् हि शास्त्रम्**- **Jñāpaka-mātram hi śāstram -**- Śāstra is but a reminder of whatever you know. Every experience of sukha, is verily a mind in broken state—a decomposed mind---a non functioning mind. In fact, the thought formation forces cannot connect themselves into a thought. What a realization! You see that every joy is an empty state of mind-an expansive state of mind- an **advaitasthiti- अद्वैतस्थिति.**

Even sukha, on examination, reduces itself to a no-mind state. If the frequency moments of sukha are increased very much, you are just nonexistent and the shell is terribly expanded for a moment. This is the same as the state of vistārata described as a remedy to Duḥkha. There is a gradation in Duḥkha state -continuous duḥkha – ati-duḥkha - somewhat duḥkha - very slight duḥkha - the curve reaches a no mind state - you cannot even think further. A further inference of this one, a bigger version of this process, makes one to conclude that, sukha and duḥkha, being separate entities, are interconnected. They are very much like conductivity and resistance. Reciprocal of resistance is conductivity. Reciprocal of conductivity is resistance. Less and less of duḥkha is more and more of sukha.** **Thus there are only two aspects of Duḥkha-

One is the Speed, at thinking centre or cittasthāna (mind centre – Ājñācakra – space between the eye brows). The other is the focussing-which is constant minding, resulting in one pointedness and this is termed as sankocata. This is also termed as a coning phase. In order to overcome these two aspects of duḥkha:



1. Replace speed or Vega by slowness or Naidhānya at the mental level.
2. Replace Sankocata or focussing by diffusion. This is the let go attitude or udāsīna bhāva

Sukha is:

Mind or cittasthāna becomes empty in the moments of happiness derived through agencies. A no mind state is created for a fraction of a moment. Consciously hold on to the no mind state so generated and try to stay there as long as possible, abandoning the agency that gave you the state. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (5-9-43) declares -

**दृश्यदर्शनसम्बन्धे सुखसंविदनुत्तम।**

**दृश्य संवलिता बन्धस्तन्मुक्ता मुक्तिरुच्यते॥**

**Dr̥śya-darśana-sambandhē sukha-saṁvit- anuttama,**

**dr̥śya saṁvalitā bandhaḥ-tan-muktā muktiḥ- ucyatē.**

Born is the happiness when the seer and the seen are in contact. But, it is still bondage when the seer is attached to the seen and it is freedom when detached from it.

I will take up questions from you to sort out any doubts on whatever we discussed till now.

**Q**Does not a material sukha, what you explained now, leads to hankering for more bhoga?

**A.** Yes, but we get a glimpse of that śāṣvata sukha in this bhogasukha. Therefore one has to see this welcome element and stay firm in it and then reject the hankering for bhoga.

**Q**Does** **the peace of mind, as described above relate to viṣayasukha?

**A.** This is another good objection on sukha. But it is that peace of mind that is referred to as sukha in the tradition also. Again the two questions overlap. Actually in our viṣayasukha moment, the penultimate positions are in excitement whereas the real point is in peace. We are tempted to say that this excitement is a sukha element. The penultimate centres are in excited state and therefore one is tempted to conclude sukha carries the element of excitement which is the previous position or the taditarasthāna. The after position or the samīpasthāna is the peaceful expansive state. When we discuss the mechanism of sukha in the next lecture, we will discuss the things involved in the mechanism of bhogasukha and then clarity would come to all of you.

**Q**If we slow down our activity, it will certainly be good, but in the eyes of the people that would look very odd and embarrassing?

**A.** All those things have to be managed of course. When you slow down your activity, it has an effect on the whole system. The system becomes so relaxed that it becomes impossible to do any work at one point of time. One simply wants to spend time in silence. Slowness becomes a point of comfort when these rules are applied. When one centre in the body slows down, every other centre takes the suggestion and slows down.

The other point is this attention business. It is here that a student finds difficulty. He likes to be focussing all the time as it improves the performance. But the truth is otherwise. One may perform better, but one has to pay the price for that effort, which ultimately works on the system itself. Truths cannot change themselves to one’s convenience. The fact is that if one holds on to concentration for a longer time, the system complains. This conclusion doesn’t go well with modern ideas of performance and production. That is what one has to manage. One can't fight against the truth. If the truth is questionable then it is fine. Otherwise the argument does not stand.

I remember one instance when I had to undergo a minor operation. I was waiting in the preparation room and the thing got delayed as the surgeon was very busy performing another major operation. He was a doctor of repute and he had the habit of going through every detail to make sure that things went on well and there should be no cause for failure. This put him under serious focussing. When he came out of the theatre I could see him puff and crash into the sofa and leave a very big sigh of relief. Why did he do that? The body system was saying that he needed rest very badly. That was a very good observation for me and that was a very good case where I could certify the truths of the Upaniṣad-s. Why does one shift from a serious mood to a lighter mood? Why does one get to an act of sipping a cup of coffee after a hard working day? Why does one say that he needs relaxation? The fact shows that serious mood is a state of **suffering**. Lighter mood is a state of contentment or **tṛpti_. _**That’s a proof.

**Q.** Don’t you think we have to do a balancing act because at certain point we have to continue our lives?

**A.** Fine. That is the compromise. Right, but we should appreciate the point that it is necessary to take a break.

**Q.** But that does not mean I stop concentrating. I may be taking a break but I am still in that mood? We cannot stop our attention mood as it is very important in life?

**A.** No. The śāstra is examining facts and their nature. That’s the point. How much of śāstra you will use for your life is another question. That’s a matter of necessity. That’s a matter of the situation or the profession in which you are placed. I am not advising everyone to give up focussing or speed. But one very important point you must remember here is, that when I am talking of speed**it is not the physical speed. It is the internal speed. The speed** **of the mind within** **is thousand times faster than the speed at the physical level.** One has to keep this always in mind when we talk of reducing speed.

**Q.** Is it possible to drop speed when you are focussing?

**A.** Yes, I will add a little more. I told you about that doctor's plight, because that’s a more serious question. Most of the times we tend to seek adjustments, compromise, taking approximate positions. So, whenever focussing is a must, you tag on slowness to it. If you are slow, focussing is acceptable for the system. Slowness can decrease the evil effects of focussing. Any amount of focussing is sustainable when the other element is taken care of, namely slowness. Once you go with the study yourselves, many more truths come out. That’s why everybody would be a teacher on his own once he starts looking inside. That leisureliness will enlarge the shell. Every time you are in the leisurely mood, or the let-go mood, you are an enlarged shell. You are a big sphere. In that sphere if you focus, you are doing that peripherally. We use the word for that, peripheral focussing, and casual focussing. It is a fact. The śāstra uses a very big word to refer to this: udāsīnabhāva, **उदासीनभाव**, anāsaktibhāva, **अनासक्तिभाव**, sākṣībhāva-**सक्षीभाव.**

**Q.** Can focussing be possible when you are in diffused state?

**A.** It is possible. They can co exist. The two can stay concurrently. People say that Vedānta takes one away from one’s profession. It proves again and again that worldly and mundane pursuits do not become hurdles for sukha. Therefore you don’t have to become an ascetic or other worldly. It is a paradox. Defocused focussing means bulk of you, mentally, is positioned in a happy way. A part of you is involved in that mundane process. That is how every jñāni manages. Lord Kṛṣṇa would be most efficient-but very casual, but at the same time very careful in details. So a jñāni need not walk away from life. If he chooses to walk away like Ramaṇa, it is okay, like Rāmakṛṣṇa, it is okay. Performance-wise one can excel the other man who does not know these secrets.

**Q.** If one gets into such a grove of slowing down, will it not affect the overall performance of the person?

**A.** This is exactly the reaction of every group that I meet with. Will the whole technology drop down if every man slows down? Everybody is unnecessarily rubbing too much on the wrong side. Why don’t you live with nature? Environment is safe when you don’t peck and interfere. Really speaking, this is the highest point. We understand that during the days of Kṛutayuga people were so much satisfied that they did not even bother to build a hut for them to live in. What is wrong if that fellow is as happy as the modern man with all this technology around him? We must be able to give this point to the advocates of technology. A fellow who is sitting under the tree is equally happy doing nothing. Then how is he inferior? Point out one defect about that. **Bhartṛhari** in his **Vairāgya Śataka-**वैराग्यशतक (53) -quotes-

**वयमिह परितुष्टा वल्कलैस्त्वं दुकूलैः।**

**सम इह परितोषो निर्विशेषो विशेषः**॥

**Vayam-iha parituṣṭā valkalaiḥ-tvaṁ dukūlaiḥ,**

**sama iha paritōṣō nirviśēṣō viśēṣaḥ.**

A sage comes across a king and develops a conversation. Oh King, you are with your silken garments and I am with my bark garments. If the happiness you have is because of the silk and the happiness I have is because of this crude cloth, how are you superior to me?

What logic! How are you superior to me if both of us are equally happy, you with all your comforts and I with no comforts?

**स तु भवतु दरिद्रो यस्य तृष्णा विशाल। ।**

**मनसि च परितुष्टे कोऽर्थवान् को दरिद्रः** ॥

**Sa tu bhavatu daridrō yasya tr̥ṣṇā viśāla,**

**manasi ca parituṣṭē kō-arthavān kō daridraḥ**.

When the mind is self satisfied how to differentiate a rich man from a poor one? This is the challenge the Indian wise men always had on positions of importance. It is not abhāva-vairāgya.

**Q.** I don’t think that the issue is with the internal happiness vis a vis technology. It should somehow be possible to bridge both. Take the case of Arjuna, who did not want to fight before he heard the message from Kṛṣṇa, afterwards he fought. On the one hand he is peaceful internally and at the same time he has a duty to perform. This is where the problem arises. What is your opinion about this?

**A.** You have to be careful while you apply this knowledge to the society in general. Therefore if the society is different, don’t disturb the society, allow it to have mixed levels. Society must have the benefit of development of technology. A hypothetical question would be as to what happens to civilisation if technology is completely dropped. When everyone is happy with minimum needs, what’s wrong with that one? I wish such a world comes into existence. That was the message of Kṛṣṇa. Of course much discussion has to take place. And another reason why Arjuna was coaxed into karma by Kṛṣṇa was that he was still not fit for taking up a life of a mendicant.

Theoretically one may understand this, but one may not be fit for total vairāgya. At the conceptual level we may appreciate. You can’t deny yourself the study, pursuits, achievements and all that. System transformation doesn’t take place simultaneously with your understanding of concepts. There is a time lag. There is a phase difference. We must wait. Only one person who could succeed totally and suddenly drop activities of the world was Ramaṇa Maharṣi. He realized this point. People made these objections on him and he just laughed at them. Some people choose the vedāntic way of living while others are willing to focus and carry on with work keeping their balance of mind for the benefit of humanity.

**Q.** Arjuna, after he listened to Sri Kṛṣṇa initially was willing to lay down his arms and keep quiet. But the Lord would not allow him. Why?

**A.** Arjuna appreciated the sānkhya ideas, just as we are now appreciating the logic of Vedānta to be true and correct. He appreciated the truths of Vedānta and then he said he would surrender and keep quiet. But Kṛṣṇa knew that Arjuna’s body-mind system was not prepared for that. Simply understanding the truths of the Upaniṣads is not sufficient. The forces within, bhoga-utsāha, karma-utsāha are still operating. I will come to that point when we do ātmāparīkṣa. Therefore his advice to Arjuna was to do karma and expend the unbearable energy.

We know that keeping quiet is the ultimate answer for happiness. But, structurally we are not prepared for that. That is where the idea of karmayoga comes. Karma sanyāsa is recommended as the ultimate position. The next step of compromise or adjustment is karmayoga because we cannot keep quiet. The whole of third and fourth chapters in Bhagavad-Ġīta (3-1) deal with the subject of karma yoga versus karma sanyāsa. Arjuna puts this very question—

**ज्यायसी चेत् कर्मणस्ते मता बुद्धिर्जनार्दन।**

**तत्किं कर्मणि घोरे मां नियोजयसि केशव॥**

**Jyāyasī cēt karmaṇḥ-tē matā buddhiḥ-janārdana,**

**tat-kiṁ karmaṇi ghōrē māṁ niyōjayasi kēśava.**

He asks Kṛṣṇa, ‘Why are you forcing me to the war which is very bad although you know well that knowledge is superior to action?’ He has appreciated this discussion and says that Kṛṣṇa has proved that keeping quiet is all joy. The answer is - Arjuna is not fit for keeping quiet yet.

**Q**: There comes the question of 'expectation'. How do you explain the removal of expectation of returns from action?

**A.** The other point where Vedānta makes a mark is to let that person examine whether he can be happy without doing. Most of us cannot remain so, though logically that position is correct. Even I cannot do that. Why? There is the boredom force acting within, which is driving one to activity. I will come to that in the next lecture when we do ātmaparīkṣa. The reason for anyone who says that he is doing work for so many good causes is that he cannot keep quiet. The proof for this is very simple. If I challenge you to sit quiet for ten minutes without doing anything, you may say that it is very easy. But if I ask you to remain quiet for half an hour, then you fail the test. Why?

Vedānta gives an answer to that point in the **yogaśāstra- योगशास्त्र**. There is what is called a life force, a vital force or **kundaliniśakti- कुण्डलिनीशक्ति**, if you care to use a technical word. It is there at the **mūlādhāra- मूलाधार** and is continuously releasing **sūkṣmaśakti- सूक्ष्मशक्ति** or**prāṇaśakti** into the system, to every part of the body. It flows up into the **ūrdhvasthāna- ऊर्ध्वस्थान**and comes to **ājñācakrasthāna- आज्ञाचक्रस्थान**, where pressure is built up.** **If the rates at which it is produced and expended are not equal, then you develop a pressure. And the pressure so developed drives you into activity. This is the most reasonable explanation.

The proof is very simple. Sit in the house without any work. That is the biggest test, to check whether you are growing in the vedāntic way or not. No wife to talk to. No kitchen where you can go and get some salted cashew nut or anything of that kind. No tape recorder to play music. Sit and try. Try this simple experiment. Everybody in the world fails. Why?

This is the explanation. Continuously energy is being released. Fortunately for man, as quickly as it is released he is expending it. The child cries away its energy. The fool talks away his energy. Man walks away his energy. A clever man thinks away his energy and therefore each one is comfortable. The subtlest burden is the pressure of boredom forces. He is spending this blocked up energy in ever so many ways that the system gets used to it and therefore he is comfortable where as he gives credit to karma, saying that Karma gave him joy. Spending of the energy is the only means by which one is becoming empty at the Ājñācakra. This mechanism is giving him joy and not karma as such.

This is the way we are all happy. Karma is a means of expenditure of this unbearable energy. Once that is spent away we are in the non-doing phase at the ājñācakra. We become empty, that is, we reach the no-mind state called amanībhāva. No activity-state is the point of joy, is the content of joy. This mechanism is giving him joy and not karma as such.

**Q.** Does it divert the energy?

**A.** Yes, incidentally this question is to be answered. If intake of coffee or any other bhogavastu leads to bhogasukha, then why don’t we have more and more of coffee or more and more of bhoga? The answer lies here. Although bhogasukha works by this mechanism, it has a defect as this drifting of the energy, shifting of the energy to the indriyasthāna is only temporary. Every indriya has a limit point. This skill to draw the energy has its limitation. The first sweet is enjoyable, the second sweet is acceptable and the third sweet is repulsive. Even at the cost of annoying the host you say, ‘sorry I cannot take it’, Why? The tongue fails to draw the energy. At that point, the energy goes back into its original place, into its swasthāna and again you are restless. That is the reason why we call the bhogasukha as short lived. When the energy expenditure mechanism to overcome the boredom is overdone, it results in restlessness again. Preceded by a disturbed state, succeeded by a disturbed state and for a small interval of time in-between, the mind quietens. Hence, bhogasukha is short lived.

<u>If you can reduce the creation of energy itself or its release by s</u>ā<u>dhana then the dependence on Bhoga gets dropped and you are in lasting happiness.</u> Then, you can naturally expand your shell. In a small sphere, the amount of thrust or the impulse on the unit area is more. Suppose the sphere is very big, the same thrust or impulse on a much bigger sphere is much smaller. Distributed over a larger area, you don’t feel the burden at all. So, if you apply the rule of naidhānya or apply the principle of vistārata, then the boredom forces are automatically absorbed or dissolved away and you don’t complain. This is a permanent method to be happy. So, a vedāntin is not running away from bhoga for ascetic reasons.

**Q** I appreciate your point very much that parīkṣa of Duḥkha is necessary to come out of it, but why one should do parīkṣa of sukha as it is a glorified state already?

**A.** This parīkṣa is required because we are always experiencing this ānanda. Humans are in continuous touch with the svarūpa, but does not take notice of that one. This is the unfortunate situation of man. He doesn’t know that svarūpasthiti is ānanda. To remove this ignorance, serious study is required. That’s all. The role of bhoga in the experiment is only incidental. Laddoo or the sweet dish or coffee did not carry the principle of ānanda. It is incidental that Laddoo brought about an expansive state inside, an empty state inside. The point of importance is this one. After understanding this point, our attention should get shifted. Our value system should be revised. Bhogavastu has a marginal role. This has necessitated the sādhana actually. Should you struggle for ānanda? The clever sādhaka on the other hand uses the bhoghavastu as a means to get the glimpse of brahmasukha, drops bhogavastu and holds on to the sukha only.

**Q**Is puruşārtha not necessary-then?

**A**. That’s the trouble with all the people. People have mystified the whole thing. I can give you hundreds of stanzas to show that this is the ultimate. It is very clear in Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa—

**यन्मनो विलयं याति तद्विष्णोः परमं पदम्**।

**Yanmanō vilayaṁ yāti tat-viṣṇōḥ paramaṁ padam.**

What is viṣṇupada - vaikuṇṭa? Yatra manaḥ vilayaṁ yāti -where mind gets extinguished that is svarūpa. That is puruśārtha. That is mokṣa. This stanza, Yatra manaḥ vilayaṁ yāti tadviṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ.—does not refer to the vaikuṇṭa with seven doors, Jaya and Vijaya keeping guard of that one etc. Yatra manaḥ -where mind is absent, that is vaikuṇṭa.

**Q** When thought is formed in the mind, there is no differentiation whether it is thought for happiness or otherwise. Then where is the thoughtless mind?

**A**. What happens in the bhogasukha is that there is an excitement co existing with peace. Therefore we are tempted to say that happiness is that excitement. Really speaking, there are two overlapping parameters. If you disassociate them, the real point of contribution, which is the ‘peace element’, comes to the fore. I will dwell on the topic of how Bhogasukha brings about peace in my next lecture.

**Q** Śankara says that bhogasukha gives a glimpse of brahmānanda. Don’t you think bhoga is excitement and where is ānanda there?

**A.** Content wise they are identical. The doṣa about bhogasukha is, that it is short lived. With the withdrawal of bhoga, again you come back to the objective world of seeking. That’s the doṣa. This point I will take up in detail in the next lecture-the mechanism involved in bhogasukha, what is the erroneous element and how to make a correction of that.

Thank you for listening.



### AVASTHĀ-TRAYA-PARĪKṣĀ 
(EXAMINATION OF THREE STATES OF EXISTANCE)

We shall do a revision on whatever we discussed in these lectures so that they remain fresh in your minds. Recapitulation is fine as it strengthens the thought pattern and sets deep rooted in your minds.We have found that Vedānta can give a solvable approach to the problems of various facets of our life. We found that there are two sides. One is the ritualistic side. Distinguished from this, you have the Parīkṣa side or the investigation side. Two routes of investigation were suggested - one is Sukha-Duḥkha-parīkṣa and the other is ātmāparīkṣa. In the first one, you do the investigation on the involved question or the involved issue which we covered exhaustively. Equally productive is the other method- ātmaparīkṣa - suggestion to examine the self, to understand one’s true nature. In fact śāstra recommends this parīkṣa more often. Most of the scholars or most of the traditional Vedāntic literature emphasises on ātmaparīkṣa. In my previous lecture I had mentioned about the discussion found in Bṛhahadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad between Yajñavalkya and his two wives Kātyāyani and Maitrēyi. When** **Maitrēyi asks the husband to show her the way for everlasting happiness, he says that the only way is to find out one’s true nature.

**आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यो मन्तव्यो निदिध्यासितव्यो मैत्रेयि ।**

**Ātmā vā arē draṣṭavyō mantavyō**

**nididhyāsitavyō Maitrēyi.** (Bṛh. Upa, 2-4-5)

Oh Maitrēyi, SELF is to be heard of, contemplated upon and get established into.

You must rightly understand your true nature and then try to stay there. That’s the way to come out of sorrow. Every Upaniṣad has a method of investigation called **Prakriyā - प्रक्रिया**. Prakriya is a logical framework, a logical structuring, by which you can understand your real nature. A style of thinking which ultimately puts you into your true nature is called a prakriya. Every Upaniṣad has at least one prakriya. Prakriya is the juice of the Upaniṣad. That’s the key point. Some of the Upaniṣad-s carry more than one prakriya. Let us take up two such Prakraiya-s for our discussion. Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad offers the prakriya called **Avasthātraya Parīkṣā - अवस्थात्रयपरीक्षा**. Taittirīya Upaniṣad offers the prakriya called the **Pancakośa Viveka- पञ्चकोशविवेक**. We will discuss them one after the other.

Tradition holds the Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad in very high esteem for the reason that in four mantras the entire discussion on the subject gets to a conclusion. You are yet to see brevity of that order in scientific regions. In fact, the Upaniṣad is held so high in parampara that a student who is serious about enlightenment is directed to go to Māṇḍūkya.

**एकं माण्डूक्यमेव अलं मुमुक्षूणां विमुक्तये।**

**Ēkaṁ māṇḍūkyam-ēva alaṁ mumukṣūṇāṁ vimuktayē**.** **Muktikopaniṣad

If a person is very serious about liberation, all that he has to do is to study Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad to clear all his doubts. That is the importance with which tradition places Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad. The Upaniṣad straight away goes into depths of human existence. After extolling Omkāra, the Upaniṣad goes to affirm that everything in this universe is Brahma.

**सर्वं ह्येतद्ब्रह्म अयमात्मा ब्रह्म सोऽयमात्मा चतुष्पात्**।

**Sarvaṁ hi-ētat-brahma ayam-ātmā brahma sa-ayam-ātmā catuṣpāt.**  (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad  2)

**sarvaṁ hi ētat brahma -**All this is Brahma. Let us understand this technically. There is a Causal stuff which is single and unique and that has become this Jagat - this Universe.

**ayam ātmā brahma -**I am also Brahma-This ‘Me’ is also Brahma.

A thought which came to my mind that ‘sarvam hi ētat Brahma’ includes ‘ayam ātmā Brahma’. This repetition seems to be redundant. I was wondering as to why the Śruti is repeating the phrases.

Śankara observes this and gives an explanation and an answer for this ambiguity. This is the point where science and Vedānta differ. We are all academicians and think in a very simple way. Scientists think that the origin of this universe can be got by understanding this existence externally. Whereas, Indian thinking or Vedāntic approach suggests that the Causal Stuff of this universe can be realised only by studying the inside of ourselves. There is no way of getting to the causal stuff by a study of the outside world and this is the set premise in Vedānta.

Śankara however makes a point here. Why did the Indian thinkers go inwards to find the origin of this universe? Why did they not go outwards as the physicist is tempted to go? If we can get a satisfactory answer to this one, we have made big strides. These activities or these entities of the external world are inflexible. These bull forces which are mutually acting, for example, shining of the Sun, blowing of the wind, cloud formation due to evaporation etc are all rigid having no flexibility. All these activities are mechanical in nature and thus they are inflexible forces.

But the forces within us on the contrary have malleability and flexibility. One can manipulate the inside forces. One can manipulate to be fast or slow or remain stationery. By a mere suggestion that one should be quiet, one becomes quiet. Where from these activities arise? One can do an experiment inside and soften them to their source. This is Śankara's position.

**प्रत्यगात्मतया एव ब्रह्म ग्राह्यम् नान्यथा ।**

**Pratyagātmatayā ēva brahma grāhyam na anyathā.**Śankarabhāṣya.

This causal stuff of the universe cannot be grasped by the study of the outside. I am sure the physicist will come to the point of deadlock one day and turn to eastern ways. They have already started recognising the importance of observer in experimental physics. Because of the role of the observer, observations become defective. He disturbs the phenomena and there is no way by which one can avoid this observer. The scientists have come to that position of impasse. Śāstra recognizes this point. One can retrace these steps as far as the inside forces are concerned. That is what I am doing, called **nāḍiśuddhi prāṇāyāma - नाडिशुद्धि प्राणायाम**. Slow down the inner forces until you touch the origin. Such a manipulation is possible inside- not possible outside. Therefore the manipulation of the activities inside is a convenient method for understanding the source of the universe. Some of the physicists appreciated this point in those international conferences where in I had to enforce this point because it makes a reference at the basic level itself. We will now continue with the ātmaparīkṣa**.**

**Sa-ayam-ātmā catuṣpāt** - That ‘I’ (that Me- ātmā-Brahma-Self) has four components. Let us see the first component.

**जागरितस्थानः बहिष्प्रज्ञः सप्ताङ्ग एकोनविंशतिमुखः स्थूलभुग्वैश्वानरः प्रथमः पादः।**

**Jāgarita-sthānaḥ bahiḥ-prajñaḥ sapta-aṅga ēkōnaviṁśati mukhaḥ sthūla-bhuk-vaiśvānaraḥ prathamaḥ pādaḥ.     (**Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 3)** **

He is identified as **Vaiśvānara.** His sphere of activity is the Waking State**.** He is conscious of the external world of objects. He has seven limbs and nineteen outlets. He enjoys the gross objects of the world. The nineteen outlets of the waking state are – the five organs of perception, the five organs of action, the five aspects of our vital breath – Prāṇa (Prāṇa, Apāna, Vyāna, Samāna, and Udāna), the Mind, the Intellect, Egoity (Ahankāra) and Citta. If any one of them is missing, our experience of the world shall, to that degree, become imperfect. In the waking state, we are outwardly conscious and are enjoying gross objects of the world through the above gateways.

Let us not worry about the details as they are not very important to our study. This is one aspect of me which is called Jāgṛth Avastha. I have a world outside of me, the details of which I can capture through the five sense organs. I am a perceiver of the outside world. Having perceived, I apply likes and dislikes such as-this is a good carpet that is a bad carpet, he is a fine person, he is not a fine person, etc. These are called rāga-dveṣa. Having perceived the world outside of me, I begin to choose and select. This facet of mine is called **Jñātṛtva - ज्ञातृत्व** –the knower's capacity, the seer's capacity.

Having applied my selection, to get what I want and avoid what I do not want, I work towards that. This facet of mine is called **Kartṛtva - कर्तृत्व**, the doer ship.

Having chosen and worked, I want to enjoy the fruits of my so doing. This facet of mine is **Bhoktṛtva - भोक्तृत्व**, the capacity to enjoy.

Jnātṛtva, bhoktṛtva, kartṛtva - this is ‘Me’ in my Jāgṛth.

I do not think that even a scientist can simplify to this degree of accuracy. My tens of thousands of activities have been brought down now to three terms - **I am a perceiver, am emotionally** **involved and a doer**. Millions of my activities have been condensed into three terms, that’s a brilliant scientific performance even by today's standards. This is what Vedānta does. Thus one who enjoys the external world as above in his waking state, is called as **Sthūlabhuk-** **स्थूलभुक्** - enjoyer of gross objects. He is also otherwise called as Vaiśvānara in this state. This is the first state of ‘I’ – the wakeful state – **Jāgarita- Sthāna - जागरितस्थान.**  The second state of ‘I’ is:

**स्वप्नस्थानोऽन्तःप्रज्ञः सप्ताङ्ग एकोनविंशतिमुखः प्रविविक्तभुक्तैजसो द्वितीयः पादः।**

**Svapna-sthānaḥ-antaḥ-prajñaḥ sapta-aṅga ēkōnaviṁśatimukhaḥ pravivikta-bhuk-taijasō dvitīyaḥ pādaḥ.** (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 4.)

His second state is called as **Taijasa.** His sphere of activity is Dream State. He is conscious of internal world of objects. He has seven limbs and nineteen outlets. He enjoys the subtle objects of the inner world. This state is called as Svapna State**.**

This Dream State is the same as the first one (Jāgṛt-Avastha) but the difference being that you are seeing inside where as in the first state you are seeing outside. Now, there is an inside world, the dream world, exactly a replica of the Jāgṛt with all the details. This is the world of your own making. In this world, you fail in an examination although you have passed the same in the Jagṛt phase forty or fifty years ago- you may walk twenty miles and still are not tired. So you have another phase of existence where the region of perception is different from that of the first phase but the experiences are common to both the phases. Even in this phase, you perceive things, you involve emotionally and you are a doer here also.

We have by now understood our two states of existence i.e., wakeful State and dream State. Nothing big has come out of such a study. We are sufferers both in Jāgṛt and Svapna States.

However, we have one more state which is generally missed by us. It is neither wakeful State nor the dream State. That third state of existence of ours (Or that ‘**I**’) is called **Dreamless Sleep State.**Psychology has given least importance to this state whereas Vedānta gives all the importance. It's an experience which the world takes no notice of. The whole study of Vedānta is built on this one experience without which there is no Vedānta at all. So, in this phase, there is neither transaction of the outside world nor transaction of the inside world. This “I” also has experience of this deep sleep. This state is beautifully defined in Upaniṣad as:

**यत्र सुप्तो न कञ्चन कामं कामयते न कञ्चन स्वप्नं पश्यति तत्सुषुप्तम् ।    (**Māṇḍ Upa. 5.)

**Yatra suptō na kañcana kāmaṁ kāmayatē na kañcana svapnaṁ paśyati tat-suṣuptam.**

That is the state of deep sleep wherein the sleeper (that ‘I’) does not yearn for any desires nor does he see any dreams – That is the third state of the ‘I’ – **Suśupti**–** **Dreamless Sleep.

No scientist could have given a better definition to the sleeping state. In this state there are no thoughts, no emotions no cognition, no emotional involvement, no work. The karmendriyā-s are resting, the jnānedriyā-s are resting, the talk centre is resting, and the mind is also not there. None of the three lakṣaṇā-s, Jñātṛtva, kartṛutva and bhokṛutva which are found in the jāgṛt and in the svapna phase are seen here. Well, definition wise it is alright, what is so big about it?

One can feel that in Jāgṛt or waking state he is transacting with what is best for him while in deep sleep he is doing nothing. But, as per Vedānta one cannot belittle this state which is the best and richest experience of man. The deep sleep state is clearly described in the Upaniṣad as:

**सुषुप्तस्थान एकीभूतः प्रज्ञानघन एवानन्दमयो ह्यान्दभुक्चेतोमुखः प्राज्ञस्तृतीयः पादः॥**

**Suṣupta-sthāna ēkībhūtaḥ prajñāna-ghanaḥ ēva-ānandamayō hi-ānanda-bhuk-cētōmukhaḥ prājñaḥ tr̥tīyaḥ pādaḥ.**(Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad  3)** **

This ‘I’ is called **Prājñā.** Here, in deep sleep, all experiences become undifferentiated. He is verily a homogeneous mass of consciousness in entirety. He is full of bliss and enjoying bliss and whose door is conscious wisdom – This is the third state of the ‘I’**–** called as Suśupti- Dreamless Sleep**.**

In the jāgṛt or svapna state your enjoyment gives you only a fraction of ānanda, but in Suśupti state you are eating ānanda itself. What a beautiful metaphor! Bhuk means eater, enjoyer. Ānandabhuk means eater of ānanda itself. Ānandamayaḥ means ānanda personified. Given this extra information, you cannot take the sleep state in a light way. It is valuable because, your very question is tackled here. There is a ready answer to your starting question - your search for joy.

In nidrā you have no objects of enjoyment. You are not walking with your girlfriend. You are not having your ice cream stuffed with nuts, no vanilla, none of these things, no word of compliment, no word of flattery, and no company. You shine in your native glory. Happiness is not outside. You are yourself a mass of happiness. That is a fact born out of your own experience. Generally, when one misses one night’s sleep, it does not bother him much. But, one gets disturbed with more number of sleepless nights. One starts worrying and even becomes desperate. So desperate that he consults a doctor for a sleeping pill! Why this sort of urge? Should not the serious thinker study this aspect more comprehensively? What fresh information about the source of joy! Whatever conclusions we made in our sukhaparīkṣa, are the very conclusion that are available to us here in ātmaprīksha. <u>Non-doing is the essence of joy.</u> In nidrā, you are utterly in non-doing state. The limbs are resting, the talk centre is resting, the jñānendriyā-s - the sense organs are resting, and the mind is also resting. There is no activity at any functional centre whatsoever. And that must be the cause for Ānanda.

If the constituents of nidrā are these and nidrā is a very happy state, then the constituents of nidrā must be responsible for that happiness. That is simple logic. What are the constituents of nidrā? **na kañcana kāmaṁ kāmayatē na kañcana svapnaṁ paśyati - न कञ्चन कामं कामयते न कञ्चन स्वप्नं पश्यति ।** There are neither thoughts nor emotions. You have a definition of sukha once again. It is proved by experience that involvement is not sukha whereas non involvement is sukha. If the world were to appreciate this point, the whole civilization, takes a new turn. You don’t require anything for joy. You are yourselves a stuff of joy. When you stay in non-doing state, the triad- knower, knowing and the known - have completely collapsed. The knower himself is out of scene, but still exists

That’s the entire lesson you draw from the nidrā experience. So what is the lesson? This is how I put it: if you can incorporate the qualities of nidrā into jāgṛt, you have the solution. Commenting on Nidrā, Bṛhahādaraṇyaka Upaniṣad (4-3-22) goes to poetic heights. It explains as to what happens to everyone during the phase of Nidrā.

**अत्र माता अमाता भवति पिता अपिता भवतिस्तेनो अस्तेनो भवति भ्रूणहा अभ्रूणहा भवति अनन्वागतं पुण्येन अनन्वागतं पापेन तीर्णो हि तदा सर्वाञ्छोकान्हृदयस्य भवति.**

**Atra mātā amātā bhavati pitā apitā bhavati stēnō astēnō bhavati bhrūṇahā abhrūṇahā bhavati ananvāgataṁ puṇyēna ananvāgataṁ pāpēna tīrṇō hi tadā sarvān-śōkān-hr̥dayasya bhavati.**

Aatra māta amāta bhavati. What are you here in jagṛt? You are burdened with your motherhood. Oh, this child doesn’t eat. This child overeats. He is indifferent to studies. He is a bookworm**.**Whereas in nidrā, she is rid of the motherly cares.

Pitā apitā bhavati. The father has come out of his responsibilities, rid of his fatherly responsibilities, fatherly cares, and fatherly duties.

Steno a-steno bhavati -Similarly you are also free from your wrong side. The thief has lost his thief hood.

Bhrūṇaḥ abhrūṇaḥ bhavati - Killing the embryo in those days was a very big sin. A sinner who kills the embryo has come out of his sin in sleep.

Ananvāgatam puṇyena- ananvāgatam pāpena -  not pursued by your virtuous calls, not pursued by your sinful calls.

Tīrṇo bhavati tadā sarvān śokān hṛdayasya- You have crushed the ocean of duḥkha. All possible worries, anxieties, lurking inside the mind have disappeared. One has come out of them.

**एषाऽस्य परमा गतिरेषाऽस्य परमा सम्पदेषोऽस्य परमो लोक एषोऽस्य परम आनन्द एतस्यैवाऽऽनन्दस्यान्यानि भूतानि मात्रामुपजीवन्ति॥**

**Ēṣaḥ-asya paramā gatiḥ-ēṣāḥ-asya paramā sampadḥ-ēṣaḥ-asya paramō lōka ēṣaḥ-asya parama ānanda ētasya-ēva-ānandasya-anyāni bhūtāni mātrām-upajīvanti.** (Bṛh. Upa. 4-3-32)



* This is your happiest state.
* This is the highest state to be achieved.
* This is your highest way of existence.
* All the creatures in the universe sustain and survive only because of an iota of this bliss.

By taking a lesson from this one and living rest of your life in obedience to this truth, how can you be miserable?

May be a very dreadful proposition, but that’s the true proposition for complete happiness. That’s the essence of vedānta. The truth cannot change to your convenience. Your value systems must be revised in conformity with the truth. It cannot be the other way because truth is truth. If a person appreciates this logic, he comes out of duḥkha. What one has to do from now on? Nothing can touch one because one can afford to be that way. What prevents one from being that way in the wakeful state? Although nearly half of your lifetime is spent in nidrā state, you are unwilling to evaluate that. What a tragedy with man!-wonders the śāstra. You have the answer to the problem of suffering this way.

Nobody can say that he got lost when he went in to sleep and a new person came on the scene when he woke up. That would be absurd, as it is a continuity of the self. In nidrā there is only prāṇa vyāpāra. Karmendriyā-s are not functioning, Jñānendriyā-s are not functioning, talk centre is not working, and Citta is not doing anything. For this reason one must be happy. Whatever are the ingredients of Nidrā must be the factors responsible for that joy, obviously. Nidrā is non dual and blissful state. It is any body's admission. Thus a no mind state is the common factor we have arrived at while doing the Sukha-Duḥkha Parīkṣā as well as Nidrā Parīkṣā.

**Q.** Can a man ever be zero inside?

**A.** It is a very intricate question. I have a model for liberation, where I have the convenience of calculus language. There is nothing like a zero function at all to me. Mukti is not ‘non doing’ utterly - we both agree that anything less than one divided by ten to the power of ten is negligible. If the softness obtained is of that order, then it is liberation. Each R̥ṣi is liberated, if there is a line of activity less than that permitted agreed line. Then, nothing bothers them and they are comfortable. But there can be spandana vyatyāsa. But, the spandana is so less that they don’t complain at all. So, that is mukti. This is the calculus language I worked out. According to me, this is a better method of understanding mukti. Then you can explain how a feeble spandana-Īśvara, otherwise a non doing thing, start creating. If Brahma is defined as utter non doing, then the question arises as to how can doing come from non doing? How can opposite qualities be related in the janya-janaka sambandha? How can darkness produce light? How can non motion produce motion? This is the difficulty with the classical model.

Whereas in our model Brahma is not a total inactive principle (avyāpāra) as the tradition puts it. But it is atyalpa spandana that can magnify. You see the convenience of Calculus which gave me happier position in understanding Brahma. I suggested this to many scientists who appreciated this model. Bhṛgu is different from persons like Dūrvāsa with regard to their levels of citta samādhāna but they are beyond duḥkha because their citta had achieved an optimum degree of samādhāna. Even with us if there is an increase of ten percent of the samādhāna, we stop complaining. Twenty percent samādhāna makes us to drop the complaining nature. That means, time is beautiful, life is beautiful, time passes sweetly, then there could be a state of mahā samādhi. Rāmakṛṣṇa is different from Ramaṇa. Rāmakṛṣṇa was more participating, but Ramaṇa was the opposite of it. He would talk only when a question was put. Otherwise there was total silence. So, hundreds of mukthā-s could be accommodated with variation in their levels of vyāpāra within this calculus model. <u>Nidra</u>, the non doing state of mind is glorified in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad  (4-3-19) as follows:

**तद्यथास्मिन्नाकाशे श्येनो वा सुपर्णो वा विपरिपत्य श्रान्तः संहत्य पक्षौ संलयायैव घ्रियते एवमेवायं पुरुष एतस्मा अन्ताय धावति यत्र सुप्तो न कंचन कामं कामयते न कंचन स्वप्नं पश्यति ॥**

**Tat-yathā-asmin-ākāśē śyēnō vā suparṇō vā viparipatya śrāntaḥ saṁhatya pakṣau saṁlayāyaiva ghriyatē ēvam ēva ayaṁ puruṣa ētasmā antāya dhāvati yatra suptō na kaṁcana kāmaṁ kāmayatē na kaṁcana svapnaṁ paśyati.**

It explains this aspect very beautifully, śyeno vā_ _suparṇo vā, Viparipatya - a big bird, flying and flying and flying …_ _śrāntaḥ- tired of beating its wings, svanīḍam_ _viśati - wings reaches to rest in its nest, and becomes empty.

Śankara in his Bhāṣya on the above comments as:

**यथा जागृत्स्वप्नयोः‍ जीवस्य पक्षिणः परिपतनजः इव श्रमः भवति । तत् श्रम अपनुत्तये संसारधर्म विलक्षणम्**

**क्रियाकारकफल आयास शून्यम् स्वामात्मानम् विशति ।**

**Yathā jāgṛt svapnayoḥ jīvasyapakśinaḥ paripatanjaḥ iva śramaḥ bhavati.**

**tat śrama apanuttayē saṁsāradharma vilakṣaṇam kriyākārakaphala āyāsa śūnyam svāmātmānam viśati.**

Yatha- like wise,

jāgṛt svapnayoḥ- jīvasya pakṣiṇaḥ paripatanajaḥ iva śramaḥ bhavati- in the very same way , this Jīva, this sufferer both in the jāgṛt and svapna phase always doing and cognising, emotionally becomes tired.

tat śrama apanuttaye samsāra dharma vilakṣaṇam kriyā kāraka phala āyāsa śoonyam swam ātmānam viśati.--to come out of this toiling phase, one comes to the sleep state.

How apt is this comparison! What a metaphor! While we think that we should give value to work or achievement, Śāstra says that one must give value to the sleep phase without which man would have become lunatic, crazy, if he were not alternating between these two phases. This nidrā phase is the recouping phase. You have a dip into this ānanda, strengthened by that, reinforced by that, refreshed by that, you are able to work again. What is the lesson? Even in the wakeful state, if you can always be that way as if you are untouched by details and you are in that expansive state with leisurely activity, then you have attained peace of mind.

Further, nobody can say that he was non-existent in the sleep phase and a new person came the next day. That would be the most ridiculous conclusion. In fact, at one place if one has left his pen or his spectacles, next day he gets them back from the same place. This is the continuity of existence. The fellow who was non-existent for all practical purposes, during nidrā, the very same fellow is there for all of us to see the next day.

Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad describes <u>the fourth state-TURĪYA</u> as-

**प्रपञ्चोपशमं शान्तं शिवमद्वैतं चतुर्थं मन्यन्ते॥**

**Prapañca-upaśamaṁ śāntaṁ śivam-advaitaṁ caturthaṁ manyantē.** (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad  7)

The end of evolution, peaceful, non-dual is deemed as the fourth state of ‘I’. This fourth state is also called **Turīya.**

**स आत्मा स विज्ञेयः - sa ātmā sa vijñēyaḥ**

 (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣat 7)** **

That is SELF. Why don’t you discover this aspect of You?

You know there are four states of existence viz Jāgṛt, Svapna, Suśupti, and Turīya. Now what is Turīya? Nidrā incorporated into the Jāgṛt phase is Turīya. Turīya is no mystery- na kañcana kāmam kāmayate-no emotions - na kañcana svapnam paśyati- no planning, scheming, thinking - thoughts are absent, emotions are absent. If you are able to bring in the qualities of Nidrā into Jāgṛt phase, you are always happy. Can action go on in such a state is the question. It can very well go on as we do not go away from work. Once you know this point most of you can be in the expansive state which is carefree and unconcerned. This can happen as if it is a reflex action. We do not have to volitionally do anything. While walking you do not say next step, it just goes on sequential, although bulk of me is resting. Co-existence of the nidrā dharma inside and vyāpāra outside is possible. Then you are a Jeevan Mukta. Then your efficiency increases. A Vedāntin is more efficient in his work. Arjuna became more efficient, Rāma came back to kingship. This is what we refer to as- sākṣī bhāva, udāsina bhāva, anāsakti bhāva. Activities can go on without involvement. You take the attitude of **‘let go’**, but functions can go on. While talking of three guṇās and their divisions Lord Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna in Bhagavad-Gīta (3-28)

**तत्त्ववित्तु महाबाहो गुणकर्मविभागयोः।**

**गुणागुणेषु वर्तन्त इति मत्वा न सज्जत** ॥

**Tattvavittu mahābāhō guṇa-karma-vibhāgayōḥ,**

**guṇā-guṇēṣu vartanta iti matvā na sajjata**.

He, who knows about the classification of the Guṇā-s and their respective functions, understands that the qualities of sense organs move amidst qualities of sense objects is not attached to the actions**.**

I can talk, I can transact, and I can walk ten miles, while the citta is zero. A mechanical work does not require brain or the thinking portion. Śāstra says manage it that way, life will be beautiful, charming, and every one can do that.

How Nidrā is different from Turīya? The answer is, in Nidrā you are not liberated, you are not yet Brahman, you are not pure ātman, because you come back from nidrā into jāgṛt Avastha. That means the forces operating in Jāgṛt must be there in the seed form in Nidrā. (Māṇ. Upa.1-Kā.13)

**द्वैतस्याग्रहणं तुल्यमुभयोः प्राज्ञतुर्ययोः।**

**बीजनिद्रायुतः प्राज्ञः सा च तुर्ये न विद्यते॥**

**Dvaitasya-agrahaṇaṁ tulyam-ubhayōḥ prājña- turyayōḥ,**

**Bīja-nidrāyutaḥ prājñaḥ sā ca turyē na vidyatē.**

Non-cognition of duality is common to the Prājñā and Turīya. But Prājñā is associated with the causal state of sleep, and that does not exist in Turīya. This is the difference between Nidrā and turīya. Nidrā carries the Jāgṛt forces in a seed form, in a potential form, in latent form. They are not eliminated. Gauḍapāda makes a beautiful point. Though non doing is a common factor between nidrā and turīya, there is a difference. There is a residue in nidrā which is absent in turīya. That is why you come back. All the forces are there intact, like hunger, jealousy, etc., and none of the forces were eliminated there; they are existing in seed form.

When you go to nidrā, you have not tackled the forces at all. It is possible to tame and dissolve consciously the forces by softening. One can soften even the respiration rate. In nidrā there is cittalaya and in turīya there is cittanāśa. It has taken the form of mere vibrations instead of specific vibrations like seeing, listening, talking and all that has become mere prāṇic activity. A specific form is replaced by a general prāṇic activity. <u>In turīya, even the general prāṇic activity is diffused. You diffuse into everywhereness, there is no spandana at all, that is the difference – This is known as cittanāśa.</u>

**Q.** Nature has given all the means of comfort for people to enjoy and people in turn help the nature to sustain the balance. Thus I feel it is necessary for one to use them and one cannot sit quiet without using them. What do you think?

**A.** That is our notion, that’s our belief. But, what do you say to this experience which is part of you? How can you turn this down? What's your logic? It is so glaring that nothing extraordinary is required for one to be in a state of ānanda. If this is the problem with you, then the śāstra says that this human problem is due to lack of parīkṣā having made wrong conclusions about things you are suffering.

**Q.** But we are not ready yet as we are bound by vāsanās?

**A.** Yes, all that we accept.

**Q.** But the quietness what you try to achieve makes you more inert, more lazy and all that?

**A.** Remove that aspect. If you can bring the qualities of nidrā into jāgṛt, you are a liberated person. But you are asking me a funny question - Do you want me to be continuously in sleep? The answer is – be consciously indifferent (sleep like state) to all the external activities in the wakeful state. The normal sleep which is not under your control is defective in the sense you have no mastery over that. You cannot wilfully go to sleep. Something drags you to sleep where as you can wilfully sit and empty the mind in the jāgṛt phase. These are the words for that- Conscious sleep- Volitional sleep - Ajādya nidrā as śāstra puts it - awakened nidrā – Jāgrannidrā - calculated sleep - self managed sleep. The indriyā-s are not corrupted. They are readily available, but you don’t put them to work. Every person has to find out for him or herself the level at which he/she can practice this depending on the maturity of his/her sādhana, but first of all we have to appreciate the Indian thinkers for the announcement of this truth. Can any scientific mind object to the conclusions made out in the Upaniṣad-s?

**Q.**How can we differentiate between Bhogasukha and nidrā?

**A.** That is exactly the Indian way of thinking. You are prepared to exchange any bhogasukha to nidrā. Suppose we look at an alternative for one to be happy. Just sit quiet with the innocence of a child, with nothingness inside. Śankara, commenting on happiness in the Sādhana Pañcaka, (Śloka 5) concludes very clearly:

**एकान्ते सुखमास्यताम् परतरे चेतस्समाधीयताम् ।**

**Ēkāntē sukham-āsyatām paratarē cētaḥ- samādhīyatām.**

Very simple. Just sit wherever you are. Just sit and empty the mind. Ēkānte sukahamāsyatāṁ, means simply stay put. Difficult, I agree. Can we find fault with this value system and with this hint from the Upaniṣads for global civilization? Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen recently said that the poorest country in this part of the world is the happiest one because they apply this vedāntic finding. There are statistical rigorous scientific findings. So where does happiness lie?

**Q.**Why was this truth which is so simple to adopt was hibernating these many years? Why has it not seen the light of the day?

**A.** Very good question. Because, it is difficult to follow/practice. The point one has to bear in mind is that the truth must be accepted. Secondly, one has to enter into sādhana phase. Life's value systems must change. Life's habits must change. That’s the important question. Don’t think that in India everybody is this way. That’s making a wrong conclusion. Most of the people in that country also are after materialism. Everyone in that country, given a chance wants to come to America because this is a country of plenty. But the society at large must appreciate this wisdom and they should be the path setters. If the intellectuals were to appreciate and adopt them in their lifestyle, then the ordinary people will automatically follow. **Mahājanāḥ yena gatāḥ sa** **eva panthāḥ** - **महाजना: येन गता: स** **एव पन्था:।**The average person treads on the path set by noble people.

We shall take up another prakriya, Pancakośa Viveka, in our next lecture and see how it takes us to deeper levels of understanding our true nature.


### PANCA KOŚA VIVĒKA 
(KNOWLEDGE OF FIVE SHEATHS OF EXISTANCE)

Another equally important prakriya about understanding the ‘self’ is beautifully explained in Taittirīya Upaniṣad and it is quite interesting. We will now deliberate on this prakriya as it is called as Pañca-kośa-viveka which is contained in the Bhṛguvalli (2) of the said Upaniṣad.

**भृगुर्वै वारुणिः वरुणं पितरं उपससार अधीहि भगवो ब्रह्मेति ॥**

**Bhr̥gurvai vāruṇiḥ varuṇaṁ pitaraṁ upasasāra adhīhi bhagavō brahmēti.**

There is seeker called Bhṛgu. He goes to his teacher who is also his father by name Varuṇa. What question he goes with? ** **Master, give me the wisdom of the self; tell me about the self or the causal stuff of the universe.

**तस्मा एतत्प्रोवाच अन्नम् प्राणं चक्षुः श्रोत्रं मनो वाचमिति॥**

**Tasmā ētat-prōvāca annam prāṇaṁ cakṣuḥ śrōtraṁ manō vācam-iti.**

The Teacher Varuṇa told his disciple that Food, i.e., the body (Śarīra), Vital Force which operates inside the body, the tools of cognising, i.e., eyes, ears, mind, etc., are the doors to realize brahman.

**यतो वा इमानि भूतानि जायन्ते। येन जातानि जीवन्त। यत्प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्ति। तद्विजिज्ञासस्व। तद्ब्रह्मेति॥**

**Yatō vā imāni bhūtāni jāyantē, yēna jātāni jīvanti, yat-prayanti-abhisaṁviśanti, tat- vijijñāsasva, tat-brahma-iti.**

The Teacher gives the most scientific definition of Brahman or the ultimate reality or the Causal stuff of the Universe as - whatever is the causal stuff from which this world is born, whatever sustains this universe and in whatever stuff into which the world dissolves, that is Brahma.

This is an excellent definition according to cosmology or even according to theoretical physics. Then the teacher asks the student to sit and do tapas (meditate)-that means the teacher doesn’t give the ultimate truth because the student does not gain by simply listening to the truth.  Investigation by the person alone would open the door to the answer.   Truth had to be discovered, only then it would become valuable. Then the student after deliberation within himself comes to the following conclusion-

**अन्नं ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात्। अन्नाद्ध्येव खल्विमानि भूतानि जायन्ते। अन्नेन जातानि जीवन्ति। अन्नं यत्प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्तीति॥**

**Annaṁ brahma-iti vyajānāt, annāt-hi-ēva khalu- imāni bhūtāni jāyantē, annēna jātāni jīvanti, annaṁ yat-prayanti-abhisaṁviśanti-iti.**

The student understood that this body is "I" and is called as anna. Anna (the food)** **is brahma, because all living things originate from anna-lives because of anna and return to the same anna. The teacher neither accepts his word nor suggests any answer but sends him back to investigate again. “By intense thinking seek Brahman”.

**तपसा ब्रह्म विजिज्ञासस्व। तपो ब्रह्मेति।**

**Tapasā brahma vijijñāsasva, tapō brahma-iti.**

It is at this point we should also make a study as to why the R̥ṣi sent back his student to study further. If I were this body, then after death no one should feel sorry for me because this body is very much present here. Śankara, in his Bhajagovindaṁ says that even the wife of that person who is dead, is afraid of that body-gatavati_ _vayou_ _prāṇāpāye_ _bhāryā_ _bibhyati_ _tasmin_ _kāye _–**गतवति वायौ प्राणापाये भार्या बिभ्यति तस्मिन् काये।**_ that means even the woman who was so intimate when the person was alive feels that the body should be disposed off as quickly as possible.  Why?  The wife did not see the husband in the body. She saw the husband only in the living body when the body had life.  Why? The body is not me, by common sense.  The life that goes with the body is the precious thing. The body becomes lifeless on death. Then after further thought, the student returns and says**–**

**प्राणो ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात्। प्राणाद्ध्येव खल्विमानि भूतानि जायन्ते। प्राणेन जातानि जीवन्ति। प्राणं प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्तीति॥            -** (Bhṛguvalli 3)

**Prāṇō brahma-iti vyajānāt, prāṇāt-hi-ēva khalu-imāni bhūtāni jāyantē, prāṇēna jātāni jīvanti prāṇaṁ  prayanti-abhisaṁviśanti-iti.**

He comes to the conclusion that prāṇa, the vital force is that “I”.   It is from prāṇa that all these living beings are born. Being produced from it, they live by it and in the end become one with it. The spandana, the vibration, the movement inside, which makes transactions possible for the body is that “I”. The teacher directs the disciple to do further investigation to arrive at the Truth. **Tapasā** **brahma vijijñāsasva**

The disciple is asked to ponder as to what is wrong with prāṇa?    Why that “I” really is not that Prāṇa. If one has just the body and prāṇa, we all very well know that it is useless to him and to others. This is the case with the person who is in the state of coma who will be just like bellows working to and fro - vegetating stuff as the doctors put it. So prāṇa is not that “I”. There is something more. Cognition, grasping things, usefully using them and working with them is something worthwhile.  Otherwise who wants that just respirating body! The student after further struggle returns with the report that-

**मनो ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात ।**

**Mano Brahma-iti** **Vyajānāt.**  -  (Bhṛguvalli 4)

He concludes that MIND** **is that “I”.  Mind through indriyā-s can capture things, can use it for one’s own joy or whatever it is. Indriya Vyāpāra dictated by Mind (Manas) is that real “I”. So this me is the mind- not the mere Prāṇa.  But the teacher dismisses him once again and orders him to do tapas and find the real truth.

Why is the mind not "me" has to be questioned here.-what is the shortcoming about mind being identified with “I”?  The simple explanation could be, mind can only take perceptions- that’s all- it cannot discriminate. It cannot see what is good for the living thing and what is bad for that, what is useful and what is not useful, what is injurious and what is not injurious. That’s the stage of the child.  Till three/four years, a child does not know how to find out what is good or bad, due to which it can cause injury to itself.  Mind is there, perception of objects is there, but judgment is not there. So self destruction could be possible. If you had only Manokośa and no Vijñānakośa, then discrimination is not possible. If both potassium cyanide and sugar are given together, one can consume former for latter and may end his life due to lack of understanding. So, Manokośa is incomplete because there is no discrimination, the faculty to know what is good or what is bad, what is useful or what is not, etc. Later, the student after further investigation asserts that-

**विज्ञानं ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात् ।**

**Vijñānaṁ Brahma-iti Vyajānāt.**  - (Bhṛguvalli 5)

Intellect is - that “I”. The teacher dismisses this point also. All of us know that Vijñānakośa** **is the one of discrimination, and judgment.  Why did the teacher dismiss it?  This stand of the teacher is an unacceptable position to all of us, since we assume that Vijñānakośa is the ultimate. That is the cream of man, that is the best of man and it is through this kośa humans do things, earn food, clothing and shelter. The primitive man could not have lived without that, as protection from predators was not possible without Vijñānakośa. So, Vijñānakośa is the best of me.

If one looks at the old temples and the present day structures, where columns and beams are used, it will immediately occur to everyone about the wonders of Vijñānakośa.  In olden days, they could not think of a beam more than five or six feet and they had to have hundreds of them in a huge structure. Now it is possible to build a large span of 60ft or 80ft without a pillar in between with the knowledge of this kośa. Today, surgery has become so easy with very high advancement in the anaesthesia technology.  All this has been possible because of this kośa. So, Vijñānakośa is the best of man for his welfare and for the welfare of the community. So, it looks that the study of the ātman is complete with “I” being equated to Vijñānakośa.   Most of the systems of philosophy stopped here. To be moral, to be ethical, sharing what we have with the have-nots is the outcome of this understanding. Despite these benefits, why the teacher did not accept this kośa as the ultimate is the point to ponder over.

Now, we have to discuss as to what are the shortcomings of this kośa.  If we can appreciate where the Vijñānakośa is defective then we have appreciated Vedānta.  Do we have a pre Vijñānakośa state of existence?  Granting that we have a pre Vijñānakośa state, is it worthwhile?  Do we have enough pramāṇa or evidence to prove that?  If we can answer successfully these questions then we have appreciated the theme of Vedānta.   Between manokośa and Vijñānakośa, the difference is that manokośa involves random thinking. It doesn’t arrange things whereas Vijñānakośa has sequential thinking, therefore very productive, very performing. In the cause--result way we think and get results.

Let us take an example.  Take the case of a lady who is managing the house hold affairs and taking care of children and other needs of the house.  If you watch carefully, she has so many needs to be attended to simultaneously, like attending to the child’s needs before putting him/her to the school bus, attending to the husband’s needs before sending him off to office, preparing food at the same time.  So many things are disorderly and all these have to be attended to in a hard pressed time frame.  All these call for full performance of the vijñāna- kośa.  After all these activities, she throws herself on the couch nearby, with a deep sigh of relief from what she has done with the problems.  By dropping herself, her Vijñānakośa is also dropped.  She wants to go to a state of no work, which is comforting for her and she wants to remain in this state for some time at least before she starts working again. This is an indication that there is a subtler and valuable phase of existence with no more problems bothering her.

Similarly, if you watch a researcher, he also shakes off after a serious work and sits quietly sipping a cup of coffee or whatever. It turns out to be a fact that Vijñānakośa, however grand it appears, is incomplete and is taxing. Any vyāpāra is taxing whether you like it or not. After hard work, every one of us feels relieved and that is the point where Vedānta alone shows the secret of happiness. The lady in our example is willing to throw away the Vijñānakośa as it is taxing and go to a pre Vijñānakośa state which is more comforting.  This is the new wisdom that Vedānta gives to man, a missing element for the present day civilization.

Performance is all right. If possible, let us all do it leisurely without target, not giving full pressure to our system.  Unfortunately, we are all put to very strict goals and we take that as the aim of life.  We do not seem to think that we can perform better if we do things at a lesser pace. We are always worried that someone else would excel our performance.  To come out of this, we have to take a dip in the state of no work which is amṛtasthāna, whereas performance is āyāsasthāna. Resting rejuvenates man, like taking a tonic.  If one had stayed on in Vijñānakośa continuously he would have broken down.   Fortunately, <u>we are oscillating between rest and performance</u> without knowing the dangers of this Vijñānakośa. This knowledge about things has to be corrected in the light of our experience. Although we have been unknowingly experiencing moments of relaxation, we have not recognised the same. Taittirīya Upaniṣat (Brahmānandavalli 2-7-3) puts this very beautifully-

**कोह्येवान्यात् कः प्राण्यात्। यदेष आकाश आनन्दो न स्यात॥**

**Kō-hi-ēva-anyāt kaḥ prāṇyāt, yadēṣa ākāśa ānandō na syāt.**

Who would have done respiration if there was no ānanda in ākāśa dharma or a no mind state?

We touch our ākāśa dharma by <u>letting go the confinement.</u>   If we did not touch this emptiness or the quietness in us, how could we have lived, how could we have respired? Our inhalation and exhalation would have been impossible and we would have broken down - **yeśa hi eva ānandayati - एषह्येवानन्दयति.** This ākāśa dharma is only the source of joy or ānanda. So the student discovers the last truth-

**आनन्दो ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात्। आनन्दाद्ध्येव खल्विमानि भूतानि जायन्ते। आनन्देन जातानि जीवन्ति। आनन्दं प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्तीति।**(Bhṛguvalli 6)** **

**Ānandō brahma-iti vyajānāt, ānandāt- hi-ēva khalu-imāni bhūtāni jāyantē, ānandēna jātāni jīvanti, ānandaṁ prayanti-abhisaṁviśanti-iti.**

From ānanda you are born, your activity is sustained.  It is because of the ānanda that you experience here, you get back to your ānanda- sthāna** **when you die.   It is the SOURCE, which is the sustaining stuff, the ‘ONE’ into which activity dissolves. When the student discovered that, he had nothing else to verify because he was so certain that he did not approach the teacher to verify whether he was correct or not. So, the Upaniṣad ends with the mantra—

**सैषा भार्गवी वारुणी विद्या। परमे व्योमन् प्रतिष्ठित।।**

**Sā-ēṣā bhārgavī vāruṇī vidyā, paramē vyōman pratiṣṭhita.**(Bhṛguvalli 6)

This is the great wisdom given by Varuṇa, the father and the teacher, to the student Bhṛgu.   What did this knowledge do to the student?  It put him in to that limitless emptiness or the expansiveness that we are all structured with. Upaniṣad further boldly puts it-Upaniṣad affirms that all persons irrespective of cast, creed, religion or place are eligible to attain this ānanda and one who knows about this comforting silence, enjoys the amanībhāva- permanent happiness.

**प्रतितिष्ठति अद्वये आनन्द मात्रे आत्मनि प्रतितिष्ठति।**

**Prati-tiṣṭhati advayē ānanda mātrē ātmani prati-tiṣṭhati.**

He gets established in that state as it is his true self and every one of us could touch that state because it is our very nature and stay there as long as one wants.

There is one more point there. When you touch that mahāvishrānti, that expansion, it is not the helpless expansion or helpless silence of the idiot.  It is that expansion which is the abode of all the activities. It is the base of creativity.  You are not powerless there. You can do any amount of performance, you can apply kumbhana that can shake the world and can lift mountains.   Power and silence can coexist. It is further declared in Bhṛguvalli 7 that:

**अन्नवान् अन्नादो भवति। महान् भवति प्रजया पशुभिः ब्रह्मवर्चसेन महान् कीर्त्या।**

**Annavān annādō bhavati, mahān bhavati prajayā paśubhiḥ brahma-varcasēna mahān kīrtyā.**

You get all mundane gains.  You get all creative energies.   If you touch that state, you get plenty of material wealth.  How can non-doing beget all these? That’s the cosmic law.  If you position yourself there, by a mere sankalpa, you can achieve whatever you want.

Annavān bhavati, annādo bhavati - **अन्नवान् भवति**। **‍अन्नादो भवति**। - Indriya patutwa increases.  Annāda means digestive power.

Mahān bhavati prajayā- paśubhiḥ - **महान् भवति प्रजया‍ पशुभि:**। People applaud you, people praise you, and look at you with great respect. All mundane gains automatically come to a man who is a brahmajñāni- who is brhmaniṣṭa- It is very difficult to grasp the mechanism involved. Possible explanation is that when there is cittaśuddhi of that order, it may be possible to materialise things of your choice. Here we may get a doubt as to whether the Śāstra is ridiculing lower levels. Śāstra is not ridiculing the lower levels at all.

Prāṇamayakośa**- प्राणमयकोश** -is much superior to annamayakośa- because the burden of mass is gone. You have lifted yourself. At the prāṇamayakośa level, mass is gone. If you observe a rocket, every few seconds some mass is reduced as it soars higher. Anger is a linear property as it is in prāṇamayakośa. It is confined.

But when you come to manomayakośa, you are in three dimensions- you are everywhere. Manomayakośa has brought in the element of expansiveness losing the defect called linearity. This kośa is superior to prāṇamayakośa when you identify with each kośa. But, what is wrong with manomāyakośa and how is vijñānamayakośa superior? Upaniṣad beautifully puts it thus-

**तस्य ऋतम् दक्षिणः पक्षः‍। सत्यम् उत्तरः पक्षः। योग आत्मा।**

**Tasya ṛtam dakṣiṇaḥ pakṣaḥ, satyam uttaraḥ pakṣaḥ, yoga ātmā**.

I was bothered about the word Yoga, as how its use has come in here, in the context of vijñānakośa? I could gather that yoga in this context means samādhāna. That is the point of difference between manas and vijñānakośa. So, if you sit in an endless space, you can at once see thousands miles. This means that you are just all that space. It is not that you moved from here to there. Your sarvavyāpitva has set in. One component of Brahmalakṣaṇa is already achieved.  But then what is wrong? How is it still different from Brahma? Though vistārata has been achieved, cancalatva of the mind has not gone. It is due to Vistārata, that Vijñānakośa is extraordinary- that is why creativity has come in.  It is very superior since naidhānya has set in.   That is why achievement is possible both in science and technology and in understanding self.

When you compare vijñānakośa and ānadakośa, expansion is common, cognition also is common.  There is a bit of focusing in former without which performance is not possible. Ānadamayakośa has no dwaita bodha.  Creation is assembling of things in an order. In ānanda- simply pictures and sounds are there, but no assembly takes place as in vijñānakośa.

Vistārata is there in manokośa, but naidhānya is not there. That has come in vijñānakośa and that ānanda has already come to you because of relaxation.  But, dwaita-bodha is destroyed only in ānandakośa since focusing is not there.

**तस्य प्रियमेव शिर**:**। मोदो दक्शिण**:**पक्श**:**।** **प्रमोदो उत्तर**: **पक्श**:**।** **आनन्द आत्मा**।.

**Tasya priyamēva śiraḥ- modo dakṣiṇaḥ pakṣaḥ** **pramodo uttaraḥ pakṣaḥ- ānanda ātmā.**

The characteristic of Ānandakośa is that it is near to Samādhi state. One can ask the difference between ānandakośa and vijñānakośa- Śankara clarifies that in Vijñānakośa, individualisation or localisation has not gone. That is, object has a locus –KHANDATVA in this Kośa. But, in Ānandakośa this defect is not there.

Now, the question arises as to whether Ānandakośa itself is the ultimate position? Śankara puts forth his argument thus:

Ānanda is included in Pancakośa. Thus, a kośa wnich represents confinement cannot be a property of Brahma. Hence Ānandakośa cannot represent Brahma, since confinement is still there in that Kośa.

Secondly, **brahmapuccham pratiṣṭha - ब्रह्मपुच्छम् प्रतिष्ठ ।** This is the portion of mantra in Upaniṣad while defining Ānandakośa. If Ānandakośa is identical to Brahma, then the portion of this Mantra is irrelevant. Every stage, you go to a higher level by dropping an extra of the previous Kośa. Similarly, when you forget a valuable thing at the higher level, missing of which, you come to a lower kośa. As such Ānandakośa is Brahma, but corrupt.

So we have looked at a beautiful prakriya enunciated in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad, where you touch the silence and show that there is silence in all of us and which is superior to vijñānakośa for the reason that it is the comforting state and is the ānandasthāna.  Ānandasthāna is the source of tremendous energy by which sequential thinking and all other values of vijñānakośa are possible because of which technology has grown.  Present civilisation is suffering because they have concluded that vijñānakośa is the ultimate and end of all.

Hindu thought provides this missing element to the global civilization.

Now I will take up questions for you.

**Q.** Ānandakośa is superior to Vijñānakośa and there is no question about this. Just because it is considered superior, why not we think that there is something superior to ānanda?

**A.** If there is anything superior please point it out.

**Q.** Buddha questioned this point?

**A.** He did not.  After enlightenment he was always happy. Incidentally he gave the message of compassion to the world and asked everybody to enjoy that ānanda. Why did he advocate sanyāsa to everybody?  He said that ānanda is your very nature. Suppose you are in the sākṣībhāva, you can do any amount of work. In fact your work efficiency increases. You’re not tired at all because you are getting a tonic there. With that spirit one has to function.  Vedānta doesn’t prevent anyone from functioning. Suffering while in activity is the one that Vedānta attacks and says that it is not needed.

**Q.**Do we take rest to be active or are we active because we want work?

**A.** The answer would be, if activity doesn’t make you complain, go ahead.  If there is some system inside where you are doing activity in the leisurely background then go ahead. When you yourself complain, your priority must change. If you want rest but feel that the work dries you up and you complain, then this wisdom comes to your rescue. Suppose you are active and not worried about it, then it is fine, there is a safety valve mechanism or protective shield that is taking care of you.  It is working well at the deeper centres.

**Q.**Ānanda and vijñāna serve each other. Am I right or wrong?

**A.** In the background of ānanda, if you are in vijñānakośa, then it is fine. There is nothing like compartments- everything is a blending, everything is in continuity. You can be stationed at various levels like-vyāpāra helplessly done or vyāpāra done without sacrificing relaxation or no vyāpāra at all. There could be phases; it is all one Brahma in different phases. Pure consciousness is one thing. Consciousness coupled with activity is another. Freedom element of consciousness is considerably lost in the animal kingdom-still worse in the plant kingdom- totally lost in the rock kingdom. A bit of freedom has flowered in the animal kingdom and plant kingdom, much more in the human beings where corticular activity has started. <u>Through the freedom of choice for doing a thing or not doing a thing, you go to regions of ānanda.   That is the tool for spiritual growth.</u>

**Q.** Most of such questions get dropped off once you get the ānanda, and the mind gets relaxed.   Why?

**A.** When we are in sākṣībhāva, Indriyā-s by themselves can perform, there being a very faint silver thread connection. For example, we are in that state of relaxation induced by the talk and discussions when we are in satang.   In satang we do not aim at getting new information at all-we talk about peace and ānanda and therefore everybody is put into that state. Satsanga is—

**तच्चिन्तनं तत्कथनमन्योन्यं तत्प्रबोधनम् ।**

**Tat-cintanaṁ tat-kathanam-anyōnyaṁ tat -prabōdhanam.** (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha 3-2-108)

I am_ _benefited now and you are also benefited as both of us are in expansive state. What is brhama abhyāsa? It is, **cintana, kathana annyonya prabodhana - चिन्तन, कथन अन्न्योन्य प्रबोधन ।**

**एतदेकपरत्वं च तदभ्यासं विदुर्बुधाः॥**

**Ētat- ēka-paratvaṁ ca tat-abhyāsaṁ vidurbudhāḥ.** (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha 3-2-108)

Mutually inducing -you talk a word about peace, I get that, -I talk a word about peace, you get that.

**Q.** Are we not always in that phase?

**A.**It is not that easy. If you are, then you might be doing that sādhana for more than twenty years! For a fresher, this focusing has to go and he has to stabilise in the state of relaxation, then he can be really happy in spite of activity.

Now we say drop this focusing and hold on to the let go state.  A stage comes when let go state is in abundance and you can focus also without any botheration. This model is called peripheral focusing. It can also be called non focusing attention. Many such words can be used to represent the state. It is a matter of time and sādhana.

**Q.** Why can’t we start at the very early age like training a child?

**A.** If you encourage a child to keep quiet, then it encourages the child to develop laziness more than the spiritual sādhana.   A bit of discipline, a bit of effort, a bit of persuasion, but within safe limits is necessary. Otherwise it degenerates since there is no vicāra. The child wants all the bhoga but does not want to toil for the same. Control or samyama has to be taught over a period of time and cannot be done hastily.  Samādhāna is missing in this civilization which is pushing the child into the rat race.

The child cannot pick up all the good vāsanā-s if left free and without any imposition from the parent.  Suggestion can be given to the child, gently and not pushing things authoritatively. Then these healthy attitudes will become stronger in the child’s mind. Unless maturity develops for discrimination, it will not be an easy path. Maithri, karuna, mudita, upekşa ideas are very good for the child’s growth, instead of selfishness, irritability, hatred.  Aśubha-vāsanā-s are to be replaced by śubha-vāsanā-s That is where our responsibility comes. Give all the ideals of Indian heritage like Dharma, Tyāga, and Nigraha.   We should inculcate these things into the child. Then the child is fit for Vedānta. If you put the child to a tight discipline, there is a break point and the child runs away to other pleasures. That is why Vedānta has to be introduced gradually.

To conclude our today’s discussion:

Now we are convinced that we should always be happy under any circumstances. But we cannot be like that because we have known the truth only by theory.  Our system is not prepared for such an immediate transformation as we are heavily conditioned. System transformation does not happen simultaneously with this knowledge because of gathered vāsanā- that is the real problem Therefore mere śāstra paricaya is not sufficient, but a phase of sādhana is required to undo the accumulated forces, which are called saṁskāra-s or vāsanā-s.  Vāsanākṣya is required (dissolving the vāsanā-s) and that is a long drawn programme.  It may take many lives, but with continuous practice, improvement takes place and every decrease of vāsanā is increase of ānanda. Please take this point carefully and do not run to the conclusion that one day you will get that brāhmic state and till then the whole thing is absurd. It is a very confused position in Vedānta. Therefore, the thing what you have to look for is the increase of ānanda every day.  You should not hurry to get the brāhmic state. It will come by itself once you are ripe.


## SĀDHANA - PRACTICE



### NECESSITY FOR SĀDHANA

In these five lectures we have done a study on the theoretical part of vedānta**- वेदान्त**. This can be called śāstrabhāga -**शास्त्रभाग** or siddhānta -**सिद्धान्त -** portion. We can say we have covered the siddhānta portion, the logical aspect or the theoretical aspect so far. Let us deliberate on the practical aspect or the sādhana -**साधन**– portion of vedānta.

In the examination of self or ātmaparīkșā-**आत्मपरीक्षा**, two references were given, namely the Pañcakośaviveka **- पञ्चकोशविवेक**and the Avasthātrayaparīkșā **- अवस्थात्रयपरीक्षा**. They are two samples of prakriyā **- प्रक्रिया** - two methods of investigation.

Every Upanișad has one or two prakriyā-s. Irrespective of the methodology tried in the Upanișad, you could design your own prakriyā - one can design his own prakriyā to get convinced of the vedāntic truths. A modern mind has an advantage in designing a prakriyā because science has given it those advantages. Sureśvarācārya **- सुरेश्वराचार्य -  **a big thinker and a direct disciple of Śankara, makes this point that one should not be sticky about the prakriyā. It is not that pancakośaviveka_ _or the avasthātrayaparīkșā are the only two tools available.

**यया यया भवेत् पुंसां व्युत्पत्तिः प्रत्यगात्मनि।**

**सा सैव प्रक्रियेह स्यात् साध्वी सा चानवस्थिता॥**

**Yayā yayā bhavēt puṁsāṁ vyutpattiḥ pratyagātmani,**

**sā sā-ēva prakriyēha syāt sādhvī sā-ca- anavasthitā.**

Whatever methodology that can take you to the source or to your true nature, is accepted as a prakriyā. What a liberal thinking on his part! Do not say it is ancient or modern-sā sā eva prakriyā sādhvī-that itself is an honourable prakriyā. All that prakriyā has to do, is to take you to your true nature. If it serves the purpose then it is a prakriyā. There is no sanctity about it as it were.

In fact I myself proceeded on the following lines of investigation - What am I? I am a thinker. Am I always thinking? Obviously the answer is no. I have a thinking phase. But, I am not always thinking- all the 365 days, all the 24 hours. Therefore thinking is not my nature because I have a nature otherwise of it. Similarly, I am talking. Am I always talking? No. So what am I then? I am not talking is equally correct as I am talking. I am not thinking is equally correct as I am thinking. Every bit of my activity has a complimentary phase.

One more example- I am angry. Am I always angry? No. That means I have a no-angry phase.  I have a no activity phase also. I thought that I am always active, I am always a doer. But here is a ready proof that I am **equally a non-doer**. See the force of this argument. If you can understand this much, the Vedānta is understood and appreciated. Our first impression is that I am a doer because I am doing this or doing that at ever so many function centres. But equally so, I do not have that quality of doing always. I am listening but not always. So, my phases of existence wherein I am not listening, not eating, not sleeping, mean I that I am not doing these act always. **I am also a non-doer as much as I am a doer too**. Our weightage is on our doer’s role which we always thought is our nature. This notion of doer ship is weakened by the above logic. So, this is also a prakriyā, a simplified prakriyā. This not only re-sets values but also takes you to your svarūpa **- स्वरूप**. Why do you say this is your svarūpa? The study suggested in vedāntic tradition puts us into the new truth that I am as much a non doer as I am a doer.

Then the question would be why does one extol this non doing role? What is so extraordinary about that? This question also must be answered to one's satisfaction. The answer is, that this non doing is a comforting phase, as we discussed the other day. Vijñānakośa **- विज्ञानकोश**- is a toiling phase and ānandakośa is a comforting phase. You cannot belittle your non doing role. It is more precious than the āyāsasthāna **- आयासस्थान**. One can easily understand the difference between two convictions. I have this non doing phase which is viśrāntisthāna - **विश्रान्तिस्थान**- whereas the doing phase of mine is āyāsasthāna.** **While the former is a healing phase the later is a fatigue phase.

Putting this in another way- all that is necessary is to prove it to oneself the unimportance of thinking and uselessness of thinking. Our present notion is that thinking is a must, is useful and hence it is our real nature. You have to break these two positions by vichāra. That is all what Vedānta wants us to know. We have to show the hollowness of this equation by showing that happiness that one gets out of objects of enjoyment, content wise, is a state of quietness wherein mind becomes empty.

When you enjoy the ice-cream, ice-cream did not carry the element of joy. By a strange mechanism, it pushed the mind into the non- doing state for a short period. That is all the role of any bhogavastu. This parīkșa is necessary to get a conviction. We have over simplified the study by saying that ice cream gave us joy. It is a very superficial study**.**

<u>Ice cream gave you joy by shifting the energy from boredom centre which is our thinking centre or Ajnacakra, down to the tongue centre, thereby creating an emptiness at the thinking centre resulting in joy.</u> See the freshness of this study! **It was nothing but an agent to divert the bothering energy from ajñacakra-sthāna down to the concerned centre or the involved centre.**

If it is music, then the energy is drawn into the ear centre. Bulk of the energy is drawn away by the principle of resonance leaving a very small residue at the thinking or the mind centre. Therefore you are almost in a non thinking phase, non-doing phase. You are touching your emptiness and emptiness is sukha. This is to prove the unimportance of thinking. We went on glorifying the thinking phase (in performance) as very valuable tool and that is gone now. In fact, once you are convinced you begin to laugh at your earlier life style and conclude how foolish you were, how absurd you were, with all your brilliance and performance!We do not have to drop karma or activities, but, our inner values should change and that is the big difference. The gusto or the false importance goes and you become a new person. By some style of argument, you have to prove to yourself the limitation of necessity and usefulness of thinking**. **But the Vedānta shows that you have an option to this. It is not your nityadharma or your natural disposition.

At this point, it is appropriate to remember Śankara who has such a sharpness of thinking which no scientist would have had. He suggests a simple study in Śankarabhāșya, Bŗhadāraṇyaka Upanișad (4-3-20)

**तस्या अविद्यायाः किं स्वाभाविकत्वं आहोस्वित् काम कर्मादिवत् आगन्तुकत्वम्?**

**Tasyā avidyāyāḥ kiṁ svābhāvikatvaṁ āhōsvit kāma karmādivat āgantukatvam?**

Is, this thinking your natural dharma or superimposed dharma? This is all the study to be made. Avidyā is cognising, emotionally involving and doing. Avidyā, kāma, karma is the triple** **point. Is this your svabhāva-dharma or āgantuka-dharma? Svabhāva-dharma is the natural quality, āgantuka-dharma is something borrowed or superimposed. This line of thinking will solve the question. Hence:

**यदि च आगन्तुकत्वम् ततो विमोक्षः उपपद्यते।**

**Yadi ca āgantukatvam tatō vimōkṣaḥ upapadyatē.**

If it is borrowed from outside or if it comes and goes it can be dropped by the very definition. Otherwise:

**यदि स्वाभाविकत्वं मोक्षप्रसङ्गोपि नास्ति ।**

**Yadi svābhāvikatvaṁ mōkṣa-prasaṅgaḥ-api**

**na-asti.**

If anger, jealousy, disturbance, thinking were to be your natural quality nobody can take it away. No Śāstra can take it away because it is your natural quality. Whiteness is the natural quality of milk. You cannot think of milk without the whiteness. Similarly, thermal quality is the nityadharma of fire. You cannot think of the fire without the heat quality, without the heat component. Heat is the nityadharma of agni. If the qualities like anger etc are your nityadharma-s, it must conform to this definition. Anger is not nityadharma because it comes and goes. Thinking is not your nityadharma because it comes and goes. None of these attributes come under the category of nityadharma. So, you can drop it by the very definition. Yadi_ _āgantukatvam_ _vimokșaḥ_ _upapadyate_-_ thinking is droppable, and worrying is** **droppable.

All that one has to examine is just two minutes of study to check <u>whether it comes under the list of nityadharma or that of āropitadharma</u>. All our attributes are coming under the second category. Show me an attribute which is nityadharma of a human being. How sharp is this argument? I was sold over to the great thinker Śankara. That’s all Vedānta! One can forget ten Upanișad-s and  Śankarabhāșya. Deliverance**can come by this simple argument.**

Number of models could be arranged by a clever mind to show that one has a non-doing phase, and that is precious. Doing is not a must and doing is not absolutely valuable. Until this conviction comes, you cannot come out of suffering because the urge to do goes on and that is the load that we always carry. One cannot sit comfortably because, one keeps on thinking about doing. One has to break this burden, by the argument that non doing gave sukha and that is the one which will give ultimate happiness. This is the conviction that one gets by sādhana.

Does this mean that one should stop one's profession or earnings? We are not yet prepared for such an extreme step and till then one should slowly progress in the path of renunciation.

Since we have understood so much, our irritability must stop, jealousy must stop, our worries must stop. But this does not happen. With this mere understanding the mind or citta does not become quiet. This can be illustrated by the experiment we did in our college days-- the gathered momentum of the fly wheel. Fly wheel is a big mass and is on its ball bearings so that there is least friction. You turn the flywheel a few times and release it. It moves on for another ten minutes or so, long after the force is withdrawn

The same example is taken in Vedānta- **kulāla cakravat - कुलाल चक्रवत् -** the wheel of the potter which keeps moving even after he removes the driving stick. Similarly, the forces that have gathered in us have become so strongly conditioned, almost to a point of rigidity, that it cannot be erased by simply acquiring the knowledge about de-conditioning. Conditioning is what is called as VĀSANĀ. It is a very satisfactory explanation. Since man has been always thinking for many lives, thinking has become his nature. Habit has crystallised into a status of law. So this wisdom cannot cancel these forces. So, śāstra paricaya_ _alone is not sufficient. A phase of de-conditioning is very much needed. This is termed as VĀSANĀKșAYA. Forces are annihilated only if there is a very high degree of citta_ _śuddhi.

Only two examples of great men are quoted in parampara. They just listened from the teacher and they were in svarūpa. Garbhasthaḥ_ _Vāmadevavat - There was a R̥ṣi named Vāmadeva. While he was in his mother’s womb, he heard the Vedānta being talked outside from his father and when he was born, he was declared a Brahmajñāni. It was said similarly with Vyāsā’s son Śuka. He was by birth relaxed. Śankara gives a ruling in all such cases.  Śankarabhāșya (200) on GauḍapādaKārika, 3-40  states that:

**नोपचारः कथञ्चन इति अवोचाम ।**

**Nōpacāraḥ kathañcana iti avōcāma.**

In such cases no prescription or methodology is necessary. Sādhana is not necessary---**teșām śravaṇam - eva alam-** **तॆषं श्रवणमॆव अलं** - for them one listening will do and they are set in Svarūpa **–**

**अतः अन्ये योगिनः मार्गगाः हीनमध्यमदृष्टयः . . . मनसः निग्रहायत्तम् अभयं सर्वेषां योगिनाम् ॥**

**Ataḥ anyē yōginaḥ mārgagāḥ hīna madhyama dr̥ṣṭayaḥ . . .  manasaḥ nigrahāyattam abhayaṁ sarvēṣāṁ yōginām.**

What about others who have big stock of rajas and tamas? For such people a long drawn a sādhana programme is necessary**. **Gauḍapāda also affirms this in his following Kārika on Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad (Man. Up. 3, Ka.40)

**मनसो निग्रहायत्तम् अभयं सर्वयोगिनाम्।**

**दुःखक्षयः प्रबोधश्चाप्यक्षया शान्तिरेव च॥**

**Manasō nigrahāyattam abhayaṁ sarva-yōginām,**

**duḥkhakṣayaḥ prabōdhaḥ-ca-api-akṣayā śāntiḥ-ēva ca.**

For all of us manonigraha is required. Taming of the mind is required because mind is very much strong and bulky filled with rajas and tamas. So a process of sādhana is** **required.

I will now take up questions from you.

**Q.** What are Vāsanā-s?

**A.** Vāsana has two lakșaṇā-s. The first aspect is speed, that is, you are in a hurry at different functional centres. Rājasic man is structurally very fast. The second aspect of vāsana is focusing or having serious concern about a problem. The two put together sums up vāsana. When these two are brought down, vāsanākșaya begins to happen.

Vāsana is also spandana. Boredom is also a mere movement which is called as moola-avidyā or anādyavidyā - unspecific or unlabeled activity. The best English word for the vāsana is boredom according to me or mere helplessness, something which makes you uncomfortable. Every activity of man is to burn this energy that is accumulated in the ājñācakra or the thinking centre to become comfortable.  More often one talks away his boredom forces. The child cries away its boredom forces. Yoga-Vāsișţha puts it thus-

**वासना तानवं राम मोक्ष इत्युच्यते बुधैः।**

**पदार्थवासनादार्ढ्यं बन्ध इत्यभिधीयते॥**

**Vāsanā tānavaṁ rāma mōkṣa iti-ucyatē budhaiḥ,**

**Padārtha-vāsanā-dārḍhyaṁ bandha iti- abhidhīyatē.**   Yoga-Vāsișţha 1-3-58)

Thinning of tendencies is liberation, where as intense attachment to objects is bondage.

What is mokșa? To get rid of the boredom forces by gradually thinning them through sādhana.

**Q**. Don’t you think vāsanā-s are habits!?

**A.**Habits are nothing but conditioning gathered over a period of time. In any emotional situation there is destruction of vaiśālyata or the ākāśadharma due to narrowing to a constricted state which are called habits. In classical terminology, they are desire, rāga dveșa, krodha etc. Destruction of your vaiśālyata or the ākāśadharma is nothing but creation or point formation. Even Lord Brahma has to do tapas or fixing. The famous stanza from Taittirīya Upanișad (2-6-4) is as follows-

**सोऽकामयत बहु स्याम् प्रजायेयेति। स तपोऽतप्यत**।

**Saḥ-kāmayata bahu syām prajāyēyēti, sa tapō tapyata.**

Brahman thought that he had to focus to generate multitudes. So he started preparations.

**Q**. What does conditioning give rise to?

**A.** In the subtlest way it is boredom forces.

**Q.** Why we cannot sit for long hours without complaining?

**A.** We get tired even when we sit for half an hour. We say we are pressured. The sādhana is to soften this pressure because the conditioning has been so strong over the years. If you believe in rebirth, for hundreds of years you are conditioned to probe, focus, etc. The pressure of boredom forces has been amplified. Even though one has the knowledge about the fact of internal happiness, he goes after the objects of enjoyment because enough tapasya has not been done by him. That’s why siddhānta (theoritical knowledge) is not sufficient. Śāstra- paricaya is not sufficient. Sādhana phase is required. All traditions refer to a long drawn sādhana.

**Q.** How does jñāna help in vāsanākșaya?

**A.**Śāstra says or sampradāya says that the clarity or the conviction, about one’s own nature will start defeating the vāsanā-s. Śankara’s position is-- knowledge or conviction about sukha and duḥkha, will start defeating the whole range of Vāsanā-s. <u>The knowledge is imprinted on the memory centres at the sub conscious level and they go on operating even without one knowing it. </u>

**Q.** How the build-up of forces takes place?

**A.** We are all conditioned to involve ourselves in one or the other activity day in and day out. We cannot think of a person without any activity. Majority of us feel that it is a crime not to do any work. Although we have seen in detail that non doing is our svarūpa and that is the sukha sthāna, no person can be happy without doing. Even I cannot do that. Why? Due to the pressure of boredom forces, one is driven to activity. Everybody who says that he is doing work for so many good reasons is due to the fact that he cannot keep quiet. The proof for this is very simple. If I challenge you to sit quiet for ten minutes without doing anything, you may say that it is very easy. But if I ask you to remain quiet for half an hour, then you fail the test. Why? Yogaśāstra gives an answer to that point.

There is what is called a life force, a vital force or kundaliniśakti in us. It originates at the mulādhāra cakra and is continuously releasing the vital force or prāṇaśakti into the system, to every part of the body. It flows up into the higher centres or the urdhvasthāna, and comes to Ājñācakra (the thinking centre or the seat of the intellect) and develops a pressure. If the rates at which the energy produced and expended are not equal, one develops pressure which can be termed as the boredom force. And the pressure so developed drives you into activity. This is the most reasonable explanation.** **

**Q.** What is the difference between Vāsanākșaya, Manonāśa and ātmābodha?

**A.** There is an interesting stanza from Yoga-Vāsișţa. He uses three terms - vāsanākșaya-manonāśa - ātmabodha. We can understand Vāsanākșaya as vēga (speed) coming down. Manonāśa is the elimination of involuntary formation of pictures and sound. This is possible by defocusing. What is ātmabodha beyond these two? Ātmabodha is the vistārata or un-broken oneness property of self.

**समकालं समभ्यस्ता भवन्ति फलदा मुनेः।**

**एकैकशो निषेव्यन्ते यद्येते चिरमप्यलम्॥**

**Samakālaṁ samabhyastā bhavanti phaladā munēḥ,**

**ēkaikaśō niṣēvyantē yadyētē ciram-apyalam.**

(Yoga-Vāsișţa 5-10-116, 117)

<u>One has to practice all the three simultaneously</u>.

I can merely keep focusing without any creation (that is, without picture and sound). Here vāsanākșaya has not happened but manonāśa has happened.

I could be slow and still keep focusing in the background of vistārata. Then both manonāśa and vāsanākșaya have happened.

For the karmakāndin who is busy doing Yajña, japa and other religious activities, vāsanākșaya is happening considerably this way without even his knowledge. He is slow in arranging the things required for the Yajña. Although he has slowed down, he is capturing details. He has not removed the focusing. Manonāśa has not happened.

Let us repeat this again: <u>When there is no picture formation manonāśa has happened. Suppose you do the focusing slowly, vāsanākșaya also happens. Still it is not the ultimate.</u>

Ātma is omnipresent - has the property of everywhereness. Localisation is the opposite of everywhereness. Although there is sam<u>ā</u>dh<u>ā</u>na for a Karmakāṇḍin, non-localisation has not happened.

As long as you do not overcome the defect of localization you cannot attain brahma although you may be happy and peaceful. In meditation we may have reduced speed but we are still in the attention mood (focussing mood). That is why most of the meditators will be watching time waiting to get up. For years people meditate but are unable to get the bliss that has to be got. The missing element - **let go**- should happen. When that starts, tons of comfort is possible. The missing state is the expansiveness-which in other terms called as ātmabodha.

Once this is recognized, the faculty opens and **let go** happens. That is the most difficult thing to do. For this, we have to practice vairāgya and udāsīnabhāva together. It is a matter of time and experience.

So, to put things in a nutshell, accept whatever method suits you, pursue that method which puts your mind in a peaceful state.



### METHODS OF SĀDHANA

Now, we will look into details about the different methods of sādhana. We will elaborate four principle methods which lead us to the state of happiness. They are Yogamārga, Jñanamārga, Śubhakarmamārga and Prema and Bhaktimārga. An important point to be noted here is that all these mārgā-s have no distinct demarcations. They overlap and sometimes merge into the other. The purpose of elaborating them under different titles is to give you an idea of their distinct features.

**YOGAMĀRGA AND JÑĀNAMĀRGA**

The Yogamārga is a path of action. Jñanamārga is the path of right understanding. Patanjali, in his yoga sutra says:

**योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः**। - **yōgaḥ-citta-vr̥tti-nirōdhaḥ**

This is the first sutra. Yoga is to quieten the mind, to soften the mind or to mellow the mind. How do you achieve this?

**अभ्यासवैराग्याभ्याम् तन्निरोधः।**

**Abhyāsa-vairāgyābhyām-tannirōdhaḥ**.

This second sutra is an answer to the first one. He lays down the premises. Two techniques are suggested- abhyāsa_ and _vairāgya_._

The same point as it were, is bodily passed on in Bhagavad-Ġīta. Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna to practice **manonigraha—**to tame the mind. But Arjuna is confused—

**चञ्चलं हि मनः कृष्ण प्रमाथि बलवद्धृढम्।**

**तस्याहम् निग्रहं मन्ये वायोरिव सुदुष्करम्॥**

**Cañcalaṁ hi manaḥ kr̥ṣṇa pramāthi balavat-dhr̥ḍham,**

**Tasya-aham nigrahaṁ manyē vāyōriva suduṣkaram.**(Bhagavad-Ġīta, 6-34)

Arjuna says it is very difficult to do that- he would rather be able to tame the wind rather than the mind. Kṛṣṇa agrees with him and says-

**असंशयं महाबाहो मनो दुर्निग्रहं चलम्।**

**अभ्यासेन तु कौंतेय वैराग्येण च गृह्यते॥**

**Asaṁśayaṁ mahābāhō manō durnigrahaṁ calam,**

**abhyāsēna tu kauṁtēya vairāgyēṇa ca gr̥hyatē.**

(Bhagavad-Ġīta, 6-35)** **

There is no doubt that mind is very unsteady, very fickle and it is very difficult to subdue it. Mind can be subdued by abhyāsa_ and _vairāgya. Whatever Pathanjali said, the very thought is here -- to show the consistency in tradition is maintained-

What is abhyāsa and what is vairāgya? Abhyāsa is actually taming the forces. Vairāgya is vedāntavicāra- or renunciation born out of vicāra.

This thought is made even clearer in Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa. Rāma asked the question as to how to tame the mind? Vāsiṣṭa says-

**द्वौ क्रमौ चित्तनाशाय योगो ज्ञानं च राघव ।**

**योगस्तद्वृत्तिरोधो हि ज्ञानं सम्यगवेक्षणम् ॥**

**Dvau kramau citta-nāśāya yōgō jñānaṁ ca rāghava,**

**yōgaḥ tat-vr̥tti-rōdhō hi jñānaṁ samyak avēkṣaṇam.** (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha, 5-9-72)

My dear Rāma, there are two methods for quietening the mind, for purifying the mind. What are they? They are Yoga and Jñāna. Suppose there is speed and disturbance of mind. In Yogamārga you slow it down by riding on it. Whereas in Jñnānamārga you slow down with right understanding. This definition is more comfortable and convenient. So, Jñāna is right understanding of things, thereby replacing wrong notions by correct notions. That is the jñānamārga which results in renunciation of wrong values which is VAIRĀGYA in the real sense.


#### JÑĀNA-MĀRGA (PATH OF KNOWLEDGE)

Jñanamarga, as Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa’s definition goes, is**samyak** **avekṣaṇam-** whatever wrong notions we have, about the nature of sukha and about our own nature, we correct them by right ideas. This is the safest method and is most productive. A sick person can do that, a paralytic patient can do that, a woman with a child can do that, a suckling mother can do that, a boy can do that because there is no toil in this process and there is no struggle. By simple suggestions, one can counter duḥkha.

By correct counselling, by auto suggestions, one can achieve the desired results. Therefore it is the easiest, safest but most productive. When the mind slips into disturbance, advise the mind to become quiet. You can do that when you are in a train; you can do that when you are driving, you can do that when you are in the office. When you get a stroke of annoyance tell yourself that annoyance is not necessary and is not your true nature.

Our system is equipped with these two tools. By a long practice of suggestion, one removes the forces inside and by applying the principle of LET GO one is able to conquer the mind**.**Our system can change under the influence of suggestions. Whenever there is duḥkha in the form of speed, suggest to slowdown. Whenever there is increased focussing, suggest the system to undo** **the pressure built up at the ājñācakra by suggesting ‘let go’.

If you are comfortable with the speed in your profession, continue the same as long it is not burdensome to you. When the system complains, start using the method since it works wonderfully. Always remember the triple gems as we call them- **śravaṇa, Manana and Nididhyāsa** -**श्रवण, मनन, निदिधयास -**Śravaṇa is listening and forming a base thought. Manana is that where all secondary questions are sorted out. Nididhyāsa is the one where the process of softening, which has already begun due to sravaṇa and manana, culminates in the peaceful state**.**

Let us recollect briefly the discussion on sukha- duḥkha parīkṣa which will be relevant to sādhana. What is duḥkha per se? What is sukha per se? It is a few minutes of study for a bright mind. Plenty of sukha moments are there, plenty of duḥkha moments are there for us to study. One’s daughter has not returned home although it is quite late in the night, she may be in trouble and without help, resulting in anxiety, fear, uncertainty. Any duḥkha moment boils down to one thing and that is speed.

Another aspect of duḥkha is to get caught in a point. You try to solve a problem, you don’t get it, and you are in a confined state. In two universities your son has got admission. You start thinking as to which one is better? This gives rise to focussing, minding. This also causes duḥkha. We don’t see the wrong side of focussing, fortunately, because we more often focus and let go. I said there is a safety mechanism by which we let go the state of focussing automatically within a short time. Then we are safe. We don’t complain about focussing. You see the evil of focussing when it is overdone. Suppose you have a problem for which there is no remedy, you keep on focussing in its full version, its exaggerated version. Then there is a breakdown. All our mundane problems, all our professional problems are solved with the tool called focussing, concentration, ekāgrata_,_ one-pointedness. Research is possible because of focussing. There is no second say about it. But then, look at the other side of focussing and what problems it creates, says the śāstra.

That’s why at the first level of listening, we shouldn’t drop focussing abruptly. Understand that you are still in the performance stage. Start practicing Vedānta in the approximate way-strike a compromise. Do the focussing leisurely. Focussing is acceptable if slowness is tagged on to it. Focussing is burdensome when speedily done. Use your intelligence when performance is a must. You are not in a stage where you give up the worldly activities. You want the gains from the world. There is nothing wrong in going after mundane type of sukha. Vedānta is not preaching asceticism, remember that. On the other hand vedānta makes you fit for action when it is required. Arjuna did not run away after listening to Kṛṣṇa after all the preaching in the battlefield. He declared:-

**नष्टो मोहः स्मृतिर्लब्ध्वा त्वत्प्रसादान्मयाच्युत ।**

**स्थितोस्मि गतसंदेहः करिष्ये वचनं तव ॥**

**Naṣṭō mōhaḥ smr̥tiḥ-labdhvā tvat-prasādāt- mayā-acyuta,**

**sthitaḥ-asmi gata saṁdēhaḥ kariṣyē vacanaṁ tava.** (Bhagavad-Ġīta, 18-73)

My confidence is restored. My scruples are gone. My fears are gone. I can enter into the battlefield of life more effectively.

Therefore, one has to tag on to slowness when ekāgrata is a must, when performance is a must. The burden of focussing is reduced very much at that point. That’s the skill. And when speed is required, be in the expansive state. Or when you are expansive, speed does not become a point for complaint.

You know, when a cricket match is going on and when your side is scoring runs, you will be shouting. You will be up on your seat. But it is not taxing as you are in an expansive mood. If an athlete focuses totally on the thread line he has to reach, that builds up pressure and he will break down. Instead, if he keeps his mind relaxed his performance gets enhanced. **So any amount of focussing is acceptable for the system in the background of slowness** **and vice versa**.

I would always do that. My son and I would try to solve the chemistry problems of our industry. I could hold on for a couple of hours, whereas he would be tired after one hour. He may be cleverer than me. But then I could hold on, because I go about the whole thing slowly whereas he is too fast or in confusion. Vedānta gives you tricks to become a better performer in your profession, may be medicine, may be engineering, may be teaching. If you apply that in your research work, qualitatively and quantitatively, your research will be of a higher order. Number of papers produced and the quality of papers will be decidedly superior. So, by understanding these points you should not be giving up focussing. Bhagavad-Ġīta puts this very nicely-**Yogaḥ karmasu kauśalam- योगः कर्मसु कौशलम्**. It is a cleverness with which we have to approach the whole problem**.**

**Here there is a question whether all these things are in one’s hands?**

The śāstra at once shows that it is certainly in one's hands. Everybody always feels that there is suffering because things around him are bad- boss is bad, child is bad, wife is bad, house is leaking etc-This is met wonderfully when śāstra says one has a**freedom**of operation and is not bound by circumstances. One does not have to bend down to the circumstances that make one so helpless. Śankarā’s enormous faith-

**कर्तुं अकर्तुं अन्यथा वा कर्तुं शक्यम्।**(Śankarabhāṣya)

**Kartuṁ akartuṁ anyathā vā kartuṁ śakyam.**

Man is an extra ordinary species in the universe, unlike inanimate objects which do not have this freedom of decision. He has the ability to do what he feels is right. For example- he can sit or refuse to sit; he can talk or keep quiet- he has the operational freedom even to think or not to think. For the first time, in the evolution process, one sees the freedom element available only in man. So, one has to use this freedom diligently to attain peace. This point must be remembered or must be appreciated for his growth to be possible, for peace to increase. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa explains clearly as to what is mind-

**स्वयमेव पीनताम् याति स्वयमेव तानवं याति ।**

**~वा~ स्वयमेव प्रसरते स्वयमेव सङ्कोचमेति च ॥**

**Svayam-ēva pīnatām yāti svayam-ēva tānavaṁ yāti.**

**~vā~ svayam-ēva prasaratē svayam-ēva saṅkōcamēti ca.** (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa. 6-9-19)

It's an unusual species in the universe. It can magnify itself. It can quieten itself. It is not dictated by an external agency. All these years, you were under the belief that your psychological transactions were completely governed by stimulus response theory. Even psychology and psychiatry, nearly stayed by this notion, determinism**.** **Kārya-kāraṇa-sambandha-** **कार्यकारणसंबंध** - cause--result sequence. An abuse on me, I am disturbed. Praise on me, I am comfortable.

No, says śāstra. This is a vulnerable law as far as psychological transactions are concerned. It is true with physical laws. An apple when ripe, pulled by the force of gravity, has got to fall down. Not so with us. We can refuse to be affected internally by the outside world, is the key point in Vedānta. Nothing can touch us- a death, a sorrow, a failure, lack of recognition in society, ill health - major factors of discomfort need not just touch us. **Cidānanda-rūpaḥ śivohaṁ śivohaṁ- चिदानंदरूपः शिवोहम् शिवोहम्** -I am pure, I am auspicious, I am chinmātra, I am mere consciousness, untouched by situations- this is our brahmadharma_,_ and this is our ātmadharma. In fact, if you want me to define brahmadharma or ātmadharma** **–It is a state of inside which is not touched by anything in the world. You don’t know how profitable it would be when we apply it. It has a solution to all your problems, a subjective solution and therefore permanent. Other solutions are external, objective, and segmental. This is total, subjective, therefore fully in your control. Just use it. You are liberated. The beauty of Vedānta lies in its application. Six months you try this, you are a different person.

My friend, who is a post doctoral fellow, professor in the Institute in Bangalore, was a highly irritable person although he was a very talented person, a rank holder all his career. He used to get upset even for very silly things outside his domain and would lose control on him and would put himself in a miserable plight. Once he listened and appreciated the simple logic put forth by me and he at once shifted his focus and set himself right. He took the situation with utter calmness. He told me that. ‘Shastriji, I applied your method and it worked wonderfully’. That’s Vedānta. Vedānta is extraordinary because it is so convincing and logical.

Take for example the yogāsana posture -ardhamatysendrāsana- it did not defeat your forces of pressure in you. But, only LOGIC defeated your forces. A single correct logic is equal to hundred practices, equal to one thousand pūjā-s. Because, pūja is a mechanical activity. During the pūja time you are comfortable. Outside the pūja time, you have every reason to be fretting and fuming, to be upset. Therefore how can pūja help you? Pūja is wonderful. During the pūja hours there is piety, sacredness, a sense of purity, and you are quiet and fine. But your notion that one must get upset at every wrong situation has not changed. You see the difference. You see the dichotomy. A very religious person is relaxed and is calm during the religious hours. After the religious hours, he thinks he has every reason to get disturbed, to get angry. He spends lot of money to perform a religious function for some benefits and then blames that pūja did not give the results. How can ritualistic religion remove the problems related to wrong notions?

Let us take up righteous indignation! There is no argument in the world to drop righteous indignation. But, here is an argument in vedānta. Righteous indignation is anger which is reasonable. One has made a mistake and therefore I have a right to get annoyed and to scold him. Given the fact that one is unreasonable, why at all it should upset me? This is an argument known only in Vedānta. You should appreciate that. One is so structured that nothing can touch him. He is the master of his ceremonies. One’s mental state is very much in one’s hands. If you can ruminate on this and get convinced your life changes and this is all vedānta. With this knowledge you simply slide into immeasurable levels of peace and calmness and this is not an exaggeration.

One needs to start contemplating with oneself thus - I sit and I am disturbed. Why should thoughts come at all? I have the freedom to think or not to think. At every point I have freedom**.**The thoughts having come, why should they emotionally affect me? When you let the forces go, simply peace sets in. These are the two arguments to increase your peace.

I can illustrate many moments when we are disturbed. If my wife is talking more comfortably with people around, I am envious. ‘She is not that comfortable with me, she is so comfortable with others!’ is my mental thought. Small little things can upset your ego and you feel hurt. She takes me for granted but she is so comfortable with other male members in the group. These are subtle problems. Inferiority complex, jealousy, poignant forces squeeze you to desperation. You lose sleep for several days. Such forces can be melted away in one suggestion built on vedāntic truths that there is an inherent freedom inside you and that **freedom stuff is called ātmā.**

Now I will take up questions from you.

**Q.** Although I agree that we have control, there are certain times when we have to lose control?

**A.** When I say I have control I am just referring to that normal freedom. If there is tooth ache, I have no control over the pain. Freedom that I am referring to is at the psychological level. If you insult me, if you hurt me, I can refuse to react**.**

Don’t apply this law for the body problems like stomach ache, head ache, pain due to an injection etc. Most of our sufferings are psychological. The freedom that is referred is at the citta level, not at the body level. One should not make a mistake here. I agree with you that, the first stroke of anger cannot be controlled. But, with gradual and repeated application of this knowledge, one gets desired results. It may take months, years, and for some people never in this life. It all depends on one's state of mind and stock of Vāsanā-s.

What I want to impress here is that, one should use this method to soften one’s stand on various problems. Please understand that there is this freedom in you. Using it or not using is up to you. Most of the time we calm down by auto suggestion. That is the freedom I am referring to. Now I am applying this freedom at all levels. **This is all my sādhana.**

Thirty years ago, I was always concentrating. I was always researching. I defeated my horrible concentrating tendency by this argument. It is not your nityadharma as the śāstra puts it. It is an āropita dharma. It can come and go. Whatever is the āropita dharma, by the very definition, you can drop it. Your objection that it cannot be dropped overnight stands well. But the whole sādhana is excellently described by Kṛṣṇa in Bhagavad-Ġīta** **as:

**यतो यतो निश्चरति मनश्चञ्चलमस्थिरम् ।**

**ततस्ततो नियम्यैतादात्मन्येव वशं नयेत् ॥**

**Yatō yatō niścarati manaḥ-cañcalam asthiram,**

**tataḥ-tatō niyamya-ētāt-ātmani -eva vaśaṁ nayēt.**Bhagavad-Ġīta, 6-260

From whatever cause the restless and unsteady mind wanders away, let him refrain from that. Let him bring it under the control of self alone.

When mind goes vary, keep telling your mind that you will be steady; you will contain the forces. In course of time you will be able to attain manonigraha

**Q.** But we all live together in a family or society or workplace and encounter problems- when something goes wrong, particularly when it is not your fault, the annoyance is there. Even if you suppress it at that point, sometime later it throws up at some other point. What of that?

**A.** Not necessary- This again is the result of our conditioning. Therefore it shows up. Now you are not suppressing it, you have proved to yourself that, even when the other person is at fault, you don’t have to work up yourself. So this quietness is based on the knowledge of your independence, your freedom, your autonomy. In the earlier method, it was suppression for decorum sake- that means you have every reason to get disturbed but you are not doing that at that moment. You were holding the very act of response, whereas here you have no cause to get disturbed. This is the realisation that you got from the study. Other fellow is at fault and you get disturbed. Given that other fellow is at fault, why you should get upset is a thing not known to man. Ātma is swatantra_, _alipta, untouched by anything good or bad. This new knowledge makes it clear that **it is not suppression but it is sublimation**. Let there be hundred errors in the world around -that need not touch me-**asaṅgo ayaṁ puruśaḥ- असङ्गो अयं पुरुषः -**a big vedantic saying. I remain untouched- this is what you have realised.** **

**Q.** What about the instance when your children put you in that irritable mood. Then I have to react, in order to change him.

**A.** If the child keeps on doing mistakes, there you do the necessary correction**.**The whole śāstra is referring to the mental level. At the vyavahāra level you do any amount of correction without getting upset. Otherwise we make a mess of things. If a child is not corrected then the child is not rightly educated. We must tell that in many different ways like sāma, dāna, bheda, danḍa, and make the child understand. But, getting mentally worked up is not necessary

**Q.**More often we do the same mistake again and again although we know that it could have been the other way. Then the guilt feeling starts and this disturbs the whole pattern. What do you say for that?

**A.** It is for this main purpose of getting rid of the guilt feeling one resorts to sādhana. After all what is sādhana? One has to let go the feeling that one is insulted or talked lightly about. **One should not chew the cud.**One should develop a state of indifference to such acts which give rise to anger, hatred, etc. One should set the clock in the reverse direction and take things in such a way that it does not create imbalance in the system. We should not develop the guilt feeling at all. A bit of repentance is fine, but balance of mind should come immediately.

This should happen in the case of desires also. Slowly but steadily one should get that understanding. A mere knowledge that it can be washed out is not sufficient. That is why vāsanākṣaya takes place slowly. One has to wash this down slowly and steadily, like the damped oscillations of a pendulum. It does not come down suddenly, but slowly. We should not try to justify our anger but must take a different attitude of letting go the things**.**For a few days it works slowly and thereafter it simply jumps to a higher level. The best way of negating an incompatible situation is by putting a question to you as —SO WHAT? This line of approach automatically brings down the impact of unruly forces.

By auto suggestions, self counselling, gentle counselling, a time comes when the forces are all reduced-this is the manana portion. Repeatedly recalling what we have listened in śravaṇa is manana.

Whenever you trip, whenever you falter, whenever you lose your poise, apply this method and a stage comes when the vāsanākşaya happens so much that even the suggestion is not necessary. This is nididhyāsa - śravaṇa improves into manana and manana improves into nididhyāsa. Nididhyāsa is a gentle sitting wherein the forces are so low that** **you can just diffuse them.

**Ātmaparicaya - आत्मपरिचय**, **ātmābhyāsa - अत्माभ्यास and ātmaniṣṭha - आत्मनिष्ट -**are the three methods of identification for the progress.

**śravaṇa is_ _ātmāparichaya -**that is,** **identification of the true nature.

Then**manana is** **ātmābhyāsa -**repeatedly reminding the same.** **

And the steady state established through this process is**nididhyāsa**or**ātmāniṣṭha_._**

Sukhaparīkṣa showed you another big truth. While our notion was, sukha is in the objects of enjoyment, Śāstra asked us to examine the nature of that sukha as to what happened to the mind at that point of your enjoyment. It was very clear to all of us that the mind refuses to think at that point, mind does not want to think, mind is incapacitated to think. In the grandeur of the ānanda the mind rests. The mind becomes decomposed, thought free. Technically speaking, mind has reached nearer to the causal state; mind has reached its pūrvasvarūpa- ātmasvarūpa or the brahmasvarūpa.

But, bhogasukha gives momentary joy preceded by restlessness and succeeded by restlessness. It is fractionated, segmental, incomplete and admixed joy. **But we get a glimpse of that śāśvatasukha in this bhogasukha.** Therefore one has to see this welcome element and stay firm in it and then **drop the agency.**

**Q.** If I go to a person and tell him to try coffee as a tool for sukha he is not satisfied, as he basically does not like coffee. How to convince him?

**A.** That is easily answered. Coffee cannot give joy to everybody. One’s taste is what is important. To some, sweet is repulsion. You cannot take the example then. I have tried many different types of things to show that expenditure of energy takes place as per the model suggested by me when certain centres are activated. I would have a music put on. Of course, music of my choice, otherwise, resonance vibration would not happen. Just before listening to the music, I would watch myself how much restless I was. While listening to the music the restlessness goes. Why? The explanation is that the centre of hearing is expending the excess energy thereby giving relaxation at the mental level. If the music is stopped, then again pressure builds up soon. This is a proof that music pushed you to a no mind state resulting in joy.

Most of you know the wire and the tuning fork experiment. There is a distance between the vibrating body (the tuning fork) and the wire. If you take the tuning fork near the wire, then the wire vibrates in resonance. When the right matching frequency is there, a very large slice of the energy is shifted to the wire and it starts vibrating. If we place a small piece of paper on the wire, the paper flies off to show that the wire is vibrating.

**Q**: What about Boredom?

**A.** As we saw earlier, when the music is applied comfort sets in because boredom force is burnt away by the principle of resonance vibration as demonstrated in the above experiment. A very large slice of the energy can be drawn away. Śṛuti and the Vedānta have explored this very well.

Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad makes a beautiful comment. Why don’t you watch the happiness of sex, which is the highest happiness in the esteem of man? The Upaniṣad makes a point.

**तद्यथा प्रियया स्त्रिया सम्परिष्वक्तो ।**

**न बाह्यं किञ्चन वेद नान्तरम् ॥**(Bṛh. Upa, 4-3-21)** **

**Tadyathā priyayā striyā sampariṣvaktō,**

**na bāhyaṁ kiñcana vēda nāntaram.**

The best of sukha is the laingikasukha. But why don’t you see the mechanism involved? What courage on the part of vedantic scientist? How did the woman give you joy? Or, what did the woman give you in the name of joy? She put you into the no-thinking state.

**Na bāhyaṁ kiñcana vēda -**You know nothing of the outside. Hundreds of problems bothering you do not touch you at that moment.

**Na antaraṁ kiñcana vēda -**You know nothing of the inside. I mean, you don’t even study the mechanism because that will take away the joy.

**एषोऽस्य परम आनन्दः, एषास्य परमा गतिः।**

**ēṣaḥ-asya parama ānandaḥ, ēṣāsya paramā gatiḥ.** (Bṛh. Upa, 4-3-21)** **

This is your exalted state. This is your richest state -world doesn’t exist for you. You are a zero inside. There is a vacuum. The knower, the known, and the knowing process are all dissolved. **Tripuṭināśa-त्रिपुटिनाश**has happened. It is a sheer emptiness. In ever so many ways it is showing you what is that **ānandasthiti** which is nothing but an expansion inside.

**Q.**Why one cannot have śāśvatasukha by involving more and more of bhoga?

**A.** If taking coffee leads you to brahmasukha, then why don’t you have more and more of coffee? Why don’t you have more sweets in order to get that brahmasukha continuously? The answer lies here. **Although bhogasukha works by this mechanism, it has a defect. It is short lived.** This shifting of the energy is only temporary. Every indriya has a limit point to draw or shift the energy to its respective centre. The first sweet is remarkable, the second sweet is acceptable, and the third sweet is repulsive. Even at the cost of annoying the host you say, ‘sorry I cannot take it’, why? The system cannot manage. The tongue fails to draw that energy. At that point, the energy goes back into its original place, the ajnācakra and again you become restless. That is the reason why bhogasukha is short lived. During bhogasukha, preceded by a disturbed state and succeeded by a disturbed state, for a small interval of time in between, the mind quietens.

If you can reduce the creation and the release of energy itself, the permanent effect remains. Without this ineffective method of shifting the energy to another indriya centre, if you can naturally reduce the release of energy itself by slowing down (adopting naidhānya way), then you can naturally expand your shell which is vistārata

In a small sphere, the amount of thrust or the hit on the unit area is more. That's simple physics. Suppose the sphere is very big, the same thrust or hit on a much bigger sphere is much smaller. Distributed over a larger area, you don’t feel the burden at all.

So, apply the rule of **naidhānya - नैधान्य**, apply the principle of **vistāratā**- **विस्तारता_ or _vaishālyatā**- **वैशाल्यता**. Then the boredom forces are automatically absorbed or swallowed away and you don’t complain at all. This is a permanent method to be always happy.

**So, a vedāntin is not running away from bhoga for ascetic reasons. He, as a happy person, can be in vistārata with or without bhoga.**

**Q**. What happens if we reject objects of bhoga?

**A**. We shouldn’t do that. We would injure the system. We need not stop taking sweets, etc. All this is necessary. Abruptly we cannot stop bhoga. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa gives us a very good wisdom. In the first phase of sādhana one should do 25% of this vicāra 75% of bhoga and at the second phase 50% of this vicāra and 50% of bhoga and at the third phase 25% of bhoga 75% of vicāra is to be practised. At the final stage one can always keep quiet depending upon his level of cittaśuddhi.

**Q.** Does viśayasukha or bhogasukha alone is the contributing aspect of gaining peace of mind?

**A.** This is another good objection on sukha. But it is the peace of mind that is referred to as sukha in the tradition. Actually in our viśayasukha moment, although the penultimate position is in excitement, the real point is in peace. We are tempted to say that this excitement is a sukha element. The penultimate centres are in excited state and therefore one is tempted to conclude that sukha carries the element of excitement. But the real thing is that the penultimate position, that is the taditarasthāna as we put it in Sanskrit, is in excitement whereas the samīpasthāna_ _or the ultimate position has an expansion which constitutes peace.

Our difficulty really is, when we are talking about happiness, we are just using words, but we do not know what happiness is in rich measure. That is why recapitulation of content of sukha is not possible, as we deal only in words saying that ānanda is bliss. The best of ānanda we know is the nidrā phase. So, if you can get a feel of that ānanda, in wakeful hours, then you come into real touch of that state.

Some time it happens. Profit by that, says the śāstra. Irrespective of the moments when you have a high measure of peace and satisfaction, you are becoming familiar with that quality of mind which is close to brahmasukha_._ Why not continue to stay like that. Gauḍapāda puts it beautifully in Kārika, 44, Chapter 3 of Māṇ. Up:

**लये सम्बोधयेत् चित्तं विक्षिप्तम् शमयेत्पुनः।**

**सकषायं विजानीयात् समप्राप्तं न चालयेत् ॥**

**Layē sambōdhayēt cittaṁ vikṣiptam śamayēt punaḥ,**

**sakaṣāyaṁ vijānīyāt samaprāptaṁ na cālayēt.**

(If the mind becomes inactive, arouse it from laya; if distracted, make it tranquil. Understand the nature of the mind when it contains the seed of attachment. When the mind has attained equanimity, do not disturb it again.)

When you get that tranquillity, hold on, do not disturb that. Then it is a mahāsādhana. There are hundreds of occasions like going to pilgrimage, going to a forest side, going to a river bed, going to temples etc where you put yourself into that calm state. So, any occasion which gives peace in the heightened measure makes recollection of that state easy.

**Q**. While one is practicing this method and attain a reasonable amount of purity of mind devoid of anger and jealousy, external forces like selfishness of people around you, dishonesty, unfaithfulness, etc may disturb you from time to time. How to come out of this?

**A**. The answer to this is given in** **Chāndogya Upaniṣad:

**सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म तज्जलानीति शान्त उपासीत ।**

**Sarvaṁ khalu-idaṁ brahma tajjalānīti śānta upāsīta.** (Chāndogya Upa 3-14-11)

Everything is verily Brahman. Contemplate, with devotion, on its creation, sustenance and dissolution.

There is nothing like wrong, filth or foul, everything is brahma. Pettiness is an activity version of Brahma. Dishonesty is an activity version of Brahma. Unfaithfulness is an activity version of Brahma--the same pure Brahman is manifested in those phases there. Everything is the functioning version of Brahma. Therefore it is respectable, worthy of salutation. When one takes this stand then complaining goes. Unless complaining goes, you cannot be comforted.

You are fine with yourself. But, when you see all these around, within the family and outside, do not get disturbed by it. If you ask me how performance can go on in such a state, you do the necessary interference and corrections but keep in mind that the same pure Brahma has become all this. In Rudra mantra and Devi- stuti, you will find that salutation to all types of people. The hint from the śāstra is that you cannot accuse any one- you cannot find fault with others- then the satisfaction comes automatically. Śankara’ puts it as:

**कामक्रोधरहित आसन् उपासीत ।**

**Kāma-krōdha-rahita āsan upāsīta.**

Worship the world and the various forces therein without any attachment or dejection.

So, this additional information should be remembered by the students who take to Jñānamārga. It goes by the method of suggestion. You begin to operate gently at every situation in life.

**Q.**What is your opinion about meditation in order to attain the state of happiness?

**A.**Meditation, according to Vedānta, is comfortable sitting or relaxed sitting. One could always be happy as in nidrā where one spends six or seven hours without any worry or burden. Vedāntic meditation is non-focusing. You need not have even the support of omkāra or candle light gazing or things like that. Instead, sit and enjoy—

**एकान्ते सुखमास्यतां ।**

**परतरे चेतस्समाधीयताम् ॥**(Sādhanapañcaka, 5)

**Ēkāntē sukham-āsyatāṁ,**

**paratarē cētaḥ-samādhīyatām.**

Enjoy the blissful solitude, through equanimity of mind.

How easy! What a recommendation! You are asked to be comfortable- that’s all. If you are convinced of the vedantic truths, just relax so that every joint gets loosened, even at the muscular level, let alone at the mental level**. It looks funny but true.**That is meditation.

And if focusing comes, a small attention comes. Just advise yourself that it is not necessary and you begin to diffuse. You begin to get back your quality of expansiveness. Layers and layers of diffusion can happen with this way of relaxed sitting culminating in expansiveness.

**That is why, when people say that realisation is instantaneous and total, I have reservations about it and** **I feel that the expansion is a gradual process.**

**Q**. Are there different levels of expansion?

**A**. When you say, you are comfortable you have expanded from the focusing stage to a leisurely state. Even in nidrā or sleep, total expansion has not occurred. But, prāṇa spandana is there. Otherwise, why would the forces come back once you are awake? Relatively we are more expansive and the expansion can go on until cessation of prāṇa happens.

**अप्राणो ह्यमानाः शुभ्रो ह्यक्षरात् परतः परः।**

**A-prāṇō hi-amānāḥ śubhrō hi-akṣarāt parataḥ paraḥ.** (Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad, 2-1-2)** **

The glorious state of tuirīya is beyond the mind, prāṇa and the unmanifeseted.

What are you?--no prānic vyāpti at all, no cittavyāpāra, no prāṇavyāpāra. That is the tuirīya state.

**Q.** Can you elaborate the difference between nidrā and turīya?

**A.** Śankara goes in detail as to why Nidrā is not the ultimate. Most people stop at Nidrā in the avsthātrayaparīkṣa. How does turīya differ from nidrā? For both the states, there is no cognition – there is no dwaithavyāpāra. There is absence of perceiving jagat and perceived jagat. Then why don’t you call nidrā itself as the ultimate? Gouḍapāda, in the Mānḍuklya Kārika beautifully answers this state-

**बीजनिद्रायुतः प्राज्ञः सा च तुर्ये न विद्यते ।**

**Bījanidrāyutaḥ prājñaḥ sā ca turyē na vidyatē.**

(Māṇ. Up 1, Kā. 13)

The seed of ignorance which is prevalent in sleep, is absent in tuirīya.

In nidrā, although a no mind state is reached, vyāpāra has not ceased. Triputi has gone- manovyāpāra has gone- but nonetheless you are in vyāpāra. Prāṇaspandana is there**.**Relative centres were perhaps blocked. Once these centres resume work again, you are very much in vyāpāra. You immediately ask for your bed coffee or rush for your news paper as soon as you get up--- all the forces are back in action. **You thought you were very quiet but the forces were all in the bīja or seed form, that is, in the form of small spandana or vibration**. You just slipped into sleep but, somehow and somewhere the forces were not tamed by a process. So you come back. Citta-laya had happened in nidrā_, _citta-nāśa had not happened.

How does the sādhaka then tackle this?--He begins to tame the forces and kills them. The forces are vanquished in the sādhana phase. Therefore there is no residue. There is nothing like coming back to any worldly desires. A man going to samādhi this way, when he comes back he is equally soft- that is all. This is called Jāgrannidrā. That’s the difference between nidrā and turīya. Śankara clearly explains the difference between nidrā and turīya thus in Śankarabhāṣya 22 on** **Kārika, 2 of  Māṇ. Up. 1

**दर्शनस्मरण एव हि मनः स्पन्दते। तदभावे हृद्येव अविशेषेण प्राणात्मना अवस्थानम् ।**

**Darśana-smaraṇa ēva hi manaḥ spandatē, tadabhāvē hr̥di-ēva aviśēṣēṇa prāṇa-ātmanā avasthānam.**

When the dream phase is not there, when the jāgrat phase is also not there, how do you exist?** **You are merely in the pulsating phase in nidrā. Chāndogya Upaniṣad (4-3-3) declares-

**स यदा स्वपिति प्राणमेव वागप्येति, चक्षुःप्राणं, श्रोत्रं प्राणं मनः प्राणं, प्राणोह्येवैतान् सर्वान् संवृङ्क्त इति ॥**

**Sa yadā svapiti prāṇaṁ-ēva vāk apyeti, cakṣuḥ prāṇaṁ, śrotraṁ prāṇaṁ, manaḥ prāṇaṁ iti-** **Prāṇo-hi-ēva-ētān sarvān samvṛṁkta iti.**

In nidrā, every activity has gone in to that general activity. Each specialized activity has taken a general version but has not been eliminated. Prāṇa has absorbed in its womb all the specialized activities like seeing, listening, talking, and thinking. But activity has not gone in nidrā. Therefore it comes back in the jāgṛt phase. By consciously taming the forces in jāgṛt never to re-appear again, you slip into turīya state.  Therefore a jñāni cannot become angry again, since anger has been conquered consciously-boredom has been conquered consciously-focusing has become diffused, over a phase of sādhana.

**Q.** Are we afraid of the state of Turīya?

**A.** Yes... Man is afraid of that utter non doing state. That is why one has to take things in a gentle way. My own definition of turīya is—it is a state where Jāgṛt is not amplified, nidrā is not amplified. But, that is the source from which general activity and specialized activities have sprouted. In the wakeful hours you sit and say to yourself not to worry, not to excite yourself and by such auto suggestions you reach turīya. That will be conscious undoing of forces which you have not done when you go to sleep.

Over a period of sādhana, even the verbal version, I am fine, I am not doing anything must also stop. In Nidrā we don’t have the feeling that we are happy. Obviously both the verbal version and the pictorial version stop thereby a process of slowing and softening occurs. That is why we should not be bothered about the ultimate position. That is only for academic reference.

**Q.** What do you mean by existence of thoughts in verbal or pictorial way?

**A.** Thought can exist in only two forms- pictorial version or the audio version, i.e., the verbal version. For example, when I say that I am going to Bangalore-it could be my Bangalore house. Bangalore is reduced to śabdarūpa or the citrarūpa. If you analyse still further- you may not have these two details in the mind. But you may be in the process of forming a thought which is called**Cetyonmukhata -**in a mood to know, in the process of crystallizing into a thought which can be called in my words as ‘CONING’. One can be in coning state without getting a picture or a sound for a thought to shape itself. Even that is a duḥkha sthāna. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha explains the cit_ and _cētya aspects very well:

**चेतश्चेत्योन्मुखत्वेन दुःखायायमहं स्थितः**।

**cētaḥ-cētyōnmukhatvēna duḥkhāyāyamahaṁ sthitaḥ**.   (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha. 6-9-382)

**Cit**is svarūpa** -**a diffused version of you.

**Cetya**is the one which has shaped itself in to objects**- Nāma, rūpa, karma-**picture or sound or a movement.

In between these two there is a process called **Cetyonmukhata-**in the process of shaping itself in to a thought. If Cētya has not set in, then whatever you are I (ego) - the creating phase, the attentive I--the suffering I, taxing I, tiring I. It is the jnātṛ. In nidrā this I is dropped. <u>But it is not the ultimate **‘I’** </u>

What a penetration as a scientist -Coning takes shape while formation of each thought. When the coning effect is not there, that is to say, when thoughts are not coming at all, that is the state of comfort. <u>We should sit for meditation in such a way that concentration/attention should be absent.</u> <u>Then only meditation becomes comfortable.</u>

**Q.** Why is coning not comfortable?

**A.** Because you are in the knowing phase, you should drop that knowing phase also. If you ask any person who sits for meditation, he is bound to say that he gets disturbed after ten minutes, because this knowing phase itself is burdensome. That should go in order to get ānanda or bliss in any meditation.

A child doesn’t stare. A child is not educated into staring at you- that’s the beautiful thing. If you look through an Ophthalmoscope into such eyes it shows a diffused look. We actually train the child to stare and spoil the diffusion of the child. Instead of diffusion the child develops the habit of looking into details only to observe things.

**नाल्पेसुखमस्ति भूमैव सुखं । –**(Chāndogya Upa 7-23)

**Na-alpē-sukham-asti bhūmaiva sukhaṁ.**

Bhūma is stretched state. Ānanda is not in looking at small things. But science says that you should look into small details. But Vedānta says otherwise. If you want ānanda, drop this habit of looking at small things. The indriyā-s are used to focussing. Attention is the pre state of every thought. Even in meditation, if you sit in a concerned way as to know who you are, then it is burdensome. IF you GIVE UP THAT concern, then, that is ānanda. One has to let things go or let thoughts go, and then only one can progress further. This is the truth, but it is anti performance as per science. It is a hard fact.

**Q.** Is there any upāsana mentioned in the Upaniṣads for the practice of meditation?

**A.** A very interesting incident is narrated in Chāndogya Upaniṣad wherein methods of sādhana or UPĀSANA are mentioned. It is, as it were, that the entire gamut of sādhana methods is put, in just five words.

A teacher is taking leave of his students after they have completed their course. One student however is left out and he is asked to wait. The student is very much pained and starts wondering if he had not satisfied the master.

The teacher goes out of the Āśrama for a few days and the student refuses to take food, as he is very much disturbed. He goes to the special room where agni upāsana takes place and sits quietly. Two or three days elapse and Agni which is burning in that room has a sense of guilt and offers a boon to alleviate the sin he has acquired by letting the student in Agnigṛha without food.

Agni announces- well, I give you a special wisdom as a compensation for the tapas you did so that you can liberate yourself.

**प्राणो ब्रह्म कं ब्रह्म खं ब्रह्म । -**(Chāndogya Upa. 4-10-4)

**Prāṇō brahma kaṁ brahma khaṁ brahma.**

Prāṇa is the general activity- you can go to the origin by using the śabda version of the jagat and go on softening till a threshold point comes where you are omkāra-mātrā. That also silences itself into svarūpa. You can also have prāṇa as the activity of the jagat-like emotions and feelings which are not coming in the śabda format or the dṛṣya format. To soften these, you have to do **prāṇopāsana-** by softening the prāṇavyāpara to such a level as to reach the no mind state. This is **Prāṇo hi Brahma**. Drop all complexities of the verbal version or the word version and try to stay in omkāra and you will soon be in svarūpa. Prāṇopāsana is to quench the śabda version of the jagat.

The next is** Khaṁ brahma.** Khaṁ means ākāśa. Do the **ākāśa Upāsana**- that is handling the rūpa position. Details and multiplicities are to be reduced into a mere focusing state and then expansion has to be tried. Go by the picture way- and come to a point where you are just cognizing and then smash that cognition by letting go the point formation.

The next one is**kaṁ Brahma.**Ka is ānanda. What is svarūpa? ānanda mātrā--- effortlessness. Do the anusandhāna of ānanda. **Ānanda upāsana** is to remain happy and contented at all times, relax and be at ease, even when unpleasant things are there.

That is the real prescription to a sādhaka. These are inner sādhana methods one has to take up relentlessly.


#### YOGA MĀRGA (PATH OF YOGA)

**Yogaḥ citta** **vṛtti nirodhaḥ**as per Patanjali. **yogo cittarodhohi-**as per Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha.  In the later, through suggestions you are softening the mind and purifying it, whereas in the former, you are actually controlling the forces. I hope you see the slight difference there. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha further declares that:

**मनः प्रशमनोपायो योग इत्यभिधीयते ।**

**Manaḥ praśamanōpāyō yōga iti-abhidhīyatē.**

(Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha 3-9-132)

Mellowing the mind is termed as yoga. It is tuning the mind from the harsh state to gentle state. So, sit and quieten the mind. You decide an interval of time where your duty calls would not come and disturb you. That is the skill with which you have to work. You have to be in a relaxed state for attaining peace.

One could ask this question as to whether it is possible to soften the mind by suggestion.

Yes, it is possible. For example, when you are walking, you are fast and ahead of your wife and your wife asks you to walk slowly and you immediately start walking slowly. How did you change from walking fast to walking slow? Yoga method is naturally available in the system. This system is capable of yoga method as it is capable of adopting Jñānamārga. Both methods are compatible with human system. Manipulations are possible. You can vary the rate of the forces inside. A doctor comes to you- wants to examine the chest for inflammation and he puts the stethoscope and asks you to take deep breath. How did you vary your breathing? You did that under the instruction from a doctor. This is a facility available at all functional centers of the human system.

**Let us study the vāksthāna-**that is the place from where sounds emanate. It is possible to stretch (elongate) the śabda or sound and go to the moola or its root until a sentence decomposes into words, words decompose into letters, letters decompose into OM, and then OM decomposes into silence.. Through śabda, as a vehicle, you can apply the slowing process, until you touch the origin. Remember the famous sentence of Shri Rāmakṛṣḥṇa Paramahamsa.** **Sandhyā merges into gāyathri, gāyathri merges into OM and OM merges into silence.

This is beautifully shown in Mānḍūkya Upaniṣad while dealing with parts of OMKĀRA- **Akāra** as crude,**Ukāra** as sutler, **Makāra** still sutler. Then the Upaniṣad says- **amātraḥ charthopādaḥ-**there is the unuttered sound. That means, it goes to the pre state, a very sūkṣma phase, then it becomes silence- just the idea of touching the origin or swarūpa.

The next centre is the**respiration centre-**śvāsa-sthāna. Wonderful tool because it is coarse and is workable. Respiration for most of us is random, irregular and if one starts regulating the same- through the famous Nāḍiśuddhi Prāṇāyāma you get your stillness. Even hidden cellular disturbances vanish with the practice of simple nāḍiŚuddhi prāṇāyāma. The process of nāḍiśuddhi pranāyāma has to be acquired from a person who has a good knowledge about it. One should not try without guidance, otherwise one may harm oneself.

These are more external, grosser, and easier for the average man. Each one is excellent in its application, in its benefits. Much of your physiological problems are solved. In addition to giving you the peace required, the grandeur of the practice is, that all other centres get purified if one centre is taken care of**.** The inner vega is changed into naidhānya. Spiritual growth happens in you.

**Q.** Can we work on the breathing coupled with expansion techniques?

**A.** When the system is conducive, you can work. It cannot be a single tool. It can be all combinations. The whole point is that mind should become zero. It is not that some tools are superior and some tools are inferior. Anything is useful.

**Q.** Naidhānya as you say is to reduce the release of energy. Can we not do that at the breathing level?

**A.** Generally respiration is irregular. How to cultivate the slowness at the crude centre, the nostrils? Take the breath slowly, hold it and then release it slowly. After a few months of practice, you start breathing slow automatically. But the śāstra says that all this is not necessary. One has to mentally slow down. Then everything falls in place. One can recite Gayatri Mantra very fast or... could be recited leisurely. One can incorporate slowness at the talk centre or at the respiration centre.

**Q.** No doubt fastness of mind is troubling us. Fear of slowing down the mind is actually causing the mind to be fast. Is it so?

**A.** This is the problem with people who complain when they_ don’t get sleep_. If it was one day of not getting sleep, then there is no problem. The next day he starts worrying about not getting sleep. When the worry or the fear about not getting sleep aggravates or exaggerates then, he should realize that, fear must go. That fear so created, develops a bigger fastness than the existing fastness. After two days of no sleep, he tends to conclude that his system may be damaged or he may be unfit to operate. And then, fear takes away the sleep all the more. First of all he must remove this fear. Not much happens if one loses sleep for many days. System can manage it. It has a cushion. A medical friend of mine told me that two hours of sleep per day is enough for any healthy person. Some people’s system learns to relax even in the wakeful hours and hence less sleep is sufficient.

Taking every vyāpāra as a holy one is a brahma sādhana. Every indriya vyāpāra is a mechanism by which the boredom forces get diffused resulting in a relaxed state. The sunken state turns into expansive state.

**सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म तज्जलानीति शान्त उपासीत ।**

**Sarvaṁ khalu-idaṁ brahma tajjalānīti śānta upāsīta.** (Chāndogya Upa 3-14-11)

**तज्जं तल्लं तदिति  - Tajjaṁ tallaṁ taditi.**

It is born out of silence. It ends in the silence and is sustained by the silence. Upāsīta-we must take the jagat very reverentially. We are always selecting, denouncing, criticising which we should put an end to.

**कालातिवाहनायैव विनोदाय क्रियोदिता ।**

**Kālātivāhanāya-ēva vinōdāya kriyā-uditā.**

(Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha. 6-9-244)

All these kṛyās are just there to pass time! One need not run away from life and vyāpāra. Every karmakāṇḍa prescription is to quench this vega. This would be the interpretation to the benefit of the karmakāṇḍin, who did not know this benefit. He thought that God is there and that He would give him some favour. But the other part of the story here is that chittaśuddhi is happening. Karmakāṇḍin is reaping the benefits of Vedānta automatically.


#### ŚUBHAKARMA (PIOUS NEUTRAL ACTIVITIES)

We have understood the main difference between Jñānamārga and Yogamārga and have studied the various methods that can be adopted to mellow the mind. The question arises now as to why we should look for other methods of sādhana when these two methods are more than sufficient to put us in the desired path.

If one carefully examines, these two paths are very difficult to adopt for common people like us who have great load of rajas and tamas compared to those who are advanced in their pursuit.

If one sits for meditation for long periods, pressure builds up at the ajnācakra and one feels like getting up. In fact if a fresher sits for meditation, in two minutes he wants to get up and be done with. That goes to prove that even two minutes of meditation is not possible. One may even end up getting headache.

If the mental composure is of that order for people like Vāmadeva or Śuka, the moment they listened to the truth they are in the state of samādhi. What about people like us then? Similarly applying yoga by slowing down the breath is also not easily possible.

That is why people like us should not try these methods unless we are under the guidance of a teacher. For most of us these methods work only in a limited way. Then how can we proceed? Is there no method for us?

When we come to sādhana, unless vāsanākşaya starts taking place in us, progress cannot be achieved. Every one of us including a sanyāsi who has given up worldly activities has to undertake continuous process of vāsanākşaya. For different people, stationed at various levels of progress, the teacher can only give the message. The student has to take up his own assessment as to where he stands in the path through extrapolation.

We all have a large stock of load or burden of vāsana that has accumulated over a long period and it is not easy for us to get a relaxed state unless we dissolve all forces like greed, anger, attachment, miserliness, jealousy and self pride. Since one overrides the other it is almost impossible for us to get away from them. Every time we make some progress, we seem to get back to the starting point. Unless serious efforts are put to contain these forces, it is not possible to get a relaxed state of mind.

Do not bother about how long it should be done. You should reach a stage where, even the questioning attitude should collapse. Udāsīnabhāva has to set in. Questioning is a severe state of mind. Searching is an energized state. By solving the question, the energy does not vanish. Only by dropping the question itself, the energy tones down. Both vāsanākṣaya and manonāśa are interdependent. We have to develop an attitude of let go of things to start from scratch.

Our ancient Rishis thought about all these and devised many simple methods to be adopted during our own life cycle to weed out the habits which are deep rooted in us. They made it mandatory for everyone to take up these programmes as a matter of discipline. They went to the extent of saying that these are ordained and not questionable. Hence they incorporated daily rituals like worship and meditation. The methods like performing rituals and offerings to God, creating many gods to suit every type of person and giving one the freedom to choose, were all meant for mellowing  the mind

All our activities are driven by rāga, dveṣa, bhaya, krodha, kāma etc. We are moulded into involving with wrong values due to loads of vāsanā-s or wrong conditioning. In view of this, we end up in generating more and more unruly forces getting very badly caught in the whirlpool of life. Karmakāṇḍa practices are devised in such a manner as not to be performed in a hurry. The objective is to gain slowness. The whole intention of karmakāṇḍa is to attain cittaśudhi. Knowing the implications of karmakāṇḍa and practicing the same or simply practicing without knowing the implication makes a mountain of difference.

All our ancestors, my father, my uncle, my grandfather, everybody was a karmaniṣṭha of a very high order. But, they were peaceful at the time of worship only. They would fret and fume the next moment after they are done with the rituals. That was because, they did not understand that the benefits gained from karmakāṇḍa had to be prolonged for a longer span. The peace they got from this was not continued by them, for lack of understanding of why and how of karmakāṇḍa methods.

The peace got during the karmakāṇḍa hours should percolate to the other hours also. Otherwise it has no meaning**.**Śankara’s position is very clear that all karmakāṇḍa methods are meant for purifying one’s own mind and nothing else**- Citta-śuddhyarthaṁ- चित्तशुद्ध्यर्थं.** So, karmakāṇḍa has to be practiced only for that gain and nothing more.

So, when you are unable to sit peacefully, get into an activity <u>like religious activity, pious activity, neutral activity, mechanical activity, any passive activity. </u>The Hindu mind showed its genius this way. Do not try to sit quiet, since sādhana will not happen forcibly. Engage yourself in activities which fulfil the condition suggested here. Whole of Hindu methodology and Hindu’s everyday life is built on doing sacred pūja, engaging in religious chanting, doing japa which are all **non- exciting**.

Everyone is spending his or her energy in eating, talking chatting, and so on—All these activities can be brought under the gamut of sādhana provided, you expend the energy in such activities <u>where the mind is not disturbed in the process</u>. All such activities can be called as NEUTRAL ACTIVITIES. That is all the prescription.

This is the most important portion of sādhana wherein karmakāṇḍa practices are to be re accepted. I have coined the word for this as **ŚUBHAKARMA.**

We are going to prove here that for vedāntic gains, karmakāṇḍa is the only way though it looks incompatible. When the stock of vāsana is more the only way to reduce the same is through karmakāṇḍa practices.** **You go back to japa, you go back to sahasranāma paṭhaṇa, and you go back to formal pūja. Once again, this primitive, trivial, seemingly absurd looking programme is what we have to go back to.

Jñānamārga would be inapplicable with students having big stock of rajas and tamas--even yogamārga cannot be applied. Then what is the solution for them? Do we not have a way out? And that is exactly where Indian genius has worked out wonderfully. The best of Indian research to me is the development of karmakāṇḍa details. The westerners mock at the way we have number of Gods, instead of one God. They even laugh at the idea of Gods having many wives and their children whom to be worshipped!

One can choose a god of one’s taste and preference. It is a plus point to Hinduism, not a minus point.** **I worship Lakshmi if I want wealth, I worship Sarasvati if I want scholarship. If I want a peaceful contemplating God, I choose Īśvara. I can design my god to suit my taste, and relate myself with the deity. This is the defence of karmakāṇḍa. The karmakāṇḍa, which is seemingly rejected, now comes as our saviour! Karmakāṇḍa caters to any human being, depending on his/her mental status. These are derived to reach the required goal. When a learned man is chanting the mantra-s with accurate intonation and one hears them, the result is a peaceful state. The peace that we have to acquire in the name of Brahmasādhana is achieved.


#### SĀKĀRADHYĀNA (MEDITATION ON A FORM)

We will now discuss the details of practice to be undertaken at each functional centre. Let us first take up the **CITTA**or the mind** **centre.

If you sit and start contemplating on Brahma (Nirguṇabrahma), you will only waste your time ending up in developing headache. Instead, have a picture of God of your choice and engage your mind on that. It is a wonderful tool in your hands. Now you relate yourself with your Iṣṭadevata. If you are a Hindu you have many gods to choose. If you are Christian, then keep a picture of Jesus or Mother Mary. A certain amount of sanctity is also established by that process which will be helpful. You can even think of your Guru. If both god and guru are not acceptable to you, then have a candle light to gaze. You are connected with a person or thing which <u>does not excite the mind</u>.

How can likes and dislikes play when you have connected yourself with a deity? Selfishness, hurry or dislike does not come to the mind. So, the citta gets purified and at the same time energy is spent away and emptiness sets in. The required gain is there because boredom forces are spent away in this way. That means, the levels of speed and focusing come down and you have an exponential expansion. Your expansive state of mind is automatically got.

Śubhakarma is the method we should adopt since we are not fully prepared for pursuing Jñānamārga or the Yogamārga. We are not fully prepared for the first two. If your system is prepared for yoga or prāṇāyāma then it is fine. In addition, spend some hours in sākāradhyāna to establish yourself firmly on the path. There is no Hindu family that doesn’t do these things. How can it be a ridiculous point about a culture, when examined in this light, as it takes you to near brāhmic state? If one understands this concept clearly, the shame associated with multi god concept vanishes.


#### JAPA (CHANTING OF HOLY NAME)

Till now we looked at the optical centre- a picture. The next centre is the **Śabdasthāna** or sound as a medium.

When you come down to the śabdasthāna, the same principle has to work that the bothering energy must be spent away and during that process mind is not excited. The prescription given under this centre is called **JAPA.** Continuous repetition of God’s name or a Mantra or a chosen word introduced at this centre is termed as japa

This is the one tool that every teacher recommends. Every religious school does prescribe japa. The internal process involved during japa is expending the bothering energy thereby resulting in the mind becoming calm. The teacher would ask the disciple to have a name as japa during meditation practice. The reason for prescribing japa was that it would make meditation easy. Incidentally the recitation process drew all the excess energy creating relaxation.

Japa is an activity at the throat centre where sounds originate and this results in spending away most of the energy. This is at a place lower to the mind centre. Much of the prāṇic energy that is coming to the mind centre is spent away at the throat centre itself. Thus, much less energy reaches the ājñā centre (Cittasthāna) resulting in expansion. That is all the science involved. There is no religious dogma here but all religions have incorporated this part of science.

Frequently asked questions on the practice of japa.

**Q.** Should the japa be long or should it be a short one?

**A.** In the beginning, use a longer phrase. It will yield better results. That was why Gāyatri mantra was prescribed at the beginning. More energy is required in chanting this long mantra. So, feeding of energy to a higher centre is reduced and expansion process starts. The chanting is the programme and expansion is the gain. Japa by itself is not important, but the resulting expansive state is important.

**Q.** Should it be recited loud or mentally?

**A.** In the beginning both can happen. After sometime it is better to do the japa mentally. This development will automatically come when you are steadfast in sādhana.

**Q**. Should the recitation of japa be fast or slow?

**A.** The system takes care of that one. When a sādhaka is disturbed due to circumstances, then automatically the chanting becomes faster. The system manages the speed of the japa. That is the natural law there. After ten minutes or so, when some energy is spent away, the system restoration takes place and japa goes on at the required pace.

**Q.** Should it be mono-syllable or multi-syllable?

**A.** To start with multi syllable is better than OM, till the attention improves.

**Q.** Should it be taken from a Guru or can one recite without the initiation from the Guru?

**A.** If you have the conviction about the mechanism, there is no need of any Guru. If you have a sense of guilt, then go to a teacher, pay his dakṣiṇa or fees and get it from him. That may give you the necessary devotion. Use your own discretion here. I did not take to any Guru, whereas my wife went to a guru! The main purpose of this initiation is to see that you do the japa regularly and not give up and to overcome a feeling of guilt or lack of devotion. Whatever be the programme, it is the result that is more important. Please remove the fear factor that God will punish you if you were to err in your religious practices. God is highly benevolent and helpful.

**Q.** Should the japa be done only in God’s room?

**A.** Please do it if you can, but it is not necessary. You can choose any place which should be disturbance free till you attain a level of sādhana. As you progress in the path, any amount of noise or disturbance or lack of cleanliness does not bother you. It is good to be disciplined in the beginning, to make sure you are installed in the practice of regular japa. Please remember that japa is only a tool and this is also not needed after you strengthen your conviction. If thoughts can be replaced by this pure word, where can rāga, dveṣa, kāma and krodha arise? Mundane thoughts must be replaced by japa, is the intention.

A lady came to me one day and said that she took my word in letter and spirit and started the recitation. Mental chanting had become so natural that she was unable to stop the japa even when she was in the toilet. This was her worry, whether it was a right thing. How blessed she was compared to any one of us, as her whole life has become japamātrā! This can happen to one in a million. I had to assure the lady that she is blessed so much and asked her to continue the same.

**Q**. I do not believe in God’s names at all and what other mantra should I use?

**A**. You can use any word for japa as long as it does not give harmful thoughts. Look at the science behind. There is no religion here. A portion of that bothering energy is to be spent in a pious way or in an unexciting way. That is all what is needed. That’s why I termed it as mechanical activity or meaningless activity. The rule to be served is that excitement must not be there in citta. Actually there is no religious sacredness here. If you could have sacredness, it could be an added point.

**Q.** Are you prescribing this for everybody? For example even for those people who say that there is no need to go to the temples or for those who say that they can see God within themselves?

**A.** In that case there should be some other mode of expenditure through any other neutral activity. Many people do not believe in going to temples. But there is nothing wrong in it. You have the alternatives like mechanical activity, repetitive activity-meaningless activity. It is like the same biblical saying asking one to count up to ten slowly- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10- when you are angry. While doing that, the bulk of the energy is spent away which would have otherwise given rise to anger and the reaction thereof. This is the remarkable vision of the rishis.

When you are placed in helpless situation take to some type of japa. It is a mahāsādhana as all mundane forces are dissolved. Forces like speed and focusing get dropped and mind starts dying.

Japa starts decomposing itself when you know that slowing has to be practiced and whatever japa that is being uttered reduces to Omkāra.

Shri Rāmakṛṣṇa has rightly said that sandhyāvandana merges into mere GAYATRI JAPA. Gayatri japa merges into OM and OM when stretched, merges into silence and that is svarūpa. Mānḍūkya Upaniṣad puts this as- amātraḥ Caturthaḥ pādaḥ-there is no activity or vyāpāra at all when silence sets in.** **

**Q.** What about mukti?

**A.** The point of importance is that we have reversed the direction. Bhagavad-Ġīta** **states:

**अनेकजन्म संसिद्धः ततो याति परां गतिम् ।**

**Anēka-janma saṁsiddhaḥ tatō yāti parāṁ gatim.**(6-45)

After many lives of vāsanākṣaya, purification starts and one attains the end point.

**बहूनाम् जन्मनामन्ते ज्ञानवान् माम् प्रपद्यते ।**

**Bahūnām janmanām antē jñānavān mām prapadyatē.**(7-19)

Even a Jñāni gets liberation after many many lives. That is the true position. We cannot underwrite that sādhana phase. But siddhānta is the base for sādhana; otherwise you have no base at all!

**Q.** If many more janmās are required for our liberation, in what way we are better than others?

**A.** We are better because we know things now about the process to become better human beings. Others may take twenty thousand lives without any improvement because they have no ways to see the difference. In fact one is spoiling oneself by getting more angry, more jealous and craving to get more and more material things. Once you get this Jñāna, craving for things gets controlled and there is a big shift in the process of evolution. How long it takes should not be a matter of concern or a point to be bothered about.**Our happiness today is better than that of yesterday. A week after it will be still better is the point to be appreciated.**

I could not continuously sit for a few minutes without any work at one point of time, but now, once I started this sādhana, I really enjoy sitting without any prop. I was getting worked up in ten minutes then but I can now sit comfortably for four hours over a period of sādhana. That means, it is possible to stay diffused once you are in the path of sādhana.

One load of kāma or desire lessened or one load of anger decreased, results in a ton of joy. That is a fact. But, whatever practice we adopt we should have the following in our mind: The elements of Naidhānya (slowing down) and Vistārata (defocusing) are to be brought in. Hurry and anxiety are to be totally avoided. <u>All our discussion and the various methods indicated mainly refer to MENTAL LEVEL</u>. Do not draw lines of demarcation between various types of sādhana-s. Each method is complementary and supplementary to others. Do not sit in watertight compartments. BECOME A REAL SĀDHAKA. The forces are so severe that we cannot tackle the entire stock by simply sitting. This stock of force is too big to manage and this is our problem. That is why both yogamārga and Jñānamārga fail.

**Q.** Is it not a fact that activity gives joy? If not, then what else?

**A.** The proof is very simple. Sit in the house without doing anything. That is the biggest test, to check whether you are growing in the vedāntic way or not. No wife to talk to. No kitchen where you can go and get some snacks. No music to listen to. Everybody in the world fails. Why?

This is the explanation. Continuously energy is being released. Fortunately for man, as quickly as it is released, he is expending it. The child cries away its energy. The fool talks away his energy. Man walks away his energy. A clever man thinks away his energy and therefore he is comfortable. He is spending in ever so many ways that the system becomes relaxed and therefore he is comfortable. And he gives credit to KARMA OR ACTIVITY, saying that Karma gave him joy. Spending of the energy is the only means by which you are becoming empty at the sūkṣmasthāna resulting in a no mind state. That’s giving you joy.

This is the way we are all happy. Karma is a means of expenditure of this unbearable energy. Once that is spent away, you are in the non-doing phase. You are in Amanībhāva, i.e. you reach the no-mind state. No-activity-state is the point of joy. Whereas our notion is 'karma gave us joy', 'bhoga gave me joy'. This is ignorance.

So the advice is not to hold the huge amount of these energy forces. That is why Karmakāṇḍa in Hindu tradition is highly placed. Śankara justifies this as it leads to cittaśuddhi.

Tradition gives you a simpler method. What is this principle? Don’t hold the forces. You will injure your system and the sādhana fails. Instead of becoming softer you become irritable. For many it has happened. Sampradāya says that one should not take up sanyāsa unless he or she is fit for that. It is good to go on with one's gṛhastha āsṛama. Do not deny the ānanda that life gives you and try by getting into a harder way. There is a simpler way

**Q** Whenever we practice these neutral activities, we are likely to step into acts of indifference or tamas. Don’t you think one has to be very careful while applying this method?

**A.** Whether it is indifference or lack of application is a matter of judgement. My answer to that question is- you can be dishonest to others and pretend. But you cannot be dishonest to yourself. If you want the fruits of the action, you should not act with laziness as it amounts to casual approach. One need not run away from profession in the name of Vedānta but carry on the duties removing the hurry element. Then you are growing in respect of peace. We are prone to become indifferent in the name of vairāgya. So we have to judge ourselves carefully.

**Q.**How do you really know if tamas gave you comfort or the sādhana?

**A.** Tamas gives comfort, but tamas is not lifting. We must come out of tamas and get into satva. These śubhakarmā-s are such that they remove the tamas. Along with the removal of rāga, dveṣa, they also remove the tamas. The japa, sahasranāma, aşţottara paṭhana, formal pūja, abhisheka, śodaśa pūja- all that keeps you awake and combat the tamas.

**Q** As per your earlier statement, I am more relaxed when I am in tamas. What you mean by this?

**A.** We can take the three phases of liquid as an example. Ice is a condensed form and is confinement representing Tamas. When it becomes liquid, mobility has already set in and this state represents Rajas. When the kinetic energy remarkably increases then it gets the form of water vapour which is expansive and this state represents Satva. When the vapour molecule ruptures then that results in vyāpakatva or anantatā.

Pṛthvi becomes āpa, āpa becomes vāyu and vāyu becomes ākāśa. Then it is pure self.

When any matter annihilates it gives out tremendous energy and when that energy spreads away it gives you silence.

I would like to repeat an excellent definition given by one of you the other day on sattva, rajas and tamas. Coming to human mind:

Desiring without acting is – **Tamas.**

Desiring with acting is ------ **Rajas.**

No desiring and acting is --- **Sattva.**

No desire and no activity is -**Turīya.**

**Q.** I had a similar difficulty. I do sahasranāma with whatever zeal I have. But somewhere in the corner of mind, I am being told that yogamārga is better for me. How will I know which mārga is good for me?

**A**. That is a good question. One has to decide for himself. For example I spend most of the time in solitude. Someone else may spend his time in work. You have to be careful not to get succumbed to sleep. You have to be alert and wakeful. Ultimately sādhakā has to tread the path carefully.

**Q.** Is it good to continue the same sādhana if it gives you happiness?

**A**. That is one good yardstick (mānadanḍa). The other test is to check whether peace and happiness have increased or not. If you are doing your sahasranāma, energy expenditure takes place and you are happy. But, is it also giving you progress in sādhana is an important point you have to test. The test is, when you sit quiet, you must be more comfortable and not pressured. Then the sādhanā-s are working. Ultimate test is –one should be comfortable without any prop what so ever. This is a very delicate question one should examine and the good point is -you should err on the safer side. Therefore do karma, instead of prematurely sitting and getting in to tamas even without your knowledge.




#### OTHER NEUTRAL ACTIVITIES

For some people,** **japa is not sufficient for expenditure of large amounts of energy. For them, still a courser activity is required for spending the stock of energy. Japa is inner articulation. For that reason, our ancestors suggested the use of loud chanting of names of the Lord. Again this is a neutral activity. They designed the Sandhyā-Vandana which was a still coarser method. Performance of this involves time, resulting in spending larger amounts of the bothering energy.

Hindus have the practice of offering Śodaśa Pūja to God every day. They have Aṣṭottara-Nāma-s or Sahasra-Nāmā-s for each Deity. They have a number of Vrata-s which are being celebrated throughout the year. Each such Vrata is having its own discipline and code for its performance resulting in expenditure of energy.

The above list is not exhaustive and Karmakāṇḍa is full of such practices giving plenty of choice to us. Since japa was an inner activity and was not sufficient, loud chanting would help drain the energy. This would not only clear stock of energy but also induces concentration. Om Keśavāya namaḥ etc. was incidental. If you can watch the ājñācakra while the chanting goes on you will find that you are in comfort.

Although our elders prescribed these methods, they could not explain why such an activity was needed since they did not understand the mechanism involved. They themselves would fret and fume once they were finished with the pūja hours. The citta that had gathered a small amount of peace during the pūja would be more than spoiled soon after they came out of pūja. The gains were lost and therefore big progress could not happen. Anger did not go, depression did not go, and complaining did not go due to lack of understanding. Now that we know this, we should make use of the methods suggested to attain peace within ourselves. If the student of karmakāṇḍa knew that he was doing the pūja for cittaśuddhi then he would have extended the peace that was generated during pūja and attain better mental state. Once he knows why he has to do pūja, then the whole problem is sorted out. Minus this knowledge it was only a local gain and not a complete gain.

If present generation gets such clarity of mind, what was thought as meaningless and incompatible religious practices, becomes beneficial and meaningful.

I laughed at Hinduism in my college days, ridiculed the gāyatri japa and all that. Now, I am the very fellow advocating gāyatri to everyone. A very big scientist from an Institute in Bangalore, who swore by Sartre and ridiculed everything that is in Hinduism, is now learning Puruṣasūkta and other mantra-s, once he got an exposure to this science of Vedānta and its importance. Concentrating on GOD is not as tiring as concentrating on a mundane thing because of the role of rāga and dveṣa in the latter and absence of it in the former. That has to be taken notice of. That is why ultimately when we come to sādhana, we shift from the unholy to the holy. If you keep thinking of God, violent emotions do not bother you, do not cripple** **you.

A famous Mexican philosopher who knew this point advised his student to get the lessons in non doing. How did he teach? He asked his student to walk around his house clasping both the hands, keeping them behind his back, thirty times in the morning, thirty times in the afternoon and thirty times in the evening. The student took this seriously and did as prescribed by his teacher for six months. This sort of neutral activity put the student in the phase of non doing.

**Q.** Even though I am doing japa and sahasranāma the mind is getting preoccupied. How to sort this out?

**A.** Do not bother. Because, the quantum of pre occupied energy which set the preoccupying thought, is one tenth now as nine tenths are spent in japa and thus its effect is much less now.

Please note that any mechanical activity, like sweeping the floor can be turned into Yoga when you cannot sit for mediation due to inner pressure. Everyone, including me becomes helpless at certain times and the point is to ignore the helplessness and proceed with sādhana. The rush for things has to go. Vegetable cutting does not require buddhi. These methods are for a non believer in religion. One has to have some work to spend the energy- that is all the purpose of any method of sādhana. So, take up work in the kitchen which does not excite you. Irrespective of the nature of the work involved your attention should be on the result. In fact, all karmakāṇḍin-s should have got very high benefits by their practice but they did not get it. Knowing why of the method makes all the difference.

#### KARMAYOGA (PATH OF SELFLESS ACTION)

If you say you have no time for doing any of the above mentioned sādhanā-s since your profession takes away much of the time, there is an alternative method for such situations. For such persons Karma yoga is the remedy.

Bhagavadgīta dwells on this in great detail and wherein Sri Kṛṣṇa elaborates on the approach to one’s activities. This, I think is the biggest research tried only in Bhagavadgīta. We shall take up the important points from that and see how it fits in to our sādhana. There are four main aspects in karma yoga.

The first presumption is-**saṁṅgaṁ tyaktvā - संङ्गं  त्यक्त्वा**.  That is, we have to do work without any excitement or attachment. This is an excellent prescription we can adopt in our life. Although it is not as easy as it is said, we can certainly make effort in this direction and improve our lives.

The second presumption is –**Phala-anusandhāna- rāhitya – फलानुसंधानराहित्य.** If you are unable to leave the excitement and or attachment to action, at least do work without always contemplating on the benefit you get out of it.

The third presumption is- **Īśvara-arpaṇa budhyā vā - ईश्वरार्पण बुध्या वा**. Just accept that you are only a proxy and the result that you get out of the work done is taken care of by HIM and you are only his obedient servant. This relationship with the Almighty, when tagged on to the work you do, gives you an expansive state.

The fourth presumption is-**Yajña dṛṣṭyā vā - यज्ञदृष्ट्या वा.** Every action performed by you can be turned into a Yajña wherein the indulgence is replaced by moderation in action. If one is invited for a lunch or a dinner with an Indian family, one has to wait patiently till all the food is served on the plate. Then the host offers the food to the Lord by saying Kṛṣṇārpaṇamastu -**कृष्णार्पणमस्तु**.** **Let all the food be offered to the Lord. After a brief prayer, everyone starts taking the food. This is an example of Yajñadṛṣṭi. This goes to show that one should not rush to satisfy the indulgence of the tongue. Likewise other indriyā-s can be mellowed down. Every bhoga can be turned into a Yajña. The feeling that bhoga is cheap is removed here, patience is introduced and a lesson in waiting is incorporated. If this attitude is taken up then any action could be converted into yajña. We will now study how a jnāni melts up activities of bhoga also by applying this attitude. This will be an excellent tool for sādhana.

An idiot’s suffering is due to pulls and pressures. The superior or sensitive man’s suffering is because of imagined idealism. This is very clearly brought out in TaittirĪya Upaniṣad (2-9-2):

**किमहम् साधु न अकरवम्, किमहम् पापम् अकरवम्**॥

**Kim-aham sādhu na akaravam, kim-aham pāpam akaravam.**

Normal people who are nobler in their values and notions suffer by the guilt sense of either not doing a good act or acting against their own self imposed values (For example, indulging in bhoga). A policeman in them always sits on judgement in their every act and thus citta aśānti is caused. Whereas, a Jñāni is not touched by any of these perturbations. He takes even bhoga as upāsana. Recognising the stock of conditioning (Vāsanā-s) that he still has, he involves a means to expend the bothering forces. How? When any activity including bhoga is approached with this orientation it becomes a Yajña. It is an upāsana. It is not cheap. It is feeding the agni called helplessness or restlessness by havis called involvement as in a homa. This is beautifully highlighted in Bhagavad-Ġīta (4-26) thus:

**श्रोत्रादीनीन्द्रियाण्यन्ये संयमाग्निषु जुह्वति ।**

**शब्दादीन् विषयानन्ये इन्द्रियाग्निषु जुह्वति ॥**

**Śrōtrādīn-īndriyāṇi-anyē saṁyamāgniṣu juhvati,**

**śabdādīn viṣayān-anyē indrayāgniṣu juhvati.**

Some yogis offer hearing and other senses, the temptations of indriayā-s, into the fire (agni) of restraint. Some other yogis feed fire of the senses or indriyā-s with corresponding bhogaviśayā-s or objects of enjoyment in a Yajña way. That is indulgence by bringing an element of Naidhānya. You do not approach a bhoga in a rush or restless way. Go to bhoga patiently. Take it as a havis offered by you to various fires called forces of indulgence with the corresponding viśayā-s. Quench the hunger of indriyā-s through such a Yajña. Everything is to be done as prescribed in Bhagavadgīta (4-24):

**ब्रह्मार्पणं ब्रह्म हविर्ब्रह्माग्नौ ब्रहणाहुतम् ।**

**Brahmārpaṇaṁ brahma haviḥ-brahmāgnau brahaṇa-āhutam.**

Brahman is the oblation. Brahman is the clarified butter constituting the offerings. Homa is being done by Brahman.

Apply leisureliness in all your acts and thus convert every act into a Yajña. All your conditionings get burnt away or melted away not to return again to bother you.

One should cultivate the habit of making the observer in him to slow down. When the activities are slowed down even the observer who is the mischief maker also mellows down. Mellowing process covers the observer also

In fact, Vedānta says that finally the correction should be undertaken at the observer level. However, killing the observer is a tough method like felling a tree. One has to cut the branches first before cutting the root. The following attitude helps very much.

**कायेन वाचा मनसेन्द्रियैर्वा बुद्ध्यात्मना वा प्रकृतेः स्वभावात्‌करोमि यद्यत् सकलं परस्मै नारायणायेति समर्पयामि ॥**

**Kāyēna vācā manasā-indriyaiḥ-vā buddhyātmanā vā prakr̥tēḥ svabhāvāt-‌karōmi yadyat sakalaṁ parasmai nārāyaṇāya-iti samarpayāmi.**

Whatever work I do, whether it employs my body, mind, speech, indriyā-s, intellect, or work done according to natural laws, is done in the name of the Lord and offered to Him only.

Now, I will take up questions from you.

**Q.**The very idea of reducing speed and defocusing shakes my vitals. I cannot imagine a situation where these two are not there! What is the holiness or otherwise about it. Can’t we have a better word?

**A.** A good point. Quite often speed is required, quite often focussing is also required. Holy and unholy is not the point here. If that was the point, the whole parīkṣa gets a religious shade. But, the speed with which one goes to a temple to worship also becomes burdensome.

Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (4-5-20) even goes to the extreme point of saying, that one has to give up even the desire to get liberated.**Mokṣārthitvaṁ api tyaja- मोक्षार्थित्वमपि त्यज । **

**बन्धो हि वासनाबन्धो मोक्षः स्यात् वासनाक्षयः।**

**वासनाम् त्वं परित्यज्य मोक्षार्थित्वमपि त्यज ॥**

**Bandhō hi vāsanā-bandhō mōkṣaḥ syāt vāsanākṣayaḥ,**

**vāsanām tvaṁ parityajya mōkṣārthitvam-api tyaja.**

Even the desire to get eternal happiness should be dropped if one wants liberation. The mind has to be a clean slate. So, the question of holy/unholy does not arise at all. Rather that exalted state is one of totality. Focussing at an acceptable level is burdenless. That way it is well taken. That’s why the śāstra said at one stage, to become pure, give up adharma and hold onto dharma,

And in the next stage –Mahābhārata, Shantiparva (Mokṣadharma, 329-40) declares that one has to give up both dharma and adharma when Dharma also becomes a burden.

**त्यज धर्ममधर्मञ्च उभे सत्यानृते त्यज ।**

**उभे सत्यानृते त्यक्त्वा येन त्यजसि तत्त्यज ॥**

**Tyaja dharmam-adharmam-ca ubhē satya-anr̥tē tyaja,**

**ubhē satya-anr̥tē tyaktvā yēna tyajasi tat-tyaja.**

Drop both righteousness and un-righteousness, truth as well as un-truth. Having relinquished both, give up even the desire to drop.

**Q.**Suppose you take the whole thing in a detached way, there is an auto mechanism in you that will give you relaxation instead of pressure. Is that so?

**A** By some refinement in your ways, if you can focus yet defocus simultaneously, then it is fine. Please listen carefully. I can reduce my entireness into a small shell and then focus and become a point. That is taxing. On the other hand I can retain my expansive nature and focus at periphery. This is not taxing. This is what a karmayogi will do. This is what a clever scientist could do. In fact, these are the improvements. When entireness reduces into a point then it will be suffering. Instead, once this mechanism is known, I can be much enlarged, very expansive and at a peripheral level, I can focus. That doesn’t burden me because I have a big shell. A small amount of energy filled into a bigger shell doesn’t tax me and nonetheless the gains of focusing are there.

**Q**Can you give us an example as to how focussing is possible at the periphery keeping expansion intact?

**A.**By adopting casual approach, things can go on at the periphery and you can be free from the problem of getting into a shell. That’s a matter of cultivation. If you cultivate this, then **let go** happens automatically. We call this by many terms like. Udāsīnabhāva. Anāsaktibhāva. Sākṣībhāva. These are the technical words. If any problem comes, take the stand. **'So what'.**When you take that stand you become diffused at once. In that background you can still focus. That will be productive, but not taxing. It is not taxing because you are in a big shell. It can take any amount of shock, any amount of energy inside that shell and you remain comfortable.

**Q.** This is something like our leaving everything to Lord Nārāyaṇa and get the comfort by not taking the burden on ourselves.

**A.** Exactly the same way. This is surrender bhāva. The sankocata is gone. In that background if you do research, it is not a burdensome** **research at all.

**Q.** When we leave the rest to GOD are we not already in the non focussing state?

**A.** Very fine. When you leave the rest to God, you are in the defocused state although you may not know the mechanism. When you take up a position as–‘oh God, you take care of me, you are there and you can solve my problems better’- the fatigue is gone. The personal element is gone. You get spreadness. In fact, a person who is in the Bhaktimārga can defocus much better than or much more quickly than the yogi who struggles to tame the forces. Actually, the choice of the sādhana is yours. But, the end result must put you in that expansive state.

**Q** Can we have our own method for diffusion of mind?

**A**. Vedānta is very liberal. By whatever argument, if you can diffuse, it is accepted. If beating a table or turning a wheel can diffuse you, fine- please do it. That’s the Indian design. When you go on rounds in a temple, the very act takes away the energy. By your simple trust in God, your mind expands. Don’t bother about the method- being reasonable or unreasonable. If the result is there – take to that method.

I** **have envied people who can surrender in a twinkle of the eye whereby focusing goes and ego is smashed. That is the quickest method.

**Q.** Should we be bothered about the time taken for achievement?

**A**. Not even that. In fact, the more we bother about it, the more distant we are from the goal.

**Q**What about the urge to get liberation fast? Does it by any chance hinder our progress in the direction of attaining the goals? Unless there is a strong urge, there cannot be a motivation for reaching the desired results.

**A.** In fact, a recommendation in Vedānta is to give up the urge to get liberated. Therefore the advice then as per Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa is-You give up the strong desire that you are still not liberated and also give up the urge that you should get liberated somehow. If this urge to get liberated goes, then it is liberation. That urge itself is the impediment actually. One has to give up even the tools used for attaining liberation. These questions will come strongly in the minds of sādhakā-s and one has to be very careful not to be influenced by them.

**Q.** How can you explain Nishkāmakarma?

**A.** Vega or speed has to be removed and the phala anusandhāna rāhitya is to be practised. Then, the karma can be done without the burden and can be done more efficiently also. Niśkāmakarma is a karma performed without attachment to both the karma itself as well as the result thereof. Īśvara arpaṇa buddhi--leaving everything at the feet of lord and accepting whichever way the result takes you to**.**Śankara repeatedly refers to this one. Surrender the result of action to HIM and hence the taxing element is gone. Then, the result of performance is not paramount. That means you are happy as the focusing goes and the speed goes.


#### PREMA AND BHAKTI (LOVE AND DEVOTION)

We went through śubha-karmamārga which was very important since we cannot always use -Jñānamārga and Yogamārga. We have to incorporate karmakāṇḍa methods of doing pūja, reciting sahasranāma, etc. as an alternative. Apart from these any karma which is not exciting can be taken up in our daily lives as a portion of our time table wherein the boredom forces can be easily dissolved. One needs to take care that the activities so taken up should not raise kāma and krodha. Number of such tricks are available and one can use them just to spend the time and energy. Forget that some God gives you benefit. It is the śubhakarma which will keep you in a peaceful mode. Unknowingly you are in a soft state of mind during those hours. You are nearer to brahmasthiti. What was left over in our study was another method which is called **Bhaktimārga- भक्तिमार्ग**, **or Prēmamārga- प्रेममार्ग**.

Prēma is a very soft state of mind compared to our several other states of mind. This is called ADŪRAKEVALĪBHĀVA- an inch removed from the peaceful state or the state of self. In contrast with violent states like anger, jealousy, etc., this is a very soft state. That is why parampara called it adūra- not removed- near to peaceful state. If a sādhaka were to stay in this soft state for longer duration, he will gently slip into that brahmasthiti which is the goal of every person.

It is difficult to describe that state! It is as good as someone trying to describe the sweetness of sugar. The only way of understanding that state is to get into it and feel that state. We have many occasions in our daily life to get into this state, as every one of us is equipped with that prēmabhāva.

The husband has returned from a tedious office job in the evening and his wife rushes to him with all smiles with a cup of coffee. The state of that woman then is called prēmasthiti.

When any one of you are walking on a street and see a small boy fall from bicycle and hurts himself you at once run to him and lift him with soothing words. You are in the prēmasthiti. On all such occasions we are in prēmabhāva.

Prēma is a natural state in every one of us**. Prēma goes with tyāga and they are inseparable constituents.** Love and sacrifice go together. If we can get it in amplified state then it becomes prēma-utkarshasthiti. That is what we see in Sri Rāmakṛṣṇa. This is called prēma-bhakti. Whatever softness we try to achieve over years of tapas, can be got in ten minutes through prēmabhāva.

While taming of mind being so difficult, one stroke of prēma can put you into soft state. Both the comforter and the comforted are in a diffused state of mind. We will take one or two examples from Mythology to see how the whole thing fits in.

It is a story from Rāmāyaṇa. We have seen in the anecdote of Bharata and Rāma, how Rāma sacrificed the throne to fulfil his father’s wishes while Bharata rejected the throne got by her mother’s wishes. Here prēma goes with tyāga. When Bharata goes to Rāma and tells him that the foolishness of his mother cannot be supported and begs Rāma to come back and take charge, Rāma declines the offer and insists that Bharata should return and rule the kingdom. Bharata requests for his pādukā-s and keeps them on the throne and rules as a proxy.

Another episode is the situation when Rāma is returning after fourteen years of exile in the forest. He is in Bharadwāja āshrama. Rāma gets a feeling that Bharata may be interested in ruling the kingdom, in which case he was ready to relinquish it for his brother’s sake. He instructs Hanumān to ascertain from Bharata if he still wanted to be the king. What a tyāga on the part of Rāma for the sake of happiness of his brother.

On the other hand, study the case of Bharata. He did not have iota of displeasure on Rāma’s return. In fact, he was eagerly awaiting his arrival. Here we see that the sacrifice of Bharata is of a much higher order than that of Rāma. Rāma thought that Bharata would be on the throne clad gorgeously and having looks of a King. But, we find Bharata in a ṛṣi’s attire, living in the parṇakutira (a thatched hut) forty miles away from Ayodhya along with āśrama inmates. He was with knotted hair, emaciated by the separation from his brother, eating only fruits available in the forest and looking virtually like a tapasvi. With utter self control, he was ruling the kingdom typically as a trustee. Bharata is so excited to hear the news of Rāma returning and gets ready to serve his brother after handing over the kingdom. This is an instance of prēma and tyāga reaching the exalted state.

The next situation in Rāmāyaṇa is Rāmā’s coronation ceremony where, after the event, gifts are to be given. The gifting ceremony is going on and the respected dignitaries are presenting themselves before Rāma. The last person in the line is Hanumantha. Rāma is at a loss as to what gift he should give him. Hanumantha was everything to him and he cannot equate any commodity to the love and service of Hanumān. The series of events that took place in Rāmyaṇa was because of him. It was impossible for Rāma to decide what gift he could give him when he was with him although. He decides that the best thing that he can give is a warm hug and so he gets down from the throne and hugs him with tears rolling down his cheeks. In turn, Hanumān says that his life has become worthwhile. Both are charged with emotion with the sense of gratitude and sense of fulfilment. That is the state of ecstasy and is the culmination in prēmabhāva.

Another example we can take from Mahābhārata- the case of Draupadi who is a famous mythological character and who thrived by Prēma and Bhakti. In the cases of Dūrvāsa ātithya, the Vastrāpaharaņa and restoration episode in the court of king Dṛtarāṣṭra, etc, Kṛṣṇa assures her every time and her wishes are fulfilled. God comes to the rescue of bhakta whenever the devotee is in an exalted state of prēma and bhakti. He goes to the level of bhakta and helps him. He did not preach Vedānta at that time. Here, we should see the subtle difference between the two. Prēma has a touch of intimacy. In Bhakti the familiarity is replaced by reverence. Both are soft states but Bhakti carries an aspect of reverence.

**While prēma goes with tyāga, Bhakti goes with reverence, submission and surrender.**

In arpaṇābhāva, ego is dropped. When you go to the Divine as a bhakta, a wonderful mechanism is operating there. You are surrendering to HIM without any scheming or planning. Aham and mama (me and mine) are both gone. Quietening of mind happens instantaneously. Even a hard core scientific person becomes soft in this mood. Whenever you touch the feet of an elder person you get into that soft state. This is the beauty of Bhakti.

Triputināśa happens for a Jñāni by vairāgya. For a bhakta, the same thing happens by a simple surrender. Both of them reach that state which is the abode of peace.

So to conclude, Prēma and Bhakti are the best tools in the hands of man to attain the brahma- bhāvana. All other methods require effort and discipline to attain the same state. One of the best methods of sādhana is the Prēmayoga or the Bhaktiyoga. One has to get convinced about the importance and then it is easy to attain the state.

**Q.**Prēmabhāva with God is alright. But, when you extend this to our own family members like wife, brother, sister and children, due to our vāsanā-s we don’t get that reverence or the poojyabhāva. A sort of bondage or attachment is created which is an impediment to our goal of vairāgya. How to break this and get away from that likely bondage?

**A.**It is a very good question. We have to forget the attachment or moha component here. In most of the cases, prēma supersedes the moha element. The contentment that mother and the son get between them masks the moha aspect. This in turn gives a spiritual lift. The special interest we take in our kith and kin is a negative part of the whole story, whereas we have to see only the upliftment part in prēmabhāva. One has to be a conscious sādhaka and should not get involved in moha. Only then it becomes universal, even among family members:

**सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः ।**

**सर्वे भद्राणि पश्यन्तु मा कश्चित् दुःखभाग्भवेत् ॥**

**Sarvē bhavantu sukhinaḥ sarvē santu nirāmayāḥ,**

**sarvē bhadrāṇi paśyantu mā kaścit duḥkhabhāgbhavēt.**

May all be happy.

May all be free from disabilities.

May all see the good in others.

May none suffer from sorrow.

Then, the above concept begins to set in the mind. In the whole process, ego should vanish and that is the main concern for the sādhaka.** **You should understand that when the mind becomes empty at that moment of prēmabhāva, where is the question of moha?

**Q.** The ecstasy developed through prēma can cause a lot of mental damage. How do we rate this?

**A**. There is certainly an element of torment, no doubt. This is because of the excitement element without which one may not get the adūrakevalībhāva.

**Q**. But most of the bhaktā-s turn hysterical?

**A.** The deep involvement in the bhajan and the dance puts them into deep levels of emptiness because of the huge energy expenditure. There is gentle load on the system which makes them go out of tune. But, that is only momentary. After years of training when mahāshānti sets in, this also will crumble down. Forgiving becomes natural and one does not have any enemies in the world. Fault finding stops for such a person.

In Nārada Bhakti Sūtra, there is a definition of prēma which can be easily distinguished from kāma-**tat sukha sukhitvaṁ- तत् सुख सुखित्वम् - Gopikā prēmavat, rādhāprēmavat- गोपिकाप्रेमवत्, राधा प्रेमवत्**. What is so special about Rādhā or Gopikā-s when they loved Kṛṣṇa? When they loved him it was for his joy and not for their personal joy. It was for the comfort of Kṛṣṇa and not for their comfort. Rukmiṇi's prēma and Satyabhāmā's prēma are gently different. Satyabhāma wanted Kṛṣṇa to alleviate her boredom and bring in contentment. Kṛṣṇa was for her joy. Whereas, Rukmiṇi found comfort in attending to Kṛṣṇa and making him happy.

The gains of doing ten days of tapas can be had by one stroke of surrender. You must watch a simple housewife. How she surrenders to the Lord saying that she is helpless and unable to solve the problems. She says that she is too small to do tapas and difficult sādhana. She can only surrender and get mentally assured that Lord will take care of her---

**अन्यथा शरणं नास्ति त्वमेव शरणं मम ।**

**तस्मात् कारुण्यभावेन रक्ष रक्ष जनार्दन ॥**

**Anyathā śaraṇaṁ na-asti tvam-ēva śaraṇaṁ mama,**

**tasmāt kāruṇya-bhāvēna rakṣa rakṣa janārdana.**

I have no other refuge, Thou art my sole refuge,Out of sense of compassion, protect me, O Supreme Lord!

This is called **Śaraṇāgatibhāva, शरणागतिभाव -**, or **prapattibhāva- प्रपत्तिभाव or arpaṇabhāva-**. In a minute the ego is destroyed and the mind surrenders. This is a very quick method which we cannot underscore. In a stroke it can bring down the citta to zero level. A house wife can be very much successful in Bhakti and surrender.

I did all this detailed study in order to drive home the point in you that our forefathers had such excellent lofty ideas and ideals. We should wonder at the skill of the vedāntic Indian researcher in formulating this wide range of sādhanā-s. After this research, all my questions were solved.

That is why one cannot say which sādhaka is at a higher level and which sādhaka is at lower level. That is in bad taste. Whosoever works, with whatsoever tasks, is a noble soul and we should offer our prostrations to him. Any school of thought for that matter has to be accommodated. Even the crudest way of pūja when I see, I feel wonderful in my heart and I get into a trance. Do not decry the simple austerity measure under taken by the women in the house, like fasting in the night for satisfying the pūja requirements. Do not laugh at her daily bhajans or śloka chanting. You dare not make a word of censure there. You may do things different from her methods, like prāṇāyāma, āsana, etc. Every method is holy by itself.

**Q.** When you are referring different methods of sādhana, you mentioned that it is slow and takes time to achieve. But how do you say that surrender brings in instant results? If that is so, then why people ignored this method?

**A.**The surrender is one of the tools to empty the mind because one completely negates one’s role. In the process, reduces his ego to such a level that the mind becomes empty, thus putting one in peace. But this also is not an easy method. It requires a **lot of courage and conviction**to do this. The immense faith in the Almighty that he would solve the problem, cannot come all of a sudden.

But the one good thing is that ego is almost killed in this process very fast. In other methods, we are taming the forces by bringing down focussing and speed. This also is time dependant, as de conditioning is not instantaneous.

In other methods, ‘I’ has to be removed consciously. Whereas, in surrender the 'I' is easily done away by asserting that you do not have a role and leave it to the Almighty to take care of things. The Jñānamārga may suit one. The Yogamārga may suit another. Karma Yoga may look easy for some. Samarpaṇabhāva or Bhakthimārga may be easy for some other. So, each one has to do some introspection and take to what is best for him and remain steady in that practice with all humility and conviction that the path chosen will certainly lead to the goal. After all, we are doing all this to achieve inner peace.

You should know that there are two 'I's. One is the thinking 'I' and the other is an emotionally caught 'I' or the focusing 'I'. Vega and focussing were the burdens in which my 'I' was resting. When the attentive 'I' goes, what is the residue? In what form can this 'I' stay? This is the last lakṣaṇa of the 'I", the thinking 'I'.

Show me an 'I' beyond that. Ahaṁkāra is not vanity. It means that I am a doer. The doer at the cittasthāna is the thinker. Thinker or the thinking is the last lakṣaṇa of the vulnerable 'I' or the suffering 'I'. When that goes where is the 'I'? It is an expansion-brahmasvarūpa. In śaraṇāgati, you surrender yourself. That means you surrender thinking or the thinking 'I'.

But, when you are looking at the process of surrender, you are still in the ego state. The observer also has to be surrendered. It is easy to surrender bhoga and other things. But, one has to surrender the mischief maker, lingering fellow, i.e., the observer. That is why samarpaṇa method becomes easier than other methods, only when you understand the mechanism. In other methods you kill the 'I' by not doing, not thinking, and not getting excited and this is a matter of time and effort.

**Q.** Sir how do the pursuits and goals that one has set up fit into vedāntic pursuit of happiness?

**A.** That’s a very good question and a very contextual question. What else can be a goal of man? It ought to be one’s happiness or the happiness ofone’s near and dear? If you are more liberal it can be the happiness of the globe. **Sarvē** **bhavantu sukhinaḥ -**सर्वॆ भवन्तु सुक्खिन:**.** Let all beings be happy throughout this Universe.Every pursuit of man, trivial or profound, is in the direction of happiness. At the smallest level, it is indriyabhoga**.** At the next level, it is the joy of achievement. At a still higher level, it is the joy of service, giving something worthwhile to the society at large. Everything becomes Joy, comfort, ānanda. Why does one serve staying by the side of a sick patient spending six hours of the night? It is to get the joy of comforting the sick. Don’t you think that this joy is superior to others? Nonetheless it is the joy of comforting a human, the sick person. Everywhere the ultimate motivation is ānanda and sukha.

Thank you, one and all, for staying with me and sharing my thoughts all these days and I hope that all of you attain inner peace, which is the only thing to be attained in this world. Benefit by the vedāntic truths and lead a happy life as Upaniṣad-s proudly announce:

**जीवेम शरदश्शतम्।**

**नन्दाम शरदश्शतम्।**

**मोदाम शरदश्शतम्॥**

**Jīvēma śaradaśśatam,                                               Nandāma śaradaśśatam,**

**Mōdāma śaradaśśatam.**


#### DHARMA (RIGHTEOUNESS) – AS A TOOL OF SĀDHANA 

_Shastriji”s concept of Dharma throws light on a variety of modern way of thinking and the apprehensions of the younger generation regarding the old value systems enunciated in the dhārmic principles. A totally new dimension has been opened by Shastriji by way of his arguments which capture the imagination of the youngsters.  His primary aim of using any method to tame the mind to attain peace and tranquillity leads one to think positively about applying dhārmic tenets in one’s own daily lives as a means of sādhana to achieve happiness.  The reader has to keep this in mind while reading the chapter on Dharma as a means of sādhana   ---  Editor_

The truths of the Upaniṣad-s form the theoretical base, supporting the other two components namely Karma and Dharma. We have a wing called Karmānuṣṭhāna which is prescribed by the Karmakāṇḍa portion of the vedas, with so many rituals, pūjā-s, prayers, Gods, demigods and their spouses. You can call them power centres if you don’t like the idea of Gods.

The same can be compared to a central Government where in, we have a Prime Minister and many subordinate ministers who are conducting duties as per the instruction of their head. There is a replica of what is in our macrocosm life. For example, Varuṇa represents the water component, Agni represents a thermal component, Sūrya represents a light component etc.

There is a cetana, which by a powerful kumbhana establishes a potential as a result of which, kinetic energy can flow. He can keep on releasing thermal or light energy which is backed by a terrible kumbhana. Our kumbhana (holding the breath) is of half minute duration. When you go to your expansive phase, you can have a kumbhana outside of your body and that can be established for years. That is how these power centres are operated.

Closely integrated with the karma aspect, there is the Dharma aspect also. This is the sādhana portion of the karmakāṇḍa. The theory portion of Dharma is covered in the message of Upaniṣads. Man thought that sukha was in the objects of enjoyments and the indriyā-s connecting them. A connection between the viśaya and viśayi gives us the sense of joy. That is a surface truth. But the real truth is that when viśaya and viśayi come together, the joy or sukha results in an empty state of mind.

See the enormous difference between the first and the second conclusion. Eating gives me joy. Any sweet dish gives me joy. The corresponding indriya and the required object getting a contact produces the happy state –** **

**विषयिविषयसम्बन्धजनितः सुखः॥**

**Viṣayi-viṣaya-sambandha-janitaḥ sukhaḥ.**

If the question was pushed further as to what gave you joy inside, the answer would be that the mind became empty because of a peculiar mechanism of contact. The real content of happiness is not in the bhogavastu. It is only a means, but in reality, citta or the mind becoming empty by which you touch your nijasvarūpa or brahmasvarūpa. This is the common thing in the whole of Universe which is brahmamātrata. A terrible silence or a terrible non doing principle is the basic composition of everything on this earth. The essence of Indian thinking is to realize this and experience that non doing state—which is otherwise known as attaining MOKṣA, which is the goal of every one.

Dharma_, _artha_, _kāma and mokṣa, are the four puruśārthā-s_ - _is the essence of Indian thinking. Indian vision has given utter clarity about these and there is no mystery about this. Every time you are in happiness, you are touching your source. A magnified version of that joy is svarūpa. If you are continuously there in a steadfast way, that is liberation. Karmakāṇḍa leads you to that state. Taming the unruly forces is the point of importance in karmakāṇḍa.

Dharma is also a portion of karmakāṇḍa. Dharma is the practical side of knowledge. It is the working region of the theory we have learnt through upaniṣadic study.

What is Dharma? A simple definition of Dharma is very difficult. Our sages have given three or four orthodox definitions. They are biblical in their representation. We shall look into them.

**धारणात् धर्म इति अभिधीयते** ॥

**Dhāraṇāt dharma iti abhidhīyatē**.

One thinker puts a definition as, ‘anything that holds on to is Dharma’. The universe is held -the cosmic flow is maintained and therefore it is Dharma. Whatever sustains the progress of the universe is dharma. It sounds dignified but that does not help in our practice**.**

**धर्मो रक्षति रक्षितः  - Dharmō rakṣati rakṣitaḥ**.

If you practice dharma, dharma itself takes care of your welfare. Your Iha- इह and Para- पर are taken care of if you live in a dhārmic way... Again this definition also is vague as far as its practice is concerned. Śankara always gives importance to this, as it is more orthodox -

**चोदनालक्षणःधर्मः  - Cōdana-lakṣaṇaḥ dharmaḥ  -**

Wwhatever śāstra is telling you in terms of dos and don’ts is dharma.

All these do not give us a sustainable position as far as practice is concerned. This is more orthodox in nature. This also did not help me when I went as an earnest research student. Notwithstanding this difficulty, we have number of dhārmic tenets or dhārmic practices observed in every Hindu home even without knowing definition of dharma. In** **Taittirīya Upaniṣad-Śikshāvalli, the following are a few dhārmic injunctions:

**Satyam vada, Dharmam cara- सत्यं वद धर्मं चर।** Always speak the truth and follow dharma.

**मातृदेवो भव, पितृदेवो भव, आचार्यदेवो भव।**

**Mātr̥dēvō bhava, pitr̥dēvō bhava, ācāryadēvō bhava**

Hold Mother as God, Father as God, Teacher as God etc. These** **are all orders from a guru to the disciple when he leaves the ashram after the study.

Whereas it is not mandatory in the west to take care of their parents in their old age, it is a dictum in Hindu Dharma. All the problems of providing separate shelter and facility for the old are just struck off by an injunction in Hindu tenets which says that they have to be looked upon as ‘gods’ and hence to be cared for. What a safe society it becomes when dharma tenets are applied? **Mātr̥vat paradārāṁśca  - मातृवत् परदारांश्च**। Look at this great thinking. Every woman other than your wife is a mother like to you. If man were to practice this dharma, all crimes born out of illegitimate relationships get routed out and society becomes safe. Rape and kill is a very common affair now a days and this can be eradicated if one were to follow this tenet. In Taittirīya Upaniṣad (3-7, 8) we have following mantra:

**अन्नं न निंद्यात् तद्व्रतम् ।**

**Annaṁ na niṁdyāt tadvratam.**

**अन्नं न परिचक्षीत तद्व्रतम् ।**

**Annaṁ na paricakṣīta tadvratam.**

**अन्नं बहुकुर्वीत ।**

**Annaṁ bahukurvīta.**

**न  कञ्चन वसतौ प्रत्याचक्षीत तद्व्रतम् ।**

**Na kañcana vasatau pratyācakṣīta tadvratam.**

His vow is that he should not deprecate food. One should not neglect food. One should try to increase the quantity of food one has. If someone comes and asks for a place to stay, one should not turn him away.

Taken in a worldly sense, if the money earned by whatever means is used for making food and distributing, then it is not unholy. What a daring statement! Even a scoundrel cannot be denied food. Nobody should die of starvation was the motto. So far as other gifts are concerned, one has to see merits and demerits in distribution but not when it comes to cooked food.

**Dāna** and **Aparigraha**are the next two important tenets. Half the crime in our society is due to hunger and wrong sex. Once the society is assured of the food and shelter, where is the crime? Big issues are simply taken care of by a simple practice of this tenet of Dharma. Every Hindu family indulges in charity. From the birth of to the cremation stage, charity is practiced.

If you see a Hindu lady performing a ritual, she gives away a coconut along with a piece of cloth, as gift after the pūja. Tagged on to that is aparigraha. As far as you are concerned, you politely refuse a dāna and say that you are bound by a ritual and cannot accept anything. Though you are in need, you refrain from taking, just to protect dharma. These two disciplines are put on a high pedestal. If practiced by all, there cannot be poverty in the society. If haves can decide to lead a simple life, their excess money will flow back to society for welfare of the needy.

While we have any number of dhārmic tenets in our society, I am not able to get at one single definition by which I can classify an act as dhārmic or otherwise. What is the common factor in all these dhārmic tenets? We still do not have a clear vision of Dharma. This calls for a deeper study of dharma. While this is one aspect of Dharma, we have another aspect where there is an excuse even when the dhārmic tenets are broken.

Let us take the case of Ahalya who was the dharma patni of sage Gautama. She fell in love with Indra who stealthily came and had sex with her and then she is cursed by the sage and becomes a stone. Rāmapāda sparṣa releases her from that state and then the ŗşi Gautama accepts her. Here, we have to see an important point. A pativrata who has to keep herself committed to dharma by thought, deed and action (kāyā vācā and manasā) had erred and keepers of Dharma could have banished her. But the Ŗşi accepts her. How do we justify Dharma here? We feel that there is an inconsistency. We have given the status of a mahāpativratā to Ahalya in spite of specific violations of dharma.

Take the case of Draupadi. While the pātivratya-dharma allowed only one husband, she is a woman who takes five men and still considered a pativratā. Our own definitions are contradicted and there seems to be no consistency in dhārmic values, is the argument of a modern day thinker. Can we be so foolish as to be inconsistent?

Take the case of sage Parāśara. He has come near a shore and is waiting for a boat. He sits in a boat and sees that a girl is rowing the boat. He invites her for company. She is shocked and is reluctant and says that she is still a virgin. She requests the sage to take the permission of her father as she has no objection to marry him as he is a worthy person. The sage brushes away her request and persuades her. The girl is afraid that a Mahaŗṣi can curse her and accepts the request reluctantly and that event gives birth to Vyāsa. If we examine this incident, even ordinary persons like us would not have done such a thing. This urgency is not pardonable. Situation is all the more important since he is a Mahaŗṣi. It is surprising to note that he is called Bhagavān Parāśara before the act and after the act also. Look at the complexity.

When we come to the story of Kṛṣṇa, it is terrifying again. He is called a thief till he was five, when he is a boy he is an eve teaser, when maturity comes he is an unscrupulous fighter in warfare. To protect the Pāndavā-s in their war against the Kauravā-s, he makes Ghatodgaja- a victim, Abhimanyu- a victim. Karṇa is treacherously handled. Bhīşma is cleverly disposed of. Droṇa is made to give up arms at the stroke of a lie. Despite this, he is considered as God. Can Dharma be so bad?

Dharma which looked so simple, takes up such strides where specific violations of dharma have been committed. Overlooking these objections, all the above involved characters continue to be glorified in religion. So, there is a need to go deep into the study of dharma. To substantiate all these and accommodate them in the tenets of dharma, bothered me for years... I had to do five years of research to get some satisfactory answer.

We shall try to define dharma. If one has to give a simplest initial definition, one can say dharma is** NYĀYA.** Nyāya is, good returned with good. If you give me a gift on a festival day, it is reasonable for me to return the same on some other day. It follows therefore - bad returned with bad also. This is called tit for tat - Punish the evil and reward the good is a vision of nyāya. This is all the scope of nyāya and no further. But dharma goes beyond nyāya. What is that which goes beyond this nyāyadṛṣṭi and offers something more? Where does dharma excel nyāya?

To give an example, take the case of professor who earns a fat salary. His neighbour is a poor school master who earns a meagre salary. The professor celebrates festivals with all pomp and pleasure where as the school master celebrates the same in a very humble way. Professor does not share his wealth with the school master. He need not do that. This is nyāyadṛṣṭi. If on the other hand, he understands the situation and goes to the neighbour with some gifts and sweets and offers them to the teacher without hurting the pride of the teacher, then he has lifted himself from the levels of nyāya to the regions of dharma. See the difference. He is setting a new dimension which was not available till then. Sharing is not an obligation here. A virtue called sharing has come into the picture here. This is how dharma excels nyāya. We have number of examples in our life to substantiate this point.

I have the example of a colleague of mine who led a bachelor’s life and was very miserly as far as his comforts were concerned. But, he had the greatness of looking after his mother who was eighty years old, spent all his money and got his six sisters married. This was the level of sacrifice he did, ignoring his own personal life. He would go to the extent of paying the fees of students in his class who were not in a position to meet the deadline. This is not called for in the regions of nyāya and goes somewhere beyond.

Many references from the Upanişad-s are available and I will place before you a story from one of them. Three representatives, one from Devaloka, one from Dānavaloka and one from Mānavaloka went to Prajāpati, the creator, to seek wisdom. Prajāpati, being a very inert person uttered only one word ‘da’ to satisfy all the three of them. Each person understood this as it suited him. The devatā-s took it as ‘dama’, the dānavā-s took it as ‘dayā’ and the mānavā-s took it as ‘dāna’. Dānava-s thought that they were very harsh. So they felt that they should show compassion and be less cruel. They felt that they had to cultivate dayā. Manavā-s thought that they had to practice dāna as they were miserly and the devatā-s understood that they had to have moderation in their indulgence and took it as Dama,

These three can be taken as the tenets of dharma. We were trying to search for a right definition as to which is the right dhārmic trait and now we have these three aspects which can be used to test them. Dayā or **Prema,**Dāna or**tyāga**and Dama or** nigraha **are the three aspects of the dharma principle. If anything is valuable in any religion it is these three things. Even Jesus Christ approved of these three aspects for a holistic living. Compassion was not available in the regions of Nyāya till the above dhārmic tenets were introduced in the religion.

We can now see the subtle shades that distinguish one from the other. In the eastern world we can give examples of hundreds of persons who practiced dharma. Now that we have a complete definition of dharma, one is considered dhārmic if any one of the three principles mentioned above is practiced. I will take three examples from epics to show these aspects-**Compassion**or prema,**charity**or tyāga and **control**or nigraha.

I will take an episode from Rāmāyaṇa. The situation is the coronation of the heir to the throne of King Daśaratha. The king has decided to appoint Rāma as his heir and an announcement to this effect has been made and the message is conveyed to queen Kaikeyi. Kaikeyi does not approve of this and wants to cash on the two boons the king had given to her some time ago. She wants Rāma to go to the forest for fourteen years and her son Bharata to be installed on the throne. King Daśaratha is bound by his words to the queen. Kaikeyi manages to get Rāma to her chambers to inform the decision.

The context here is very important. Rāma has been accepted as king and preparations are in full swing and there is joy everywhere. Rāma expects that he would be greeted by both the king and the queen. But the queen tells him otherwise. What a lift at the announcement of coronation and what a fall when he has been told that he has to go to forest, clad in the dress of an ascetic. There was not a simple frown on Rāma’s face. That showed the preparedness of Rāma for upholding dharma, by honouring the word given by his father to the queen. He was ready to accept the order at the drop of a hat and give up kingship. But the queen is in a hurry to send him away as quickly as possible to make sure that Rāma did not change his mind. That was her anxiety. Rāma is called maryādā- purusha as he was never disturbed at any time. Rāma tells the queen that he will not change his mind even if the world tries to persuade him, since he has accepted the order of the queen who is like mother to him. This is where we can see the difference between Nyāyadṛṣṭi and dharmadṛṣṭi.

In front of all other queens and sage Vasiṣṭha, Lakṣmaṇa, the brother of Rāma, argues and tells his brother that there is no need for him to go to the forest and puts forth three points to support the Nyāyadṛṣṭi. Firstly, it is the birth right of the eldest son to become the king. The promise or boon given by the king has no place there and Rāma need not fulfil his promise. Secondly, the king being old seemed to have lost his senses and is unable to decide which is good and which is bad and hence there is no need to obey the king. Thirdly, the king seems to have got attracted by the young queen by blind love, hence Rāma need not take the word of the king seriously. If they decide to take the kingship by force, as his brother, he would singlehandedly destroy them. Hence, Rāma should not have any fear in ignoring the words of the foolish queen. He further asserts that Rāma is the most deserving son of Daśaratha for kingship. This was the Nyāyadṛṣṭi put forth by Lakṣmaṇa. Even Kausalya and sage Vasiṣṭha also say that the order is unjust. Rāma at this juncture puts forth his points in favour of his decision. He says that one should not look at the issue as put forth by Lakşmaṇa. That was not the way of studying the problem. There is no place for debate when the duty of the son is, to obey the father’s words and free him from that burden. The dharma of any son is to protect the words of the father. Under such a situation, no argument to dislodge the order was acceptable. So, the case is settled as dharma tenets have to be upheld and arguments of Nyāya do not fit in. When other equally noble souls argue on the basis of Nyāya, Rāma takes a different stand upholding the dhārmic values. This shows up to what level one can go and be mentally prepared to accept whatever comes in the way. That was how Rāma applied nigraha and tyāga components of Dhrama.

Another example from Rāmāyaṇa is worth mentioning where Rāma acts in a balanced way when the war between him and Rāvaṇa becomes imminent. He was told that Rāvaṇā’s brother Vibhīşaṇa, with his four followers, is coming to his camp. A deliberation is on whether to accept him or not since he is from the enemy quarters. Rāma is quietly watching when Sugriva says that Vibhīşaṇa should not be let in as he might be having foul motives. He may be trying to find out the war strategy. Lakşmaṇa is in agreement with that point of view. Hanumantha at this point makes a balancing act by saying that he has judged them as noble souls when he visited Lanka for the first time. Hence, they should be given a hearing. Rāma, after listening to all these arguments, says that the case here is not of any fear of someone with evil designs. Being a kshatriya, it is his Dhrama to give protection to anyone who came to him for help. Vālmiki’s śloka from Rāmāyaṇa is excellent here**.**

**सकृदेव प्रपन्नाय तवास्मीति च याचत ।**

**अभयं सर्वभूतेभ्यः ददामि एतद्व्रतम् मम॥**

**Sakr̥dēva prapannāya tava-asmi-iti ca yācata,**

**abhayaṁ sarva-bhūtēbhyaḥ dadāmi ētat-vratam mama.** (VālmikiRāmāyaṇa)

Rāma is at his best- If a person comes _to_ him once saying that he is helpless and is at his mercy, he will give protection from all the enemy forces which is acting against him. This is the dharma of a kşatriya and particularly of a king like him.

These are lessons to show us how dharma differs from Nyāyadṛṣṭi and how far you can stick to dharma if you so desire and make your life noble.

Now we take another story of Bhīşma from Mahābhārata. We know about the King Śāntanu and Bhīşma is born to him from Queen Ganga. He is also known as Devavrata. One day while Śāntanu was hunting, he feels a fragrant smell and follows the trail of that and finds a girl of eighteen. He falls in love with her. He is unable to express the pangs and gets depressed and stays lonely in the palace. Devavrata comes to know of this and tries to find out the reason through the people who had accompanied his father on the hunting trip.

He goes in search of that girl (matsyagandhi, girl with fragrance due to the boon given by sage Parāśara) and informs her father that King Śāntanu had sought her for marriage. The father of the girl is happy and puts a condition that the son born out of his daughter should be made the king of Hastināpur. This was a very big request to be accepted as Devavrata could lose the position of a king. But, he readily obliges and takes a vow that even his children would not take the throne. To fulfil this end, he would remain a bachelor. He made two promises that he would reject not only the kingship but also marriage with any woman. This was a terrible sacrifice for the sake of his father. Even the devatā-s were stunned by such an impossible vow. And they named him Bhīşma.

This goes to show to what level one can sacrifice to make a mark for himself. If any one of us were in that position, we would not have dared to make such a promise. We would have probably advised our fathers that they should abandon the lust at that age! We would have asked them to change their ways if such a situation arose. But here is a boy of eighteen or twenty who deserved the company of a woman more than his aged father, at the drop of a hat, agrees to the request of not only losing his right to marry but also lose the kingship. While we are always tempted to go by Nyāyadṛṣṭi, Devavrata went by the Dharmadṛṣṭi.

The next example is the story of Karṇa from Mahābhārata. Karṇa is a tragic hero of Mahabhārata, unfairly treated by the mother. Karṇa was invincible and Indra, who was anxious of the safety of his son Arjuna, comes in the disguise of a Brahmin. Indra knew that Karṇa had a vrata that he would not refuse the request of anyone who came to him asking for a help especially when he is doing the ritual of Arghyapradāna (oblations). Indra demands that he should part with kavaca which was with him since birth, by pouring water along with the gift. In spite of warning by his father Surya who clearly tells Karṇa that the person who has come to ask is none other than Indra himself and the gift would result in his death in the battlefield, Karṇa still obliges the Brahmin. That was the Dharmadṛṣṭi, where as the Nyāyadṛṣṭi is to think whether or not it is right to oblige when a seeker comes with a foul intention. Karṇa, who respected his vrata more than anything, did not care if the intention of the seeker was good or bad.

So, these are examples to show in a subtle way how a Nyāyadṛṣṭi differed from Dharmadṛṣṭi and are examples to reach those ideals as much as we can. But, the real question begins here.

Here, let us recollect the incident which I narrated some days ago wherein the post doctoral student of Theology rejected the religious tenets outright stating that religion is a joy killer.

Can you see the ruthless attack on religion in two directions! It has no self defence by way of arguing itself as right. Everyone wants to have a free life of indulgence and thinks it is his right. Indulgence gives him joy. More indulgence is more joyful. It is quite a natural demand as the purpose of life is happiness.  religion can probably defend itself against such a reasonable attack.

We cannot call that student foolish to be dismissed or ignored as he is a post doctoral student. The student in question says that unless the religion or the advocates of religion, give a justifying answer, he is not satisfied. The best part of the booklet was that the teacher confesses that he had no answer nor he could find any answers in the religious texts.

In the present days, if one observes the world over, youngsters are going into ways of too much of distraction and spoiling themselves in the name of worldly pleasures which are giving them misery instead of happiness. So, tenets of Dharma have to be carefully studied and adopted in every mode of our life.

Most of us argue that dhārmic principles are dependent on time and place and so also nyāya and there is no constant factor. That is the problem we are facing today. If Dharma had the constancy and is independent of time, then all our religious practices should not have changed. Most of us do not practice them. In the days of religious tightness, lot of prescriptions used to be there and people adhered to them. Whether Dhārmic values should remain intact and rigid is to be answered when we think of redefining Dharma.

It is possible to restructure Dharma when we are in a position to understand the why of Dharma and have a full vision of dharma. Our notion earlier was dharma is for dharma’s sake. Now we have a higher vision. Whereas, all of us thought that the values of Dharma are highest, the doctoral student threw a challenge on us. He insisted that prema, tyāga and nigraha are simply a negation of indulgence. He went on to say that sukha was in Bhoga and religion was putting a check on his joy.

The student is right in saying that everybody is in need of joy. That cannot be questioned. But then, it can be shown, by applying restraints, which is the best factor of every religion, everlasting joy can be easily attained. This was shown in detail when we discussed the concept of sukha and duḥkha-parīkṣa. Religion does not take you away from joy. Religion can help you to reach a lasting joy. Bhogasukha gives momentary joy preceded by restlessness, succeeded by restlessness. Religion gives you complete stretch of joy. Once that is accepted, the whole world can turn religious. The great ethical, moral, religious, dhārmic values simply get restored. That is the beauty of Vedānta.

When everyone questions the religious methods and its practises, the doctoral student in question may seem right as far as logic goes. But, he is unable to see what an amount of effort has gone in formatting these ideas to give him permanent happiness if he were to accept them after a careful study. Dharma gets restored even without our knowledge if IndriyaNigraha is applied as a balancing act in all our actions.

The seemingly mischievous question, but very well laid out from the postdoctoral student, is very well met and therefore religion has a strong point to defend itself. All the religions have Prema, Tyāga and Nigraha as common values. We can now appreciate every religion. Now, this is a wonderful explanation which tells us why of Dharma. <u>All the three tenets prema, tyāga and nigraha ultimately take you to pure state of mind or a no mind state</u>. And this state, as we have seen, is the state of ānanda. Even Bhogasukha, corresponds to a momentary mental peace. So Dharma is one which can take me to mokṣa, a quietened state of mind, a soft or gentle state of mind. Dharma is not an end in itself but a means to a nobler state of mind which is ānanda. We can now give a more encompassing and richer definition to Dharma. <u>Whatever action which takes one to a state of mahā śānti is Dharma.</u> This is a better and more convenient definition than the earlier one of Prema, Tyaga and Nigraha.

We also have problems while dealing with some aspects of dharma. How do we justify some of the acts mentioned below as dhārmic acts?

Take the case of Bhishma of Mahābhārata who stood by the Kauravā-s and fights battle with the Pāņdavā-s although he knew that they were not the right people. His only explanation for supporting the bad King is to satisfy the promise given by him to Matsyagandhi that he would protect the kingdom and her progeny. He affirms that, as a citizen also, it is his dharma to protect the king and he stands by it.

In another case in Rāmāyaṇa, Vibhīşana deserts the king Rāvaṇa although he was his brother, as Rāvaṇa turns a deaf ear to all his good advice. Vibhishana goes to the enemy camp to avoid his non righteous brother. He not only goes there but tells all the secrets and helps Rāma in defeating Rāvaṇa.

Two people under identical situations take opposite views. In the case of Bhīşma, he decides to stay with the bad King. Whereas, Vibhīşaṇa decides to disown the bad King though he was his own brother and had given him the support all through. What is this confusion? It is a good case for attack by any one. In spite of this, in the eyes of deciders of Dharma, both are termed as Mahātmās. Both are termed as Dharmiṣṭā-s. If dharma were to be an end in itself, both cannot be right. If dharma were to be for dharma’s sake the two cannot be termed as Dharmiṣṭhā-s. Only one can be right and the other can be wrong. But we have now got a superior definition. <u>Whatever takes you to permanent happiness is Dharma</u>. Bhīşma acted as a custodian of a promise. Bhīşma as a vrataniṣṭha had no axe to grind. He was not acting as a coward. He had no cheap mortal motives. For purification of his mind or for higher scruples he stood by the side of a bad king taking it as his Dharma.

Same is the case with Vibhīşaṇa who was against any injustice being committed by his own brother. He was not craving for the throne. He was acting with the background of keeping his mind clean. The action is not as important as the motive behind. Here we can argue as to why Bhīşma did not act as Vibhīşaṇa. It is the question of one’s preference. Thus both are termed as Dharmiṣṭhā-s <u>An act done in the background of Chittashudhi or for the expansion of Chitta is Dharma</u>.

In the case of Paraśurāma who slayed his mother at the behest of his father, the argument can be on both sides. Here he stuck to the dictum, Pitṛudevo Bhāva. He could have taken the other stand and followed the dictum MātŗDevo Bhāva and disobeyed his father. In both the cases, he would have been a Dharmiṣṭa. Here, we can see that it is one’s own delicate preference which needs to be honoured. There is no running away or escapism or cunningness.

The benefit of understanding the concept of dharma at the fundamental level is to restructure Dharma. If Dharma was an end in itself then there is no salvation. We would all be adharmi-s from that angle. Kālidāsa in his epic poem Raghuvamśa described the four stages of man while referring to the dynasty of Raghu.

**शैशवे अभ्यस्त विद्यानां यौवने विषयैषिणाम् ।**

**वार्धके मुनिवृत्तीनां योगेनान्ते तनुत्यजाम्॥**

**Śaiśavē abhyasta vidyānāṁ yauvanē viṣayaiṣiṇām,**

**vārdhakē muni-vr̥ttīnāṁ yōgēna-antē tanu- tyajām.**

It shows how our ancestors gave importance to the four stages in the evolution of man. The first was the learning age called śaiśava or bālya. Then came the period of youvana of gṛhasta where there was freedom for enjoyment. Then they moved gently away from Bhoga during their old age by leading an ascetic life in the forest called vānaprastha. Finally, it was sanyāsa where even the smallest bhoga was given up to prepare for leaving the body.

There was no absoluteness about these things, as it was a matter of convenience. At respective stages it was possible for people to practice without any difficulty. All these dhārmic values were insisted upon for mental peace. Now, we can have any number of different ways in which the same peace could be cultivated.

Let us take a person who does not do worship of Gods. Is he an adharmi? NO. We have deliberated earlier that all kinds of pūjā-s are neutral activities which help in cleansing of minds. The said person may be practicing prāṇāyāma or meditation. So Dharma has alternatives. So, restructuring of Dharma is possible. Highly traditional people, rooted purely in dos and don’ts of the laws laid down did not understand the scope of dharma.

If the intention of the śāstrā-s were for upliftment of humanity then there are alternatives to the harsh and ungraceful ways practiced hitherto. Hundreds of substitutes are possible. A substitute for sandhya can be japa for longer times. One need not feel sorry that he has given up sandhya, now that he has a better tool with him. The subtler the level of sādhana, the superior you are as a protector of dharma. Whatever takes one to permanent mental peace is Dharma. <u>Please continue the practices with an understanding as to why they are prescribed and not with blind faith.</u>

Now we will analyse the following cases-the affair of Ahalya, Draupadi’s marriage, the cases of Parāśara and Kṛṣṇa where they all deviated from Dharma visibly, explicitly.

Ahalya was cursed with stone hood. Here, we have to take the curse as immobility for the body, with mind being intact. as we know that ātmā cannot die. Being the wife of a Ŗşi, the process of introspection and purification must have started by realising the fault. The period during which she was in stone hood was a period of tapasya for her. The tapasya was to conquer the forces of mind during correction phase. Here, let us understand as to what is pātivratya and why it was prescribed for a woman. Every prescription given either for man or woman is for his/her self control and growth. And pātivratya is one such prescription for woman for her spiritual growth and cittaśuddhi. Through conquering the instincts for sex, one manages cittaśuddhi. In the episode of Ahalya, after going through years of tapasyā of self purification, if she stands unaffected, unperturbed by the best of male beauty, Rāma, standing before her, we can say that she has conquered sex. Thus the intensions of pativratya are restored. Intension of any discipline is to push you up in the ladder of self purification – in this case it is pativratya, or conquest of sex by vicāra.

Draupadi’s case is interesting since she comes to an understanding with her five husbands that every year she will accept only one of them as her husband. The other four will stay as her brothers. If Arjuna is her husband Yudhiṣṭira is treated as her husband’s elder brother and that is all. How is this possible? It is an attitudinal change and is a possibility. In our daily life also, we will be seeing woman staying with her husband in a joint family where other male members of the family are treated as brothers. Every time Draupadi submitted herself to the discipline of staying with one husband only as per pātivratya-dharma. Once the intentions of the discipline are understood and appreciated, anything can be seen in that light.

Parāśara’s case is the most difficult of the three examples. Even an ordinary man can conclude that he has committed the sin by misbehaving with an unmarried girl. Parāśara could not even wait till he met the father of the girl and take his permission for marrying the girl. In spite of this, it is strange that he is called Bhagavān Parāśara! How do we account this absurdity? We have to apply the definition of Dharma in this case as follows - Dharma is one which takes you to mental balance through a series of disciplinary processes. When there is a scope for adharma or temptation, they can be conquered easily. Parāśara had reached the pinnacle of control of mind. Nothing in the world can shake him from that steadfastness. He has completely conquered the temptations. Cittaśuddhi of the highest order has been achieved by him. What is then dharma or adharma for such a person? Normal definitions of dharma do not apply to such people. Such laws are applicable to persons like us who are not completely free from worldly pleasures. So, whatever a sage like Parāśara does is dharma, be it sex or otherwise. Nothing can tilt him. Abstinence from temptations will not add further to his stability. The laws which were till now operative, will not operate on such a person. They are above such laws. They are called Dharmātīta.

Explained in a simple way, there are three major differences in the behaviour of human beings on earth.



1. **Un-ethical is the animal way of behaviour (Immoral).**
2. **Ethical is the natural way of sticking to human values (Moral)**
3. **Freedom from ethical values and dropping them when needed is not unethical, but it is A-ETHICAL or A-MORAL - above and beyond moral values.**

The laws of Dharma do not apply to persons of third category. This freedom from laws of Dharma are applicable to only such persons who have touched the source of creation and who have the capacity to confer boons or even to curse. For them, these laws are childish or elementary. They can take liberties with the laws of nature. This power we could see in Parāśara. He had the extraordinary powers of creation and thus could restore the virginity of Sugandhi. No one should quote Parāśara and take liberties. Parāśara could ward off the guilt sense or impurity sense on the part of Matsyagandhi in a trice.

This is the extra vision and courage of Hinduism which is not found elsewhere in the world. One could go beyond Dharma. This is the region of freedom which a brahmajñāni or Gods have access to. All others stop at the region of Dharma. Why did Parāśara do such an act? To show that such regions of freedom, that of Eshwara, exist. In this context we have a bold śloka in Bhagavad-Gīta (18-17):

**यस्य नाहंकृतो भावो बुद्धिर्यस्य न लिप्यते ।**

**हत्वापि स इमान् लोकान् न हन्ति न निबध्यते॥**

**Yasya na-ahaṁ-kr̥tō bhāvō buddhiḥ-yasya na lipyatē,**

**hatvā-api sa imān lōkān na hanti na nibadhyatē.**

Whoever does it in dispassion, in utter detachment and who is not affected by the event, even if he takes a sword and cuts off the whole mankind, he is not deemed to have killed anybody and the killing does not tarnish him. Another famous śloka from Bhagavad Gīta (2-45)-

**त्रैगुण्यविषया वेदा: निस्त्रैगुण्यो भवार्जुन ।**

**निर्द्वन्द्वो नित्यसत्वस्थो निर्योगक्षेम आत्मवान्॥**

**Traiguṇya-viṣayā vēdāḥ nistraiguṇyō bhava arjuna,**

**nirdvandvō nitya-satvasthō niryōgakṣēma ātmavān.**

Arjuna, this moral, ethical, etc, are within the regions of Satva, Rajas and Tamas. When one grows beyond the three guṇas, action right or action wrong has no meaning. Then, where is the Dhrama or adharma? That is what a Jñāni is. If application of dharma in the case of sage Parāśara is understood, then all absurdities of Kṛṣṇa are understood.

We have mundane examples also. We also take such short cuts in our life. As a scientist, we do it many times. Take for example of chemistry lab where an examination is going on and if a student makes a mistake of touching a small weight in his hand instead of using the forceps, marks will be deducted for that, as it is against the rules of weighing. Similarly the burette and pipette are to be rinsed before any solution is put in them. This is also a rule and no excuse will be given if someone violated this rule. Whereas, the Professor does not bother about this and easily handles the weights in his bare hands since he knows that, that much degree of accuracy is not needed in a particular test. Why? Because the purpose is served. But, the student is not spared as a matter of discipline. Whoever knows the implications of the law can violate the law without any objection, if the purpose is served.

A lineman of an electricity department handles a live wire with a simple gloves which is not permitted for others. He knows the intensity of electricity flowing through the line. A knowledgeable man who knows the why of a law, can violate the law if the point is served by it.

A simple Bhajan can be irritating for a person who is adopting a different method to calm his mind. Whereas, for the person doing bhajan it is a wonderful sādhana. A spiritual growth like bhajan can be a noise to another person. So, the laws are only conventional.

To summarise, it is important to adopt the principles of prema, tyāga and nigraha, which are the basis of dharma, cautiously after a full understanding of the consequences arising out of such practices and lead a life of complete happiness. This is the avenue open to one and all.


        Thank you for listening.


## LECTURES  ON  MĀNDŪKYA UPANIṣAD

Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad. which contains only twelve mantras belongs to Atharva-Veda. Although the Upaniṣad looks very small in narration; its greatness lies in the brevity with which it extols the aspect of Brahman.  Muktikopanṣad asserts that study of only this Upaniṣad is sufficient for any serious sādhaka to attain liberation - Ēkaṁ Māṇḍūkyam-ēva alaṁ mumukṣūṇām vimuktayē.

“Upaniṣadbrahmayogi” who has commented on the one hundred and eight Upaniṣad-s, called this Upaniṣad as Sarva Vedānta Sāriṣṭha (the essence of the entire Vedānta).    Ādi Śankara has called this Upaniṣad (which includes the Kārakā-s of Gaudapāda” as Sarva Vedānta Sāra Sangraha, in his Bhāṣya.

Just like in any other Upaniṣad, the theme of this Upaniṣad also is the extolling of Brahman. But the methodology used in this text is extra ordinary.  The main contents is the analysis of the three states experienced by all mortals, namely , Jāgṛt , Svapna and Suśupti (waking, dream and dreamless sleep states).   Through this, the Upaniṣad establishes the highest state of Turīya which is the state of Brahman. This is the great contribution of this Upaniṣad.

Prof Shastriji was at his best when he spoke on Manūkya Upaniṣad. He himself used to mention that he had read this Upaniṣad more than one hundred times to understand and appreciate the extolling of Omkāra. Omkāra sādhana being one of his favourite talks, I felt that any serious sādhaka should get to know the intricacies of the Omkāra.

The states of existence of a man has already been introduced in the Avastha Traya Parīkṣa. However an elaborate explanation of the two stages especially dream and sleep in the lecture is worth reading. Some of the talks on Māndūkya Upaniṣad contain excellent hints for a Sādhaka.

Shastriji has chosen some śloka-s from Gauapāda Kārika-s which have immense value. I have taken out the important ones and have reproduced here for the reader to benefit from them.

I am sure the reader will get the best out of the suggestions from the master. ---     Editor


### OMKĀRA UPĀSANA 
(MEDITATION ON OMKĀRA)

Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad** **is one of the ten major Upaniṣad-s admitted by Sampradāya. Sampradāya holds this Upaniṣad very high. In fact there is a śloka to show what status this Upaniṣad earns in the eyes of sampradāya. Muktikopaniṣad declares that the study of only Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad is sufficient to liberate an ardent student of Vedānta:

**एकं माण्डूक्यमेव अलं मुमुक्षूणाम् विमुक्तये ।**

**Ēkaṁ māṇḍūkyam-ēva alaṁ mumukṣūṇām vimuktayē.**

That means you can bypass all other details enumerated in other Upaniṣad -s and go straight to Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad and that is the right thing to do. Mumukṣu is a sādhaka who is after liberation. For his liberation, study of this Upaniṣad will give him the necessary guide lines and there is no need to waste time going through other vedāntic texts- says the axiom. Such a point of view on this Upaniṣad is reasonable because as I see there is no waste of time at all here- not a syllable, not a word which is extra is stated in this text than what is required. It is as straight as the flight of an arrow. There are no stories told in this Upaniṣad, no ākhyāyika and no dialogue between the master and the disciple as found in other Upaniṣad-s. Brevity of this order or an accuracy of this order is not seen elsewhere. That is why it is remarkable. People have rightly called it the best. Let us study the aspect of Omkāra as described in First Mantra of Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad:** **

**ओमित्येतदक्षरमिदग्ं सर्वं तस्योपव्याख्यानम् भूतम् भवद्भभविष्यदिति सर्वमोङ्कार एव।**

**यच्चान्यत्रिकालातीतं तदप्योङ्कार एव ।।**

**ŌM-iti-ētat-akṣaram-idagṁ sarvaṁ tasya-upa vyākhyānam bhūtam bhavat-bhaviṣyat-iti sarvam-ōṅkāra ēva,**

**Yat-ca-anyat-trikāla-atītaṁ tat-api-ōṅkāra ēva.**

(AUM, the word, is all this, the whole universe. A clear explanation of it is as follows: All that is past, present and future is, indeed, AUM. And whatever else there is, beyond the threefold division of time, space and causation also is truly AUM.)

This is the first mantra which tries to extol Omkāra. I always wondered why Upaniṣad-s have extolled Omkāra. Śankara quotes number of references** **from other Upaniṣad-s to show that there is hardly any vedāntic text without the mention of Omkāra. Let me explain my difficulty. Atman is nirguṇa - lakṣaṇarahita, without attributes. That is, all adjectives are withdrawn from the one who is the enjoyer, cognisor and the doer. Whatever lakṣaṇā-s we seem to possess are superimpositions on us are what śāstra wants to prove. If you drop them one after the other or en-block, whatever is the residue, is your Self. That is a satisfactory definition and is consistent for all of us to agree. But I could not understand as to why Omkāra has been extolled so much? I could not get the right vision until I went through Śankarā’s commentary on Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad which I want to share with you all.

**ओमित्येतदक्षरमिदग्ं सर्वं ।**

**Ōmiti-ētat-akṣaram-idagṁ sarvaṁ.**

OM, the word, means the whole world or the entire universe surrounding us, is Omkāra.  **तस्योपव्याख्यानम्  - Tasya-upa-vyākhyānam.**

Therefore it is but right that we make an extensive comment on this one or it is but right to make a special reference to Omkāra.

**भूतम् भवद्भविष्यदिति सर्वमोङ्कार एव ।**

**Bhūtam bhavat-bhaviṣyat-iti sarvam-ōṅkāra ēva**

Once the world is recognised as Omkāra -- the past, the present and the future is all Omkāra. The **past**is what the world has already moved past, the **present** is what we are now in actual contact, and the **future** is whatever we imagine or conceive about the world external or internal. As we have considered the world as Omkāra, the past, present and future should be included.

**यच्चान्यत्रिकालातीतं तदप्योङ्कार एव ।**

**Yat-ca-anyat-trikāla-atītaṁ tat-api-ōṅkāra ēva.**

Here again there is a concern or an element of mystery. Whatever is beyond kālatraya_ _or whatever is beyond the past, present and future is also considered as Omkāra. See how complexity has set in. What is it that can be there beyond past, present and future? Is it for the world or for the involver? The whole thing is already exhausted. Whatever is the aspect of the universe or jagat that is not covered by the past, present and future is also Omkāra as per this Upaniṣad. The answer to this anomaly is that these three - the past, present and the future - are the manifested versions or the visible versions of the jagat (the world) or of the phenomenon or the **sṛiṣṭi.** To elaborate: Jagat is represented in three words- nāma, rūpa and karma. This is again a grand stroke on the part of the vedāntin-s. Jagat is fully spoken of, when I say, it is the **śabda**portion or**nāma**, it is the**dṛṣya portion**or**rūpa**and it is the**activity portion**or**karma**. You cannot add a bit more to the definition, as perceived by the Indian thinker. Śankara presents this very well through an example as under:-

**अयं देवदत्तः  - Ayaṁ dēvadattaḥ_ - _-**This (person) is Devadatta.

He takes the example of a commoner, by name Devadatta.  That is, when I am referring to that person, I am uttering a word. This means that the name or the word represents the person. That is, Devadatta is the **nāma** aspect or the**śabda**aspect of jagat.

**देवदत्तः दीर्घः गौरः - Dēvadattaḥ dīrghaḥ, gauraḥ**.

Oh he is tall, he is fair skinned- that is the **rūpa** aspect or the**dṛṣya**aspect.

**देवदत्तः गच्छति - Dēvadattaḥ gacchati**- Devadatta walks along - that is the **karma**aspect or the activity aspect.

How can we further elaborate? The picture version is dṛṣṭigocara and the sound version is śravaṇagocara. So, nāma, rūpa and karma completely represent the manifested world or jagat. Why does the Upaniṣad add an extra, apart from the above three aspects?

**यच्चान्यत्रिकालातीतं तदप्योङ्कार एव ।**

**Yat ca anyat trikālātītaṁ tadapi ōṅkāra ēva**

The answer is that there is also an **un-manifested**version of the jagat or the world.We see the world as nāma, rūpa and karma, when it comes to its perception through the senses - indriyagocaratva. The ears can listen and grasp the components of the universe. I can visualize a form and that is the nāma aspect. I can see - the eyes can see the rūpa aspect. I can see a movement, say I walk – I can turn my neck- that is a vyāpāra, an activity-that is the karma aspect. This is the visible version or a manifested version called dṛggocara or Indriyagocara.

All of you know that there are five pañcabhutā-s as enunciated in Taittirīya Upaniṣad (2-1-2)

**एतस्मादात्मन आकाशस्सम्भूतः। आकाशाद्वायुः। वायोरग्निः। अग्नेरापः। अद्भ्यः पृथ्वी...**

**Ētasmāt-ātmana ākāśa-sambhūtaḥ, ākāśāt- vāyuḥ, vāyōragniḥ, agnērāpaḥ, adbhyaḥ pr̥thvī.**

Ākāśa, vāyu, agni, āpa and pṛthvi--that is, space, wind, fire, water and earth respectively. What happens when these aspects become subtler? To give a simple example - Ākāśa is not indriyagocara_–_not_ _perceivable _to _senses_ _and_ _vāyu is not dṛṣṭigocara-cognizable. By the time we come to Agni, Āpa and Pṛthvi a visible component has already set in. Agni has fire component, it shines and has rūpa. Āpa - also has rūpa. Pṛthvi, the earth which is coarser has rūpa.

Let us take the first two pañcabhutā-s or elements-ākāśa and vāyu. They are subtle in nature. There is no dṛṣṭi-gocaratva of the world in this stage of the element. Science has proved the existence of the element at the vāyu level. By taking a known volume of gas and weighing it one can positively say that it has existence. Much more subtle than vāyu is the ākāśa - the first creation from ātma as propounded in

Taittirīya Upaniṣad. So, ākāśa is the unseen version of the Jagat. Science accepts that. Electromagnetic radiations are there in the universe around us. We are not able to trace these impulses unless there is a right instrument to detect them and to label them or code them. That is the reference of the Upaniṣad here while declaring **Yat ca anyat trikālātītam pointing** to un-manifested version of the world. This is one aspect.

There is another aspect also. Universe is recognised as a heap of activity- vyāpāra-mātra- What a closeness in thinking of the modern scientist and our ancient rishis! Cognition is there in the Jñānendriyā-s, the manas and buddhi. Activities become sūkṣma or subtle at the level of buddhikośa itself. At the level of buddhi, without focusing, indriyavyāpāra is not possible. That is, Buddhikośa, the subtlest form of representation of ātma, is coming to the attention pose. Without attention cognition is not possible. Attention mood is the necessary prerequisite to enable the manas and the indriyā-s to cognize. So if you want to define buddhi in the best way, it is the attention posture or focussing posture. Otherwise visible world does not exist for anyone unless you cognise with focussing. Sometimes we say-“will you say that again, I am unable to follow you”. So to grasp a thing one has to come to the attention mood. So attention phase is a necessary precursor to the grasping or thinking stage. That means, attention is that property which makes us to cognise the world.

Beyond manas and budhikosa there are layers and layers of the Jagat. After Buddhi, śāstra recognizes two more components-- **Mahattattva**and **avyākṛta**. It is stated In Kathopaniṣad (1-3-10) as:

**इद्रिंयेभ्यः परा ह्यर्था अर्थेभ्यश्च परं मनः।**

**मनसस्तु परा बुद्धिर्बुद्धेरात्मा महान् परः॥**

**Indryēbhyaḥ parā hi-arthā arthēbhyaḥ-ca paraṁ manaḥ,**

**manasastu parā buddiḥ-buddhērātmā mahān paraḥ.**

(Beyond the senses are the objects, beyond the objects is the mind, beyond the mind is the intellect, and beyond the intellect is the expansive state of MERE ‘I’ NESS.)

The component subtler to manas or mind is buddhi or intellect. Subtler to buddhi there is the component recognised as mahattattva. In Mahattattva you are so expansive that localisation has not set in. That is to say, one cannot identify things like a pen or a table, etc. Only at the level of buddhikośa, focussing or indriyagocaratva is there. But Mahat is vyāpakatva or expansive state- which is very much like ākāśa. Further in Kathopaniṣad (1-3-11) it is stated that:

**महतः परमव्यक्तमव्यक्तान्पुरुषः परः।**

**पुरुषान्न परं किञ्चित्सा काष्ठा सा परा गतिः॥**

**Mahataḥ param-avyaktam-avyaktāt-puruṣaḥ paraḥ,**

**puruṣānna paraṁ kiñcit-sā kāṣṭhā sā parā gatiḥ.**

(Beyond Mahat is the Unmanifested; beyond the Unmanifested is the Purusha (the SELF) and Purusha is the ultimate.)

Sūkṣma or subtler than mahattatva one more component is posited which is called as  **avyākṛta.** How to conceive that? It is less and less of activity or pulsation. While Kathopanishad mentions this phase as **Mahattattva**and **Avyākṛta,** Taittirīya Upaniṣad mentions it as **ākāśa**. From atman, the first grossification is ākāśa.** **

Still it is not yet Brahma. These layers are recognised by the Upaniṣad  as- **Yat ca anyat trikālātītam ---** there is a universe subtler and which does not fall under the framework of Bhūta, Bhavat and Bhaviṣyat (past, present and future) represented by the nāma, rūpa, karma and **that is also Omkāra**.** **

**That also has to be dropped to get to your Brahmasthiti.**

There are two schools contradicting these things. One school says that you are in svarūpa/ātma in Nidrā or dreamless sleep. There is no jagat in nidrā. In svapna or dream there is the jagat of the inside. In jāgṛt there is a jagat of the outside... So in Nidrā since Jagat is not there it is ātma or it is svarūpa.

The other school denies this argument. You are still a component in this world although jagat is not there in dreamless sleep. You have only become sūkṣma or subtle. You are still not ātma or Brahma. What is the sūkṣmatva here? It is a mere pulsation – Kevala-Vyāpāra is there. You are in the form of mere pulsation. That means the vyāpāra has not yet disappeared. **A sādhaka has to make a note of this point.**Just because I have stopped cognising the visible world, the task is not yet over, the vyāpāra has not gone. There is an invisible component - a mere spandana or pulsation in you which is also a vyāpāra. A mere spandana can take the śabdadharma (sound version) or rūpadharma (picture version). But minus those two later positions it is a mere spandana which is nothing but prāṇic vibration.

So, there is no nāma, rūpa aspect here. But life exists as mere prāṇaspandana. Nidrā is not your true self because a movement is still there. So if that also is eliminated, i.e., if your prāṇavyāpāra is also quietened or softened, then that is the **nija-svarūpa.**

<u>So, in order to clearly show the difference, the Upaniṣad is saying- Yatcha_ _anyat_ _trikālātīta</u>ṁ <u>- that is, whatever is beyond the past present or future is also Omkāra. </u>

Now why this world is represented by Omkāra which is śabdarūpa or sound version? The Upaniṣad could have represented the world through dṛṣyarūpa or the picture version. Every object has a name. Ex, this is a book- this is a table etc. Every object that we see (or every rūpa carrying stuff) has a name. World is made up of objects -so the world can be condensed into a **set of names.**Look at the logic. World is nothing but innumerable objects. In this world--a wall, a brush, and an ornamental piece - every object or every dṛṣya has a counterpart in śabda. Therefore if the world is **dṛṣya-svarūpa** - **दृष्य‍स्वरूप**- one can also call it as **śabdasvarūpa** - **शब्दस्वरूप**.  Śankara in his commentary on Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad (Bhāṣya 1-5) comments on this thus—

**ओमिति एतदक्शरमिदम् सर्वम् इति यदिदम् अर्थजातम् अभिधेयभूतम् तस्य अभिधानाव्यतिरेकात् अभिधानस्य च ॐकाराव्यतिरेकात् ---**

**ŌM-iti ētat-akśaram-idam sarvam iti yadidam arthajātam abhidhēya-bhūtam tasya abhidhāna avyatirēkāt abhidhānasya ca ōm̐kāra avyatirēkāt.**

Name by which an object is revealed is Abhidāna. Or description of an object is abhidāna and whatever is described is abhideya. The material content is not different from its description. So any word is not different from the object described. And all these śabdā-s can be rendered into**a minimal version** or a mono syllable notation and that is OMKĀRA. Book, tea table, carpet are all multi syllable words. The simplest version of any name, if represented by sound, is**ummm... utterance** and that utterance is represented by the word**OM**. So,**the whole world is OM**. What a beautiful condensation of details!

That is what exactly the scientists do. Thousands of plant species are simplified into one word by grouping them as monocotyledons or dicotyledons. Hundreds of leafs can be brought into one term. Thousands of compounds in chemistry were brought under ninety six and odd elements. Simplification or generalization means reducing the complexity into smaller and smaller components. Chemists and Physicists thought that this was the final representation of the universe. But, the famous Crooks experiment or the cathode ray experiment showed that all the ninety six and odd elements are nothing but protons, electrons and neutrons. So the whole world is made up of three units. See the simplification that the science has achieved.

Exactly, such thinking is here in the vedantic research. I really marvelled at the explanation given by Śankara as I could not get to such deep analysis. My attack was- why this simplicity- why does everything be reduced to one word. Śankara alone could help me.

**परं च ब्रह्म अभिधानाभिधेयोपायपूर्वकमेव गम्यते इति ॐकार एव ।**

**Paraṁ ca brahma abhidhāna-abhidhēyaōḥ-upāya-pūrvakam-ēva gamyatē iti ōm̐kāra ēva.**

What is our object? Why are we becoming the students of the Upaniṣad -s? It is to get to know our true nature- the causal stuff out of which activity has sprung. We want to get to the pre- activity version of the universe. Therefore I will stay at the smallest activity (utterance of Omkāra) and then I drop even that to know the pre state.** **What is so big about this utterance? Śankara goes further in helping us (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 1, Śankara Bhāṣya 5.) as under:

**तस्य एतस्य परापरब्रह्मरूपस्य अक्षरस्य ॐ इत्येतस्य उपव्याख्यानम् ब्रह्मप्रतिपत्त्युपायत्वात् ब्रह्मसमीपतया विस्पष्टं प्रकथनं उपव्याख्यानम् ॥**

**Tasya ētasya parāpara-brahma-rūpasya akṣarasya ōm̐  iti-ētasya upa-vyākhyānam brahmapratipat-upāyatvāt brahma-samīpatayā vispaṣṭaṁ prakathanaṁ upa-vyākhyānam.**

**परापरब्रह्मणि तस्य एव ।**

**Para-apara-brahmaṇi tasya ēva.**

Omkāra is representative of aparabrahma-which means later position and parabrahma which_ _is the preposition. If you used the word Om, you have represented the later world and the prior world also. Two words are used in Vedānta:

aparabrahma is kāryabrahma-the changed brahma -- the vivartabrahma-the jagat. Jagat is an after position of brahma. The parabrahma is the causal brahma.

The importance of Omkāra is clear now. How is that? **Brahma samīpatayā –**It is very near or close to brahma.**brahmapratipat upāyatvāt -**It is a tool to reach your true nature or svarūpa As already discussed the whole world is activity and if you want to drop the activity or to find out the source of the activity what should be done? Reduce the activity to the minimum and then drop it. That is the only way. Words, sentences and texts books of statements are all reduced into one activity OM. In utterance of Om, a tinge of activity is there and its magnification is universe and the slipping or tapering down of activity is svarūpa. It is on the threshold point.

You hold on to the least activity and then naturally you slip into no activity. Millions of activities are reduced to just one syllable UMMM. If you drop this <u>makāra,</u> then it is close to Brahma -**OM...UMM...MMM...MMM...MMM....**

<u>So when makāra dies it is prāṇa and when prāṇa also softens it is svarūpa. And that is the glory of OMKĀRA.</u>

We have now represented the threshold point and a further explanation is necessary to justify this. The answer is that Om is so near to brahma that it needs a very small shift either to realize it or to get away from it. This justifies extolling Omkāra.

That is why we do** **not find any Upaniṣad that does not frequently refer to Omkāra. To know this aspect, it took me many years of purposeful thinking though I had read Mānḍūkya hundreds of times! But I had not taken the first mantra and the Śankarabhāṣya seriously. In fact I am not exaggerating if I were to say that there is enough material for lot of research.

When you come to sādhana what else is the way? When you advance in the sādhana the gāyatri that is being chanted tends to lengthen itself and the Japa starts decomposing itself when you slow down and finally it becomes Omkāra. Sri Rāmakṛṣṇa rightly said that:

Sandhya merges into Gayatri.

Gayatri merges into OM. and

Om, when you stretch, merges into silence and that is svarūpa.

This is also called as the turīya stage. Why?

**a**- component is very coarse,** **represents Jāgṛat, the outside world or even the jagat.

**u-**component corresponds to the inner sound and this is the dream equivalent which is subtler.

**ma**- component is nidrā equivalent which is still subtler- very very subtler level of prāṇavyāpāra is going on- spandana is there but this is not yet Brahma.

When **ma**merges into silence it is Turīya.

The question is- how does nidrā carry the element of jagat? Dwaitaprapañca is absent. So why do you say that it is a phased phenomenon? The answer is that there is sūkṣma-vyāpāra or prāṇavyāpāra -- spandana is there and respiration is going on.

Then should we stop respiration? Yes!!! Verily!!!

Are you saying that we should die?

<u>No. In death, we do not die. Death according to me is, that the prāṇa-citta cluster that is pulsating in the body, in our system, comes out and pulsates in ākāśa. Death has not occurred. Vyāpāranāśa or seizure of activity has not taken place. It is only a displacement from the inside to the outside. Real death means, that even this pulsation also should stop.</u>

**अप्राणोह्यमनाः शुभ्रोह्यक्षरात् परतः परः।**

**Aprāṇaḥ-hi-amanāḥ śubhraḥ-hi-akṣarāt parataḥ paraḥ.**(Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad  2-1-2)

Svarūpa is that one where there is no mind and no prāṇavyāpāra. But in nidrā we have kevala- vyāpāra. What we see as death for persons like us is--Death is just a displacement of the citta and prāṇa cluster. What about a jñāni, a realised person?

**न उत्क्रामन्ति अत्रैव अस्मिन्नेव परेणात्मना अविभागं गच्छन्ति।---समवनीयन्ते---**

**Na utkrāmanti atraiva asmin-ēva parēṇa-ātmanā avibhāgaṁ gacchanti---samavanīyantē---** (Bṛh.Upa. 3-2-1, Śankarabhāṣya)

Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad declares that there is no displacement of citta and prāṇa cluster for a Jñāni. It diffuses into omnipresence, never to re-collect itself, merges into limitless space. That is mukti in Indian thinking. The obstacle to mukti in all of us is the importance given by us for our existence. That is why many people cannot go into** **Samādhi.

Therefore one can get Brahmasthiti by operating at the śabda level. Omkāra is so near to Brahma. If you stay there and citta becomes Omkāra mātra you simply slide into self effortlessly. **Omkāra becomes a working tool to reach brahma.** We may appreciate the theoretical potion, but how do you reach that state? Only** **by sādhana of Omkāra upāsana one can attain that state.

**Q.** How do you explain the concept of Brahma?

**A.** A scientist of today is at a better advantage than our forefathers as we have superior tools in the way of science models. They never knew of the energy mass equivalence. They thought that both matter and energy were different and unrelated; until Einstein came on the scene and established that the mass is but a frozen energy or a compact energy. That means the universe is nothing but energy, either in the held up form or in a way suffering displacement.

Similarly calculus helped me. By definition if you say that the svarūpa is non doing and activity is jagat, how can svarūpa be the cause of jagat? It looks absurd, unthinkable and unacceptable. Śankara had to go through tremendous hurdles to manage this aspect during his time when science had not developed. How can two opposite things be related through janya-janaka sambandha? (The generator and the generated.) A scientist has to face problems of these types when Vedānta is to be appreciated.

How can activity begotten from non activity? <u>But when the activity is made softer and softer, we reach the closest point of non activity.</u> <u>Here, CALCULUS comes to our help. This was a knot that bothered me for years. Absolute zero need not be posited. In calculus we have a concept for zero which is understood as less than anything deemed to be smallest we agree upon. When two people agree on a thing less than one divided by ten to the power of ten as a thing that can be neglected and therefore be considered as tending to zero (or almost zero).</u>

So, how can energy be got from nothingness? But if you take the calculus language of defining things, we can have a very small number which cannot be comprehended, none the less it is still in the category of non-zero numbers. From that quantity you can have any big quantity up to infinity. This is an improvement of one’s understanding with the entry of calculus. Now it is very easy to understand Brahma.

Brahma according to me is not a no-activity principle. But it is a principle tending to no-activity state. All people, who are less than the mutually agreed level of activities, are brahmajñāni-s. There could be hundreds of types of brahmajñāni-s, but they are all well accommodated. So, we can easily understand the concept of Omkāra once you know the calculus language. The paradox of activity begotten from non activity is easily explained. This is the advantage of a modern thinker over the ancient thinkers.

Even Śankara had to concede and say that it was not brahma who created the jagat but māya created the jagat. My** **question was where is māya from? Then why do you say sarvam khalu idaṁ  brahma? You should have said saravam khalu idaṁ māyā instead of brahma. Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad declares that—

**सर्वंह्येतत् ब्रह्म अयमात्मा ब्रह्म सोयमात्मा चतुष्पात् ।**

**Sarvaṁ-hi-ētat brahma ayam-ātmā brahma sōyam ātmā catuṣpāt.**(Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 1-2)

Everything in the universe according to Vedānta is an after position of brahma- brahma tatkārya- not brahma in the unmodified way- karya brahma**-sopādhika-brahma – सोपाधिकब्रह्म.**Whereas, svarūpa is **nirūpādhika-brahma**–**निरुपाधिकब्रह्म -** where all adjectives are withdrawn, no lakṣaṇa stays whatsoever. Hence in svarūpa you have touched the brahma.  Let us study Śankara’s commentary—Soayaṁ ātmā- this true ‘me’ is of two kinds—

**परमार्थरूपः अपरमार्थरूपः इत्युक्तः ।**

**Paramārtha-rūpaḥ a-paramārtha-rūpaḥ iti-uktaḥ.**

They are:**अपरमार्थ ब्रह्म, परमार्थ ब्रह्म - aparamārtha brahma, paramārtha brahma -**  -  the former is the suffering version and the latter is the non suffering version of brahma.

**तस्य अपरमार्थरूपम् पादत्रयलक्षणम् आह ।**

**Tasya aparamārtha-rūpam pāda-traya-lakṣaṇam āha.**

**Aparamārtha brahma** has three phases, jāgṛt, swapna and suşupti which are the three after positions or kāryasthāna-

**तस्य परमार्थरूपम् पादत्रय निराकरणेन आह ।**

**Tasya paramārtha-rūpam pāda-traya nirākaraṇēna āha.**

Here is the unmanifested/causal version, paramārtha-svarūpa version - kāraṇabrahma- attained by negating the three positions of kāryabrahma.

**Q.**What are Abhidhāna and Abhidheya?

**A.** A description in the form of śabda is Abhidhāna and a pictorial description is Abhidheya. For reaching the aspect of brahma –both the methods are available and you can choose what you feel appropriate. Sarvām khalu idaṁ brahma –can be approached by picture way or ayam ātmā brahma by the śabda way. Om iti ētat akṣaram idaṁ sarvam. Both the śabda version and dṛṣya version have equal prominence. **You can go back to the origin either by the śabda route or dṛṣya route**.

**Q**. What is the advantage of this ekatva dṛsti?

**--- एकेनैव प्रयत्नेन युगपत् प्रविलापयन् तत् विलक्षणम् ब्रह्म प्रतिपद्येत इति ॥**

**--- ēkēna-ēva prayatnēna yugapat pravilāpayan tat vilakṣaṇam brahma pratipadyēta iti.**

(Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad  1 Śankarabhāṣya, 7)

**A.** That is a beautiful explanation**.**You can go by the śabda way to the origin, in which process the other is automatically covered. If you dissolve one type of activity, all other type of activities are dissolved. Ākāśadharma or vyāpakatva is established. So the sādhaka need not do all softening methods, but can tackle one when others vanish simultaneously. This is the master stroke of Śankara.

### STATES OF EXISTANCE 

We will discuss now as to what clue a sādhaka gets from the study of the different states of existence of man as enumerated in Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad.The first state is- (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 3)

**जागरितस्थानः बहिष्प्रज्ञः सप्ताङ्ग एकोनविंशतिमुखः स्थूलभुग्वैश्वानरः प्रथमः पादः॥**

**Jāgarita-sthānaḥ bahiḥ-prajñaḥ saptāṅga ēkōnaviṁśati-mukhaḥ sthūla-bhuk vaiśvānaraḥ prathamaḥ pādaḥ.**

(The waking state outwardly conscious, having seven limbs and nineteen doors, enjoying gross objects common to all, is the first State.)

You are in a capacity of cognizing the world outside of you. Bahiṣprajñaḥ–your cognising capacity is outward. Then – saptāńgaḥ –You are seven limbed. Ekonavimśati mukhaḥ –You have one less than twenty that is nineteen faces. These are the ventilators or the outlets by which you contact the outside world.

They are five karmendriyā-s -five senses or indriyā-s of excreting, procreating, moving, grasping, and speaking,

Five Jnānendriyā-s -the five cognitive senses of smelling, tasting, seeing, touching, and hearing- Pañca prāṇā-s - five prāṇas -prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, udāna, and samāna.

Four functions of mind or aspects of antaḥkaraṇa, the inner instrument-- which are manas, buddhi, citta and ahaṁkāra.

Through these outlets man touches the outside world and relates them. This is one aspect of ‘me’ or one version of ‘me' or one pāda of ‘me’. After perceiving he enjoys. Likes and dislikes begin to operate. He begins to choose good and bad (priya-apriya – sukha-duḥkha) with his capacity to perceive the outside world, capacity to enjoy and capacity to do (Jñātṛtva-Bhoktṛtva-Kartṛtva). This is my jāgṛtāvastha. What a beautiful condensation of details! Hundreds and thousands of my activities are brought under one term- jāgaritasthāna. This fellow in the jāgṛt-avastha is called **Vaiśvānara**. He is sthūlabhuk- he is enjoying the gross world, its likes and dislikes, sukha and duḥkha etc.

Just as there is an outside world, there is an inside world which is our second state - (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 4)

**स्वप्नस्थानोऽन्तःप्रज्ञः सप्ताङ्ग एकोनविंशतिमुखः प्रविविक्तभुक्तैजसो द्वितीयः पादः।**

**Svapna-sthānaḥ antaḥ-prajñaḥ saptāṅga ēkōnaviṁśati-mukhaḥ pravivikta-bhuk taijasaḥ dvitīyaḥ pādaḥ.**

(The dream state, inwardly conscious, having seven limbs and nineteen doors, enjoying subtle objects that are luminous, is the second version of me or pāda of me.)

It is called svapna-sthāna--is similar to jāgaritasthāna -is a duplication of the first state with a difference that the world you are connecting is not the outside world but the inside world. It has the same three capacities, jñātṛtva, kaṛtutva, bhoktṛtva- but the world is inside – svapna-prapañca. The vāsanā-s of jāgṛt are imprinted in the memory centres and shows up in dream with all the details and all the intricacies- the dreaming of a serpent is so real that the dreamer shudders and shouts only to find out that it is false.

He is called **taijasaḥ**- the world that he is transacting is tejomātra. Everything is optical or ethereal. How do you distinguish the inside world from the outside world? To me, the objects in jāgṛt have a mass, but there is no mass in dream world. One can lift a mountain or even fight with a demon which is impossible in jāgṛt. Otherwise that world is as much a world as the one in which we are all there, in terms of details like sounds and pictures. In svapna he is pravivktabhuk- the enjoyment he has is of the subtle inside world.

**Q**. There seems to be no recording in svapna where as in jagṛt there is a definite imprint on the mind. Can you elaborate on this?

**A**. The possible explanation is- this jāgṛt phase is different from svapnasthāna wherein every day, the dream content is different. No two dreams are identical whereas jāgṛt does not change. In jāgṛt, there is some law operating whereas, within the dream there is no consistent law operating. There is no consistent event taking place and changes are so rapid that there is no relation between two events. Although the time scales are different between the jāgṛt and the dream phase, there is no law operating in the dream.

The laws in jagṛt are intact and are applicable to everyone and there is no dispute here, where as the laws in dream varies from person to person. It cannot be argued that the jāgṛt is different every day by the simple logic that if one keeps a material on the table, the previous night before going to sleep; the material will be in the same place when he wakes up the next day. The details are intact between today’s and tomorrow’s jāgṛt. In a dream there is no connection between two dreams. So, jāgṛt has a more steady and enduring quality than the dream state.

The argument that one has created this outside world is easily defeated by the point that the laws have not changed and the individual is not capable of changing them. So this world is not created by ‘me’. Similarly the dream world also cannot be manipulated. Actually my own position is that the spandanā-s released in the cosmos collect themselves into a pattern and give us a dream, but the world of imagination is in our hands.

Now we can distinguish between two worlds. The world of dreams which is ethereal and over which we have no control. Whereas in the jāgṛt, it is possible to imagine what we need and also reject what we do not want. This is actually the inside world with ‘me’ as the creator. We cannot say that we are creating many unpleasant things and are suffering as no one would create things for suffering. We have no volition in the dream since dream is throwing images helplessly from the memory centre. The point of importance is that the real jagat (as a dream) has a mass and dream jagat has no mass. Therefore this world or the inside world is created by something called ‘ātmā’ or the mind.

An all pervading consciousness principle has created the visible world. This world being the world of imagination, can also be created by a consciousness is the pre vedāntic position. Whether it is Īśvarā’s or my consciousness is debatable. One thing is certain that the world is not a creation of my consciousness because I cannot make a thing desired by me. I should be able to make and unmake things. So I cannot agree that this world is my projection.

I can however agree that another consciousness in the capacity of Īśvara has projected this world and I am vibrating in resonance. That is possible. If I insist on my world of imagination and if it is very strong then the pictures can stay longer. Paatanjalividyā says that.

Svapnasthāna is a phase where you show that you are the projector of the universe. One may argue that jāgṛt is created by someone else, but the proof is in the dream world. We call svapna unreal because it is not possible for us to hold a picture or sound for a longer time. Our minds are fickle-there is such a cāncalya that it is impossible to hold a picture of even our iṣṭadevata.

If one could hold the picture of say ’Kālimāta’ like Sri Rāmakṛṣṇa, which was so real to him then the matter is very much different. He had such a conviction that he answered Vivekānanda in affirmation that he has seen God just as he is seeing Vivekānanda. He further said that he could show him God if Vivekānanda was so interested. Nobody in the world has made such a daring statement till today. That was his capacity to create any object. So it is the question of dhārana. Still, it could be ethereal and that is the whole message of Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha.

**दृष्टासु अस्यमात्रेण देहः अदेहतां याति ।**

**Dr̥ṣṭāsu asya-mātrēṇa dēhaḥ a-dēhatāṁ yāti.**

A point comes where he says that body does not exist and is only an imagination. If you emphasise that view, the body vanishes- it is terrible to imagine! If your imagination is so strong and insisting, then adeha becomes deha.

**Yōga saṁsiddhi saṁvidām  - योग** संसिद्धि **संविदाम्।**For those who are experts in yoga - **sulabhēyam –सुलभेयम्** - it is very easy- says Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha. The consciousness that can divide and hold on the object of imagination is called **citta-vicchēda** - **चित्तविछेद.** This aspect was called **prāṇa-pratiṣṭa** - **प्राणप्रतिष्ठ**. It is a surprise to all of us.

The Svapna is not important for our sukha-duḥkha study, but it is to understand whether we can get a clue for the creation. Does the Indian position about creation have any meaning to the modern world or the modern scientist? Science has begun to recognise the role of Consciousness in the creation of Universe. Can we subscribe to that or is the position too weak for want of sufficient data? The dream world which is as intricate as the one we experience is created by the consciousness. Therefore we are tempted to suspect that this intricate world with all the energy-mass has been created likewise. Can we conclude that way and if so, are we reasonable or not, should be the scientific study. Otherwise there is no importance to svapna phase discussion which we did till now.

But Vedānta takes a different view. Can we ever say as to what the dream fellow experiences is unreal? We never have an impression that we are passing through the dream phase while dreaming. We say that, only when we wake up. Gauḍapāda takes up this question and devotes a whole chapter called Vaitathya Prakaraṇa. It is very difficult to understand that prakaraṇa. We should only wonder and keep quiet when things come to our mind about creation.

Now we will go to the next important state.( Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 5)

**यत्र सुप्तो न कञ्चन कामं कामयते न कञ्चन स्वप्नं पश्यति तत्सुषुप्तम् । सुषुप्तस्थान एकीभूतः प्रज्ञानघन एवानन्दमयो ह्यान्दभुक्चेतोमुखः प्राज्ञस्तृतीयः पादः॥**

**Yatra suptō na kañcana kāmaṁ kāmayatē na kañcana svapnaṁ paśyati tat suṣuptam.**

**Suṣuptasthāna ēkībhūtaḥ prajñānaghana ēva- ānandamayō hi-ānanda-bhuk-cētō-mukhaḥ prājñaḥ tr̥tīyaḥ pādaḥ.**

We are thinking of the third phase of human existence, the first two being the waking state and the dream state. Sleep is now defined. I wonder at the excellent definition which even the present day psychologists are unable to condense into such form.

**Na kañcana kāmaṁ kāmayatē** -no emotions what so ever- kāma is rāga, dveṣa and bhaya - attraction, repulsion and fear - inferiority complex, irritability, violent emotions

**Na kañcana svapnaṁ paśyati -** emotional components of the mind are absent and thinking component of the mind is also absent. Svapna includes the jāgṛt perception also.

**Tat suṣuptam -** excellent definition for characterising nidrā. You have a dreamless sleep. Thinking and emotional aspects are absent.

The teacher says that you are neither in waking nor in dream state, where dwaitabodha or duality is not there. There is a knower and a world that is known in the other two states- a cognisor and the cognized. This is absent in nidrā. We glorified the waking state saying that all that was in it is essential part of us. Although he is spending half of his time in nidrā, he is underscoring the same without giving it any importance. If one can appreciate this, his anxiety will go. This shows our priorities are wrongly taken. A precise definition for Nidrā is called prājñāsthiti or suṣuptasthiti. Vaishvānara or jāgṛt, taijasa or svapna, prājña or suśupti are the three pādā-s or attributes to man. We have to understand the contents of nidrā and adopt it in the jāgṛt phase.Śankara clarifies why this happiness is due to (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad-5, Śankarabhāṣya-16).

**अत्यन्तानायासरूपा हि इयं स्थितिः अनेन अनुभूयते इति आनन्दभुक्।**

**Atyanta-anāyāsa-rūpā hi iyaṁ sthitiḥ anēna**

**anubhūyatē iti ānanda-bhuk.**

Any sukha is āyāsa-rāhitya. What is the āyāsa that was found in jagrat and svapna and which is absent in nidrā?

**मनसः विषय विषय्याकारस्पन्दनायासदुःखाभावात् आनन्दमयः।**

**Manasaḥ viṣaya viṣayi-ākāra-spandana-āyāsa duḥkha-abhāvāt ānanda-mayaḥ.**

You are continuously** **oscillating between two pulsations - thinking and emotions which are the taxing elements.

**तत् रहितत्वात् आनन्दभुक् - tat rahitatvāt ānandabhuk -**the absence of these two gives ānanda.** **

**दर्शन स्मरणे ऎव हि मन: स्पन्दिते -  darśana smaraṇē eva hi manaḥ spanditē**- Mind reacts only to the experiences of senses as well as memory.

**तदभावे हृद्येव अविशेषेण प्राणात्मना अवस्थानम् ।**

**Tat-abhāvē hr̥di-ēva aviśēṣēṇa prāṇa-ātmanā avasthānam -**In the absence of it** **you are mere spandana of prāṇa.

We should never lose sight of the main issue of our study which is to **give us clarity about what should man do in the name of coming out** **of duḥkha and attaining permanent happiness.** We should search for situations where we are permanently happy.

In jāgṛt it is a divided happiness, broken as it were. Such a thing is not there in nidrā. One could pose a naughty question as to why he should study the nidrā phase in man! The lesson is, that it is the happiest state by anybody’s admission and is not because of any religious brainwashing. Every one, whether he is cultured or not says that nidrā is the happiest state. Man would forego anything in preference to sleep.

For the pursuit of happiness what are the characteristics we have to adopt?

**Na kañcana kāmaṁ kāmayatē na kañcana svapnaṁ paśyati.**The hint here is very clear. These were the two elements of burden both in Jāgṛt and Svapna. Kāma is an agitated state or fastness. A scientific thinker can put all the factors like kāma, krodha, mada, mātsarya, lobha and moha condensed into one term—as **vega**-force or **speed** inside us. Physical speed is nothing compared to mental speed. We can say that there is a volcano inside. We don’t have to conquer the forces inside one by one, but we can control only the mental speed and with the result, the other untamed forces also reduce slowly.

The teacher says that one cannot under-rate the sleep phase. Why?

Ānandabhuk, ānandmayaḥ- the whole study is here. Here is a clue for eliminating duḥkha. You are enjoying ānanda in nidrā, whereas you are enjoying the outside world in jāgṛt, which is a combination of sukha and duḥkha. You are happiness itself in nidrā. Here is a method by which one can always be happy.

What is the method by which one can always be happy? Whatever are the constituents of sleep must be responsible for happiness. If you want happiness, do not create disturbing emotions and thoughts**. Staying in wakeful state incorporating the characteristics of nidrā is the solution for lasting happiness**. That is all Vedānta. Everyone in the world does not miss sleep. They even go the extent of taking a sleeping pill for that purpose.

Sleep is alright in one way, but is not all, as some forces trap or trip you to sleep and you are helpless. If one wants to be in a state of ānanda, all the characteristics of nidrā has to be introduced voluntarily in the jāgṛt state. This state is called jāgṛn-nidrā or ajādya-nidrā.

**प्रत्यङ्विबोधैक बलेन पुंसां।**

**प्राचीन गन्धेषु पलायितेषु ।**

**प्रादुर्भवेत् काचित् अजाड्य निद्रा ।**

**प्रपञ्चचिन्तां परिमार्जयन्ति॥**

**Pratyaṅvibōdhaika balēna puṁsāṁ,**

**prācīna gandhēṣu palāyitēṣu,**

**prādurbhavēt kācit ajāḍya nidrā,**

**prapañca-cintāṁ parimārjayanti.**

On the strength of realisation of Self a person retreats from tendencies gathered over several lives. Then, dawns a state similar to slumber sans its impurity by the result of which all the worldly sorrows get completely extinguished.

An excellent śloka. Through this analysis and this parīkṣa you can know where happiness lies. Happiness lies in the non-doing when all the Vāsanā-s are washed away by vicāra. You get the wakeful sleep or invited nidrā or calculated nidrā. Contemplation is necessary to accept this point.

Perform all the tasks of your wakeful state in a leisurely manner and incorporate the qualities of non-doing in doing, then doing becomes simple and effective. Bhagavad Gīta (4-8) asserts:

**कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येदकर्मणि च कर्म यः।**

**स बुद्धिमान् मनुष्येषु स युक्तः कृत्स्नकर्मकृत्॥**

**Karmaṇi-akarma yaḥ paśyēt-akarmaṇi ca karma yaḥ,**

**sa buddhimān manuṣyēṣu sa yuktaḥ kr̥tsnakarmakr̥t.**

He who sees action in inaction and inaction in action is a wise and strong man. He is a yogi and performer of all actions. Can we come to the conclusion that there is no vyāpāra in nidrā as compared to jāgṛt? As per śāstra it is not a state of a-vyāpāra, but vyāpāra exists in seed form. Seed version means something that is hidden. It is prāṇa vyāpāra. Prāṇa is the general activity whereas thinking and emotions are specialized activities. If there was no vyāpāra, it is not possible to come back from sleep. As opined in Śankarabhāşya 24 on** **Gauḍapāda Kārika-2

**निर्बीजतयैव चेत् सति लीनानाम् संपन्नानाम् सुषुप्त -प्रलययोः पुनरुत्थानानुपपत्तिः स्यात् । मुक्तानाम् पुनरुत्पत्ति प्रसङ्गः।	**

**Nirbījatayā-ēva cēt sati līnānām saṁpannānām suṣupta-pralayayōḥ punarutthāna anupapattiḥ syāt, muktānām punarutpatti prasaṅgaḥ.	**

To come back, you have to infer that there is a bījarūpa of vyāpāra, that is, the general activity of prāṇa. In jāgṛt a fatigue point is reached in two hours. Whereas in nidrā, it takes six hours to reach the fatigue point since there is a very feeble vyāpāra. In Samādhi, it takes much longer. In fact you are comfortable even after you return to Jāgṛt. It took a very long time for Prahlāda to come back from Samādhi -** mahatā tēna śabdēna vaiśṇava prāṇa janmanaḥ -  महता तेन शब्देन वैश्णव प्राण जन्मन:।** a very big śankhanāda (sound of a conch) had to be blown to wake him up from Samādhi.

The more relaxed you are, the more time it takes you to come to the activity phase.** **In the light of this how do you do sādhana? Reduce the thought speed and emotion speed if you want to perform. Leisureliness is not anti productive as per śāstra. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (5-7-9) puts it beautifully-

**बहिरुन्मत्तताण्डवः अन्तःशीतलतयता समधिरिति कथ्यत**॥

**Bahiḥ-unmatta-tāṇḍavaḥ antaḥ śītalatayatā samadhiḥ-iti kathyata**.

Although outwardly he appears to be in a ecstatic drunken state he is extremely cool internally – that is the Samādhisthiti.

**निस्त्रैगुण्ये पथि विचरतां को विधिः को निषेधः।**

**Nistraiguṇyē pathi vicaratāṁ kō vidhiḥ kō niṣēdhaḥ.** (Śukāṣṭakam)

For people who are hovering in realised state which is right and which is wrong. Everything seems fine and good. This state is called Turīya (Māṇḍ. Upaniṣad -7)

**नान्तःप्रज्ञं, न बहिष्प्रज्ञं**, **नॊभयतःप्रज्ञं**, **न प्रज्ञानघनं**, **न प्रज्ञं**, **नाप्रज्ञं अदृश्यं**, **अव्यवहार्यं**, **अग्राह्यं**, **अलक्शणं**, **अचिन्त्यं**, **अव्यपदॆश्यं**, **ऎकात्मप्रत्ययसारं**, **प्रपञ्चोपशमं**, **शान्तं**, **शिवं**, **अद्वैतं**, **चतुर्थं मन्यन्तॆ**, **स आत्मा स विज्ञॆयः॥**

**Na-antaḥ-prajñaṁ, na bahiḥ-prajñaṁ**, **na- ubhayataḥ-prajñaṁ**, **na prajñāna-ghanaṁ**, **na prajñaṁ**, **nā-prajñaṁ adr̥śyaṁ**, **avyavahāryaṁ**, **agrāhyaṁ**, **alakśaṇaṁ**, **acintyaṁ**, **avyapadeśyaṁ**, **ekātmapratyayasāraṁ**, **prapañcōpaśamaṁ**, **śāntaṁ**, **śivaṁ**, **advaitaṁ**, **caturthaṁ manyante**, **sa ātmā sa vijñeyaḥ.**

**Na antaḥprajñaṁ, na bahiṣprajñaṁ** - Both the inside and outside world are ruled out.

**Na prajñaṁ nāprajñaṁ naprajñānaghanam**- Not even the mere activity version of you-not even the prāṇa svarūpa.

**Prapañca upaśamaṁ śāntaṁ śivaṁ advaitam**-You are so relaxed and non doing that you are peace itself-one need not be afraid ofthis state. There is no touch of duality.

**Caturthaṁ manyante**-Knowers of wisdom call this the fourth state- **sa ātmā sa ca vijñeyaḥ**- That has to be rediscovered by the sādhaka.

Śankara raises a point regarding the turīya state. When a fourth position is enunciated it means that it is- **स एष नेति नेत्यात्मा - Sa eśa neti netyātmā--**. There is no way of explaining this state except by negating vaiśvānara, taijasa or prājñā–This is a major hint for sādhaka. Śankara while commenting on various occasions infers that there is no positive definition for Brahma. According to him the best definition is—**Neti neti ityeva brahma grāhyam- नेति नेति इत्येव ब्रह्म ग्राह्यम्**. When the urge to search stops, you are in brahma. It cannot be perceived. It is not a result of cognition. One of the best śloka-s is from Kena Upaniṣad(1-6).

**यन्मनसा न मनुते एनाहुर्मनो मतम्।**

**तदेव ब्रह्म त्वं विद्धि नेदं यदिदमुपासते॥**

**Yan-manasā na manutē ēna-āhurmanō matam,**

**tat-ēva brahma tvaṁ viddhi nēdaṁ yadidam-upāsatē.**

That which has given the cognizing power for the mind is brahma. The śloka has a poetic grandeur. The prior state to prāṇa, the prior state to the seeing power, the prior state to the listening power, the prior state to the talking power, the prior state to the thinking power is Bhrahma.

**Q.** Why Turīya is not considered as nidrā?

**A.** You must see the abstractness to which the student is compelled to rise. Dvaitasya agrahaṇa- Non  experience of duality is common to both in the nidrā and turīya phase. Why don’t you stop at the nidrā phase? What is there to drop? Since the activity did not go completely in nidrā, it is still an incomplete state. In Man.Up.1- Ka.11 it is stated that-

**कार्यकारण बद्धौ ताविष्येते विश्वतैजसौ ।**

**प्राज्ञः कारणबद्धस्तु द्वौ तौ तुर्ये न सिध्यतः॥**

**Kārya-kāraṇa baddhau tāviṣyētē viśva-taijasau,**

**prājñaḥ kāraṇa-baddhastu dvau tau turyē na sidh‌yataḥ.**

The observer in jāgṛt and svapna are bound by two types of bandhanā-s- kārya-bandhana and kāraṇa-bandhana. Emotions, rāga and dveṣa are kārya-bhandana. Un-specified general pulsation (as in Nidrā) is kāraṇa-bandhana. They are entrapped by helplessness.

**Prājñaḥ kāraṇa baddhastu-**prājñā is burdened only by the kāraṇa- bandhana (un-specified general pulsations).

**Dvau tau turye na sidhyataḥ** - Turīya is different this way that it is neither bound by kāraṇa-avidyā nor kārya-avidyā. Further, in Māṇ.Up.1-Kā.12 Gauḍapāda says-

**नात्मानं न परांश्चैव न सत्यं नापि चानृतम्।**

**प्राज्ञः किञ्चन संवेत्ति तुर्यं तत् सर्वदृक् सदा॥**

**Na-ātmānaṁ na parāṁ-ca-ēva na satyaṁ na-api ca-anr̥tam,**

**prājñaḥ kiñcana saṁvētti turyaṁ tat sarvadr̥k sadā.**

In prājñā, there is no cognition of visible and invisible forces. In turīya the person is in total awareness. After Buddhikośa, when we go to mahattatva and avyākṛta, world is not there. But the causal forces are in operation. Mere spandana operates. This spandana takes specific forms when it grossifies into cetana. Śankara says-

**या सा प्रज्ञा सा प्राणा या सा प्राणा सा प्रज्ञा |**

**Yā sā prajñā sā prāṇā yā sā prāṇā sā prajñā**

They call it prāṇa or prājña or avyākṛta or bīja nidrā or tamas-all are equivalent. In Kenopaniṣad (1-4) the teacher asks you to note-

**अन्यदेव तद्विदितादथो अविदितादधि।**

**Anyadēva tat-viditāt-athō aviditāt-adhi.**

It is other than the seeable and unseen world. But in turīya, even the avidita forces are dissolved.

How do you dissolve the avidita forces? You keep on reducing the vāsanā-s such as rāga, dveṣa, krodha and the creative forces like attention which captures details. Only in the focusing stage, there can be a flower, a tree etc. Objects are formed by giving contours and by giving edges. In nidrā state, because of shell expansion, the attention goes. There is sańkocata in jagrat and svapna. The sańkocata is the one that creates details of desired shape. The ānanda in nidrā is because of softness of forces. **In fact you stop attention when you want to go to nidrā.**

But when you come to turīya, none of these exist. Prāṇa is also thinned out in turīya. Even according to science, there cannot be annihilation of anything–so confinement spreads. You exist in the spread version. **It is not death but immortality**. What can nothingness die into? This nothingness is sattā. Vedānta is sometimes wonderful, but at times it is dreadful- that is why we don’t go to that state! We prefer to be safe here only. We are only more comfortable by slowing down the activity and feel happier. When the system breaks barriers, then enlightenment happens.

Even in praļaya we are all not gone. Then why bother about liberation? **Simho vā maṣako vā vyāghro vā**—**सिंहो वा मषको वा व्याघ्रो वा** the lion, the mosquito, the tiger or anybody-**tattat jñānakarma vāsanāṅkitaḥ sapraviśanti-** **तत्तत् ज्ञानकर्म वासनांकितः सप्रविशन्ति‍ -**they come here and retain their sūkṣma tendencies. Our tendencies do not die in praļaya or even in nidrā - this is in Chāndogya Upaniṣad. Whereas, a jñāni softens the activities and comes to a phase where even the prāṇadharma gets dropped. Such a man cannot come into the cycle of creation.

**न उत्क्रामन्ति अत्रैव अस्मिन्नेव परेणात्मना अविभागं गच्छन्ति ।**

**Na utkrāmanti atra-ēva asmin-ēva parēṇa-ātmanā avibhāgaṁ gacchanti.**

If you are not bothered about the consequences, what is wrong with performance? None of us ever complain that our heart is beating and we are carrying a burden! Softer level of activity can be there due to which there is no cause for complaint. That is mukti.

**Q.** Is there a test to know if one has grown spiritually?

**A**. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha (6-4-6) refers to this aspect thus:

**एतावदेव खलु लिङ्गमलिङ्गमूर्तेः**

**संशान्त संसृति चिरभ्रम निवृतस्य ।**

**तज्ञस्य यन्मदन कोप विषाद मोह**

**लोभापदां अनुदिनं निपुणं तनुत्वम्॥**

**Ētāvadēva khalu liṅgamaliṅga-mūrtēḥ**

**saṁśānta saṁsr̥ti cirabhrama nivr̥tasya,**

**tajñasya yan-madana kōpa viṣāda mōha**

**lōbha-āpadāṁ anudinaṁ nipuṇaṁ tanutvam.**

What are the symptoms by which we can identify the realised soul who is established in peace and for whom the eternal illusory cycle of birth and death has come to an end and who is bereft of any external symbols? He can only be identified by the gradual thinning down of forces like sex, anger, anguish, delusion and greediness day by day in him.

Rāma asks this very same question- How do you judge a jñāni? By what symptoms can I say that a person is growing? Vāsiṣṭa says that it is very difficult to label a jñāni or judge him symptomatically. He is just like any other person A jñāni has no lakṣaṇā-s - but then?- Tajñasya - for a jñāni, the forces like sex, anger, depression, confusion, greed etc. are all thinning down every day. It is a continuous process of purification.

This is a test for you also. Check whether you react or to what level you react when you are faced with the unruly forces. If you do not react then there is a marked improvement in you. Śāstra is an applicable science.

How much can one be like a Jñāni depends on one’s intensity of sādhana. It also depends on the stock of vāsanā-s one carries.

It took me twenty years to come to the level of an average man’s comfort after this clarity came to me. Sādhana cannot be a complicated one as the problems are only two. Speed and focusing are the only ones that lead one to react when confronted by evil forces. Conscious lessening/thinning of these two aspects in one’s life is the sādhana. Diffusion should start when such tendencies come. One has to develop the ‘let go’ attitude. This is all sādhana. There cannot be a third method.


### A FEW GEMS FROM GAUDAPĀDA

_Gauḍapāda Kārikā-s are an integral part of the Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad. Certain portions of the Kārika-s are considered as Upaniṣad itself. Gauḍapāda was, by tradition, the philosophical grand preceptor of Śankara. His Kārika on the Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad is the oldest known systematic exposition of Advaita Vedānta. The Kārika is a commentary in verse on the Upaniṣad. It falls into four sections: 1. Āgama Prakaraṇa 2.Vaitathya Prakaraṇa (Illusion) 3.Advaita Prakaraṇa (Non duality) and 4.Alātaśānti Prakaraṇa (Extinguishing a burning torch.)_

_The first section is a brief systematic exposition of the Upaniṣadic text, following its distinction of differrent states of consciousness. Several of the most important Indian commentators treat the Āgama Prakaraṇa as part of the scriptural text of Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad. _

_The second section moves beyond the text of the Upaniṣad to establish the unreality of the things experienced in dreams and by analogy, the things experienced in the waking state. All these are but MĀYĀ, illusion. Gauḍapāda emphasized the essential unity of waking and dreaming states, and argues that the waking world is as unreal as the dream-world._

_The Advaita section of the Kārika presents a clear, positive statement of the Non-Dualist position: ātman/brahman alone is real, all else is illusion. Gauḍapāda teaches the AJĀTA doctrine: the doctrine of NO-BECOMING. _

_The fourth section of the Kārika expounds the means of clearing the illusion of duality._

_As per Shastriji, the Advaita Prakaraṇa of Gaudapāda Kārika of Māṇdūkya Upaniṣad is excellent as it clarifies the doubts of a sādhaka. One should always keep ruminating on a few of them in the light of strengthening the sādhana.   So, he chose a few nuggets and has given his commentary on them.  I have reproduced them here for the reader to do introspection._

#### KĀRIKĀ-S

**बहिष्प्रज्ञो विभुर्विश्वो ह्यन्तःप्रज्ञस्तु तैजसः।**

**घनप्रज्ञस्तथा प्राज्ञः एक एव त्रिधा स्मृतः॥**

**Bahiḥ-prajñaḥ vibhuḥ-viśvaḥ hi-antaḥ- prajñaḥ-tu taijasaḥ,**

**ghana-prajñaḥ-tathā prājñaḥ ēka ēva tridhā smr̥taḥ.**(Mā.Up.1-Kā.1)

(Viśva is all-pervading, the experiencer of external objects. Taijasa is the cognizer of internal objects. Prājña is a mass of consciousness. It is self alone that is thus known in the three states.)

**Bahiḥ-prajñaḥ vibhuḥ-viśvaḥ**-One who is cognizing outside is vibhu and is called Vaiṣvānara.

**Antaḥ- prajñaḥ-tu taijasaḥ** - the fellow who cognizes the inside world is taijasa.

**Ghana-prajñaḥ-tathā prājñaḥ** -In the prājña phase, outside cognition as well as inside cognition have vanished. We know the example of seven colors merging into white colour when the disc with seven colours is rotated fast. When you soften cognition, picture, and sound vanish. This explains as to how one suddenly slips into sleep. When you sit for meditation and slow down the assemblage of words, words get decomposed, śabda vanishes and that is a good growth to oneself. Dṛṣyanāśa and śabdanāśa occur when meditation ripens.

**Ghana-prajñaḥ-tathā prājñaḥ ēka ēva tridhā smr̥taḥ**-The dream observer is the same as the jāgṛt observer. Even the witness of silence and the person in nidrā are the same. There are no three enjoyers or perceivers. That is valuable from the sādhana point of view. Śankara comments as-**soham iti smṛtyā - सोऽहम् इति स्मृत्या।** Nobody says that a different person experienced the three states. What are you then? That means you have an existence independent of three states. However quick is the succession from one state to the other, there must be a time gap. That means, in that time gap you are not tagged on to any feature. You are independent. That means, jāgṛt dharma or svapna dharma or nidrā dharma is not a must for you showing that you are **alipta_-_aspruṣṭa – अलिप्त-अस्पृष्ठ** - untouched by these. The whole parīkṣa is to find your original svarūpa, you are **upaśānta_-_उपशान्त_._** Supported by this argument you begin to relax during meditation. Śankara’s comments (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad- Śankara Bhāṣya-19).

**पर्यायेण त्रिस्थानत्वात् सोऽहम् इति स्मृत्या प्रतिसन्धानाच्च स्थानत्रयव्यतिरिक्तत्वम् शुद्धत्वम् एकत्वम् असङ्गत्वम् च सिद्धम् इति अभिप्रायः॥**

**Paryāyēṇa tri-sthānatvāt saḥ-aham iti smr̥tyā prati-sandhānāt-ca sthānatraya-vyatiriktatvam śuddhatvam ēkatvam asaṅgatvam ca siddham iti abhiprāyaḥ.**

Since you are changing the three states and confirm that you are the same fellow in these states, you are one, you are pure, untainted and not linked with any of the three states. There were moments in your life when you stood aloof from these dharmā-s, you are pure and single and are unattached. Ultimately one has to come out of all these dharmā-s instead of fighting what is tamas and rajas! The state, where there is no outside cognition or inside cognition or even mere prāṇavyāpāra as in Nidra, is known as **Turīya** where you are untainted. Even for a** **paramahaṁsa sanyāsi who is exempted from sandhya or gayatri must hold on to prāņava japa. This is because the avidita forces are not easy to dissolve. Otherwise he will slip into corresponding nidrā. With a loss of awareness how can you manipulate? That means you must be wakeful and then decompose using onkāra in a very minimal way.

Why do you think of three states and examine them? Gauḍapāda puts it very nicely- In one wakeful state itself we can have the three properties.

**दक्षिणाक्षिमुखे विश्वो मनस्यन्तस्तु तैजसः।**

**आकाशे च हृदि प्राज्ञस्त्रिधा देहे व्यवस्थितः॥**

**Dakṣiṇa-akṣi-mukhē viśvaḥ manasi-antastu taijasaḥ,**

**ākāśē ca hr̥di prājñaḥ-tridhā dēhē vyavasthitaḥ.**(Mā.Up.1-Kā.2)

(Viśva is the cognizer through the right eye; Taijasa is the cognizer through the mind within; Prājña is the ākāśa in the heart. Therefore the one Atman is perceived threefold in the same body.)

Dakṣiṇākṣi mukhe viśvaḥ –Who is viśva?  The one who looks outside in the wakeful state.

Manasi antastu taijasaḥ- close your eyes and then you have the inside world even in the wakeful state- you do not have to wait for getting into dream state.

Ākāśe ca hṛdi prājñaḥ-When you are very much relaxed you are in your nidrādharma.

Tridhā dehe vyavasthitaḥ- simultaneously you have touches of all the three states.

**विश्वो हि स्थूलभुक् नित्यं तैजसः प्रविविक्तभुक्।**

**आनन्दभुक् तथा प्राज्ञः त्रिधा भोगं निबोधत ॥**

**Viśvō hi sthūlabhuk nityaṁ taijasaḥ praviviktabhuk,**

**ānandabhuk tathā prājñaḥ tridhā bhōgaṁ nibōdhata.**(Mā.Up.1-Kā.3)

Vaiśvānara enjoys the outside-the gross sense objects, Taijasa enjoys the inside-the subtle world of objects, and Prājña enjoys the peace-the bliss.

All the three understand bhoga this way.

**स्थूलं तर्पयते विश्वं प्रविविक्तं तु तैजसम्।**

**आनन्दश्च तथा प्राज्ञं त्रिधा तृप्तिं निबोधत॥**

**Sthūlaṁ tarpayatē viśvaṁ praviviktaṁ tu taijasam,**

**ānandaśca tathā prājñaṁ tridhā tr̥ptiṁ nibōdhata.** (Mā.Up.1-Kā.4)

The gross satisfies Viśva. The subtle satisfies Taijasa and bliss satisfies Prājña. Know that satisfaction is threefold.

Three types of food and three types of tṛpti or satisfaction are mentioned here. Grasping outside world is one tṛpti. Enjoying inside world of imaginations is another tṛpti. Staying in the mere prāṇa level or nidrā level is another.

**विभूतिं प्रसवं त्वन्ये मन्यन्ते सृष्टिचिन्तकाः।**

**स्वप्नमायासरूपेति सृष्टिरन्यैर्विकल्पिता ॥**

**Vibhūtiṁ prasavaṁ tvanyē manyantē sr̥ṣṭi-cintakāḥ,**

**svapna-māyā-sarūpēti sr̥ṣṭiranyaiḥ-vikalpitā.**

(Mā.Up.1-Kā.7)

(Some of those who contemplate the process of creation regard it as the manifestation of God’s powers; others imagine creation to be like dreams and illusions.)

Various people who want to label sṛṣṭi or creation call it as Īśvara’s display of power. Svapnamāyāsarūpeti. One person says that it is like dream; another fellow interprets as the māya of the indrajālika, the magic of The Magician.

**भोगार्थं सृष्टिरित्यन्ये क्रीडार्थमिति चापरे ।**

**दैवस्यैष स्वभावोऽयं आप्तकामस्य का स्पृहा ॥**

**Bhōgārthaṁ sr̥ṣṭiḥ-iti-anyē krīḍārthaṁ-iti cāparē,**

**daivasya-ēṣa svabhāvaḥ-ayaṁ āpta-kāmasya kā spr̥hā.**(Mā.Up.1-Kā.9)

Some people say that sṛṣṭi is Īśvara’s māya. Another says, time is the creator of the universe. Others say it is the sport of Īśvara for his enjoyment. Gauḍapāda says that Īśvara is a self satisfied fellow. How can you give him an attribute called kartr̥tva and bhōktr̥tva? He is ‘ātmani_ _eva_ _ātmanā_ _tuṣṭaḥ’-आत्मनि ऎव आत्मना तुष्ठः. How can there be kāmana for him?

**ग्रहोन तत्र नोत्सर्गश्चिंता यत्र न विद्यते।**

**आत्मसंस्थं तदा ज्ञानमजाति समतां गतम्॥**

<u>A sādhaka has to become indifferent to society or else he cannot achieve the goal.</u>

**Grahaḥ-na tatra na-utsargaḥ-cintā yatra na vidyatē,**

**Ātmasaṁsthaṁ tadā jñānaṁ-ajāti samatāṁ gatam.** (Mā.Up.3-Kā.38)

Grahaḥ na utsargaḥ na–Likes and dislikes are the two forces which we have encouraged continuously due to which mind does not keep quiet at all. It oscilates betweenacceptance and rejection,desire and aversion, attachment and detachment , dharma and adharma. This is the last straw of disturbance of the mind which a sādhaka has to overcome ultimately.Every thought that is born has to have a natural death. You are a mere non involved observer of the birth and death of thoughts. That should be the state of equanimity in sādhaka.

**निगृहीतस्य मनसो निर्विकल्पस्य धीमतः।**

**प्रचारः स तु विज्ञेयः सुषुप्तेऽन्यो न तत्समः॥**

**Nigr̥hītasya manasaḥ nirvikalpasya dhīmataḥ,**

**Pracāraḥ sa tu vijñēyaḥ suṣuptē-anyō na tat-samaḥ.** (Mā.Up.3-Kā.34)

(One should know the behavior of the conquered mind which is endowed with discrimination and free from illusions. The condition of the mind in deep sleep is not like that but is of a different kind.)

One has to sit quiet and find out his quietened mind consciously. Nigraha is control. You have to understand the content of the subdued mind and the content of the mind which has no sañkalpa.

Pracāraḥ yaḥ manasaḥ - whatever is the quality of the mind, sa tu vijñeyaḥ-that should be understood and appreciated by the sādhaka. Your sādhana in the wakeful state is different from sleep. You sit wakefully and quieten the forces. This state is different from state of sleep and they are not equal.

Why they did not equate the suşupti with nigṛhīta manas? The answer is in the next śloka:

**लीयते हि सुषुप्ते तन्निगृहीतं न लीयते।**

**तदेव निर्भयं ब्रह्म ज्ञानालोकं समन्ततः॥**

**Līyatē hi suṣuptē tat-nigr̥hītaṁ na līyatē,**

**tat-ēva nirbhayaṁ brahma jñānālōkaṁ samantataḥ.** (Mā.Up.3-Kā.35)

(The mind is dissolved in deep sleep, but it is not so when the mind is controlled. The controlled mind is verily the fearless Brahman, the light of whose omniscience is all-pervading.)

The mind gets dissolved in deep sleep, but when under restraint, it doesn’t get dissolved. That (mind) alone becomes Brahman, the fearless, endowed with the light that is Consciousness on all sides. In nidrā, mind is not eliminated. Manolaya has happened but manonāśa has not happened. We sleep because there is a pull which is an inability to hold the indriya-vyāpāra. There is something in sleep which is not in a person having complete cittaśuddhi.

suśuptau manaḥ līyate-it acquires a seed form-a general prāṇa-spandana. Whereas, jñāna is quietened state of  mind. Gauḍapāda declares this very clearly.

<u>Nigṛhītaṁ_ _manaḥ_ _eva_ _nirbhayaṁ_ _brahma_ _- it is a no-mind state</u> <u>in wakeful hours</u>.

**सर्वाभिलापविगतः सर्वचिंन्तासमुत्थितः।**

**सुप्रशान्तः सकृज्ज्योतिः समाधिरचलोऽभय:॥**

**Sarva-abhilāpa-vigataḥ sarva-cintā-samutthitaḥ,**

**su-praśāntaḥ sakr̥jjyōtiḥ samādhiḥ-acalḥ-abhayaḥ.**   (Mā.Up.3-Kā.37)

(Atman is beyond all expression by words and beyond all acts of the mind. It is peace itself, eternal effulgence and samādhi; It is unmoving and fearless.)

Sarva-abhilāpa-vigataḥ - no śabda inside- no expressions. Sarva-cintā-samutthitaḥ - free from all thoughts involving  pictures and sounds. That should be the sādhana. Try these two things when you sit quiet. Remaining silent in your wakeful state is samādhi. Regularly cultivate this.

**मनसो निग्रहायत्तमभयं सर्वयोगिनाम्।**

**दुःखक्षयः प्रबोधश्चाप्यक्षया शान्तिरेव च॥**

**Manasō nigrahāyattam-abhayaṁ sarva-yōginām,**

**Duḥkhakṣayaḥ prabōdhaḥ-ca-api-akṣayā śāntiḥ-ēva ca.** (Mā.Up.3-Kā.40)

This excellent śloka says that even after the knowledge one has to do sādhana. For every type of yogi - duḥkha-kṣayaḥ - banishing of duḥkha, Prabodha - self knowledge, Akṣaya-śāntiḥ- ever lasting peace are through manasaḥ nigrahāyattam conquering the mind and that is the fearless state - Abhayam. Śankara’s commentary on the above Kārika is:

**एषां पुनः ब्रह्मस्वरूपव्यतिरेकेण - “नोपचारः कथञ्चन” इति अवोचाम। येतु अतः अन्ये योगिनः-मनोनिग्रहायत्तैव॥**

**Ēṣāṁ punaḥ brahma-svarūpa-vyatirēkēṇa . . . . “na-upacāraḥ kathañcana” iti avōcāma,**

**yētu ataḥ anyē yōginaḥ - manōnigrahāyattaiva.**

For those people of calibre like, Vāmadeva or Śuka whose mind is so pure, it is already in the kalpita phase. Pangs are not there at all. Mind is not in the continuous thinking phase and so it dies. They are nearly in brahma. Indriya- vyāpāra and mano-vyāpāra are kalpitam eva-**कल्पित ऎव**. Na paramārthataḥ - न परमार्थतः - It is not permanant.

Teśām_ _brahma_ _svarūpānām- They are already in brahma.

Mokṣākhyā akṣyāśāntiḥ svabhāvataḥ eva siddhā – **मोक्षाख्या अक्षयशान्तिः स्वभावतः ऎव सिद्धा** - They are already in that state of boundless shanti.

Na anyayattā – **न अन्यत्ता** - They don’t depend upon any other prop.

Nopacāraḥ kathañcana ityavocāma – There is no need for any suggestion.

Teşām śravaṇānāmeva alam – **तॆषां श्रवणमॆव अलं** - For them one listening is enough.

Ye tu ataḥ anye yoginaḥ- What about people like us with so much rajas and tamas?

Hīna madhyama_ _dṛṣṭayaḥ_ _avyatiriktam_ _ātmasambandhi_ _manaḥ_ _indriyādi_ _anyat_ _paşyanti – **हीन मध्यम दृष्टयः अव्यतिरिक्तम् आत्मसम्बन्धि मनः इन्द्रियादि अन्यत् पष्यन्ति** - They see vividly the thoughts since they cannot be eradicated easily. It won’t go by simple suggestion. Teṣāṁ ātmasvarūpa rahitānām- they do not have the ātmaniṣṭa.

Such people have to practice - manso nigrahāyattam**- मनसॊनिग्रहायत्तम्** - have to tame the mind. Mind control is necessary.

**उपायेन निगृह्णीयात् विक्षिप्तम् कामभोगयोः।**

**सुप्रसन्नम् लये चैव यथा कामो लयस्तथा॥**(Mā.Up.3-Kā.42)

**Upāyēna nigr̥hṇīyāt vikṣiptam kāma-bhōgayōḥ,**

**su-prasannam layē ca-ēva yathā kāmō layaḥ-tathā.**

Therefore do not harshly try to quieten the mind, do it gently by upāya. When the mind tends to go out, try to reduce its speed gently.

Suprasannam layecchaiva yathā kāmanartha hetuḥ layaḥ api tathā anarthahetuḥ. The feeling of comfort derived out of manolaya is also a force to be overcome by being wakeful and conscious. That manolaya also traps you. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha (3-9-132) declares-

**मनः प्रशमनोपायो योग इत्यभिधीयते॥**

**Manaḥ praśamana-upāyḥ yōga iti-abhidhīyatē.**

Mellowing the mind is termed as yoga. That is, tuning it from the harsh state to gentle state. So sit and quieten the mind. You decide an interval of time where your duty calls would not come and disturb you. That is the skill with which you have to work. You have to be in a relaxed state for attaining peace. Simple ātmāparichaya is not sufficient for the sādhana. ātmā niṣṭhatva has to get established through sādhana. Even after knowing your svarūpa, you should not stop nididhyāsa.

<u>A single flash of self, no-mind state, is felt in śravaṇa. </u>

<u>Repeated occurance of this flash of self is termed as manana. </u>

<u>Nididhyāsa is the stabilisation of the repeated flashes of the self. </u>

**लये सम्बोधयेच्चित्तं विक्षिप्तं शमयेत्पुनः।**

**सकाषायं विजानीयात् सम प्राप्तं न चालयेत्॥**

**Layē sambōdhayēt-cittaṁ vikṣiptaṁ śamayēt-punaḥ,**

**Sakāṣāyaṁ vijānīyāt sama prāptaṁ na cālayēt.**

(Mā.Up.3-Kā.44)

(If the mind becomes inactive, arouse it from laya; if distracted, make it tranquil. Understand the nature of the mind when it contains the seed of attachment. When the mind has attained equanimity, do not disturb it again.)

Indriyavyāpāra is called bhogavāsana. Karmendriyavyāpāra is called karmavāsana. Vikṣiptaṁ śamayet punaḥ - both operations are to be corrected. Slight samādhāna comes as in nidrā. But, understand that there is still a small dosha in bīja form. Once a pleasant state is reached, try to hold on to that state. We often spoil that by inviting another thought. Do not do that. Even the āsvādana of sukha should not be done heavily as it amounts to problems.

**यदा न लीयते चित्तं न च विक्षिप्यते पुनः।**

**अनिङ्गनमनाभासं निष्फन्नं ब्रह्म तत्तदा॥**

**Yadā na līyatē cittaṁ na ca vikṣipyatē punaḥ,**

**Aniṅganamana-ābhāsaṁ niṣphannaṁ brahma tat-tadā.**(Mā.Up.3-Kā.46)

(When the mind does not lapse into inactivity and is not distracted by desires, that is to say, when it remains unshakable and does not give rise to appearances, it verily becomes Brahman.)** **

When the mind is no more wandering, that is the brahmasthiti. When there is movement it is called mind, when it is not there then it is brahman.

**SELF in the functioning phase is MIND.**

**MIND in the non-functioning phase is SELF.**

**निवृत्तस्य अप्रवृत्तस्य निश्चला हि तदा स्थितिः।**

**विषयः स हि बुद्धानां तत् साम्यमजमद्वयम्॥**

**Nivr̥ttasya a-pravr̥ttasya niścalā hi tadā sthitiḥ,**

**Viṣayaḥ sa hi buddhānāṁ tat sāmyam-ajam-advayam.**(Mā.Up.4-Kā.80)

(The in-between state of the mind which is withdrawn but not yet started indulging is verily the state of immutability.The wise realize such a mind to be Brahman; It is undifferentiated, birth less and non-dual.)

One thought has gone, another thought is yet to come. At that point the mind is calana-rahita or without movement. Otherwise, where is the feel of that state? The interval is your svarūpa- that is a no-thought, no-mind state. The enlightened people hover there. That is your advayasthiti –sama-sthiti. Gauḍapāda finally salutes the advaita-śāstra itself.

**दुर्दर्शमतिगंभीरम् अजम् साम्यम् विशारदम्।**

**बुद्द्वा पदमनानात्वम् नमस्कुर्मो यथा बलम्॥**

**Durdarśam-ati-gaṁbhīram ajam sāmyam viśāradam,**

**buddvā padam-anānātvam namaskurmō yathā balam.**(Mā.Up.4-Kā.100)

Having realised the non-dual state that is hard to perceive and which is lofty, unborn, uniform and serene, we offer our salutations to IT, as best as we can. Our prostrations do not go to a personal God as we are discussing advaita here. We salute to this advaita-tatva, having known and established in it, to the best of our ability.
