title = "03 LECTURES ON MĀNḌŪKYA UPANIṣAD"

+++

Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad. which contains only twelve mantras belongs to Atharva-Veda. Although the Upaniṣad looks very small in narration; its greatness lies in the brevity with which it extols the aspect of Brahman.  Muktikopanṣad asserts that study of only this Upaniṣad is sufficient for any serious sādhaka to attain liberation - Ēkaṁ Māṇḍūkyam-ēva alaṁ mumukṣūṇām vimuktayē.

“Upaniṣadbrahmayogi” who has commented on the one hundred and eight Upaniṣad-s, called this Upaniṣad as Sarva Vedānta Sāriṣṭha (the essence of the entire Vedānta).    Ādi Śankara has called this Upaniṣad (which includes the Kārakā-s of Gaudapāda” as Sarva Vedānta Sāra Sangraha, in his Bhāṣya.

Just like in any other Upaniṣad, the theme of this Upaniṣad also is the extolling of Brahman. But the methodology used in this text is extra ordinary.  The main contents is the analysis of the three states experienced by all mortals, namely , Jāgṛt , Svapna and Suśupti (waking, dream and dreamless sleep states).   Through this, the Upaniṣad establishes the highest state of Turīya which is the state of Brahman. This is the great contribution of this Upaniṣad.

Prof Shastriji was at his best when he spoke on Manūkya Upaniṣad. He himself used to mention that he had read this Upaniṣad more than one hundred times to understand and appreciate the extolling of Omkāra. Omkāra sādhana being one of his favourite talks, I felt that any serious sādhaka should get to know the intricacies of the Omkāra.

The states of existence of a man has already been introduced in the Avastha Traya Parīkṣa. However an elaborate explanation of the two stages especially dream and sleep in the lecture is worth reading. Some of the talks on Māndūkya Upaniṣad contain excellent hints for a Sādhaka.

Shastriji has chosen some śloka-s from Gauapāda Kārika-s which have immense value. I have taken out the important ones and have reproduced here for the reader to benefit from them.

I am sure the reader will get the best out of the suggestions from the master. ---     Editor


## OMKĀRA UPĀSANA 
(MEDITATION ON OMKĀRA)

Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad** **is one of the ten major Upaniṣad-s admitted by Sampradāya. Sampradāya holds this Upaniṣad very high. In fact there is a śloka to show what status this Upaniṣad earns in the eyes of sampradāya. Muktikopaniṣad declares that the study of only Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad is sufficient to liberate an ardent student of Vedānta:

**एकं माण्डूक्यमेव अलं मुमुक्षूणाम् विमुक्तये ।**

**Ēkaṁ māṇḍūkyam-ēva alaṁ mumukṣūṇām vimuktayē.**

That means you can bypass all other details enumerated in other Upaniṣad -s and go straight to Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad and that is the right thing to do. Mumukṣu is a sādhaka who is after liberation. For his liberation, study of this Upaniṣad will give him the necessary guide lines and there is no need to waste time going through other vedāntic texts- says the axiom. Such a point of view on this Upaniṣad is reasonable because as I see there is no waste of time at all here- not a syllable, not a word which is extra is stated in this text than what is required. It is as straight as the flight of an arrow. There are no stories told in this Upaniṣad, no ākhyāyika and no dialogue between the master and the disciple as found in other Upaniṣad-s. Brevity of this order or an accuracy of this order is not seen elsewhere. That is why it is remarkable. People have rightly called it the best. Let us study the aspect of Omkāra as described in First Mantra of Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad:** **

**ओमित्येतदक्षरमिदग्ं सर्वं तस्योपव्याख्यानम् भूतम् भवद्भभविष्यदिति सर्वमोङ्कार एव।**

**यच्चान्यत्रिकालातीतं तदप्योङ्कार एव ।।**

**ŌM-iti-ētat-akṣaram-idagṁ sarvaṁ tasya-upa vyākhyānam bhūtam bhavat-bhaviṣyat-iti sarvam-ōṅkāra ēva,**

**Yat-ca-anyat-trikāla-atītaṁ tat-api-ōṅkāra ēva.**

(AUM, the word, is all this, the whole universe. A clear explanation of it is as follows: All that is past, present and future is, indeed, AUM. And whatever else there is, beyond the threefold division of time, space and causation also is truly AUM.)

This is the first mantra which tries to extol Omkāra. I always wondered why Upaniṣad-s have extolled Omkāra. Śankara quotes number of references** **from other Upaniṣad-s to show that there is hardly any vedāntic text without the mention of Omkāra. Let me explain my difficulty. Atman is nirguṇa - lakṣaṇarahita, without attributes. That is, all adjectives are withdrawn from the one who is the enjoyer, cognisor and the doer. Whatever lakṣaṇā-s we seem to possess are superimpositions on us are what śāstra wants to prove. If you drop them one after the other or en-block, whatever is the residue, is your Self. That is a satisfactory definition and is consistent for all of us to agree. But I could not understand as to why Omkāra has been extolled so much? I could not get the right vision until I went through Śankarā’s commentary on Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad which I want to share with you all.

**ओमित्येतदक्षरमिदग्ं सर्वं ।**

**Ōmiti-ētat-akṣaram-idagṁ sarvaṁ.**

OM, the word, means the whole world or the entire universe surrounding us, is Omkāra.  **तस्योपव्याख्यानम्  - Tasya-upa-vyākhyānam.**

Therefore it is but right that we make an extensive comment on this one or it is but right to make a special reference to Omkāra.

**भूतम् भवद्भविष्यदिति सर्वमोङ्कार एव ।**

**Bhūtam bhavat-bhaviṣyat-iti sarvam-ōṅkāra ēva**

Once the world is recognised as Omkāra -- the past, the present and the future is all Omkāra. The **past**is what the world has already moved past, the **present** is what we are now in actual contact, and the **future** is whatever we imagine or conceive about the world external or internal. As we have considered the world as Omkāra, the past, present and future should be included.

**यच्चान्यत्रिकालातीतं तदप्योङ्कार एव ।**

**Yat-ca-anyat-trikāla-atītaṁ tat-api-ōṅkāra ēva.**

Here again there is a concern or an element of mystery. Whatever is beyond kālatraya_ _or whatever is beyond the past, present and future is also considered as Omkāra. See how complexity has set in. What is it that can be there beyond past, present and future? Is it for the world or for the involver? The whole thing is already exhausted. Whatever is the aspect of the universe or jagat that is not covered by the past, present and future is also Omkāra as per this Upaniṣad. The answer to this anomaly is that these three - the past, present and the future - are the manifested versions or the visible versions of the jagat (the world) or of the phenomenon or the **sṛiṣṭi.** To elaborate: Jagat is represented in three words- nāma, rūpa and karma. This is again a grand stroke on the part of the vedāntin-s. Jagat is fully spoken of, when I say, it is the **śabda**portion or**nāma**, it is the**dṛṣya portion**or**rūpa**and it is the**activity portion**or**karma**. You cannot add a bit more to the definition, as perceived by the Indian thinker. Śankara presents this very well through an example as under:-

**अयं देवदत्तः  - Ayaṁ dēvadattaḥ_ - _-**This (person) is Devadatta.

He takes the example of a commoner, by name Devadatta.  That is, when I am referring to that person, I am uttering a word. This means that the name or the word represents the person. That is, Devadatta is the **nāma** aspect or the**śabda**aspect of jagat.

**देवदत्तः दीर्घः गौरः - Dēvadattaḥ dīrghaḥ, gauraḥ**.

Oh he is tall, he is fair skinned- that is the **rūpa** aspect or the**dṛṣya**aspect.

**देवदत्तः गच्छति - Dēvadattaḥ gacchati**- Devadatta walks along - that is the **karma**aspect or the activity aspect.

How can we further elaborate? The picture version is dṛṣṭigocara and the sound version is śravaṇagocara. So, nāma, rūpa and karma completely represent the manifested world or jagat. Why does the Upaniṣad add an extra, apart from the above three aspects?

**यच्चान्यत्रिकालातीतं तदप्योङ्कार एव ।**

**Yat ca anyat trikālātītaṁ tadapi ōṅkāra ēva**

The answer is that there is also an **un-manifested**version of the jagat or the world.We see the world as nāma, rūpa and karma, when it comes to its perception through the senses - indriyagocaratva. The ears can listen and grasp the components of the universe. I can visualize a form and that is the nāma aspect. I can see - the eyes can see the rūpa aspect. I can see a movement, say I walk – I can turn my neck- that is a vyāpāra, an activity-that is the karma aspect. This is the visible version or a manifested version called dṛggocara or Indriyagocara.

All of you know that there are five pañcabhutā-s as enunciated in Taittirīya Upaniṣad (2-1-2)

**एतस्मादात्मन आकाशस्सम्भूतः। आकाशाद्वायुः। वायोरग्निः। अग्नेरापः। अद्भ्यः पृथ्वी...**

**Ētasmāt-ātmana ākāśa-sambhūtaḥ, ākāśāt- vāyuḥ, vāyōragniḥ, agnērāpaḥ, adbhyaḥ pr̥thvī.**

Ākāśa, vāyu, agni, āpa and pṛthvi--that is, space, wind, fire, water and earth respectively. What happens when these aspects become subtler? To give a simple example - Ākāśa is not indriyagocara_–_not_ _perceivable _to _senses_ _and_ _vāyu is not dṛṣṭigocara-cognizable. By the time we come to Agni, Āpa and Pṛthvi a visible component has already set in. Agni has fire component, it shines and has rūpa. Āpa - also has rūpa. Pṛthvi, the earth which is coarser has rūpa.

Let us take the first two pañcabhutā-s or elements-ākāśa and vāyu. They are subtle in nature. There is no dṛṣṭi-gocaratva of the world in this stage of the element. Science has proved the existence of the element at the vāyu level. By taking a known volume of gas and weighing it one can positively say that it has existence. Much more subtle than vāyu is the ākāśa - the first creation from ātma as propounded in

Taittirīya Upaniṣad. So, ākāśa is the unseen version of the Jagat. Science accepts that. Electromagnetic radiations are there in the universe around us. We are not able to trace these impulses unless there is a right instrument to detect them and to label them or code them. That is the reference of the Upaniṣad here while declaring **Yat ca anyat trikālātītam pointing** to un-manifested version of the world. This is one aspect.

There is another aspect also. Universe is recognised as a heap of activity- vyāpāra-mātra- What a closeness in thinking of the modern scientist and our ancient rishis! Cognition is there in the Jñānendriyā-s, the manas and buddhi. Activities become sūkṣma or subtle at the level of buddhikośa itself. At the level of buddhi, without focusing, indriyavyāpāra is not possible. That is, Buddhikośa, the subtlest form of representation of ātma, is coming to the attention pose. Without attention cognition is not possible. Attention mood is the necessary prerequisite to enable the manas and the indriyā-s to cognize. So if you want to define buddhi in the best way, it is the attention posture or focussing posture. Otherwise visible world does not exist for anyone unless you cognise with focussing. Sometimes we say-“will you say that again, I am unable to follow you”. So to grasp a thing one has to come to the attention mood. So attention phase is a necessary precursor to the grasping or thinking stage. That means, attention is that property which makes us to cognise the world.

Beyond manas and budhikosa there are layers and layers of the Jagat. After Buddhi, śāstra recognizes two more components-- **Mahattattva**and **avyākṛta**. It is stated In Kathopaniṣad (1-3-10) as:

**इद्रिंयेभ्यः परा ह्यर्था अर्थेभ्यश्च परं मनः।**

**मनसस्तु परा बुद्धिर्बुद्धेरात्मा महान् परः॥**

**Indryēbhyaḥ parā hi-arthā arthēbhyaḥ-ca paraṁ manaḥ,**

**manasastu parā buddiḥ-buddhērātmā mahān paraḥ.**

(Beyond the senses are the objects, beyond the objects is the mind, beyond the mind is the intellect, and beyond the intellect is the expansive state of MERE ‘I’ NESS.)

The component subtler to manas or mind is buddhi or intellect. Subtler to buddhi there is the component recognised as mahattattva. In Mahattattva you are so expansive that localisation has not set in. That is to say, one cannot identify things like a pen or a table, etc. Only at the level of buddhikośa, focussing or indriyagocaratva is there. But Mahat is vyāpakatva or expansive state- which is very much like ākāśa. Further in Kathopaniṣad (1-3-11) it is stated that:

**महतः परमव्यक्तमव्यक्तान्पुरुषः परः।**

**पुरुषान्न परं किञ्चित्सा काष्ठा सा परा गतिः॥**

**Mahataḥ param-avyaktam-avyaktāt-puruṣaḥ paraḥ,**

**puruṣānna paraṁ kiñcit-sā kāṣṭhā sā parā gatiḥ.**

(Beyond Mahat is the Unmanifested; beyond the Unmanifested is the Purusha (the SELF) and Purusha is the ultimate.)

Sūkṣma or subtler than mahattatva one more component is posited which is called as  **avyākṛta.** How to conceive that? It is less and less of activity or pulsation. While Kathopanishad mentions this phase as **Mahattattva**and **Avyākṛta,** Taittirīya Upaniṣad mentions it as **ākāśa**. From atman, the first grossification is ākāśa.** **

Still it is not yet Brahma. These layers are recognised by the Upaniṣad  as- **Yat ca anyat trikālātītam ---** there is a universe subtler and which does not fall under the framework of Bhūta, Bhavat and Bhaviṣyat (past, present and future) represented by the nāma, rūpa, karma and **that is also Omkāra**.** **

**That also has to be dropped to get to your Brahmasthiti.**

There are two schools contradicting these things. One school says that you are in svarūpa/ātma in Nidrā or dreamless sleep. There is no jagat in nidrā. In svapna or dream there is the jagat of the inside. In jāgṛt there is a jagat of the outside... So in Nidrā since Jagat is not there it is ātma or it is svarūpa.

The other school denies this argument. You are still a component in this world although jagat is not there in dreamless sleep. You have only become sūkṣma or subtle. You are still not ātma or Brahma. What is the sūkṣmatva here? It is a mere pulsation – Kevala-Vyāpāra is there. You are in the form of mere pulsation. That means the vyāpāra has not yet disappeared. **A sādhaka has to make a note of this point.**Just because I have stopped cognising the visible world, the task is not yet over, the vyāpāra has not gone. There is an invisible component - a mere spandana or pulsation in you which is also a vyāpāra. A mere spandana can take the śabdadharma (sound version) or rūpadharma (picture version). But minus those two later positions it is a mere spandana which is nothing but prāṇic vibration.

So, there is no nāma, rūpa aspect here. But life exists as mere prāṇaspandana. Nidrā is not your true self because a movement is still there. So if that also is eliminated, i.e., if your prāṇavyāpāra is also quietened or softened, then that is the **nija-svarūpa.**

<u>So, in order to clearly show the difference, the Upaniṣad is saying- Yatcha_ _anyat_ _trikālātīta</u>ṁ <u>- that is, whatever is beyond the past present or future is also Omkāra. </u>

Now why this world is represented by Omkāra which is śabdarūpa or sound version? The Upaniṣad could have represented the world through dṛṣyarūpa or the picture version. Every object has a name. Ex, this is a book- this is a table etc. Every object that we see (or every rūpa carrying stuff) has a name. World is made up of objects -so the world can be condensed into a **set of names.**Look at the logic. World is nothing but innumerable objects. In this world--a wall, a brush, and an ornamental piece - every object or every dṛṣya has a counterpart in śabda. Therefore if the world is **dṛṣya-svarūpa** - **दृष्य‍स्वरूप**- one can also call it as **śabdasvarūpa** - **शब्दस्वरूप**.  Śankara in his commentary on Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad (Bhāṣya 1-5) comments on this thus—

**ओमिति एतदक्शरमिदम् सर्वम् इति यदिदम् अर्थजातम् अभिधेयभूतम् तस्य अभिधानाव्यतिरेकात् अभिधानस्य च ॐकाराव्यतिरेकात् ---**

**ŌM-iti ētat-akśaram-idam sarvam iti yadidam arthajātam abhidhēya-bhūtam tasya abhidhāna avyatirēkāt abhidhānasya ca ōm̐kāra avyatirēkāt.**

Name by which an object is revealed is Abhidāna. Or description of an object is abhidāna and whatever is described is abhideya. The material content is not different from its description. So any word is not different from the object described. And all these śabdā-s can be rendered into**a minimal version** or a mono syllable notation and that is OMKĀRA. Book, tea table, carpet are all multi syllable words. The simplest version of any name, if represented by sound, is**ummm... utterance** and that utterance is represented by the word**OM**. So,**the whole world is OM**. What a beautiful condensation of details!

That is what exactly the scientists do. Thousands of plant species are simplified into one word by grouping them as monocotyledons or dicotyledons. Hundreds of leafs can be brought into one term. Thousands of compounds in chemistry were brought under ninety six and odd elements. Simplification or generalization means reducing the complexity into smaller and smaller components. Chemists and Physicists thought that this was the final representation of the universe. But, the famous Crooks experiment or the cathode ray experiment showed that all the ninety six and odd elements are nothing but protons, electrons and neutrons. So the whole world is made up of three units. See the simplification that the science has achieved.

Exactly, such thinking is here in the vedantic research. I really marvelled at the explanation given by Śankara as I could not get to such deep analysis. My attack was- why this simplicity- why does everything be reduced to one word. Śankara alone could help me.

**परं च ब्रह्म अभिधानाभिधेयोपायपूर्वकमेव गम्यते इति ॐकार एव ।**

**Paraṁ ca brahma abhidhāna-abhidhēyaōḥ-upāya-pūrvakam-ēva gamyatē iti ōm̐kāra ēva.**

What is our object? Why are we becoming the students of the Upaniṣad -s? It is to get to know our true nature- the causal stuff out of which activity has sprung. We want to get to the pre- activity version of the universe. Therefore I will stay at the smallest activity (utterance of Omkāra) and then I drop even that to know the pre state.** **What is so big about this utterance? Śankara goes further in helping us (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 1, Śankara Bhāṣya 5.) as under:

**तस्य एतस्य परापरब्रह्मरूपस्य अक्षरस्य ॐ इत्येतस्य उपव्याख्यानम् ब्रह्मप्रतिपत्त्युपायत्वात् ब्रह्मसमीपतया विस्पष्टं प्रकथनं उपव्याख्यानम् ॥**

**Tasya ētasya parāpara-brahma-rūpasya akṣarasya ōm̐  iti-ētasya upa-vyākhyānam brahmapratipat-upāyatvāt brahma-samīpatayā vispaṣṭaṁ prakathanaṁ upa-vyākhyānam.**

**परापरब्रह्मणि तस्य एव ।**

**Para-apara-brahmaṇi tasya ēva.**

Omkāra is representative of aparabrahma-which means later position and parabrahma which_ _is the preposition. If you used the word Om, you have represented the later world and the prior world also. Two words are used in Vedānta:

aparabrahma is kāryabrahma-the changed brahma -- the vivartabrahma-the jagat. Jagat is an after position of brahma. The parabrahma is the causal brahma.

The importance of Omkāra is clear now. How is that? **Brahma samīpatayā –**It is very near or close to brahma.**brahmapratipat upāyatvāt -**It is a tool to reach your true nature or svarūpa As already discussed the whole world is activity and if you want to drop the activity or to find out the source of the activity what should be done? Reduce the activity to the minimum and then drop it. That is the only way. Words, sentences and texts books of statements are all reduced into one activity OM. In utterance of Om, a tinge of activity is there and its magnification is universe and the slipping or tapering down of activity is svarūpa. It is on the threshold point.

You hold on to the least activity and then naturally you slip into no activity. Millions of activities are reduced to just one syllable UMMM. If you drop this <u>makāra,</u> then it is close to Brahma -**OM...UMM...MMM...MMM...MMM....**

<u>So when makāra dies it is prāṇa and when prāṇa also softens it is svarūpa. And that is the glory of OMKĀRA.</u>

We have now represented the threshold point and a further explanation is necessary to justify this. The answer is that Om is so near to brahma that it needs a very small shift either to realize it or to get away from it. This justifies extolling Omkāra.

That is why we do** **not find any Upaniṣad that does not frequently refer to Omkāra. To know this aspect, it took me many years of purposeful thinking though I had read Mānḍūkya hundreds of times! But I had not taken the first mantra and the Śankarabhāṣya seriously. In fact I am not exaggerating if I were to say that there is enough material for lot of research.

When you come to sādhana what else is the way? When you advance in the sādhana the gāyatri that is being chanted tends to lengthen itself and the Japa starts decomposing itself when you slow down and finally it becomes Omkāra. Sri Rāmakṛṣṇa rightly said that:

Sandhya merges into Gayatri.

Gayatri merges into OM. and

Om, when you stretch, merges into silence and that is svarūpa.

This is also called as the turīya stage. Why?

**a**- component is very coarse,** **represents Jāgṛat, the outside world or even the jagat.

**u-**component corresponds to the inner sound and this is the dream equivalent which is subtler.

**ma**- component is nidrā equivalent which is still subtler- very very subtler level of prāṇavyāpāra is going on- spandana is there but this is not yet Brahma.

When **ma**merges into silence it is Turīya.

The question is- how does nidrā carry the element of jagat? Dwaitaprapañca is absent. So why do you say that it is a phased phenomenon? The answer is that there is sūkṣma-vyāpāra or prāṇavyāpāra -- spandana is there and respiration is going on.

Then should we stop respiration? Yes!!! Verily!!!

Are you saying that we should die?

<u>No. In death, we do not die. Death according to me is, that the prāṇa-citta cluster that is pulsating in the body, in our system, comes out and pulsates in ākāśa. Death has not occurred. Vyāpāranāśa or seizure of activity has not taken place. It is only a displacement from the inside to the outside. Real death means, that even this pulsation also should stop.</u>

**अप्राणोह्यमनाः शुभ्रोह्यक्षरात् परतः परः।**

**Aprāṇaḥ-hi-amanāḥ śubhraḥ-hi-akṣarāt parataḥ paraḥ.**(Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad  2-1-2)

Svarūpa is that one where there is no mind and no prāṇavyāpāra. But in nidrā we have kevala- vyāpāra. What we see as death for persons like us is--Death is just a displacement of the citta and prāṇa cluster. What about a jñāni, a realised person?

**न उत्क्रामन्ति अत्रैव अस्मिन्नेव परेणात्मना अविभागं गच्छन्ति।---समवनीयन्ते---**

**Na utkrāmanti atraiva asmin-ēva parēṇa-ātmanā avibhāgaṁ gacchanti---samavanīyantē---** (Bṛh.Upa. 3-2-1, Śankarabhāṣya)

Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad declares that there is no displacement of citta and prāṇa cluster for a Jñāni. It diffuses into omnipresence, never to re-collect itself, merges into limitless space. That is mukti in Indian thinking. The obstacle to mukti in all of us is the importance given by us for our existence. That is why many people cannot go into** **Samādhi.

Therefore one can get Brahmasthiti by operating at the śabda level. Omkāra is so near to Brahma. If you stay there and citta becomes Omkāra mātra you simply slide into self effortlessly. **Omkāra becomes a working tool to reach brahma.** We may appreciate the theoretical potion, but how do you reach that state? Only** **by sādhana of Omkāra upāsana one can attain that state.

**Q.** How do you explain the concept of Brahma?

**A.** A scientist of today is at a better advantage than our forefathers as we have superior tools in the way of science models. They never knew of the energy mass equivalence. They thought that both matter and energy were different and unrelated; until Einstein came on the scene and established that the mass is but a frozen energy or a compact energy. That means the universe is nothing but energy, either in the held up form or in a way suffering displacement.

Similarly calculus helped me. By definition if you say that the svarūpa is non doing and activity is jagat, how can svarūpa be the cause of jagat? It looks absurd, unthinkable and unacceptable. Śankara had to go through tremendous hurdles to manage this aspect during his time when science had not developed. How can two opposite things be related through janya-janaka sambandha? (The generator and the generated.) A scientist has to face problems of these types when Vedānta is to be appreciated.

How can activity begotten from non activity? <u>But when the activity is made softer and softer, we reach the closest point of non activity.</u> <u>Here, CALCULUS comes to our help. This was a knot that bothered me for years. Absolute zero need not be posited. In calculus we have a concept for zero which is understood as less than anything deemed to be smallest we agree upon. When two people agree on a thing less than one divided by ten to the power of ten as a thing that can be neglected and therefore be considered as tending to zero (or almost zero).</u>

So, how can energy be got from nothingness? But if you take the calculus language of defining things, we can have a very small number which cannot be comprehended, none the less it is still in the category of non-zero numbers. From that quantity you can have any big quantity up to infinity. This is an improvement of one’s understanding with the entry of calculus. Now it is very easy to understand Brahma.

Brahma according to me is not a no-activity principle. But it is a principle tending to no-activity state. All people, who are less than the mutually agreed level of activities, are brahmajñāni-s. There could be hundreds of types of brahmajñāni-s, but they are all well accommodated. So, we can easily understand the concept of Omkāra once you know the calculus language. The paradox of activity begotten from non activity is easily explained. This is the advantage of a modern thinker over the ancient thinkers.

Even Śankara had to concede and say that it was not brahma who created the jagat but māya created the jagat. My** **question was where is māya from? Then why do you say sarvam khalu idaṁ  brahma? You should have said saravam khalu idaṁ māyā instead of brahma. Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad declares that—

**सर्वंह्येतत् ब्रह्म अयमात्मा ब्रह्म सोयमात्मा चतुष्पात् ।**

**Sarvaṁ-hi-ētat brahma ayam-ātmā brahma sōyam ātmā catuṣpāt.**(Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 1-2)

Everything in the universe according to Vedānta is an after position of brahma- brahma tatkārya- not brahma in the unmodified way- karya brahma**-sopādhika-brahma – सोपाधिकब्रह्म.**Whereas, svarūpa is **nirūpādhika-brahma**–**निरुपाधिकब्रह्म -** where all adjectives are withdrawn, no lakṣaṇa stays whatsoever. Hence in svarūpa you have touched the brahma.  Let us study Śankara’s commentary—Soayaṁ ātmā- this true ‘me’ is of two kinds—

**परमार्थरूपः अपरमार्थरूपः इत्युक्तः ।**

**Paramārtha-rūpaḥ a-paramārtha-rūpaḥ iti-uktaḥ.**

They are:**अपरमार्थ ब्रह्म, परमार्थ ब्रह्म - aparamārtha brahma, paramārtha brahma -**  -  the former is the suffering version and the latter is the non suffering version of brahma.

**तस्य अपरमार्थरूपम् पादत्रयलक्षणम् आह ।**

**Tasya aparamārtha-rūpam pāda-traya-lakṣaṇam āha.**

**Aparamārtha brahma** has three phases, jāgṛt, swapna and suşupti which are the three after positions or kāryasthāna-

**तस्य परमार्थरूपम् पादत्रय निराकरणेन आह ।**

**Tasya paramārtha-rūpam pāda-traya nirākaraṇēna āha.**

Here is the unmanifested/causal version, paramārtha-svarūpa version - kāraṇabrahma- attained by negating the three positions of kāryabrahma.

**Q.**What are Abhidhāna and Abhidheya?

**A.** A description in the form of śabda is Abhidhāna and a pictorial description is Abhidheya. For reaching the aspect of brahma –both the methods are available and you can choose what you feel appropriate. Sarvām khalu idaṁ brahma –can be approached by picture way or ayam ātmā brahma by the śabda way. Om iti ētat akṣaram idaṁ sarvam. Both the śabda version and dṛṣya version have equal prominence. **You can go back to the origin either by the śabda route or dṛṣya route**.

**Q**. What is the advantage of this ekatva dṛsti?

**--- एकेनैव प्रयत्नेन युगपत् प्रविलापयन् तत् विलक्षणम् ब्रह्म प्रतिपद्येत इति ॥**

**--- ēkēna-ēva prayatnēna yugapat pravilāpayan tat vilakṣaṇam brahma pratipadyēta iti.**

(Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad  1 Śankarabhāṣya, 7)

**A.** That is a beautiful explanation**.**You can go by the śabda way to the origin, in which process the other is automatically covered. If you dissolve one type of activity, all other type of activities are dissolved. Ākāśadharma or vyāpakatva is established. So the sādhaka need not do all softening methods, but can tackle one when others vanish simultaneously. This is the master stroke of Śankara.

## STATES OF EXISTANCE 

We will discuss now as to what clue a sādhaka gets from the study of the different states of existence of man as enumerated in Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad.The first state is- (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 3)

**जागरितस्थानः बहिष्प्रज्ञः सप्ताङ्ग एकोनविंशतिमुखः स्थूलभुग्वैश्वानरः प्रथमः पादः॥**

**Jāgarita-sthānaḥ bahiḥ-prajñaḥ saptāṅga ēkōnaviṁśati-mukhaḥ sthūla-bhuk vaiśvānaraḥ prathamaḥ pādaḥ.**

(The waking state outwardly conscious, having seven limbs and nineteen doors, enjoying gross objects common to all, is the first State.)

You are in a capacity of cognizing the world outside of you. Bahiṣprajñaḥ–your cognising capacity is outward. Then – saptāńgaḥ –You are seven limbed. Ekonavimśati mukhaḥ –You have one less than twenty that is nineteen faces. These are the ventilators or the outlets by which you contact the outside world.

They are five karmendriyā-s -five senses or indriyā-s of excreting, procreating, moving, grasping, and speaking,

Five Jnānendriyā-s -the five cognitive senses of smelling, tasting, seeing, touching, and hearing- Pañca prāṇā-s - five prāṇas -prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, udāna, and samāna.

Four functions of mind or aspects of antaḥkaraṇa, the inner instrument-- which are manas, buddhi, citta and ahaṁkāra.

Through these outlets man touches the outside world and relates them. This is one aspect of ‘me’ or one version of ‘me' or one pāda of ‘me’. After perceiving he enjoys. Likes and dislikes begin to operate. He begins to choose good and bad (priya-apriya – sukha-duḥkha) with his capacity to perceive the outside world, capacity to enjoy and capacity to do (Jñātṛtva-Bhoktṛtva-Kartṛtva). This is my jāgṛtāvastha. What a beautiful condensation of details! Hundreds and thousands of my activities are brought under one term- jāgaritasthāna. This fellow in the jāgṛt-avastha is called **Vaiśvānara**. He is sthūlabhuk- he is enjoying the gross world, its likes and dislikes, sukha and duḥkha etc.

Just as there is an outside world, there is an inside world which is our second state - (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 4)

**स्वप्नस्थानोऽन्तःप्रज्ञः सप्ताङ्ग एकोनविंशतिमुखः प्रविविक्तभुक्तैजसो द्वितीयः पादः।**

**Svapna-sthānaḥ antaḥ-prajñaḥ saptāṅga ēkōnaviṁśati-mukhaḥ pravivikta-bhuk taijasaḥ dvitīyaḥ pādaḥ.**

(The dream state, inwardly conscious, having seven limbs and nineteen doors, enjoying subtle objects that are luminous, is the second version of me or pāda of me.)

It is called svapna-sthāna--is similar to jāgaritasthāna -is a duplication of the first state with a difference that the world you are connecting is not the outside world but the inside world. It has the same three capacities, jñātṛtva, kaṛtutva, bhoktṛtva- but the world is inside – svapna-prapañca. The vāsanā-s of jāgṛt are imprinted in the memory centres and shows up in dream with all the details and all the intricacies- the dreaming of a serpent is so real that the dreamer shudders and shouts only to find out that it is false.

He is called **taijasaḥ**- the world that he is transacting is tejomātra. Everything is optical or ethereal. How do you distinguish the inside world from the outside world? To me, the objects in jāgṛt have a mass, but there is no mass in dream world. One can lift a mountain or even fight with a demon which is impossible in jāgṛt. Otherwise that world is as much a world as the one in which we are all there, in terms of details like sounds and pictures. In svapna he is pravivktabhuk- the enjoyment he has is of the subtle inside world.

**Q**. There seems to be no recording in svapna where as in jagṛt there is a definite imprint on the mind. Can you elaborate on this?

**A**. The possible explanation is- this jāgṛt phase is different from svapnasthāna wherein every day, the dream content is different. No two dreams are identical whereas jāgṛt does not change. In jāgṛt, there is some law operating whereas, within the dream there is no consistent law operating. There is no consistent event taking place and changes are so rapid that there is no relation between two events. Although the time scales are different between the jāgṛt and the dream phase, there is no law operating in the dream.

The laws in jagṛt are intact and are applicable to everyone and there is no dispute here, where as the laws in dream varies from person to person. It cannot be argued that the jāgṛt is different every day by the simple logic that if one keeps a material on the table, the previous night before going to sleep; the material will be in the same place when he wakes up the next day. The details are intact between today’s and tomorrow’s jāgṛt. In a dream there is no connection between two dreams. So, jāgṛt has a more steady and enduring quality than the dream state.

The argument that one has created this outside world is easily defeated by the point that the laws have not changed and the individual is not capable of changing them. So this world is not created by ‘me’. Similarly the dream world also cannot be manipulated. Actually my own position is that the spandanā-s released in the cosmos collect themselves into a pattern and give us a dream, but the world of imagination is in our hands.

Now we can distinguish between two worlds. The world of dreams which is ethereal and over which we have no control. Whereas in the jāgṛt, it is possible to imagine what we need and also reject what we do not want. This is actually the inside world with ‘me’ as the creator. We cannot say that we are creating many unpleasant things and are suffering as no one would create things for suffering. We have no volition in the dream since dream is throwing images helplessly from the memory centre. The point of importance is that the real jagat (as a dream) has a mass and dream jagat has no mass. Therefore this world or the inside world is created by something called ‘ātmā’ or the mind.

An all pervading consciousness principle has created the visible world. This world being the world of imagination, can also be created by a consciousness is the pre vedāntic position. Whether it is Īśvarā’s or my consciousness is debatable. One thing is certain that the world is not a creation of my consciousness because I cannot make a thing desired by me. I should be able to make and unmake things. So I cannot agree that this world is my projection.

I can however agree that another consciousness in the capacity of Īśvara has projected this world and I am vibrating in resonance. That is possible. If I insist on my world of imagination and if it is very strong then the pictures can stay longer. Paatanjalividyā says that.

Svapnasthāna is a phase where you show that you are the projector of the universe. One may argue that jāgṛt is created by someone else, but the proof is in the dream world. We call svapna unreal because it is not possible for us to hold a picture or sound for a longer time. Our minds are fickle-there is such a cāncalya that it is impossible to hold a picture of even our iṣṭadevata.

If one could hold the picture of say ’Kālimāta’ like Sri Rāmakṛṣṇa, which was so real to him then the matter is very much different. He had such a conviction that he answered Vivekānanda in affirmation that he has seen God just as he is seeing Vivekānanda. He further said that he could show him God if Vivekānanda was so interested. Nobody in the world has made such a daring statement till today. That was his capacity to create any object. So it is the question of dhārana. Still, it could be ethereal and that is the whole message of Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha.

**दृष्टासु अस्यमात्रेण देहः अदेहतां याति ।**

**Dr̥ṣṭāsu asya-mātrēṇa dēhaḥ a-dēhatāṁ yāti.**

A point comes where he says that body does not exist and is only an imagination. If you emphasise that view, the body vanishes- it is terrible to imagine! If your imagination is so strong and insisting, then adeha becomes deha.

**Yōga saṁsiddhi saṁvidām  - योग** संसिद्धि **संविदाम्।**For those who are experts in yoga - **sulabhēyam –सुलभेयम्** - it is very easy- says Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha. The consciousness that can divide and hold on the object of imagination is called **citta-vicchēda** - **चित्तविछेद.** This aspect was called **prāṇa-pratiṣṭa** - **प्राणप्रतिष्ठ**. It is a surprise to all of us.

The Svapna is not important for our sukha-duḥkha study, but it is to understand whether we can get a clue for the creation. Does the Indian position about creation have any meaning to the modern world or the modern scientist? Science has begun to recognise the role of Consciousness in the creation of Universe. Can we subscribe to that or is the position too weak for want of sufficient data? The dream world which is as intricate as the one we experience is created by the consciousness. Therefore we are tempted to suspect that this intricate world with all the energy-mass has been created likewise. Can we conclude that way and if so, are we reasonable or not, should be the scientific study. Otherwise there is no importance to svapna phase discussion which we did till now.

But Vedānta takes a different view. Can we ever say as to what the dream fellow experiences is unreal? We never have an impression that we are passing through the dream phase while dreaming. We say that, only when we wake up. Gauḍapāda takes up this question and devotes a whole chapter called Vaitathya Prakaraṇa. It is very difficult to understand that prakaraṇa. We should only wonder and keep quiet when things come to our mind about creation.

Now we will go to the next important state.( Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 5)

**यत्र सुप्तो न कञ्चन कामं कामयते न कञ्चन स्वप्नं पश्यति तत्सुषुप्तम् । सुषुप्तस्थान एकीभूतः प्रज्ञानघन एवानन्दमयो ह्यान्दभुक्चेतोमुखः प्राज्ञस्तृतीयः पादः॥**

**Yatra suptō na kañcana kāmaṁ kāmayatē na kañcana svapnaṁ paśyati tat suṣuptam.**

**Suṣuptasthāna ēkībhūtaḥ prajñānaghana ēva- ānandamayō hi-ānanda-bhuk-cētō-mukhaḥ prājñaḥ tr̥tīyaḥ pādaḥ.**

We are thinking of the third phase of human existence, the first two being the waking state and the dream state. Sleep is now defined. I wonder at the excellent definition which even the present day psychologists are unable to condense into such form.

**Na kañcana kāmaṁ kāmayatē** -no emotions what so ever- kāma is rāga, dveṣa and bhaya - attraction, repulsion and fear - inferiority complex, irritability, violent emotions

**Na kañcana svapnaṁ paśyati -** emotional components of the mind are absent and thinking component of the mind is also absent. Svapna includes the jāgṛt perception also.

**Tat suṣuptam -** excellent definition for characterising nidrā. You have a dreamless sleep. Thinking and emotional aspects are absent.

The teacher says that you are neither in waking nor in dream state, where dwaitabodha or duality is not there. There is a knower and a world that is known in the other two states- a cognisor and the cognized. This is absent in nidrā. We glorified the waking state saying that all that was in it is essential part of us. Although he is spending half of his time in nidrā, he is underscoring the same without giving it any importance. If one can appreciate this, his anxiety will go. This shows our priorities are wrongly taken. A precise definition for Nidrā is called prājñāsthiti or suṣuptasthiti. Vaishvānara or jāgṛt, taijasa or svapna, prājña or suśupti are the three pādā-s or attributes to man. We have to understand the contents of nidrā and adopt it in the jāgṛt phase.Śankara clarifies why this happiness is due to (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad-5, Śankarabhāṣya-16).

**अत्यन्तानायासरूपा हि इयं स्थितिः अनेन अनुभूयते इति आनन्दभुक्।**

**Atyanta-anāyāsa-rūpā hi iyaṁ sthitiḥ anēna**

**anubhūyatē iti ānanda-bhuk.**

Any sukha is āyāsa-rāhitya. What is the āyāsa that was found in jagrat and svapna and which is absent in nidrā?

**मनसः विषय विषय्याकारस्पन्दनायासदुःखाभावात् आनन्दमयः।**

**Manasaḥ viṣaya viṣayi-ākāra-spandana-āyāsa duḥkha-abhāvāt ānanda-mayaḥ.**

You are continuously** **oscillating between two pulsations - thinking and emotions which are the taxing elements.

**तत् रहितत्वात् आनन्दभुक् - tat rahitatvāt ānandabhuk -**the absence of these two gives ānanda.** **

**दर्शन स्मरणे ऎव हि मन: स्पन्दिते -  darśana smaraṇē eva hi manaḥ spanditē**- Mind reacts only to the experiences of senses as well as memory.

**तदभावे हृद्येव अविशेषेण प्राणात्मना अवस्थानम् ।**

**Tat-abhāvē hr̥di-ēva aviśēṣēṇa prāṇa-ātmanā avasthānam -**In the absence of it** **you are mere spandana of prāṇa.

We should never lose sight of the main issue of our study which is to **give us clarity about what should man do in the name of coming out** **of duḥkha and attaining permanent happiness.** We should search for situations where we are permanently happy.

In jāgṛt it is a divided happiness, broken as it were. Such a thing is not there in nidrā. One could pose a naughty question as to why he should study the nidrā phase in man! The lesson is, that it is the happiest state by anybody’s admission and is not because of any religious brainwashing. Every one, whether he is cultured or not says that nidrā is the happiest state. Man would forego anything in preference to sleep.

For the pursuit of happiness what are the characteristics we have to adopt?

**Na kañcana kāmaṁ kāmayatē na kañcana svapnaṁ paśyati.**The hint here is very clear. These were the two elements of burden both in Jāgṛt and Svapna. Kāma is an agitated state or fastness. A scientific thinker can put all the factors like kāma, krodha, mada, mātsarya, lobha and moha condensed into one term—as **vega**-force or **speed** inside us. Physical speed is nothing compared to mental speed. We can say that there is a volcano inside. We don’t have to conquer the forces inside one by one, but we can control only the mental speed and with the result, the other untamed forces also reduce slowly.

The teacher says that one cannot under-rate the sleep phase. Why?

Ānandabhuk, ānandmayaḥ- the whole study is here. Here is a clue for eliminating duḥkha. You are enjoying ānanda in nidrā, whereas you are enjoying the outside world in jāgṛt, which is a combination of sukha and duḥkha. You are happiness itself in nidrā. Here is a method by which one can always be happy.

What is the method by which one can always be happy? Whatever are the constituents of sleep must be responsible for happiness. If you want happiness, do not create disturbing emotions and thoughts**. Staying in wakeful state incorporating the characteristics of nidrā is the solution for lasting happiness**. That is all Vedānta. Everyone in the world does not miss sleep. They even go the extent of taking a sleeping pill for that purpose.

Sleep is alright in one way, but is not all, as some forces trap or trip you to sleep and you are helpless. If one wants to be in a state of ānanda, all the characteristics of nidrā has to be introduced voluntarily in the jāgṛt state. This state is called jāgṛn-nidrā or ajādya-nidrā.

**प्रत्यङ्विबोधैक बलेन पुंसां।**

**प्राचीन गन्धेषु पलायितेषु ।**

**प्रादुर्भवेत् काचित् अजाड्य निद्रा ।**

**प्रपञ्चचिन्तां परिमार्जयन्ति॥**

**Pratyaṅvibōdhaika balēna puṁsāṁ,**

**prācīna gandhēṣu palāyitēṣu,**

**prādurbhavēt kācit ajāḍya nidrā,**

**prapañca-cintāṁ parimārjayanti.**

On the strength of realisation of Self a person retreats from tendencies gathered over several lives. Then, dawns a state similar to slumber sans its impurity by the result of which all the worldly sorrows get completely extinguished.

An excellent śloka. Through this analysis and this parīkṣa you can know where happiness lies. Happiness lies in the non-doing when all the Vāsanā-s are washed away by vicāra. You get the wakeful sleep or invited nidrā or calculated nidrā. Contemplation is necessary to accept this point.

Perform all the tasks of your wakeful state in a leisurely manner and incorporate the qualities of non-doing in doing, then doing becomes simple and effective. Bhagavad Gīta (4-8) asserts:

**कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येदकर्मणि च कर्म यः।**

**स बुद्धिमान् मनुष्येषु स युक्तः कृत्स्नकर्मकृत्॥**

**Karmaṇi-akarma yaḥ paśyēt-akarmaṇi ca karma yaḥ,**

**sa buddhimān manuṣyēṣu sa yuktaḥ kr̥tsnakarmakr̥t.**

He who sees action in inaction and inaction in action is a wise and strong man. He is a yogi and performer of all actions. Can we come to the conclusion that there is no vyāpāra in nidrā as compared to jāgṛt? As per śāstra it is not a state of a-vyāpāra, but vyāpāra exists in seed form. Seed version means something that is hidden. It is prāṇa vyāpāra. Prāṇa is the general activity whereas thinking and emotions are specialized activities. If there was no vyāpāra, it is not possible to come back from sleep. As opined in Śankarabhāşya 24 on** **Gauḍapāda Kārika-2

**निर्बीजतयैव चेत् सति लीनानाम् संपन्नानाम् सुषुप्त -प्रलययोः पुनरुत्थानानुपपत्तिः स्यात् । मुक्तानाम् पुनरुत्पत्ति प्रसङ्गः।	**

**Nirbījatayā-ēva cēt sati līnānām saṁpannānām suṣupta-pralayayōḥ punarutthāna anupapattiḥ syāt, muktānām punarutpatti prasaṅgaḥ.	**

To come back, you have to infer that there is a bījarūpa of vyāpāra, that is, the general activity of prāṇa. In jāgṛt a fatigue point is reached in two hours. Whereas in nidrā, it takes six hours to reach the fatigue point since there is a very feeble vyāpāra. In Samādhi, it takes much longer. In fact you are comfortable even after you return to Jāgṛt. It took a very long time for Prahlāda to come back from Samādhi -** mahatā tēna śabdēna vaiśṇava prāṇa janmanaḥ -  महता तेन शब्देन वैश्णव प्राण जन्मन:।** a very big śankhanāda (sound of a conch) had to be blown to wake him up from Samādhi.

The more relaxed you are, the more time it takes you to come to the activity phase.** **In the light of this how do you do sādhana? Reduce the thought speed and emotion speed if you want to perform. Leisureliness is not anti productive as per śāstra. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (5-7-9) puts it beautifully-

**बहिरुन्मत्तताण्डवः अन्तःशीतलतयता समधिरिति कथ्यत**॥

**Bahiḥ-unmatta-tāṇḍavaḥ antaḥ śītalatayatā samadhiḥ-iti kathyata**.

Although outwardly he appears to be in a ecstatic drunken state he is extremely cool internally – that is the Samādhisthiti.

**निस्त्रैगुण्ये पथि विचरतां को विधिः को निषेधः।**

**Nistraiguṇyē pathi vicaratāṁ kō vidhiḥ kō niṣēdhaḥ.** (Śukāṣṭakam)

For people who are hovering in realised state which is right and which is wrong. Everything seems fine and good. This state is called Turīya (Māṇḍ. Upaniṣad -7)

**नान्तःप्रज्ञं, न बहिष्प्रज्ञं**, **नॊभयतःप्रज्ञं**, **न प्रज्ञानघनं**, **न प्रज्ञं**, **नाप्रज्ञं अदृश्यं**, **अव्यवहार्यं**, **अग्राह्यं**, **अलक्शणं**, **अचिन्त्यं**, **अव्यपदॆश्यं**, **ऎकात्मप्रत्ययसारं**, **प्रपञ्चोपशमं**, **शान्तं**, **शिवं**, **अद्वैतं**, **चतुर्थं मन्यन्तॆ**, **स आत्मा स विज्ञॆयः॥**

**Na-antaḥ-prajñaṁ, na bahiḥ-prajñaṁ**, **na- ubhayataḥ-prajñaṁ**, **na prajñāna-ghanaṁ**, **na prajñaṁ**, **nā-prajñaṁ adr̥śyaṁ**, **avyavahāryaṁ**, **agrāhyaṁ**, **alakśaṇaṁ**, **acintyaṁ**, **avyapadeśyaṁ**, **ekātmapratyayasāraṁ**, **prapañcōpaśamaṁ**, **śāntaṁ**, **śivaṁ**, **advaitaṁ**, **caturthaṁ manyante**, **sa ātmā sa vijñeyaḥ.**

**Na antaḥprajñaṁ, na bahiṣprajñaṁ** - Both the inside and outside world are ruled out.

**Na prajñaṁ nāprajñaṁ naprajñānaghanam**- Not even the mere activity version of you-not even the prāṇa svarūpa.

**Prapañca upaśamaṁ śāntaṁ śivaṁ advaitam**-You are so relaxed and non doing that you are peace itself-one need not be afraid ofthis state. There is no touch of duality.

**Caturthaṁ manyante**-Knowers of wisdom call this the fourth state- **sa ātmā sa ca vijñeyaḥ**- That has to be rediscovered by the sādhaka.

Śankara raises a point regarding the turīya state. When a fourth position is enunciated it means that it is- **स एष नेति नेत्यात्मा - Sa eśa neti netyātmā--**. There is no way of explaining this state except by negating vaiśvānara, taijasa or prājñā–This is a major hint for sādhaka. Śankara while commenting on various occasions infers that there is no positive definition for Brahma. According to him the best definition is—**Neti neti ityeva brahma grāhyam- नेति नेति इत्येव ब्रह्म ग्राह्यम्**. When the urge to search stops, you are in brahma. It cannot be perceived. It is not a result of cognition. One of the best śloka-s is from Kena Upaniṣad(1-6).

**यन्मनसा न मनुते एनाहुर्मनो मतम्।**

**तदेव ब्रह्म त्वं विद्धि नेदं यदिदमुपासते॥**

**Yan-manasā na manutē ēna-āhurmanō matam,**

**tat-ēva brahma tvaṁ viddhi nēdaṁ yadidam-upāsatē.**

That which has given the cognizing power for the mind is brahma. The śloka has a poetic grandeur. The prior state to prāṇa, the prior state to the seeing power, the prior state to the listening power, the prior state to the talking power, the prior state to the thinking power is Bhrahma.

**Q.** Why Turīya is not considered as nidrā?

**A.** You must see the abstractness to which the student is compelled to rise. Dvaitasya agrahaṇa- Non  experience of duality is common to both in the nidrā and turīya phase. Why don’t you stop at the nidrā phase? What is there to drop? Since the activity did not go completely in nidrā, it is still an incomplete state. In Man.Up.1- Ka.11 it is stated that-

**कार्यकारण बद्धौ ताविष्येते विश्वतैजसौ ।**

**प्राज्ञः कारणबद्धस्तु द्वौ तौ तुर्ये न सिध्यतः॥**

**Kārya-kāraṇa baddhau tāviṣyētē viśva-taijasau,**

**prājñaḥ kāraṇa-baddhastu dvau tau turyē na sidh‌yataḥ.**

The observer in jāgṛt and svapna are bound by two types of bandhanā-s- kārya-bandhana and kāraṇa-bandhana. Emotions, rāga and dveṣa are kārya-bhandana. Un-specified general pulsation (as in Nidrā) is kāraṇa-bandhana. They are entrapped by helplessness.

**Prājñaḥ kāraṇa baddhastu-**prājñā is burdened only by the kāraṇa- bandhana (un-specified general pulsations).

**Dvau tau turye na sidhyataḥ** - Turīya is different this way that it is neither bound by kāraṇa-avidyā nor kārya-avidyā. Further, in Māṇ.Up.1-Kā.12 Gauḍapāda says-

**नात्मानं न परांश्चैव न सत्यं नापि चानृतम्।**

**प्राज्ञः किञ्चन संवेत्ति तुर्यं तत् सर्वदृक् सदा॥**

**Na-ātmānaṁ na parāṁ-ca-ēva na satyaṁ na-api ca-anr̥tam,**

**prājñaḥ kiñcana saṁvētti turyaṁ tat sarvadr̥k sadā.**

In prājñā, there is no cognition of visible and invisible forces. In turīya the person is in total awareness. After Buddhikośa, when we go to mahattatva and avyākṛta, world is not there. But the causal forces are in operation. Mere spandana operates. This spandana takes specific forms when it grossifies into cetana. Śankara says-

**या सा प्रज्ञा सा प्राणा या सा प्राणा सा प्रज्ञा |**

**Yā sā prajñā sā prāṇā yā sā prāṇā sā prajñā**

They call it prāṇa or prājña or avyākṛta or bīja nidrā or tamas-all are equivalent. In Kenopaniṣad (1-4) the teacher asks you to note-

**अन्यदेव तद्विदितादथो अविदितादधि।**

**Anyadēva tat-viditāt-athō aviditāt-adhi.**

It is other than the seeable and unseen world. But in turīya, even the avidita forces are dissolved.

How do you dissolve the avidita forces? You keep on reducing the vāsanā-s such as rāga, dveṣa, krodha and the creative forces like attention which captures details. Only in the focusing stage, there can be a flower, a tree etc. Objects are formed by giving contours and by giving edges. In nidrā state, because of shell expansion, the attention goes. There is sańkocata in jagrat and svapna. The sańkocata is the one that creates details of desired shape. The ānanda in nidrā is because of softness of forces. **In fact you stop attention when you want to go to nidrā.**

But when you come to turīya, none of these exist. Prāṇa is also thinned out in turīya. Even according to science, there cannot be annihilation of anything–so confinement spreads. You exist in the spread version. **It is not death but immortality**. What can nothingness die into? This nothingness is sattā. Vedānta is sometimes wonderful, but at times it is dreadful- that is why we don’t go to that state! We prefer to be safe here only. We are only more comfortable by slowing down the activity and feel happier. When the system breaks barriers, then enlightenment happens.

Even in praļaya we are all not gone. Then why bother about liberation? **Simho vā maṣako vā vyāghro vā**—**सिंहो वा मषको वा व्याघ्रो वा** the lion, the mosquito, the tiger or anybody-**tattat jñānakarma vāsanāṅkitaḥ sapraviśanti-** **तत्तत् ज्ञानकर्म वासनांकितः सप्रविशन्ति‍ -**they come here and retain their sūkṣma tendencies. Our tendencies do not die in praļaya or even in nidrā - this is in Chāndogya Upaniṣad. Whereas, a jñāni softens the activities and comes to a phase where even the prāṇadharma gets dropped. Such a man cannot come into the cycle of creation.

**न उत्क्रामन्ति अत्रैव अस्मिन्नेव परेणात्मना अविभागं गच्छन्ति ।**

**Na utkrāmanti atra-ēva asmin-ēva parēṇa-ātmanā avibhāgaṁ gacchanti.**

If you are not bothered about the consequences, what is wrong with performance? None of us ever complain that our heart is beating and we are carrying a burden! Softer level of activity can be there due to which there is no cause for complaint. That is mukti.

**Q.** Is there a test to know if one has grown spiritually?

**A**. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha (6-4-6) refers to this aspect thus:

**एतावदेव खलु लिङ्गमलिङ्गमूर्तेः**

**संशान्त संसृति चिरभ्रम निवृतस्य ।**

**तज्ञस्य यन्मदन कोप विषाद मोह**

**लोभापदां अनुदिनं निपुणं तनुत्वम्॥**

**Ētāvadēva khalu liṅgamaliṅga-mūrtēḥ**

**saṁśānta saṁsr̥ti cirabhrama nivr̥tasya,**

**tajñasya yan-madana kōpa viṣāda mōha**

**lōbha-āpadāṁ anudinaṁ nipuṇaṁ tanutvam.**

What are the symptoms by which we can identify the realised soul who is established in peace and for whom the eternal illusory cycle of birth and death has come to an end and who is bereft of any external symbols? He can only be identified by the gradual thinning down of forces like sex, anger, anguish, delusion and greediness day by day in him.

Rāma asks this very same question- How do you judge a jñāni? By what symptoms can I say that a person is growing? Vāsiṣṭa says that it is very difficult to label a jñāni or judge him symptomatically. He is just like any other person A jñāni has no lakṣaṇā-s - but then?- Tajñasya - for a jñāni, the forces like sex, anger, depression, confusion, greed etc. are all thinning down every day. It is a continuous process of purification.

This is a test for you also. Check whether you react or to what level you react when you are faced with the unruly forces. If you do not react then there is a marked improvement in you. Śāstra is an applicable science.

How much can one be like a Jñāni depends on one’s intensity of sādhana. It also depends on the stock of vāsanā-s one carries.

It took me twenty years to come to the level of an average man’s comfort after this clarity came to me. Sādhana cannot be a complicated one as the problems are only two. Speed and focusing are the only ones that lead one to react when confronted by evil forces. Conscious lessening/thinning of these two aspects in one’s life is the sādhana. Diffusion should start when such tendencies come. One has to develop the ‘let go’ attitude. This is all sādhana. There cannot be a third method.


## A FEW GEMS FROM GAUḌAPĀDA

_Gauḍapāda Kārikā-s are an integral part of the Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad. Certain portions of the Kārika-s are considered as Upaniṣad itself. Gauḍapāda was, by tradition, the philosophical grand preceptor of Śankara. His Kārika on the Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad is the oldest known systematic exposition of Advaita Vedānta. The Kārika is a commentary in verse on the Upaniṣad. It falls into four sections: 1. Āgama Prakaraṇa 2.Vaitathya Prakaraṇa (Illusion) 3.Advaita Prakaraṇa (Non duality) and 4.Alātaśānti Prakaraṇa (Extinguishing a burning torch.)_

_The first section is a brief systematic exposition of the Upaniṣadic text, following its distinction of differrent states of consciousness. Several of the most important Indian commentators treat the Āgama Prakaraṇa as part of the scriptural text of Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad. _

_The second section moves beyond the text of the Upaniṣad to establish the unreality of the things experienced in dreams and by analogy, the things experienced in the waking state. All these are but MĀYĀ, illusion. Gauḍapāda emphasized the essential unity of waking and dreaming states, and argues that the waking world is as unreal as the dream-world._

_The Advaita section of the Kārika presents a clear, positive statement of the Non-Dualist position: ātman/brahman alone is real, all else is illusion. Gauḍapāda teaches the AJĀTA doctrine: the doctrine of NO-BECOMING. _

_The fourth section of the Kārika expounds the means of clearing the illusion of duality._

_As per Shastriji, the Advaita Prakaraṇa of Gaudapāda Kārika of Māṇdūkya Upaniṣad is excellent as it clarifies the doubts of a sādhaka. One should always keep ruminating on a few of them in the light of strengthening the sādhana.   So, he chose a few nuggets and has given his commentary on them.  I have reproduced them here for the reader to do introspection._

### KĀRIKĀ-S

**बहिष्प्रज्ञो विभुर्विश्वो ह्यन्तःप्रज्ञस्तु तैजसः।**

**घनप्रज्ञस्तथा प्राज्ञः एक एव त्रिधा स्मृतः॥**

**Bahiḥ-prajñaḥ vibhuḥ-viśvaḥ hi-antaḥ- prajñaḥ-tu taijasaḥ,**

**ghana-prajñaḥ-tathā prājñaḥ ēka ēva tridhā smr̥taḥ.**(Mā.Up.1-Kā.1)

(Viśva is all-pervading, the experiencer of external objects. Taijasa is the cognizer of internal objects. Prājña is a mass of consciousness. It is self alone that is thus known in the three states.)

**Bahiḥ-prajñaḥ vibhuḥ-viśvaḥ**-One who is cognizing outside is vibhu and is called Vaiṣvānara.

**Antaḥ- prajñaḥ-tu taijasaḥ** - the fellow who cognizes the inside world is taijasa.

**Ghana-prajñaḥ-tathā prājñaḥ** -In the prājña phase, outside cognition as well as inside cognition have vanished. We know the example of seven colors merging into white colour when the disc with seven colours is rotated fast. When you soften cognition, picture, and sound vanish. This explains as to how one suddenly slips into sleep. When you sit for meditation and slow down the assemblage of words, words get decomposed, śabda vanishes and that is a good growth to oneself. Dṛṣyanāśa and śabdanāśa occur when meditation ripens.

**Ghana-prajñaḥ-tathā prājñaḥ ēka ēva tridhā smr̥taḥ**-The dream observer is the same as the jāgṛt observer. Even the witness of silence and the person in nidrā are the same. There are no three enjoyers or perceivers. That is valuable from the sādhana point of view. Śankara comments as-**soham iti smṛtyā - सोऽहम् इति स्मृत्या।** Nobody says that a different person experienced the three states. What are you then? That means you have an existence independent of three states. However quick is the succession from one state to the other, there must be a time gap. That means, in that time gap you are not tagged on to any feature. You are independent. That means, jāgṛt dharma or svapna dharma or nidrā dharma is not a must for you showing that you are **alipta_-_aspruṣṭa – अलिप्त-अस्पृष्ठ** - untouched by these. The whole parīkṣa is to find your original svarūpa, you are **upaśānta_-_उपशान्त_._** Supported by this argument you begin to relax during meditation. Śankara’s comments (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad- Śankara Bhāṣya-19).

**पर्यायेण त्रिस्थानत्वात् सोऽहम् इति स्मृत्या प्रतिसन्धानाच्च स्थानत्रयव्यतिरिक्तत्वम् शुद्धत्वम् एकत्वम् असङ्गत्वम् च सिद्धम् इति अभिप्रायः॥**

**Paryāyēṇa tri-sthānatvāt saḥ-aham iti smr̥tyā prati-sandhānāt-ca sthānatraya-vyatiriktatvam śuddhatvam ēkatvam asaṅgatvam ca siddham iti abhiprāyaḥ.**

Since you are changing the three states and confirm that you are the same fellow in these states, you are one, you are pure, untainted and not linked with any of the three states. There were moments in your life when you stood aloof from these dharmā-s, you are pure and single and are unattached. Ultimately one has to come out of all these dharmā-s instead of fighting what is tamas and rajas! The state, where there is no outside cognition or inside cognition or even mere prāṇavyāpāra as in Nidra, is known as **Turīya** where you are untainted. Even for a** **paramahaṁsa sanyāsi who is exempted from sandhya or gayatri must hold on to prāņava japa. This is because the avidita forces are not easy to dissolve. Otherwise he will slip into corresponding nidrā. With a loss of awareness how can you manipulate? That means you must be wakeful and then decompose using onkāra in a very minimal way.

Why do you think of three states and examine them? Gauḍapāda puts it very nicely- In one wakeful state itself we can have the three properties.

**दक्षिणाक्षिमुखे विश्वो मनस्यन्तस्तु तैजसः।**

**आकाशे च हृदि प्राज्ञस्त्रिधा देहे व्यवस्थितः॥**

**Dakṣiṇa-akṣi-mukhē viśvaḥ manasi-antastu taijasaḥ,**

**ākāśē ca hr̥di prājñaḥ-tridhā dēhē vyavasthitaḥ.**(Mā.Up.1-Kā.2)

(Viśva is the cognizer through the right eye; Taijasa is the cognizer through the mind within; Prājña is the ākāśa in the heart. Therefore the one Atman is perceived threefold in the same body.)

Dakṣiṇākṣi mukhe viśvaḥ –Who is viśva?  The one who looks outside in the wakeful state.

Manasi antastu taijasaḥ- close your eyes and then you have the inside world even in the wakeful state- you do not have to wait for getting into dream state.

Ākāśe ca hṛdi prājñaḥ-When you are very much relaxed you are in your nidrādharma.

Tridhā dehe vyavasthitaḥ- simultaneously you have touches of all the three states.

**विश्वो हि स्थूलभुक् नित्यं तैजसः प्रविविक्तभुक्।**

**आनन्दभुक् तथा प्राज्ञः त्रिधा भोगं निबोधत ॥**

**Viśvō hi sthūlabhuk nityaṁ taijasaḥ praviviktabhuk,**

**ānandabhuk tathā prājñaḥ tridhā bhōgaṁ nibōdhata.**(Mā.Up.1-Kā.3)

Vaiśvānara enjoys the outside-the gross sense objects, Taijasa enjoys the inside-the subtle world of objects, and Prājña enjoys the peace-the bliss.

All the three understand bhoga this way.

**स्थूलं तर्पयते विश्वं प्रविविक्तं तु तैजसम्।**

**आनन्दश्च तथा प्राज्ञं त्रिधा तृप्तिं निबोधत॥**

**Sthūlaṁ tarpayatē viśvaṁ praviviktaṁ tu taijasam,**

**ānandaśca tathā prājñaṁ tridhā tr̥ptiṁ nibōdhata.** (Mā.Up.1-Kā.4)

The gross satisfies Viśva. The subtle satisfies Taijasa and bliss satisfies Prājña. Know that satisfaction is threefold.

Three types of food and three types of tṛpti or satisfaction are mentioned here. Grasping outside world is one tṛpti. Enjoying inside world of imaginations is another tṛpti. Staying in the mere prāṇa level or nidrā level is another.

**विभूतिं प्रसवं त्वन्ये मन्यन्ते सृष्टिचिन्तकाः।**

**स्वप्नमायासरूपेति सृष्टिरन्यैर्विकल्पिता ॥**

**Vibhūtiṁ prasavaṁ tvanyē manyantē sr̥ṣṭi-cintakāḥ,**

**svapna-māyā-sarūpēti sr̥ṣṭiranyaiḥ-vikalpitā.**

(Mā.Up.1-Kā.7)

(Some of those who contemplate the process of creation regard it as the manifestation of God’s powers; others imagine creation to be like dreams and illusions.)

Various people who want to label sṛṣṭi or creation call it as Īśvara’s display of power. Svapnamāyāsarūpeti. One person says that it is like dream; another fellow interprets as the māya of the indrajālika, the magic of The Magician.

**भोगार्थं सृष्टिरित्यन्ये क्रीडार्थमिति चापरे ।**

**दैवस्यैष स्वभावोऽयं आप्तकामस्य का स्पृहा ॥**

**Bhōgārthaṁ sr̥ṣṭiḥ-iti-anyē krīḍārthaṁ-iti cāparē,**

**daivasya-ēṣa svabhāvaḥ-ayaṁ āpta-kāmasya kā spr̥hā.**(Mā.Up.1-Kā.9)

Some people say that sṛṣṭi is Īśvara’s māya. Another says, time is the creator of the universe. Others say it is the sport of Īśvara for his enjoyment. Gauḍapāda says that Īśvara is a self satisfied fellow. How can you give him an attribute called kartr̥tva and bhōktr̥tva? He is ‘ātmani_ _eva_ _ātmanā_ _tuṣṭaḥ’-आत्मनि ऎव आत्मना तुष्ठः. How can there be kāmana for him?

**ग्रहोन तत्र नोत्सर्गश्चिंता यत्र न विद्यते।**

**आत्मसंस्थं तदा ज्ञानमजाति समतां गतम्॥**

<u>A sādhaka has to become indifferent to society or else he cannot achieve the goal.</u>

**Grahaḥ-na tatra na-utsargaḥ-cintā yatra na vidyatē,**

**Ātmasaṁsthaṁ tadā jñānaṁ-ajāti samatāṁ gatam.** (Mā.Up.3-Kā.38)

Grahaḥ na utsargaḥ na–Likes and dislikes are the two forces which we have encouraged continuously due to which mind does not keep quiet at all. It oscilates betweenacceptance and rejection,desire and aversion, attachment and detachment , dharma and adharma. This is the last straw of disturbance of the mind which a sādhaka has to overcome ultimately.Every thought that is born has to have a natural death. You are a mere non involved observer of the birth and death of thoughts. That should be the state of equanimity in sādhaka.

**निगृहीतस्य मनसो निर्विकल्पस्य धीमतः।**

**प्रचारः स तु विज्ञेयः सुषुप्तेऽन्यो न तत्समः॥**

**Nigr̥hītasya manasaḥ nirvikalpasya dhīmataḥ,**

**Pracāraḥ sa tu vijñēyaḥ suṣuptē-anyō na tat-samaḥ.** (Mā.Up.3-Kā.34)

(One should know the behavior of the conquered mind which is endowed with discrimination and free from illusions. The condition of the mind in deep sleep is not like that but is of a different kind.)

One has to sit quiet and find out his quietened mind consciously. Nigraha is control. You have to understand the content of the subdued mind and the content of the mind which has no sañkalpa.

Pracāraḥ yaḥ manasaḥ - whatever is the quality of the mind, sa tu vijñeyaḥ-that should be understood and appreciated by the sādhaka. Your sādhana in the wakeful state is different from sleep. You sit wakefully and quieten the forces. This state is different from state of sleep and they are not equal.

Why they did not equate the suşupti with nigṛhīta manas? The answer is in the next śloka:

**लीयते हि सुषुप्ते तन्निगृहीतं न लीयते।**

**तदेव निर्भयं ब्रह्म ज्ञानालोकं समन्ततः॥**

**Līyatē hi suṣuptē tat-nigr̥hītaṁ na līyatē,**

**tat-ēva nirbhayaṁ brahma jñānālōkaṁ samantataḥ.** (Mā.Up.3-Kā.35)

(The mind is dissolved in deep sleep, but it is not so when the mind is controlled. The controlled mind is verily the fearless Brahman, the light of whose omniscience is all-pervading.)

The mind gets dissolved in deep sleep, but when under restraint, it doesn’t get dissolved. That (mind) alone becomes Brahman, the fearless, endowed with the light that is Consciousness on all sides. In nidrā, mind is not eliminated. Manolaya has happened but manonāśa has not happened. We sleep because there is a pull which is an inability to hold the indriya-vyāpāra. There is something in sleep which is not in a person having complete cittaśuddhi.

suśuptau manaḥ līyate-it acquires a seed form-a general prāṇa-spandana. Whereas, jñāna is quietened state of  mind. Gauḍapāda declares this very clearly.

<u>Nigṛhītaṁ_ _manaḥ_ _eva_ _nirbhayaṁ_ _brahma_ _- it is a no-mind state</u> <u>in wakeful hours</u>.

**सर्वाभिलापविगतः सर्वचिंन्तासमुत्थितः।**

**सुप्रशान्तः सकृज्ज्योतिः समाधिरचलोऽभय:॥**

**Sarva-abhilāpa-vigataḥ sarva-cintā-samutthitaḥ,**

**su-praśāntaḥ sakr̥jjyōtiḥ samādhiḥ-acalḥ-abhayaḥ.**   (Mā.Up.3-Kā.37)

(Atman is beyond all expression by words and beyond all acts of the mind. It is peace itself, eternal effulgence and samādhi; It is unmoving and fearless.)

Sarva-abhilāpa-vigataḥ - no śabda inside- no expressions. Sarva-cintā-samutthitaḥ - free from all thoughts involving  pictures and sounds. That should be the sādhana. Try these two things when you sit quiet. Remaining silent in your wakeful state is samādhi. Regularly cultivate this.

**मनसो निग्रहायत्तमभयं सर्वयोगिनाम्।**

**दुःखक्षयः प्रबोधश्चाप्यक्षया शान्तिरेव च॥**

**Manasō nigrahāyattam-abhayaṁ sarva-yōginām,**

**Duḥkhakṣayaḥ prabōdhaḥ-ca-api-akṣayā śāntiḥ-ēva ca.** (Mā.Up.3-Kā.40)

This excellent śloka says that even after the knowledge one has to do sādhana. For every type of yogi - duḥkha-kṣayaḥ - banishing of duḥkha, Prabodha - self knowledge, Akṣaya-śāntiḥ- ever lasting peace are through manasaḥ nigrahāyattam conquering the mind and that is the fearless state - Abhayam. Śankara’s commentary on the above Kārika is:

**एषां पुनः ब्रह्मस्वरूपव्यतिरेकेण - “नोपचारः कथञ्चन” इति अवोचाम। येतु अतः अन्ये योगिनः-मनोनिग्रहायत्तैव॥**

**Ēṣāṁ punaḥ brahma-svarūpa-vyatirēkēṇa . . . . “na-upacāraḥ kathañcana” iti avōcāma,**

**yētu ataḥ anyē yōginaḥ - manōnigrahāyattaiva.**

For those people of calibre like, Vāmadeva or Śuka whose mind is so pure, it is already in the kalpita phase. Pangs are not there at all. Mind is not in the continuous thinking phase and so it dies. They are nearly in brahma. Indriya- vyāpāra and mano-vyāpāra are kalpitam eva-**कल्पित ऎव**. Na paramārthataḥ - न परमार्थतः - It is not permanant.

Teśām_ _brahma_ _svarūpānām- They are already in brahma.

Mokṣākhyā akṣyāśāntiḥ svabhāvataḥ eva siddhā – **मोक्षाख्या अक्षयशान्तिः स्वभावतः ऎव सिद्धा** - They are already in that state of boundless shanti.

Na anyayattā – **न अन्यत्ता** - They don’t depend upon any other prop.

Nopacāraḥ kathañcana ityavocāma – There is no need for any suggestion.

Teşām śravaṇānāmeva alam – **तॆषां श्रवणमॆव अलं** - For them one listening is enough.

Ye tu ataḥ anye yoginaḥ- What about people like us with so much rajas and tamas?

Hīna madhyama_ _dṛṣṭayaḥ_ _avyatiriktam_ _ātmasambandhi_ _manaḥ_ _indriyādi_ _anyat_ _paşyanti – **हीन मध्यम दृष्टयः अव्यतिरिक्तम् आत्मसम्बन्धि मनः इन्द्रियादि अन्यत् पष्यन्ति** - They see vividly the thoughts since they cannot be eradicated easily. It won’t go by simple suggestion. Teṣāṁ ātmasvarūpa rahitānām- they do not have the ātmaniṣṭa.

Such people have to practice - manso nigrahāyattam**- मनसॊनिग्रहायत्तम्** - have to tame the mind. Mind control is necessary.

**उपायेन निगृह्णीयात् विक्षिप्तम् कामभोगयोः।**

**सुप्रसन्नम् लये चैव यथा कामो लयस्तथा॥**(Mā.Up.3-Kā.42)

**Upāyēna nigr̥hṇīyāt vikṣiptam kāma-bhōgayōḥ,**

**su-prasannam layē ca-ēva yathā kāmō layaḥ-tathā.**

Therefore do not harshly try to quieten the mind, do it gently by upāya. When the mind tends to go out, try to reduce its speed gently.

Suprasannam layecchaiva yathā kāmanartha hetuḥ layaḥ api tathā anarthahetuḥ. The feeling of comfort derived out of manolaya is also a force to be overcome by being wakeful and conscious. That manolaya also traps you. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha (3-9-132) declares-

**मनः प्रशमनोपायो योग इत्यभिधीयते॥**

**Manaḥ praśamana-upāyḥ yōga iti-abhidhīyatē.**

Mellowing the mind is termed as yoga. That is, tuning it from the harsh state to gentle state. So sit and quieten the mind. You decide an interval of time where your duty calls would not come and disturb you. That is the skill with which you have to work. You have to be in a relaxed state for attaining peace. Simple ātmāparichaya is not sufficient for the sādhana. ātmā niṣṭhatva has to get established through sādhana. Even after knowing your svarūpa, you should not stop nididhyāsa.

<u>A single flash of self, no-mind state, is felt in śravaṇa. </u>

<u>Repeated occurance of this flash of self is termed as manana. </u>

<u>Nididhyāsa is the stabilisation of the repeated flashes of the self. </u>

**लये सम्बोधयेच्चित्तं विक्षिप्तं शमयेत्पुनः।**

**सकाषायं विजानीयात् सम प्राप्तं न चालयेत्॥**

**Layē sambōdhayēt-cittaṁ vikṣiptaṁ śamayēt-punaḥ,**

**Sakāṣāyaṁ vijānīyāt sama prāptaṁ na cālayēt.**

(Mā.Up.3-Kā.44)

(If the mind becomes inactive, arouse it from laya; if distracted, make it tranquil. Understand the nature of the mind when it contains the seed of attachment. When the mind has attained equanimity, do not disturb it again.)

Indriyavyāpāra is called bhogavāsana. Karmendriyavyāpāra is called karmavāsana. Vikṣiptaṁ śamayet punaḥ - both operations are to be corrected. Slight samādhāna comes as in nidrā. But, understand that there is still a small dosha in bīja form. Once a pleasant state is reached, try to hold on to that state. We often spoil that by inviting another thought. Do not do that. Even the āsvādana of sukha should not be done heavily as it amounts to problems.

**यदा न लीयते चित्तं न च विक्षिप्यते पुनः।**

**अनिङ्गनमनाभासं निष्फन्नं ब्रह्म तत्तदा॥**

**Yadā na līyatē cittaṁ na ca vikṣipyatē punaḥ,**

**Aniṅganamana-ābhāsaṁ niṣphannaṁ brahma tat-tadā.**(Mā.Up.3-Kā.46)

(When the mind does not lapse into inactivity and is not distracted by desires, that is to say, when it remains unshakable and does not give rise to appearances, it verily becomes Brahman.)** **

When the mind is no more wandering, that is the brahmasthiti. When there is movement it is called mind, when it is not there then it is brahman.

**SELF in the functioning phase is MIND.**

**MIND in the non-functioning phase is SELF.**

**निवृत्तस्य अप्रवृत्तस्य निश्चला हि तदा स्थितिः।**

**विषयः स हि बुद्धानां तत् साम्यमजमद्वयम्॥**

**Nivr̥ttasya a-pravr̥ttasya niścalā hi tadā sthitiḥ,**

**Viṣayaḥ sa hi buddhānāṁ tat sāmyam-ajam-advayam.**(Mā.Up.4-Kā.80)

(The in-between state of the mind which is withdrawn but not yet started indulging is verily the state of immutability.The wise realize such a mind to be Brahman; It is undifferentiated, birth less and non-dual.)

One thought has gone, another thought is yet to come. At that point the mind is calana-rahita or without movement. Otherwise, where is the feel of that state? The interval is your svarūpa- that is a no-thought, no-mind state. The enlightened people hover there. That is your advayasthiti –sama-sthiti. Gauḍapāda finally salutes the advaita-śāstra itself.

**दुर्दर्शमतिगंभीरम् अजम् साम्यम् विशारदम्।**

**बुद्द्वा पदमनानात्वम् नमस्कुर्मो यथा बलम्॥**

**Durdarśam-ati-gaṁbhīram ajam sāmyam viśāradam,**

**buddvā padam-anānātvam namaskurmō yathā balam.**(Mā.Up.4-Kā.100)

Having realised the non-dual state that is hard to perceive and which is lofty, unborn, uniform and serene, we offer our salutations to IT, as best as we can. Our prostrations do not go to a personal God as we are discussing advaita here. We salute to this advaita-tatva, having known and established in it, to the best of our ability.
