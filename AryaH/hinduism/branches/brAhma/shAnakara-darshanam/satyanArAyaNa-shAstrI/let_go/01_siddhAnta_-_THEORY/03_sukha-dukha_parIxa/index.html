  <p>(AN ANALYSIS OF HAPPINESS AND SUFFERING)</p>
<p>The credit of discovering this path definitely has to go to me. In my days of intense suffering, I was frantically searching for solutions in Vedānta śāstrās by thorough study of the texts along with the invaluable commentary by Śankara on them. This in-depth search of mine led to the discovery of the above path. When presented in the public, many took it with disbelief and they naturally wanted sanction in Vedāntic Texts or Śāstra Pramāna. In Chāndogya Upaniṣad (7-22)** **Sanatkumāra (the teacher) tells Nārada (the student) that:</p>
<p><strong>यदा वै सुखं लभतेऽथ करोति।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yadā vai sukhaṁ labhate atha karōti.</strong></p>
<p>One will involve oneself in that activity only which gives him Sukha or happiness.</p>
<p><strong>सुखं लब्ध्वा करोति - Sukhaṁ labdhvā karōti.</strong></p>
<p>One will not venture into that activity which will not result in happiness.</p>
<p><strong>सुखमेव लब्ध्वा करोति।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sukham-ēva labdhvā karōti.</strong></p>
<p>One is goaded into an activity if he gets only happiness.</p>
<p><strong>सुखंत्वेव विजिज्ञासितव्यमिति ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sukhaṁtvēva vijijñāsitavyam-iti.</strong></p>
<p>Hence, we have to investigate or do the parīkṣa of sukha only. Therefore the student requests the teacher:</p>
<p><strong>सुखं भगवो विजिज्ञास इति॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sukhaṁ bhagavō vijijñāsa iti.</strong></p>
<p>Oh my Lord, let me know about the secrets of Sukha.</p>
<p>In Taittirīya Upaniṣad, (2-8) the aspect of Ānanda or Happiness or Sukha is discussed in detail:** **</p>
<p><strong>सैषानन्दस्य मीमांसा भवति।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sa-ēṣa-ānandasya mīmāṁsā bhavati.</strong></p>
<p>The teacher calls the student for an investigation of ānanda.</p>
<p>When the teacher suggests sukha-duḥkha parīkṣa, the student immediately reacts, saying that everything about sukha and duḥkha is known already. What more is there to be studied? Look at the reaction of the student. He can categorically tell what his knowledge about sukha-duḥkha is. He declares that he knows about sukha in the sense that music gives him joy, a sweet dish gives him joy, company of welcome friends gives him joy, and a very understanding wife gives him joy. If these are not available, then he is not happy. He further elaborates that if his son/daughter is not studious, he is not happy. Pleasant situations give him joy. Indriya āsvādana gives him joy. The contact of five indriyā-s with the corresponding viṣayā-s, give him joy. The minus of that puts him into sorrow. So, he declares that he knows everything about sukha and duḥkha.</p>
<p>The teacher sets aside the conclusions drawn by the student. He wants the student to investigate Sukha and Duḥkha <strong>content wise and not agency wise.</strong> Here one should pause a little, contemplate and try to catch the difference between knowing the thing agency wise and the same thing content wise. The general opinion is that certain things put one in a happy mood and certain other things put one in an unhappy mood. This was not the study the teacher wanted the student to go into. <strong>He wanted the student to closely watch his state of mind when the student declared that he was happy. Similarly, the teacher wanted the student to study the Cittasthiti (mental state) when he felt he was unhappy.</strong></p>
<p>This type of investigation, none of us have tried when we are in moments of sukha or duḥkha. Instead, we had restricted our studies of happy or unhappy state at the indriya level all the time. That is all the study we made. Content-wise we have to examine what is sukha and what is duḥkha. We should observe this difference. What was my mental state when I said that the whole of Sunday was a bad day? What is my mental state when I say that it is beautiful, I am so fine? This parīkṣa may look very simple, but it has not occurred to anybody in the world to do the parīkṣa this way. It is exclusively the suggestion from the Upaniṣads. No philosopher, no system of philosophy could give it in such simple terms. In no religion or practice it has been emphasised that sukha-duḥkha parīkṣa should be on the lines where you examine the state of the mind when you are happy and the state of the mind when you are not happy.<strong>The suggestion is unique to the Upaniṣads</strong>. What is the psychological state, what is the psychological posture when you are happy and when you are not happy? A very simple examination but it is a very profound one. It can take you to a new discovery. That’s why I mentioned yesterday that Vedanta is a difficult science, but when properly understood, it is the easiest of all the sciences.</p>
<h2 id="duḥkha-parīkṣa-examination-of-suffering">DUḤKHA PARĪKṣA (EXAMINATION OF SUFFERING)</h2>
<p>Let us take up duḥkha parīkṣa to start with and later on go to sukha parīkṣa. What is Duḥkha parīkṣa? Take any duḥkha moment and see what the cittasthiti is. That’s all. Every day we have many moments of duḥkha. Observe what is the state of the mind at that time? Take the case of the day previous to the examination results of a student. The parents of the person are anxious and the student is anxious. The student’s interest is either to get into the computer science course or to get into the medical course, because they are the highest paying jobs. Just imagine the state of parent’s mind or the student’s mind and identify yourself with that situation. Oh! Would I get my first class? Will I lose that? All my plans will be broken if I don’t get it. Would it be a donation seat? Or would it be a seat earned on merit? What then? What are the alternatives? I have such high expectations about the result.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the nature of mind at that time? Anxiety! Insecurity! Fear! Doubt! The student wants to relax, but he cannot. He or she is agitated, disturbed. See the revised way of studying duḥkha, not constituent-wise, not ingredients-wise, not characteristics-wise,</p>
<p>The most powerful example that I always remember to illustrate, is to imagine the mental state of your wife or daughter or your sister when a baby is about to be delivered in the family. Admitted to the hospital/ nursing home, the lady is moved to the operation theatre. Watch the husband or father or the mother of the lady in question. They are all anxious, moving up and down the corridor of the hospital. Would it be a simple labour case? Would it be a forceps case? Would it be a caesarean case? Would the child and the mother be safe? The state of mind of the concerned person, when observed, points to **Uncertainty, Anxiety, Impatience, Fear,**which are all attributes of duḥkha.</p>
<p>Similarly, Rāga-attraction,** **Dveṣa-repulsion, Bhaya-fear, are also facets of duḥkha. Jealousy comes when you have only one car and your neighbour has more than that. You grudge him. You feel small. It&rsquo;s that inferiority complex that bothers you- this is a duḥkha attribute. Mind is agitated, excited and troubled. You try to further see the common factor through a scientist&rsquo;s eye-that is, to reduce many things into as few things as possible.</p>
<p>It is a wellestablished fact in Vedānta that the entire set of activities of a human being, both physical and psychological, are nothing butPrāṇic Activity only. Prāṇa is defined as ‘Gatiḥ Prāṇaḥ’-** गतिः प्राणः**. Movement is Prāṇa. Movement is vibration or pulsation. Chāndogya Upaniṣad** **declares that:</p>
<p><strong>…स यदा स्वपिति प्राणमेव वागप्येति । प्राणं चक्षुःप्राणं श्रोत्रं प्राणं मनः प्राणोह्येवैतान् सर्वान् संवृङ्क्त इति।</strong></p>
<p><strong>…sa yadā svapiti prāṇam-ēva vāk-apyēti.  prāṇaṁ cakṣuḥ prāṇaṁ śrōtraṁ prāṇaṁ manaḥ prāṇō-hi-ēva-ētān sarvān saṁvr̥ṅkta iti.</strong></p>
<p>(Chāndogya Upa. 4-3-3)**  **</p>
<p>When a person is in deep sleep his speech gets merged into general prāṇic activity. Likewise his seeing, hearing, thinking, etc. - i.e., all his physical and psychological activities - merge into a single prāṇic activity or a general vibration.</p>
<p>The above can be easily grasped if we think of a person who is in coma. Except the beating of the pulse there is no other activity in him. All other physical and mental activities stand merged in this mere pulsation- general prāṇic activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our thinking centre (centre of our mind which is called as Citta) is filled with Prāṇaic Activity, Vibration or Movement.</li>
<li>Any activity involves variation in its occurrence – it may be very slow, slow, normal, fast, very fast etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>As already discussed above, the teacher’s direction of investigating Duḥkha is to watch the state of mind when one says that he is not happy or is suffering. Accordingly, if one examines his own mind or Citta Centre when he is angry it is highly agitated, the level of activity is at a very high speed, there is fastness, there is restlessness, citta is filled with throbbing prānic activity. Although he is not in a position to watch his state of mind at the peak of his anger, he can do so when he calms down a little. We would have seen people physically disturbed and even trembling during such angry situations. When we analyse this, we can say that Rāga, Krodha (Anger), Jealousy, Bhaya (fear), Anxiety, Uncertainty, Impatience, Hurry etc., are all synonyms of <strong>SPEED</strong> only. All these situations amount to fastness or hyper activity of the mind (citta) called <strong>VEGA</strong> in Sanskrit. Thus, all such moments are moments of Duḥkha or suffering. Let us take up the following Śloka of Bhagavad-Ġīta (5-23).</p>
<p><strong>शक्नोतीहैव यः सोढुं प्राक्शरीरविमोक्षणात् ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>कामक्रोधोद्भवं वेगं स युक्तः स सुखी नर:॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Śaknōti-iha-ēva yaḥ sōḍhuṁ prāk-śarīra- vimōkṣaṇāt,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kāma-krōdha-udbhavaṁ vēgaṁ sa yuktaḥ sa sukhī naraḥ.</strong></p>
<p>One who is able to withstand the impulse of lust and anger before death is a yogi, and a happy person.Man can be happy only when he is able to control or drop the speed arising out of Kāma (desire), Krodha, and Bhaya etc. which are the moments of Duḥkha.</p>
<p><strong>दुःखेष्वनुद्विग्नमनाः सुखेषु विगतस्पृहः।</strong></p>
<p><strong>वीतरागभयक्रोधः स्थितधीर्मुनिरुच्यते॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Duḥkhēṣu-anudvigna-manāḥ sukhēṣu vigata- spr̥haḥ,</strong></p>
<p><strong>vīta-rāga-bhaya-krōdhaḥ sthitadhīḥ- muniḥ-ucyatē.</strong> (Bhagavad-Ġīta, 2-56)</p>
<p>A person whose mind is unperturbed by sorrow, who does not crave for pleasures, and who is completely free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called Sthitaprajña &mdash; a sage of steady intellect.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-Ġīta, while dealing with the characteristics of a balanced person or Yogi it is said that – such a person will not get disturbed, his mind does not get agitated or his mind is rid of Vega during the moments of Duḥkha. That is, he has conquered the speed of Rāga, Bhaya, and Krodha in all such situations.</p>
<p>When examined, one can see that any disturbance, any misery, and any pain amounts to violence inside- it can be an excited mind, an agitated mind with unruly forces operating inside. If you apply the cleverness of a scientist, all these can be brought under one term –<strong>speed or vega</strong> or fastness. That’s the advantage the scientist has over the others. He can bring all these things into a few minimal terms. Hundreds of nearly different things can be brought into one term, so that handling is easy. So,<strong>duḥkha is speed</strong>. What a permitted conclusion!</p>
<p><strong>Hence, the solution</strong> is, wherever there is fastness, replace it by slowness. It is our experience that an agitated person instead of walking will almost be running. A speed at one point is a speed revealed everywhere. If he is fast inside and is chewing, it can be fast chewing. If he is swallowing, it is fast swallowing. My relative who was a specialist in cancer layer study in Cincinnati, USA, had the habit of chewing the gum. When he focussed and when he was fast, this speed of chewing also increased. He had observed this and shared with me. He was not a student of Vedānta, but look at the observation.</p>
<p><u>Speed felt at one centre is revealed at all centres. Speed corrected at one centre, purifies all other centres</u>. Now that you have the answer-walk slowly- talk slowly-think slowly. Try to get angry slowly. Then it is no anger at all! Softness brought at one centre induces softness at other centres like the thinking centre, the walk centre, the talk centre and the respiratory centre. Try to apply slowness and see the difference. Comfort sets in immediately. I have tried this experiment and got results. You can best appreciate this truth when you start applying them. You can see the difference and appreciate the śāstra then. If you want to walk, do it slowly. Walking slowly starts purifying all these centres. Then one is very much relaxed.</p>
<p>There is another component of duḥkha, which we have to study. In fact it is a subtler aspect. Once you become an intellectual, you begin to think seriously. And what&rsquo;s that thinking - to know, to understand, to grasp. That’s again another burden. Why do you call it a burden? Is it not the power in you? Intellect is the best tool in the hands of man. All this technology is because of his intellect. Employing that intellect, the medical science has advanced. Anaesthesia itself has become so sophisticated that it is very convenient to surgery. A roof can be bent in any direction because of the combination of concrete and reinforcements. All this technology is the result of focussing_. _But the point is that it is burdensome and that is the reason why focussing is turned down by śāstra. One is naturally disturbed with this position of śāstra and this can be anybody’s objection to the śāstra. Focussing is the most powerful tool in the hands of man due to which the advancement of technology is possible. But the point is that this attention or focussing is burdensome. Fortunately, we are making and breaking this focussing. Nobody is continuously concentrating for more than half an hour, even the most studious. Even the big researcher reaches the break down point very early. The fatigue point is reached and he shakes off. That’s a natural safety mechanism built in man. Otherwise, man would have broken himself down, would have turned mad, and would have hit himself against a wall! You shift from the serious mood to a lighter mood. But once you start encouraging this quality of overdoing this focussing, the balance is tilted. Generally, we err in the wrong direction and we begin to suffer.</p>
<p>Imagine the fatigue experience of such a person. We must know the goodness or badness of a thing in its exaggerated version. Otherwise it becomes difficult to appreciate! You must push the pendulum to the extreme point and then see the momentum it carries. But, once you exploit this intellect and start doing much of it, you begin to suffer. Excitement, fear, desire for objects of enjoyment, desire for fame; can be managed to certain extent. But the endless pursuit for creativity is difficult to manage. If you watch the professors in any research institute, either they are in the laboratory doing research or they are stuck in their home also preoccupied with the same thought of research. They cannot come out of this focussing. Hence, subtler version of suffering is <strong>focussing.</strong> Basically we are ‘all-pervasive’ beings or** sarvayvāpī- सर्वव्यापी.**</p>
<ul>
<li>When you are not in suffering state you are expansive, unloaded, diffused, very light, and non-dense and hence you are in a state of Vistārata- all-pervasiveness.</li>
<li>But when you are in a moment of Duḥkha, you are sacrificing your everywhereness and coming to a pinpoint.</li>
<li>In the language of a Quantum Physicist – you are in a <strong>CONING</strong>phase- tending towards pointedness.</li>
<li>If one observes a cone, the tip of the cone is pointed and the base is wide.</li>
<li>Focussing is coning into a point. Reducing to a point or to an aperture.</li>
<li>Since you are a burdened stuff, your mind acquires the highest density because it has limited volume- That is why you feel the load on you.</li>
<li>We have sacrificed our true nature of expansive state and are badly caught up in searching, trying to solve, trying to know etc. We have shrunk ourselves into a narrow stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unaware of this obvious truth, I made a mess of my life for 20 years, always focussing, to a point that I lost my sleep, I lost my appetite, and no medication would help me. I went to a very famous doctor only to be told that no medicine would help me and I had to gain balance of mind through control of aspirations. I was always researching on something or the other. I was having a firm faith and conviction that I was doing a very big thing or a noble act.</p>
<p>I am showing a very big aspect of human being, especially that of an intellectual. I was proud of my research skills. I thought I was a big fellow because I could easily focus on various things. All the while I was under the impression that I was doing the best thing - solving problems – such as, how to give a simpler house for the villager with which I was not concerned at all as I was a chemistry professor. My research was to device a method to simplify a house construction and make it cost effective. How to avoid a beam for the door and have only the shutter, how to avoid plastering for the wall so that it could save 20% of the total cost, how to build a house without foundation? It was not my field at all. Even then, I had designed all carpentry work. You may say that it is a wonderful research for society&rsquo;s benefit and for one’s own delight, but it was exhausting for me.</p>
<p>I owe everything to Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa because I was able to open the knot of suffering. I deeply understood the vedāntic solution when no teacher could tell me what my problem was and where I erred. Most of the teachers went by vedāntic definitions Satyam Jñānam Anantam Brahma, Anoranīyān Mahatomahīāyn, etc. Once again, if you become a serious student and start studying these declarations you will end up confused. What does one understand by saying ‘you are smaller than the smallest, bigger than the biggest’ (Anoranīyān, Mahatomahīyān)? To a scientist that is a very big inconsistency. How can anything simultaneously be smaller than the smallest and bigger than the biggest?</p>
<p>One of my friends was a director of a computer science research centre. He was in his fifties, heading twenty top scientists and was the chief of the unit. While we were discussing one day, he said that he had become prematurely ten years older due to pressure of work and focussing. An American, who was a big researcher, head of a team of researchers, confessed to the fact that he was 10 years older than his actual age. Then why not give it up? See the difficulty. How can he give up, as the investor of money into that research unit is demanding results? The investor or money giver claims results. Otherwise there is a fear of the funds being stopped. So, that leads to more and more focussing. What next? How to complete this research in one or two weeks? Though it can be a remarkable achievement from one point of view it is alarming from the other point of view.</p>
<p>We cannot say that focussing - **ēkāgratā- एकाग्रता,**is a wrong thing, but ekāgratā was my cause for suffering when I overdid it although it gave me good credit for an extraordinary performance.</p>
<p>I want you to appreciate this point. The world of technology and the civilization has missed this big point. While we may glorify it from one point of view, we should condemn it from the other point of view. The urge to over perform through attention or concentration is a killer of peace! You are paying a big price for your technological achievements. Why should not people here in America realize this one? Look at the wisdom from the East? At what cost are you getting these achievements-new discoveries, especially in the medical field and in the engineering field. If there is adequate rest for the **buddhikośa- बुद्धिकोश –<strong>the intellect</strong>- **it is okay. This is the missing element in the 21<sup>st</sup> century civilization. And what is the technique that can complement that missing element? It is the Indian wisdom- the Vedāntic wisdom. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (3-9-39) asserts-</p>
<p><strong>अनास्थैव हि निर्वाणम् दुःखमास्था परिग्रहः।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anāsthā-ēva hi nirvāṇam duḥkham-āsthā parigrahaḥ.</strong></p>
<p>While attachment (focussing) is sufferring, detachment (diffusion) alone leads to liberation.</p>
<p>Focussing, pinpointedness, concentration, coning, etc. all result in untold suffering or Duḥkha. Whereas, Vistārata or diffusion or expansive state of mind gives you Sukha or happiness or deliverance from Duḥkha. Therefore drop burdensome/tiresome focussing and concentration and adopt a<strong>Let go</strong> <strong>attitude</strong> as far as possible. This is called <strong>Udāsīnabhāva- उदासीनभाव.</strong></p>
<p>This focussing is the main aspect of Duḥkha for an intellectual. The duḥkha of a non intellectual or worldly person is to hanker for small things such as satisfaction of the tongue, attainment of status and recognition etc. Even the role of the social worker is to think about the ways of serving the society. What about the householder then? He worries about the children, about the wife, about the bank deposit? How does it help him to come out of duḥkha? As said in Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (6-9-418)-</p>
<p><strong>द्वित्वैकत्वदृशौ चित्तं तदेवाज्ञानमुच्यते।</strong></p>
<p><strong>एतयोर्यो लयो दृष्टयोस्तज्ज्ञानं सा परा गतिः॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dvitva-ēkatva-dr̥śau cittaṁ tat-ēva-ajñānam- ucyatē,</strong></p>
<p><strong>ētayōryō layō dr̥ṣṭayō-tat-jñānaṁ sā parā gatiḥ.</strong></p>
<p>That itself is ignorance if eirher the mind cognises several objects at a time or concentrates on one object only. If both these modes of the mind dissolve then that is the highest and exalted state.</p>
<p>If cāncalya is a bandhana then ēkāgratā also is a bandhana. When these are put an end to, then that is liberation.</p>
<p>Anyway, <strong>speed and focussing</strong> are the two aspects of duḥkha. It is a very big piece of research whatever we have discussed in these ten minutes. Duḥkha is completely understood through these two words- speed - <strong>vega- वेग</strong>and focussing (Lakshya). Thus, duḥkha is either an agitated state of mind or a focussed state of mind. <u>If agitation is replaced by <strong>naidhānya- नैधान्य</strong>, gradually and consciously it will result in less and less of duḥkha. Whenever focussing becomes burdensome, replace the same by de-focussing or diffusion (‘let go’ attitude - udāsīnabhāva).</u> And again the result will be elimination of duḥkha. More you diffuse, more will be the expansion of your shell. Ramaṇa and R<u>ā</u>makṛṣṇa would often say &lsquo;I don’t know where I exist. I am not centred.&rsquo; The point here is that they did not even know where they were. To that extent the diffusion had taken place. We identify ourselves with some place or work as a reference point when we ask ourselves as to where we are. Whereas, a Jñāni would say that he cannot see himself and confirms that he has lost his focus. That’s the experiential announcement of a jñāni.</p>
<p>As doctors put it, half the remedy is achieved by proper diagnosis. So if you are convinced that the points raised above are the symptoms of Duḥkha, then replace<strong>Vēga by slowness</strong> <strong>and focussing by expansion</strong>. This is the solution to the problem of duḥkha. That was our research to come out of duḥkha. Sankochatā or constriction or narrowing down is replaced by Vistāratā-<strong>विस्तारता</strong> -everywhereness, spreadness.</p>
<p>That’s where a scientist is at an advantage over the pundit as far as Vedānta is concerned. We are at a distinct advantage than our forefathers who did not know this vocabulary. They did not know this scientific phraseology because they didn’t know aspects like density, potential etc. Duḥkha is localization. Non localized- spread version is the solution for the state of burden. So once you know this, you have the answer.</p>
<p><strong><u>Role of One’s Freedom Element</u>.</strong></p>
<p>The student appreciates the whole point and expresses that he is fully convinced about the solution for duḥkha. But, he urges that not to be fast and not to focus is not under his control. The main objection is that situations drive a person mad. There are a number of problems to be attended to simultaneously within limited period of time and this cannot be avoided. Logically, this is a valid point to consider. In the language of psychology, one is determined by the stimulus-response theory. There is the stimulus, there is the situation and one has to respond helplessly. Many examples can be considered. Take the case of a household lady. She is suffering because her husband is very indifferent to domestic work. How do you expect her to be comfortable and relaxed? It is an attack on the whole study we made here.</p>
<p>Psychological transactions are not just governed by the law of stimulus and response. A new factor comes into the study and it is the<strong>freedom</strong> element. You have a choice, you have a freedom, and you have an option. It is not deterministic. Till now, you never thought so. In fact this is the ignorance on the part of man. Everyone thinks that the situations are so demanding that they drive one to suffering. Although one knows the answer, still it cannot be applied. This is a very important objection.</p>
<p>It is here that I did a bit of deeper research. It is here that text books in psychology can take a fresh lesson from Vedānta. One is the theoretical aspect and the other is the application part of it. Śāstra says man is not a creature of circumstances. He can react or he can refuse to react. The situations cannot thrust themselves on him. The option is with him, the freedom is within him, the choice is with him.</p>
<p>Śankara’s brilliant research gives us the truth. What is mind? Mind is a very peculiar thing and it has this capacity:</p>
<p><strong>कर्तुं अकर्तुं अन्यथा वा कर्तुं शक्यम् ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kartuṁ akartuṁ anyathā vā kartuṁ śakyam.</strong></p>
<p>(Śankara, Brahmasutrabhāṣya)</p>
<p>A person has an inherent freedom to do, not to do or to do it differently.</p>
<p>What a wonderful truth! The mind can do this way, it can do the other way, it can do neither this way nor that way, it can stay quiet .For example, one can be harsh to one’s parents or one can be soft, thinking that they deserve his respects since they are elders. Alternatively, one can be neither harsh nor soft and can be neutral.</p>
<p>Here is the difference between the <strong>jaḍa</strong> and the **cetana,**the inanimate and the animate. In the case of a <strong>jaḍavastu</strong> like football- it cannot manipulate itself. When left in a place for fifty thousand years, it stays there. It cannot vary by itself. If one pushes, then it moves. It is a helpless mass, it has no choice. It is governed totally by the stimulus and response.</p>
<p><strong>Cetana</strong>on the other hand, has the freedom of action, a facility not available with jaḍavastu. Let us say – a fellow has hurt me. I have a reason to get into depression or hit back with anger. Or, I can as well say ‘let him have his own opinion, why should I bother?’ **The evil forces dissolve by applying the second suggestion.<strong>This is the available freedom</strong> **in us.</p>
<p>To say that the external situations determine one’s mental state is a wrong thing. With the recognition of the freedom element in him, a person can have a strong volition, will or autonomy. Everyone’s home becomes beautiful if he can grow as wise as this. Any difference of opinion can be accepted. An opinion suggested by the other person may be foolish. But one need not be disturbed by that because of the freedom element human beings have. Look at the contribution of Vedānta to individual suffering and therefore to global suffering!</p>
<p>I can put this one argument into the textual language. <u>This freedom of choice can be applied even with regard to my three natural phases of existence namely, jnāt</u>ṛ<u>tva or perceiving, bhokt</u>ṛ<u>tva or selecting and ka</u>r<u>tṛtva or doing. I could use these qualities or I could be without them.</u> Śāstra is not forcefully thrusting something on you. This is the result of an investigation which we have done. Hence, I am pure consciousness, chinmātra svarūpa- not disturbed, not affected by situations. The individual should recognise and apply this freedom element inbuilt in him to come out of suffering.</p>
<h2 id="sukha-parīkṣa-happiness-analysed">SUKHA PARĪKṣA (HAPPINESS ANALYSED)</h2>
<p>Now let us examine the concept of Sukha as understood by our** **R̥ṣi-s. One may say that Duḥkharāhitya or absence of Duḥkha is not Sukha. It is the general notion that Sukha is positive and comes from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objects of enjoyment – Bhogasukha- Enjoyment derived through the five senses – sense of vision, hearing, smell, taste and touch.</li>
<li>Social Service – serving the poor, disabled, economically challenged etc. It may be any activity – either trivial or profound.</li>
<li>Job satisfaction.</li>
<li>Satisfaction in one’s profession.</li>
<li>Achieving name and fame in society.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the above give you positive feeling. So, what is there to examine? Why at all we should bother about investigating Sukha? The experience of almost all of us, especially the persons who are internally sensitive, is that there is saturation in every kind of worldly Sukha/happiness. Everything becomes stale at some point of time or the other. Hence, the search for everlasting happiness or pure ānanda or śāśvatasukha becomes necessary. Unfortunately we are all searching for this in the outside world. Here comes Vedānta to our rescue and asks us to investigate any moment of happiness, <u>content wise and not agency wise.</u></p>
<p>The observation or watching is to be done at the thinking centre i.e., Citta or mind Centre, as we had done with Duḥkha Moments**.** We have to observe the mind as to what happens at the moments of sukha and observation has to happen at the ājñāchakra or the space between the eyebrows.</p>
<p>Sip a cup of coffee or tea or listen to music of your choice or taste a sweet dish and see what happens at the thinking centre. <strong>Shift your attention from the agency, that is, coffee or music or sweet dish</strong>to the <strong>thinking Centre</strong> and just <strong>Watch.</strong> For the first time in your life you will experience a wonder. Bulk of the mind does not exist during that moment, the mind cannot think of any problems, the mind refuses to think, the mind doesn’t want to think, the mind is incapacitated to think at that moment of joy. World doesn’t exist for you. Your problems are thrown out and you are carefree- you are free of any responsibility. The burning problems that you had all along cannot touch you now in the enjoyment of coffee, or sweets or whatever.</p>
<p>You have touched your pūrvasthiti/amanī- bhāva/manorāhitya/cittaviśrānti. You are in your<strong>ātmāsvarūpa- आत्मस्वरूप</strong>. You are set in your brahmasvarūpa. You are in your no-mind state. You are in your thought free state which is your <strong>nijasvarūpa- निजस्वरूप</strong>. Here, you may disagree to accept that Bhogasukha is<strong>Brahmasukha- ब्रह्मसुख</strong>. But śāstra and Śankara mention it in a different way. Now you listen to bhāṣhya from Śankara.</p>
<p><strong>Laukikōpi ānandō brahmānandasya ēva mātrā.</strong></p>
<p><strong>लौकिकोपि आनन्दो ब्रह्मानन्दस्यैव मात्रा॥</strong></p>
<p>(Taittirīya Upa, Śankarabhāṣya, 2-8-197)</p>
<p>Don’t you see that this bhogasukha is only a fraction of that brahmasukha? What a daring statement! Is it not obvious? This means that every moment of sukha is an empty state of mind which is&ndash;Your kāraṇasthiti-Your advaita sthiti- a non dual state- a no-mind state. There is nothing like noble sukha and ignoble sukha. The agency may be noble, or ignoble. But sukha per se is Brahma. And Śankara actually adds a line from Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upa -4-3-32</p>
<p><strong>एतस्यैवानन्दस्यान्यानि भूतानि मात्राम् उपजीवन्ति ॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ētasya-ēva-ānandasya-anyāni bhūtāni mātrām upa-jīvanti.</strong></p>
<p>Tom, Dick and Harry or anyone in this world, can experience this ānanda which is the pure expansive state and a state of utter nothingness. One is touching that no mind state and is getting the feel of joy. Every experience of happiness is a state where mind for a moment has become empty-rid of its problems, rid of its anxieties, cares and worries. Can sukha be this simple? I fought with the truths of Upaniṣads for two years. That was my struggle. That was my research. Can it be this simple? But every time I tried an experiment using some bhogavastu, sukhānubhava is very much felt by me. I am confident in saying that every one of you will get this experience also. Śāstra puts this as amanībhāva. Gowḍapāda in his kārika (Māṇ.Up.3, Ka.32) of Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad has this beautiful thing to say:</p>
<p><strong>आत्मसत्यानुबोधेन न सङ्कल्पयते यदा।</strong></p>
<p><strong>अमनस्तां तदा याति ग्राह्याभावे तदग्रहम्॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ātma-satya-anubōdhēna na saṅkalpayatē yadā,</strong></p>
<p><strong>amanastāṁ tadā yāti grāhya-abhāvē tat-agraham.</strong></p>
<p>While modifications of mind stop having realised Self, no mind state is attained due to the absence of graspable phenomenal world.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of realizing yourself?&ndash;you have to touch that no-thought state.-you get into that no-mind state. A no-mind state is verily brahma. The śloka from Kaṭha Upaniṣad (2-6-10) is proclaiming this very same truth.</p>
<p><strong>यदा पञ्चावतिष्ठन्ते ज्ञानानि मनसा सह ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>बुद्धिश्च न विचेश्टते तामाहुः परमां गतिम्॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yadā pañca-avatiṣṭhantē jñānāni manasā saha,</strong></p>
<p><strong>buddhiḥ-ca na vicēśṭatē tāmāhuḥ paramāṁ gatim.</strong></p>
<p>When the five sense organs are not functioning, when the mind is not functioning, when even the buddhi is not functioning, that is your holy state. That is your exalted state. That is your true nature. That is your blissful state. The terminal śloka of that Nārada Sanatkumāra ākhyāyika (Chāndogya Upa 7-24) says-</p>
<p><strong>यत्र नान्यत्पश्यति नान्यच्छृणोति नान्यद्विजानाति स भूमा॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yatra na-anyat-paśyati na-anyat-śr̥ṇōti na- anyat-vijānāti sa bhūmā.</strong></p>
<p>When you do not perceive anything, when you are not hearing anything, when you are not in the knowledge of anything that is your expansive state. The meaning of the word Bhūma is that of vyāpakatva- a state of expansion.</p>
<p><strong>यो वै भूमा तत्सुखं नाल्पे सुखमस्ति भूमा वै सुखम्॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yo vai bhūmā tat-sukhaṃ na-alpe sukham-asti bhūmā vai sukham.</strong> (Chāndogya Upa 7-23)</p>
<p>Bhūma state is really the blessed state, the blissful state as against the confined state which is not blissful and profound. Man considers that watching details is the right action. Actually it is ‘alpatva swīkāra’- that is, a constricted state of mind. All the research work that we are into is the work of scrutiny which is a toiling phase. Indriya vyāpāra means capturing details. Bhūma vai sukham- <strong>that let-go state is sukha</strong>. Vedānta is not brainwashing you.</p>
<p><strong>नापूर्वं वक्षति श्रुतिः</strong>। <strong>Na-pūrvaṁ vakṣati śrutiḥ.</strong></p>
<p>Śruti** **doesn’t tell you anything that is not within the zone of your experience.</p>
<p><strong>ज्ञापकमात्रम् हि शास्त्रम्</strong>- <strong>Jñāpaka-mātram hi śāstram -</strong>- Śāstra is but a reminder of whatever you know. Every experience of sukha, is verily a mind in broken state—a decomposed mind&mdash;a non functioning mind. In fact, the thought formation forces cannot connect themselves into a thought. What a realization! You see that every joy is an empty state of mind-an expansive state of mind- an <strong>advaitasthiti- अद्वैतस्थिति.</strong></p>
<p>Even sukha, on examination, reduces itself to a no-mind state. If the frequency moments of sukha are increased very much, you are just nonexistent and the shell is terribly expanded for a moment. This is the same as the state of vistārata described as a remedy to Duḥkha. There is a gradation in Duḥkha state -continuous duḥkha – ati-duḥkha - somewhat duḥkha - very slight duḥkha - the curve reaches a no mind state - you cannot even think further. A further inference of this one, a bigger version of this process, makes one to conclude that, sukha and duḥkha, being separate entities, are interconnected. They are very much like conductivity and resistance. Reciprocal of resistance is conductivity. Reciprocal of conductivity is resistance. Less and less of duḥkha is more and more of sukha.** **Thus there are only two aspects of Duḥkha-</p>
<p>One is the Speed, at thinking centre or cittasthāna (mind centre – Ājñācakra – space between the eye brows). The other is the focussing-which is constant minding, resulting in one pointedness and this is termed as sankocata. This is also termed as a coning phase. In order to overcome these two aspects of duḥkha:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace speed or Vega by slowness or Naidhānya at the mental level.</li>
<li>Replace Sankocata or focussing by diffusion. This is the let go attitude or udāsīna bhāva</li>
</ol>
<p>Sukha is:</p>
<p>Mind or cittasthāna becomes empty in the moments of happiness derived through agencies. A no mind state is created for a fraction of a moment. Consciously hold on to the no mind state so generated and try to stay there as long as possible, abandoning the agency that gave you the state. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (5-9-43) declares -</p>
<p><strong>दृश्यदर्शनसम्बन्धे सुखसंविदनुत्तम।</strong></p>
<p><strong>दृश्य संवलिता बन्धस्तन्मुक्ता मुक्तिरुच्यते॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr̥śya-darśana-sambandhē sukha-saṁvit- anuttama,</strong></p>
<p><strong>dr̥śya saṁvalitā bandhaḥ-tan-muktā muktiḥ- ucyatē.</strong></p>
<p>Born is the happiness when the seer and the seen are in contact. But, it is still bondage when the seer is attached to the seen and it is freedom when detached from it.</p>
<p>I will take up questions from you to sort out any doubts on whatever we discussed till now.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>Does not a material sukha, what you explained now, leads to hankering for more bhoga?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Yes, but we get a glimpse of that śāṣvata sukha in this bhogasukha. Therefore one has to see this welcome element and stay firm in it and then reject the hankering for bhoga.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>Does** **the peace of mind, as described above relate to viṣayasukha?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> This is another good objection on sukha. But it is that peace of mind that is referred to as sukha in the tradition also. Again the two questions overlap. Actually in our viṣayasukha moment, the penultimate positions are in excitement whereas the real point is in peace. We are tempted to say that this excitement is a sukha element. The penultimate centres are in excited state and therefore one is tempted to conclude sukha carries the element of excitement which is the previous position or the taditarasthāna. The after position or the samīpasthāna is the peaceful expansive state. When we discuss the mechanism of sukha in the next lecture, we will discuss the things involved in the mechanism of bhogasukha and then clarity would come to all of you.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>If we slow down our activity, it will certainly be good, but in the eyes of the people that would look very odd and embarrassing?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> All those things have to be managed of course. When you slow down your activity, it has an effect on the whole system. The system becomes so relaxed that it becomes impossible to do any work at one point of time. One simply wants to spend time in silence. Slowness becomes a point of comfort when these rules are applied. When one centre in the body slows down, every other centre takes the suggestion and slows down.</p>
<p>The other point is this attention business. It is here that a student finds difficulty. He likes to be focussing all the time as it improves the performance. But the truth is otherwise. One may perform better, but one has to pay the price for that effort, which ultimately works on the system itself. Truths cannot change themselves to one’s convenience. The fact is that if one holds on to concentration for a longer time, the system complains. This conclusion doesn’t go well with modern ideas of performance and production. That is what one has to manage. One can&rsquo;t fight against the truth. If the truth is questionable then it is fine. Otherwise the argument does not stand.</p>
<p>I remember one instance when I had to undergo a minor operation. I was waiting in the preparation room and the thing got delayed as the surgeon was very busy performing another major operation. He was a doctor of repute and he had the habit of going through every detail to make sure that things went on well and there should be no cause for failure. This put him under serious focussing. When he came out of the theatre I could see him puff and crash into the sofa and leave a very big sigh of relief. Why did he do that? The body system was saying that he needed rest very badly. That was a very good observation for me and that was a very good case where I could certify the truths of the Upaniṣad-s. Why does one shift from a serious mood to a lighter mood? Why does one get to an act of sipping a cup of coffee after a hard working day? Why does one say that he needs relaxation? The fact shows that serious mood is a state of <strong>suffering</strong>. Lighter mood is a state of contentment or **tṛpti_. _**That’s a proof.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Don’t you think we have to do a balancing act because at certain point we have to continue our lives?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Fine. That is the compromise. Right, but we should appreciate the point that it is necessary to take a break.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> But that does not mean I stop concentrating. I may be taking a break but I am still in that mood? We cannot stop our attention mood as it is very important in life?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> No. The śāstra is examining facts and their nature. That’s the point. How much of śāstra you will use for your life is another question. That’s a matter of necessity. That’s a matter of the situation or the profession in which you are placed. I am not advising everyone to give up focussing or speed. But one very important point you must remember here is, that when I am talking of speed<strong>it is not the physical speed. It is the internal speed. The speed</strong> <strong>of the mind within</strong> <strong>is thousand times faster than the speed at the physical level.</strong> One has to keep this always in mind when we talk of reducing speed.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Is it possible to drop speed when you are focussing?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Yes, I will add a little more. I told you about that doctor&rsquo;s plight, because that’s a more serious question. Most of the times we tend to seek adjustments, compromise, taking approximate positions. So, whenever focussing is a must, you tag on slowness to it. If you are slow, focussing is acceptable for the system. Slowness can decrease the evil effects of focussing. Any amount of focussing is sustainable when the other element is taken care of, namely slowness. Once you go with the study yourselves, many more truths come out. That’s why everybody would be a teacher on his own once he starts looking inside. That leisureliness will enlarge the shell. Every time you are in the leisurely mood, or the let-go mood, you are an enlarged shell. You are a big sphere. In that sphere if you focus, you are doing that peripherally. We use the word for that, peripheral focussing, and casual focussing. It is a fact. The śāstra uses a very big word to refer to this: udāsīnabhāva, <strong>उदासीनभाव</strong>, anāsaktibhāva, <strong>अनासक्तिभाव</strong>, sākṣībhāva-<strong>सक्षीभाव.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Can focussing be possible when you are in diffused state?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> It is possible. They can co exist. The two can stay concurrently. People say that Vedānta takes one away from one’s profession. It proves again and again that worldly and mundane pursuits do not become hurdles for sukha. Therefore you don’t have to become an ascetic or other worldly. It is a paradox. Defocused focussing means bulk of you, mentally, is positioned in a happy way. A part of you is involved in that mundane process. That is how every jñāni manages. Lord Kṛṣṇa would be most efficient-but very casual, but at the same time very careful in details. So a jñāni need not walk away from life. If he chooses to walk away like Ramaṇa, it is okay, like Rāmakṛṣṇa, it is okay. Performance-wise one can excel the other man who does not know these secrets.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> If one gets into such a grove of slowing down, will it not affect the overall performance of the person?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> This is exactly the reaction of every group that I meet with. Will the whole technology drop down if every man slows down? Everybody is unnecessarily rubbing too much on the wrong side. Why don’t you live with nature? Environment is safe when you don’t peck and interfere. Really speaking, this is the highest point. We understand that during the days of Kṛutayuga people were so much satisfied that they did not even bother to build a hut for them to live in. What is wrong if that fellow is as happy as the modern man with all this technology around him? We must be able to give this point to the advocates of technology. A fellow who is sitting under the tree is equally happy doing nothing. Then how is he inferior? Point out one defect about that. <strong>Bhartṛhari</strong> in his **Vairāgya Śataka-**वैराग्यशतक (53) -quotes-</p>
<p><strong>वयमिह परितुष्टा वल्कलैस्त्वं दुकूलैः।</strong></p>
<p><strong>सम इह परितोषो निर्विशेषो विशेषः</strong>॥</p>
<p><strong>Vayam-iha parituṣṭā valkalaiḥ-tvaṁ dukūlaiḥ,</strong></p>
<p><strong>sama iha paritōṣō nirviśēṣō viśēṣaḥ.</strong></p>
<p>A sage comes across a king and develops a conversation. Oh King, you are with your silken garments and I am with my bark garments. If the happiness you have is because of the silk and the happiness I have is because of this crude cloth, how are you superior to me?</p>
<p>What logic! How are you superior to me if both of us are equally happy, you with all your comforts and I with no comforts?</p>
<p><strong>स तु भवतु दरिद्रो यस्य तृष्णा विशाल। ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>मनसि च परितुष्टे कोऽर्थवान् को दरिद्रः</strong> ॥</p>
<p><strong>Sa tu bhavatu daridrō yasya tr̥ṣṇā viśāla,</strong></p>
<p><strong>manasi ca parituṣṭē kō-arthavān kō daridraḥ</strong>.</p>
<p>When the mind is self satisfied how to differentiate a rich man from a poor one? This is the challenge the Indian wise men always had on positions of importance. It is not abhāva-vairāgya.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> I don’t think that the issue is with the internal happiness vis a vis technology. It should somehow be possible to bridge both. Take the case of Arjuna, who did not want to fight before he heard the message from Kṛṣṇa, afterwards he fought. On the one hand he is peaceful internally and at the same time he has a duty to perform. This is where the problem arises. What is your opinion about this?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> You have to be careful while you apply this knowledge to the society in general. Therefore if the society is different, don’t disturb the society, allow it to have mixed levels. Society must have the benefit of development of technology. A hypothetical question would be as to what happens to civilisation if technology is completely dropped. When everyone is happy with minimum needs, what’s wrong with that one? I wish such a world comes into existence. That was the message of Kṛṣṇa. Of course much discussion has to take place. And another reason why Arjuna was coaxed into karma by Kṛṣṇa was that he was still not fit for taking up a life of a mendicant.</p>
<p>Theoretically one may understand this, but one may not be fit for total vairāgya. At the conceptual level we may appreciate. You can’t deny yourself the study, pursuits, achievements and all that. System transformation doesn’t take place simultaneously with your understanding of concepts. There is a time lag. There is a phase difference. We must wait. Only one person who could succeed totally and suddenly drop activities of the world was Ramaṇa Maharṣi. He realized this point. People made these objections on him and he just laughed at them. Some people choose the vedāntic way of living while others are willing to focus and carry on with work keeping their balance of mind for the benefit of humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Arjuna, after he listened to Sri Kṛṣṇa initially was willing to lay down his arms and keep quiet. But the Lord would not allow him. Why?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Arjuna appreciated the sānkhya ideas, just as we are now appreciating the logic of Vedānta to be true and correct. He appreciated the truths of Vedānta and then he said he would surrender and keep quiet. But Kṛṣṇa knew that Arjuna’s body-mind system was not prepared for that. Simply understanding the truths of the Upaniṣads is not sufficient. The forces within, bhoga-utsāha, karma-utsāha are still operating. I will come to that point when we do ātmāparīkṣa. Therefore his advice to Arjuna was to do karma and expend the unbearable energy.</p>
<p>We know that keeping quiet is the ultimate answer for happiness. But, structurally we are not prepared for that. That is where the idea of karmayoga comes. Karma sanyāsa is recommended as the ultimate position. The next step of compromise or adjustment is karmayoga because we cannot keep quiet. The whole of third and fourth chapters in Bhagavad-Ġīta (3-1) deal with the subject of karma yoga versus karma sanyāsa. Arjuna puts this very question—</p>
<p><strong>ज्यायसी चेत् कर्मणस्ते मता बुद्धिर्जनार्दन।</strong></p>
<p><strong>तत्किं कर्मणि घोरे मां नियोजयसि केशव॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jyāyasī cēt karmaṇḥ-tē matā buddhiḥ-janārdana,</strong></p>
<p><strong>tat-kiṁ karmaṇi ghōrē māṁ niyōjayasi kēśava.</strong></p>
<p>He asks Kṛṣṇa, ‘Why are you forcing me to the war which is very bad although you know well that knowledge is superior to action?’ He has appreciated this discussion and says that Kṛṣṇa has proved that keeping quiet is all joy. The answer is - Arjuna is not fit for keeping quiet yet.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: There comes the question of &rsquo;expectation&rsquo;. How do you explain the removal of expectation of returns from action?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The other point where Vedānta makes a mark is to let that person examine whether he can be happy without doing. Most of us cannot remain so, though logically that position is correct. Even I cannot do that. Why? There is the boredom force acting within, which is driving one to activity. I will come to that in the next lecture when we do ātmaparīkṣa. The reason for anyone who says that he is doing work for so many good causes is that he cannot keep quiet. The proof for this is very simple. If I challenge you to sit quiet for ten minutes without doing anything, you may say that it is very easy. But if I ask you to remain quiet for half an hour, then you fail the test. Why?</p>
<p>Vedānta gives an answer to that point in the <strong>yogaśāstra- योगशास्त्र</strong>. There is what is called a life force, a vital force or <strong>kundaliniśakti- कुण्डलिनीशक्ति</strong>, if you care to use a technical word. It is there at the <strong>mūlādhāra- मूलाधार</strong> and is continuously releasing <strong>sūkṣmaśakti- सूक्ष्मशक्ति</strong> or<strong>prāṇaśakti</strong> into the system, to every part of the body. It flows up into the <strong>ūrdhvasthāna- ऊर्ध्वस्थान</strong>and comes to <strong>ājñācakrasthāna- आज्ञाचक्रस्थान</strong>, where pressure is built up.** **If the rates at which it is produced and expended are not equal, then you develop a pressure. And the pressure so developed drives you into activity. This is the most reasonable explanation.</p>
<p>The proof is very simple. Sit in the house without any work. That is the biggest test, to check whether you are growing in the vedāntic way or not. No wife to talk to. No kitchen where you can go and get some salted cashew nut or anything of that kind. No tape recorder to play music. Sit and try. Try this simple experiment. Everybody in the world fails. Why?</p>
<p>This is the explanation. Continuously energy is being released. Fortunately for man, as quickly as it is released he is expending it. The child cries away its energy. The fool talks away his energy. Man walks away his energy. A clever man thinks away his energy and therefore each one is comfortable. The subtlest burden is the pressure of boredom forces. He is spending this blocked up energy in ever so many ways that the system gets used to it and therefore he is comfortable where as he gives credit to karma, saying that Karma gave him joy. Spending of the energy is the only means by which one is becoming empty at the Ājñācakra. This mechanism is giving him joy and not karma as such.</p>
<p>This is the way we are all happy. Karma is a means of expenditure of this unbearable energy. Once that is spent away we are in the non-doing phase at the ājñācakra. We become empty, that is, we reach the no-mind state called amanībhāva. No activity-state is the point of joy, is the content of joy. This mechanism is giving him joy and not karma as such.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Does it divert the energy?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Yes, incidentally this question is to be answered. If intake of coffee or any other bhogavastu leads to bhogasukha, then why don’t we have more and more of coffee or more and more of bhoga? The answer lies here. Although bhogasukha works by this mechanism, it has a defect as this drifting of the energy, shifting of the energy to the indriyasthāna is only temporary. Every indriya has a limit point. This skill to draw the energy has its limitation. The first sweet is enjoyable, the second sweet is acceptable and the third sweet is repulsive. Even at the cost of annoying the host you say, ‘sorry I cannot take it’, Why? The tongue fails to draw the energy. At that point, the energy goes back into its original place, into its swasthāna and again you are restless. That is the reason why we call the bhogasukha as short lived. When the energy expenditure mechanism to overcome the boredom is overdone, it results in restlessness again. Preceded by a disturbed state, succeeded by a disturbed state and for a small interval of time in-between, the mind quietens. Hence, bhogasukha is short lived.</p>
<p><u>If you can reduce the creation of energy itself or its release by s</u>ā<u>dhana then the dependence on Bhoga gets dropped and you are in lasting happiness.</u> Then, you can naturally expand your shell. In a small sphere, the amount of thrust or the impulse on the unit area is more. Suppose the sphere is very big, the same thrust or impulse on a much bigger sphere is much smaller. Distributed over a larger area, you don’t feel the burden at all. So, if you apply the rule of naidhānya or apply the principle of vistārata, then the boredom forces are automatically absorbed or dissolved away and you don’t complain. This is a permanent method to be happy. So, a vedāntin is not running away from bhoga for ascetic reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> I appreciate your point very much that parīkṣa of Duḥkha is necessary to come out of it, but why one should do parīkṣa of sukha as it is a glorified state already?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> This parīkṣa is required because we are always experiencing this ānanda. Humans are in continuous touch with the svarūpa, but does not take notice of that one. This is the unfortunate situation of man. He doesn’t know that svarūpasthiti is ānanda. To remove this ignorance, serious study is required. That’s all. The role of bhoga in the experiment is only incidental. Laddoo or the sweet dish or coffee did not carry the principle of ānanda. It is incidental that Laddoo brought about an expansive state inside, an empty state inside. The point of importance is this one. After understanding this point, our attention should get shifted. Our value system should be revised. Bhogavastu has a marginal role. This has necessitated the sādhana actually. Should you struggle for ānanda? The clever sādhaka on the other hand uses the bhoghavastu as a means to get the glimpse of brahmasukha, drops bhogavastu and holds on to the sukha only.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>Is puruşārtha not necessary-then?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. That’s the trouble with all the people. People have mystified the whole thing. I can give you hundreds of stanzas to show that this is the ultimate. It is very clear in Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa—</p>
<p><strong>यन्मनो विलयं याति तद्विष्णोः परमं पदम्</strong>।</p>
<p><strong>Yanmanō vilayaṁ yāti tat-viṣṇōḥ paramaṁ padam.</strong></p>
<p>What is viṣṇupada - vaikuṇṭa? Yatra manaḥ vilayaṁ yāti -where mind gets extinguished that is svarūpa. That is puruśārtha. That is mokṣa. This stanza, Yatra manaḥ vilayaṁ yāti tadviṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ.—does not refer to the vaikuṇṭa with seven doors, Jaya and Vijaya keeping guard of that one etc. Yatra manaḥ -where mind is absent, that is vaikuṇṭa.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> When thought is formed in the mind, there is no differentiation whether it is thought for happiness or otherwise. Then where is the thoughtless mind?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. What happens in the bhogasukha is that there is an excitement co existing with peace. Therefore we are tempted to say that happiness is that excitement. Really speaking, there are two overlapping parameters. If you disassociate them, the real point of contribution, which is the ‘peace element’, comes to the fore. I will dwell on the topic of how Bhogasukha brings about peace in my next lecture.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> Śankara says that bhogasukha gives a glimpse of brahmānanda. Don’t you think bhoga is excitement and where is ānanda there?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Content wise they are identical. The doṣa about bhogasukha is, that it is short lived. With the withdrawal of bhoga, again you come back to the objective world of seeking. That’s the doṣa. This point I will take up in detail in the next lecture-the mechanism involved in bhogasukha, what is the erroneous element and how to make a correction of that.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
