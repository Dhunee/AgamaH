## INTRODUCTION

Having been trained in the ways of science, I was simply drawn to Upaniṣad-s when I started reading them in view of the meticulous way the subject is dealt with. The more and more I read the Upaniṣad-s along with commentories of Adi Shankara, an extremely powerful commentary on the original text of Upaniṣad-s, I as a scientist could not but wonder and appreciate them.

A scientific approach to any matter/ problem demands the following:



* A free, frank and fearless approach.
* An intimate one to one interaction between the teacher and the taught.
* The skill of penetrating into the fundamentals.
* Sweeping generalisation through the suggested methods.
* Availability of experimental support and verifiability of the methodology suggested in the Upaniṣads.

All the above requirements are to be fully   satisfied while dealing with the subject matter in question. A scientist of today can have all the admiration for such an approach. I am of the firm opinion that no one can excel the scientific penetration, accuracy and courage of Adi Śankarachārya’s approach to the subject while dealing with the Upaniṣad-s. This is one of the aspects why I was drawn to the Upaniṣads.

The other aspect which attracted me into the study of Upaniṣad-s was that it tackled the question of suffering – suffering at the psychic level. Every one, right from a child to an old man, from the rich to the poor, complains of suffering. The cause may be anything – inferiority complex, compatibility in family, question of non-recognition, nagging boss, dissatisfaction at profession, etc. Man is suffering in a grosser way or subtler way. But, here is a Vedic Science which with utter confidence declares that it can give an everlasting or permanent remedy.

The present day living is full of tension, hurry, rat race, severe competition, exploitation, etc. which can be called as negative forces. These negative forces are bad to oneself, bad to others and ultimately bad to the society. We are witnessing teen aged boys and girls going to the extent of committing suicide even for trivial reasons unable to handle or manage or face these negative forces. But, here is a science which assures permanent remedy to these. Unfortunately, in India, it is a general notion that spirituality is only for persons beyond sixty years of age. But, I sincerely feel that these concepts should be introduced at a very young age of sixteen itself so that he or she will never face helplessness, desperateness, depression, etc. instead, they grow with strong minds and in turn build a strong and healthy society.

As an introduction to understand what the source of these Upaniṣad-s are, where they are from, what is the larger text of which this is a portion, let us understand some fundamental phrases that are in use. Everyone would have heard the word Vedā-s. Vedā-s are the most ancient religious texts of the Hindus. That is the source of inspiration for all the cultural, religious, ethical,values. It is so ancient that historians place them as far back as 5000 years or 8000 years. The Indian thinking is that it is not manmade. In fact Śankara (Ādi Śankarācārya) says that it was  co released along with creation,in his introductory reference to Bhagavad-Ġīta

The Vedā-s are four in number and we all know them very well. They are Rigveda, Yajurveda, Sāmaveda and Atharvaveda. All these four Vedas have their own sub divisions. They are the prose forms of chanting pertaining to the method of performing many  sacrificial rites. These have been devised by many sages. These rituals are conducted for attaining specific benefits for daily living. Another division also contain rituals to be performed by men who are moving into forests as retires and settle down there. The end portions of  these contain the philosophical treatise seeking answer to some fundamental questions of life and life after death. These portions are called the Upaniṣad-s.

For the purpose of our study, we will broadly look into the classification of Vedā-s as two major portions called,religious treatise and** **philosophical treatise.

Tradition accepts this subdivision. It is honoured that way. The question arises as to why this subdivision at all? What are the distinctive features of these two portions? How do they differ from each other? The difference lies both in the subject matter and in the structuring,difference in methodology and content.

We will restrict ourselves to some of the practical aspects of these great teachings from the end portion of the Vedā-s, as we are mainly concerned with the practice than the theory. But, a study of how and why of some of the rituals and practices that are carried out in our homes even till date and those which have been handed over to us from our forefathers is necessary for a better understanding of the intentions behind them.

We shall broadly look into what this religious  methods( Karmakāṇḍa) means to us in our daily life. I do not wish to cast a shadow on these practices nor condemn them while I detail out some of the practices that are in vogue. In fact, a proper understanding of them will help us and strengthen our own practice and clarity will come to us as to how our ancestors had designed them with a purpose. However, during the following few minutes I would like to put before you the facts as to how the practices of Karmakāṇḍa are losing ground with the advent of science and due to the inability to defend itself the onslaught of especially younger and materialistic generation. We will be discussing in due course that the very same practices of Karmakāṇḍa rise to the heights of glory if practiced with an understanding of the purpose for which they were designed.

This portion envisages a number of Gods and demigods. You can call them power centres- manipulating the various powers of the cosmic activity. That is a position in karmakāṇḍa. Indra, Varuṇa, Yama, Agni, Aświni devatā-s, the three forces called the Brahma, Viṣṇu, Maheśwara( generator,operator and destroyer)and their spouses- all these Gods are envisaged in this part of vedic literature. And Karmakāṇḍa has a position that you can approach these Gods through prayers, through offerings. There are different aspects in Karmakāṇḍa structured in a very sophisticated and detailed way. There are many ways of appeasing these Gods. Chosen mantras are there for each God. The chnatings are to be uttered in a very specific way- with right intonations** **without deviations. Any offering to these God-s through sacrifies., are for getting some favour or the other.

Some examples could be given:

In India there is what is called, an **Upākarma-उपाकर्म** - programme. In this ceremony during the Virajāhoma mantra chanting (Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad) many blessings are sought from the Gods. The student is asking for five prāṇā-s to be purified.

**प्राणोपानव्यानोदानसमाना मे शुद्ध्यन्ताम् ज्योतिरहम् विरजा विपाप्मा भूयासम् स्वाहा ॥**

**Prāṇa-apāna-vyāna-udāna-samānā mē śuddhyantām jyōtiraham virajā vipāpmā bhūyāsam svāhā.**

I am offering into the fire, the homadravyā-s so that my pañcaprāṇā-s be purified. Let my several vital organs be purified. All this goes to show that very dignified wishes were sought from the Gods with the belief that, when properly approached, they would give the necessary favours.

After initiation into the ritualistic ways through **Upākarma-**i.e., after **dvijatva svīkāra-द्विजत्व स्वीकार -**the student** **who performs Agni Upāsana seeks from Gods the following blessings-



* **मेधावी भूयासम्**  -  **Medhāvī bhūyāsam -**Let me become an intellectual.
* **तेजस्वी भूयासम् -** **Tejasvī bhūyāsam -**Let me have the intellectual resplendence.
* **वर्चस्वी भूयासम् – Varcasvī** **bhūyāsam -**Let me have exalted stature in the society.
* **आयुश्मान् भूयासम्**- **Āyuśmān bhūyāsam –**Let me have long life.
* **अन्नादो भूयासम् -Annādo bhūyāsam -**Let me have strong digestive power.
* **सर्वसमृद्धो भूयासम्** -**Sarvasamṛddho bhūyāsam -** Let me have all physical wants at my disposal- i.e.- food, clothing,shelter, etc**.**

The above are not mean or cheap desires. They are highly dignified. These blessings were sought from the Gods with the belief that they would bestow the necessary favours. In the same tone many Mantras are there in Medhāsūktam:

**मयि मेधाम् मयि प्रजाम् मय्यग्निस्तेजो दधातु।**

**मयि मेधाम् मयि प्रजाम् मयीन्द्र इन्द्रियम् दधातु।**

**मयि मेधाम् मयि प्रजाम् सूर्यो भ्राजो दधातु।**

**Mayi mēdhām mayi prajām mayi agniḥ - tējō dadhātu.**

**Mayi mēdhām mayi prajām mayi indra indriyam dadhātu.**

**Mayi mēdhām mayi prajām sūryō bhrājō dadhātu.**

May Agni render in me intelligence, continuity of progeny and splendour born of Vedic study. May Indra render in me intelligence, continuity of progeny and virility. May Surya render in me intelligence, continuity of progeny and prowess that strikes fear in the hearts of enemies.

This is one part of Karmakāṇḍa. But the question arises now under the second part of Karmakāṇḍa, under which the **kāmya-karmā-s** are listed. Karmakāṇḍa takes a stand where certain mantras with corresponding homadravyā-s, when offered through a combination of chanting and offerings to Agni, can bring desired results. Under kāmyakarma we have for example;** **



* **पर्जन्यहोम - Parjanyahoma -**where rain can be sought after
* **मृत्युञ्जयहोम**- **Mṛtyuñjayahoma‍ -**where the mortality could be extended**.**
* **पुत्रकामेष्टि याग**- **Putra-kāmeṣṭi yāga**- where progeny can be sought after.

But the whole question is this**. Is there any experimental support**to this aspect of Karmakāṇḍa which declares that we can win over the Gods and get their favours and have these dignified wishes fulfilled? Whatever palatable or interesting things one may say on this aspect of Karmakāṇḍa, the question posed by today’s generation is, whether these are born out of experimentation. This was the counter I had in my days of studentship also. By that time the country had moved in the direction of scientific thinking. Fifty years ago, science really started capturing the imagination of man. We became a scientifically oriented community. Being scientific in temperament, we would put questions why, what and how, for the things which we had no proof or justification. We would accept a thing only if it was reasoned out. We would not accept a thing on the basis of **śraddhā - श्रद्धा -**(pure faith) alone. The above aspect which looks so glorious is incomplete in the sense that the followers of karmakāṇḍa accepted them with blind faith with all its deficiencies because it was a dignified thing according to them and they had been so ordained.

When I became a brahmacāri (when I was initiated into the sandhyā) a dilemma arose in me whether I should repeat this practice simply because my forefathers did it on the basis of the commands from their gurus and the scriptures. As long as śraddhā was there things went well. For generations people respected Karmakāṇḍa rituals and went by them.

To cite another example, in **śrāddha-prayoga-श्राद्धप्रयोग**- (ceremony performed for the departed souls) the deviation of the slightest order was not accepted. It was looked down as sacrilege. Unquestioned adherence to details of karmakāṇḍa rituals went on for almost thousand years till we entered into the age of science when pure faith was washed away due to questioning the very basis of the need of such rituals. During this scientific age questions arose from every quarter as to which idea had to be accepted or which idea had to be rejected.

Let us take the example of the utility of Vitamin C for human consumption. The argument that it gave immunity against infection could be proved by its usage. So the idea was accepted as it had been tested and tried and results were the proof for that. Similarly, the argument that saturated fats and animal fats were harmful for humans due to its high percentage of cholesterol and its effect on the circulatory system was accepted since there was sufficient proof available. It was also reasonable, as it was proved by facts, that a wholesome diet must contain vitamins and minerals in minute proportions because of their special properties. Everywhere we started adopting this scientific spirit once it appealed to us as reasonable.

Our forefathers did not have this attitude of rebelling against the practices of karmakāṇḍa. While we in our generation questioned the practice, our children and grand children are questioning its legitimacy.

That is how Karmakāṇḍa suffered neglect when science came on the scene. I would say Agni upāsana is a forgotten thing. An apology for Sandhyā is tried by those whosoever is practising it. Most of us have given it up. The civilization that stood the test of time for more than thousand years, omitting no details in its practices, was just set aside over the last fifty years. This is not the case only with Hinduism. I was looking in detail as to how other religions also are suffering the same way. Can we save these religious practices from this attack? Karmakāṇḍa promoters cannot give an answer to such attacks even today as it went by authority, went by dictation-**इदं कुरु, इदं मा कुरु**  -  **'Idaṁ kuru,** **Idaṁ mā kuru-**Do this. Don’t do that.

Another aspect of karmakāṇḍa pertains to various tenets-** **

**मातृदेवो भव, पितृदेवो भव, आचार्यदेवो भव, अतिथिदेवो भव ।**

**'Mātṛdevo** **bhava' 'Pitṛdevo bhava' ‘Ācāryadevo Bhava’ ‘Atithidevo Bhava’.**

It was a mandate that one’s mother, father, guru and a guest should be treated Godly. A youngster asked me the other day, 'If my father is bad, should I worship him as God?' He put forth an argument that Daśaratha (of Rāmāyaṇa) was unreasonable when he asked Rāma to go to the forest for no fault of his. Therefore Rāma should not have obeyed him. This 'Matṛdevo bhāva' 'Pitṛdevo bhāva' should be conditional and cannot be generalised. The argument and reasoning given by this youngster seems justified. When we come into the age of science, many religious values weaken. That is what has happened to karmakāṇḍa in the scientific age.

When I was the Head of the Department of chemistry, twenty years ago, an incident occurred which I would like to share with you now. One of my junior colleagues, who was equally disposed to fundamental thinking, came to me one day with a booklet. It was a forty page performance that was an edited version of a series of talks given by a professor of Theology from a prestigious American university. The professor was teaching Theology to the post doctoral students giving ethical values, moral values, religious values, in a very gusto way. One of the students listened carefully and at the close of the lesson expressed his total disagreement with whatever professor had narrated and termed all of them as illogical.

He questioned the professor as to-why should he not steal? Why should he not walk away with neighbour’s wife, if she agreed? If he robbed or stole, he would get more money and that money he could exchange for joy and for comforts. Joy was the pursuit of life for anybody whether religious or irreligious. The student went on to say that the religion was a joy killer and restricted the scope of one’s joy. It curtailed one’s happiness. He concluded that such a value system could not be accepted and deserved to be rejected outright.

Can you see the ruthless attack on religion in two directions! It has no self defence by way of arguing itself as the right thing. Everyone wants to have a free life of indulgence and thinks it as his right. <u>Indulgence gives him joy. More indulgence is more joyful. It is quite a natural demand as the purpose of life is happiness. No religion can probably defend itself against such a reasonable attack</u>.

We cannot call that student foolish, deserved to be dismissed or ignored, as he is a post doctoral student. The student in question says that unless the religion, the advocates of religion, gives a justifying answer he is not satisfied. The best part of the booklet was that the teacher confessed that he had no answer nor he could find any answers in the religious texts. Does any one of you have an answer to this touchy question? Every attack of that student is reasonable. Karmakāṇḍa in itself has no answer to this question. No religion, as I can perceive, can give a satisfactory answer to this question.

I subscribe to the view that everybody is in need of joy. That cannot be questioned. But then, <u>I can show you that by applying restraints, which is the best factor of every religion,**indriyanigraha**-self restraint- governing oneself is the only way of getting **śāśvata-sukha - - शाश्वत सुख** - everlasting joy. Religion does not take you away from joy as complained by that post doctoral student. Religion can help you reach a lasting joy. Bhogasukha or worldly pleasure gives incremental, segmental, admixed joy</u>. <u>This joy is preceded or succeeded by restlessness. Religion gives you complete stretch of joy</u>. Once that is accepted, the whole world can turn religious. The great ethical, moral, religious, dhārmik values simply get restored through this.

The whole world is now turning materialistic. It is not that Christianity is losing; it is not that Hindu religion is getting lost. It is the triumph of materialism over spiritual and ethical values that we should be anxious about. Is it defective in its content? Can there be a holistic model? If so what are the defects? Can we justify the religious values? Can we restore the religious values, ethical values, spiritual values? Otherwise where is the answer to the problems of today's culture which caters to the materialistic world? Is man happy with all this technology, this hurry, this rat race? Every moment we are in a state of hurry. Are we comfortable? Are we happy? If not, then where does happiness lie? We have taken a superficial truth as the ultimate position. We have automatically assumed the stand without examining in detail all the factors that are responsible for the joy. Materialism goes on the basis that objects give joy and the way of life should be more and more of ungoverned indulgence which yields more and more of sukha. Re-examination of our value system is exactly what Vedānta does.

This is exactly where **Jñānakāṇḍa**comes to our rescue. Jñānakāṇḍa is that part of Vedas which constitute the philosophical treatise. Let us try to know a few things about them.



* It is called **Jñānakāṇḍa—ज्ञानकाण्ड** -because it emphasises knowledge, it emphasises parīkṣā, it emphasises investigation, which is the true way of a scientist.
* **Upaniṣad** –**उपनिषत्-**means to sit near the teacher and absorb his knowledge in order to kill one’s ignorance.
* It is also known as **Vedānta- वेदान्त -** - the end portion of Vedas, the best portion of Vedas, the peak of Vedas, the cream of Vedas, the essence of Vedas.
* It talks about the causal stuff of this universe- therefore it is **Brahmavidyā- ब्रह्मविद्या -** - Brahma is the name for the original substance, whose transformed state is jagat. Vedānta discusses that principle, therefore it is Brahmavidyā.

It is a knowledge where the 'I' entity is investigated. 'I' has another name ‘**Atman**’-**आत्मा.**



* Therefore it is**ātmavidyā- आत्मविद्या -**ātmāparīkṣā is done here, therefore it is ātmāvidyā.
* It is a science which gives you the secrets of ānanda, therefore it is called **ānanda - vidyā**, **madhu - vidyā- आनन्दविद्या, मधुविद्या.**
* It is **adhyātma-** **अध्यात्म -** - the science of the inside- **Ātmānam adhikṛtya- आत्मानम् अधिकृत्य -** means studying the inside stuff of man or the **antaḥkaraṇa-** **अन्तःकरण -** -therefore **adhyātma.**

Why did I go to Upaniṣads? If you ask me that question my answer would be that I went to the Upaniṣads desperately as I was suffering. I needed it most. I was miserable. What was my misery? I had a good wife, a good job, recognition in society. I was a very good teacher. But I was suffering. What was I suffering from? I was **<u>fast</u>**... **<u>Speed</u>** had overcome me. What was my other suffering? I was always **<u>focussing</u>**, studious, researching on anything and everything. I used to ponder over trivial topics like, why the American President is fighting with the Russian President? Why not they live and let live? I used to find out the reasons for such things which were not at all important to my life. That was my problem. Every problem on earth was my problem. Why are they piling up nuclear weapons? A press of a button can destroy either America or Russia. That means I was too much awake - research in context and out of context.

Although I was a chemistry professor, I studied civil engineering as if to excel a civil engineer. I learnt fundamentals of medicine as if to excel a conventional doctor. I knew more of carpentry than the carpenter himself, like the stability of a chair? What should be the extent of inclination to give comfort? But I was miserable. I lost the skill of resting.

See how human skills, when pushed to measures beyond tolerance limits, can injure the person. I thought these were my best points--researching, being studious, focussing and concentrating. I lost my sleep. I lost my appetite. Instead of being in the company of my wife where I should relax and enjoy, I would be always serious. I became a case for psychiatry. Even Dr. Govindaswamy, the then director of NIMHANS in Bangalore, could not help me. I could not sleep continuously for half an hour. No one could help me at that point where as Vedānta alone came to my rescue.** **

Arjuna, the hero of Mahābhārata suffered this way:

**गाण्डीवं स्रंसते ह्स्ताद्वाक्चैव परिदह्यते ।**

**न च शक्नोम्यवस्थातुं भ्रमतीव च मे मन:॥**

**Gāṇḍīvaṁ sraṁsatē hstāt-tvāk-ca-ēva paridahyatē,**

**na ca śaknōmi-avasthātuṁ bhramatīva ca mē manaḥ.** (Bhagavad-Ġīta, 1-29 & 1-30)

Arjuna tells Krishna that he is unsettled and is confused. It has become a malady for him whether to fight for one value system or another value system. How to overcome the clash of interest between his relatives and gurus on the one side and his duty, as a Kşatriya, on the other side. He is at a loss to understand what course of action he should take. This situation gave birth to the most valuable vedāntic treatise, **Śrīmadbhagavadgītā –श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता.**

Similarly Sri Rāma (of Rāmāyana) also went into melancholy as he found that everything in his life became stale. Kingship became stale. Honour-recognition-status became stale. King Daśaratha lost his cool and was in tears. He almost came to the conclusion that he had lost his son. He was all the while under the impression that Sri Rāma would be an excellent king, representing the Raghu dynasty. When Sage Viśvāmitra visited him, King Daśaratha asked for a solution for Rāma’s depression. Sage Viśvāmitra assured that the problem was very simple and the solution was available in his own court yard. He suggested the King to put Rāma into a dialogue with sage Vāsiṣṭa who was an expert in Brahmavidyā as he felt that it was only with the help of Vedānta such a problem could be solved. That was how **Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa – योगवासिष्ठ -** was born. In that big discussion, Rāma asked all the questions that haunted the people of the world and sought for an answer from the Sage. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha is one of the best texts I have come across in vedāntic literature. Many of the difficult questions that we encounter have been comfortably answered.

In another context in the **Chāndogya Upaniṣad- छान्दोग्य उपनिषत्**, an interesting situation comes where Maharṣi Nārada is the student and Sanatkumāra is the teacher. Nārada comes to Sanatkumāra and announces his credentials, his worthiness to become a student as under:

**यजुरध्येमि, ऋगध्येमि, क्षात्रविद्याम्, नक्षत्रविद्याम्, गन्धर्वविद्याम् ।**Chāndogya Upa. 7-1-2)



* **Yajuradhyemi, ṛgadhyemi -**I know all the four Veda-s.
* **Kṣātravidyām –**I know the science of valour.
* **Nakṣatravidyām –**I know the science of Astronomy**.**
* **Gandharvavidyām-**I know the art of music and dance.

Despite the above, I have come to you to seek solution to my problem as I am in distress and I am not comfortable with myself.

A R̥ṣi of devaloka, is declaring or swearing that he is in distress and discomfort. It is very much interesting to note that, the affected persons in the instances mentioned above were no ordinary people. But, all of them complained that they were suffering, getting dejected in life, had depressed state of mind etc.

There are hundreds of intellectuals in present day world who are suffering this way. They have lost their sleep, they have lost their appetite. They have come to a stage of nervous breakdown due to too much of focussing, too much of problem solving and too much of attention on the matters which are trivial.

At this point of impasse, at this point of deadlock, Vedānta, a beautiful piece of literature which is an integral part of the Vedas, can simply come to our rescue. All religious values in this world can be defended, through the insight of Vedas, through the explanations found in Vedas.

What a wonderful contribution the Indian thinkers have made, to what fundamental levels they have gone, what ingenuity they had displayed in their studies, how powerful their researches were. That is the greatness of Vedānta, which we are going to study in the course of these lectures culminating in the grand revelation as to how Vedānta is a tonic for all the suffering in this world.

In order to find out a real solution to Duḥkha, we have to turn only to the Upaniṣad-s. They are the only source of comfort to a person in distress. Repeatedly our sages are asserting that if one wants real liberation from duḥkha, one should examine himself and find out his true nature. This is the declaration in Chāndogya Upa.(7-1-3)

**शोकम् तरति आत्मवित् इति ।**

**Śokam tarati ātmavit iti.**

(The one who has realized SELF overcomes grief.)

This Duḥkha or grief is everybody's problem - be it of Christians, Europeans, Americans, Hindus, Chinese or Japanese. That's why Upaniṣads deserve to be called as the universal philosophy.

Upaniṣad-s, the religious text which is divested of all the overtones of Karmakāṇḍa, directs its student not to indulge in the external world which is responsible for Duḥkha but to start looking within himself and find out his true nature. The right answer to this problem lies in finding out who is this ‘I’? Who is it that is saying again and again-I am rich-I am poor-I am depressed-I am helpless-I am suffering? Where from this pulsation is getting generated? Is it possible to tame them? Is this ‘I’ a reference point for all our activities? Such questions have not been either thought of or discussed in other schools. This is the true beginning for a student of Vedānta.

We will now take up a few questions posed in the Vedānta Sampradāya:

**कोहं। कथमिदं जातं।**

**किं वा मरण जन्मनि।**

**कथं शाम्यति वेत्ति भो**॥      (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha 6-9-252)

**Kōhaṁ? Katham-idaṁ jātaṁ?**

**Kiṁ vā maraṇa janmani?**

**Kathaṁ śāmyati vētti bhō.**

**Kōhaṁ? -**Who am ‘I’?

**Kathamidaṁ jātaṁ? –**What is this creation with its multiplicity? Does it have a single cause? These questions in cosmology and theoretical physics are haunting the scientists. Can we reduce the whole universe into one or two terms? Physicists of today are still with the four basic forces. Such questions, which are now being thought of by theoretical physicists, had already been raised by our Rishis, ten thousand years ago.

**Kiṁ vā maraṇa janmani? -** What is life? What is death? Does anything survive death? Is there anything which is everlasting? Is there a residue after death?

**Kathaṁ śāmyati vētti bhō?** Tell me how this world subsides?

The whole thinking of the modern biologist is that life is arefinement of matter, an after position of evolved matter. Man has still not settled the basic question whether life is more fundamental or matter more fundamental. It is still an unanswered question in science even today, as all of us know that. Such a question was taken up for study by our ancient Rishis.

**मनुष्येऽस्तीत्येके नायमस्तीति चैके**। (Kaṭha Upa. 1-1-20)

**Manuṣyē-astī-iti-ēkē na-ayam-astī-iti ca-ēkē**.** **

Whether something outlives death or death is the end of everything? Some say yes, some say no. Which is right? This question was posed by Naciketa (student) to Yamadharmarāja (Guru).

**कथं बन्धः कथं मोक्षः-**(Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha, 6-9-253)

**Kathaṁ bandhaḥ kathaṁ mōkṣaḥ?**

What is this suffering? What is this helplessness? What is the solution?

**इति प्रश्नानुदाहरन् पारावारविदां पादान्कस्माद्राजन्न सेवसे**।** **(Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha-6-9-253)

**Iti praśnān-udāharan pārāvāravidāṁ pādān-kasmāt rājan na sēvasē.**

Posing such questions, go to the experts who have solved them. Go to a teacher not in a challenging way, but in a very modest way, with full faith and acceptance of the teacher's ability, by serving him, by looking after his comforts**.**

**साधूनां समदृष्टीनां परिप्रश्नेन सेवय। ।**

**संङ्गमेन च सा युक्तिर्लभते मुच्यते यया ॥**

**Sādhūnāṁ sama-dr̥ṣṭīnāṁ paripraśnēna sēvaya,**

**saṁṅgamēna ca sā yuktiḥ labhatē mucyatē yayā.** (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha 6-9-254)

It is not that the teacher gives some magic wand and the problem is solved or the teacher gives some blessing by which the solution is in sight. None of such things are quoted anywhere in vedāntic texts. What does the teacher give you by way of parihāra_ _(solution)? He gives you a style of logic, a line of investigation, a line of thinking by which your doubts are cleared. You don’t have to accept the teacher even. He gives you a fresh direction of investigation the result of which is an answer to the problem. That is what precisely Vedānta does. You don’t have to accept anything. The student can argue with the teacher. This is what we saw earlier in the case of the post doctoral student who did not agree with his teacher and posed serious doubts. It is not possible to understand Vedānta by listening to a lecture, but by repeated introspection and clarifying the doubts that arises in the mind-by one to one dialogue-by cross questioning the teacher-sometimes not agreeing to what he says and expressing freely one’s own point of view.

In fact, our Upaniṣads contain such serious dialogues where in the teacher is not disturbed by the nature of the question but answers the student very calmly. In **Praśnopaniṣad - प्रश्नोपनिषत् -**the student asks his master- - (Q 3-1)

**भगवन् कुत एषः प्राणो जायते**।

**Bhagavan kuta ēṣaḥ prāṇō jāyatē.**

Where does this prāṇa originate from? This is a question which is very difficult to answer. And the teacher instead of scolding the student says - **Ati praśnān-pṛcchasi** **brahmiṣṭosi - अति प्रश्नान्पृच्छसि** **ब्रह्मिष्टोसि.**You are asking difficult questions, extraordinary questions-that is all the reason why I should discuss with you. That was the attitude of the teacher. How scientific the whole tradition was! Any disturbing or difficult question could be posed and the teacher welcomed it. That was the true scientific spirit.

I would like to mention about an incident which took place some years ago in our house. It was in the case of a professor of a famous institute in Bangalore who was very much into western thinking that he swore by Sartre’s existentialism and his big ideas. One day he came along with his wife accidentally to one of the Sunday Classes going on in my house. We were discussing the ‘ānanda’ mechanism as detailed in the Upaniṣad-s He was moved so much by that one single day’s discussion, he returned the very next day in the morning and said that he was totally convinced about the line of thought we were discussing the previous day. A person who disowned Hinduism so much and called all ritualistic things as meaningless and foolish, started learning Rudra and Puruşasūkta under a teacher for three years and now he is spending his time for three hours every day in the morning chanting mantra and performing the ritualistic programmes.

The importance of Karmakāṇḍa comes to the forefront once Vedānta is studied and understood in this way. Vedānta therefore doesn’t differ with karmakāṇḍa. It strengthens karmakāṇḍa. <u>Whatever **cittaśuddhi-**cleansing of mind-has to happen which is a pre requisite in Vedānta, is possible only through karmakāṇḍa.</u> Reciting aṣṭottara, sahasranāma, performing different pūja-s, earns a meaning with this broad understanding. What is looked as very primitive ideas in the eyes of the modern man become very significant as sādhana progresses. Thus, the role of japa and the role of repeating gāyatrīmantra can be explained. Everything fits in here. A student of Vedānta in the earlier phase of sādhana really goes to karmakāṇḍa and its details. In the later phase a standard process of **śravaṇa, manana** and **nididhyāsana** -**-श्रवण-मनन-निदिध्यासन -** has to take place. Then he has to sit and diffuse himself and workout alone.

Thank you for listening.



## IN SEARCH OF OUR TRUE NATURE - AN OVERVIEW

In our last talk we tried to bring out the differences between karmakāṇḍa and jñānakāṇḍa. It is possible that I have spoken lightly of karmakāṇḍa, but karmakāṇḍa is a very valuable part of Vedas. I was just showing the differences in the content, rather than emphasising the superior ways in which jñānakāṇḍa takes us in the realm of spiritual study. Whosoever has that śraddhā and devotion to karmakāṇḍa details is certainly a superior person. Please do not slacken that śraddhā, as it pays in the long run. All religious activities conceived by the Indian**R̥ṣi-s  - ऋषि**- have a very big significance in creating peace in our minds.**Śankara - शङ्कर**makes a conclusive statement about it, calling that all the religious activities are aimed at**Cittaśuddhi - चित्तशुद्धि -**cleansing of the mind. The whole of karmakāṇḍa is highly valuable because it purifies the mind and very soon we come to the realization that purified mind is**ātmā - आत्मा** **or** **Brahma - ब्रह्म.** I will be wrong if I underrate karmakāṇḍa rituals. The worship, the **pūjā - पूजा**, the **prārthanā - प्रार्थना** and the **vrata - व्रत**that every Indian home does, is equally important in the attainment of peace of mind.

Once at a couples' camp at Kanyakumari in India where eighty people had participated, I was observing a Maharaṣṭrian lady, a doctor by profession, who was constantly doing **Japa - जप** while listening to the lectures. Out of curiosity, I asked her whether it was the Maharaṣṭrian way. She replied that she always did Japa whenever she found time during the day, irrespective of the place and time. So her mind had become **Japamātra - जपमात्र**. Imagine the cittaśuddhi that could have happened to that lady when all unwanted thoughts are simply replaced by the japa. Once the mind is purified, then that is the seat of peace. A purified mind is ānanda or ātmā or Brahma.

**निगृहीतस्य मनसो निर्विकल्पस्य धीमतः।**

**Nigr̥hītasya manasō nirvikalpasya dhīmataḥ.**

(Māṇ. Up.3-Kā.34)

An assertion from a famous thinker Gauḍapāda, the grand preceptor of Śankara, **Nigr̥hītaṁ manaḥ ēva nirbhayaṁ brahma  - निगृहीतं मनः एव निर्भयं ब्रह्म  -**the fully conquered mind, the fully tamed mind is verily Brahman, the seat of bliss, the seat of ānanda.

Coming back to our point, jñānakāṇḍa is remarkable because it is scientific in every sense of the word and you all know that it appeals to us more, as we are scientific by disposition and by training. Therefore there is a good deal of matching in our thinking process. One does not have to take things for granted. Everything goes by investigation. If the points stated are established, one accepts them or else one rejects them. That’s the courage shown in jñānakāṇḍa reflecting a typical scientific temper.

Fundamental questions are posed and answers sought in Jñānakāṇḍa. Questions which are relevant to day to day life of mankind are tackled. It is a universal science catering to the needs of anybody and everybody irrespective of caste, creed, religion, nation, race etc. It need not be stressed that everyone is suffering with one or the other problem. Anyone can swear by this. Vedānta comes to the rescue of one and all and assures a total and everlasting solution to one’s suffering. It is for this reason that we should go to this science. **Ātyantika duḥkha nivāraṇa, niratiśaya sukhaprāpti - आत्यन्तिक दुःख निवारण, निरतिशय सुखप्राप्ति**(cessation of perennial suffering and attainment of unbounded happiness)** **is the motto of that science. Upaniṣad-s themselves declare this point. A person after self examination can actually discover his true nature and come out of sorrow automatically. A student comes and asks the teacher:

**कस्मिन्नु भगवो विज्ञाते सर्वमिदं विज्ञातं भवतीति ।**

**Kasminnu bhagavō vijñātē sarvaṁ-idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati-iti.** (Muṇḍaka Upa. 1-1-3)

O master, give that knowledge knowing which everything is known. This jigsaw puzzle is completely solved once you are a sādhaka as enumerated in Muṇḍaka Upa. (2-2-9) thus:

**भिद्यते हृदयग्रन्थिश्छिद्यन्ते सर्वसंशयाः।**

**क्षीयन्ते चास्य कर्माणि तस्मिन् दृष्टे परावरे॥**

**Bhidyatē hr̥dayagranthiḥ-chidyantē sarva-saṁśayāḥ,**

**kṣīyantē ca-asya karmāṇi tasmin dr̥ṣṭē parāvarē.**

**Bhidyatē hr̥dayagranthiḥ _-_**

The pressure at the **Ājñācakra**, at the optic centre (space_ _between the eye brows) is totally relieved.**_ _**

**Chidyantē sarvasaṁśayāḥ**

To a student of Vedānta, this knot of bondage is completely cut. All doubts are cleared.

And, what else?**kṣīyantē cā asya karmāṇi.** Everybody has a load of karma on his shoulders. Upaniṣadic wisdom shows that karma is not the ultimate. We are under the belief that only money fetching and objects of enjoyment thereof, brings us sukha. Śāstra proves that all this is not necessary for the end point. Kṣīyante chāsya karmāni-the load of karma simply gets dropped here.

When? **tasmin dr̥ṣṭē parāvarē-**When you know the mechanism by which the phenomenon turns into non phenomenon, when you can catch this reversible reaction, the creation phase versus the dissolution phase - **ātmasthiti - आत्मस्थिति**, all the gains come to you. So this philosophy by which this **duḥkhanāśa - दुःखनाश** – eradication of duḥkha happens is the main feature of Vedānta. If we keep this in mind, yesterday's objection on karmakāṇḍa can be forgotten.  As Nārada puts it-

**शोकम् तरति आत्मविदिति ---**

**Śōkam tarati ātmaviditi ---**Chāndogya Upa. 7-1-3)

With the knowledge of Self one can overcome grief.

Let us now try to understand how Vedānta goes about the above subject. It asks the person to investigate - do Parīkṣa. Whatever the inside forces are and whatever the inside phenomena are, observe them. The following beautiful stanza from Kaţhopaniṣhad (2-4-1) is worth elaborating and contemplating**.**:

**पराञ्चि खानि व्यतृणत्स्वयंभूस्तस्मात्पराङ्पश्यति नान्तरात्मन्।**

**कश्चित् धीरः प्रत्यगात्मानमैक्षत् आवृत्तचक्षुः अमृतत्वमिच्छन्॥**

**Parāñci khāni vyatr̥ṇat-svayaṁbhūḥ-tasmāt parān-paśyati na-antarātman.**

**Kaścit dhīraḥ pratyagātmānam-aikṣat āvr̥tta-cakṣuḥ amr̥tatvam-icchan.**



* Parāncikhāni_ _vyatṛṇat_ _svayambhuḥ_ _tasmāt_ _parān_ _paśyati_ _na_ _antarātman - The Creator has created the indriyā-s in man which are directed outwardly. He has structured them as if they go out always, look for things of pleasure. Hence we are always thinking of the outside world transacting through the Jñānendriyā-s.
* Kaścit dhīraḥ-** **Once in a way, a bold person is born who takes the centre stage. What does he do?
* Āvṛtta cakṣuḥ pratyagātmānam aikṣhata- He reverses the process. He turns the Indriyā-s** **inwards with his intellect. The tool of investigation turned inside, he conducts the search. Why does he do that?
* amṛtatvam icchan - To get everlasting happiness.

Such a hero was Nachiketha of Kaţhopaniṣad, who at his sixteenth year seriously sought answers from Yama to such deeper questions. This also goes to show that one has to search for truths at a very early age. Mainly two methods of investigation are suggested for this purpose. We will look at them one by one.

**1.Ātmaparīkṣā-आत्मपरीक्षा**–**Self Examination.**

I will narrate an incident from Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad -**बृहदारण्यक उपनिषत्**.

Yājñavalkya **– याज्ञवल्क्य** - is the great preceptor, the hero of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. He** **decides to take formal sanyāsa to enable him to do the sādhana for attainment of the reality he has theoretically und -erstood. To take sanyāsa, one should seek the permission of the wife. So naturally Yājñavalkya also had to do the same. He had two wives**Kātyāyanī - कात्यायनी**,** **and**Maitreyī- मैत्रेयी**. He goes to Kātyāyani, the elder wife and assures her that he will equally divide his wealth acquired from King Janaka so that both of them could be happy. Kātyāyani permits him to take sanyāsa** **as she is happy with the wealth provided for. Then he goes to Maitreyi and repeats the assurance given to the other wife and asks her permission to take sanyāsa. Maitreyi,** **on the other hand, questions him if the riches given by him would fetch permanent happiness. Yājñavalkya** **tells her the truth that riches cannot give permanent happiness.

**अमृतत्वस्य न आशा अस्ति वित्तेन**। - (Bṛha. Upa. 2-4-2)

**Amr̥tatvasya na āśā asti vittēna**

Riches can give comfort, but amṛtatva is impossible. Permanent joy, unbroken joy, undiluted joy, uninterrupted joy is not possible. Maitreyi says that she wants permanent happiness, if he can give her, other than the money. She wants the method by which she can get the**śāśvatasukha.**

The answer given by Yājñavalkya is the very famous vedāntic thought and also the method by which one can gain undiluted happiness. If one wants to be happy always, the only way is to know oneself.

**आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः श्रोतव्यः मन्तव्यः निदिध्यासितव्यः।**

**Ātmā vā arē draṣṭavyaḥ śrōtavyaḥ mantavyaḥ nididhyāsitavyaḥ.** (Bṛha Upa. 2-4-5)

My dear (Maitreyi), Self should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon.

The gist of Vedānta has been condensed into one sentence and a prescription is given. Are you really interested in Sukha? Total Sukha? Then why don’t you do ātmāparīkṣa? But, what is ātmā and why parīkṣa? A wonderful explanation is given by Yajñavalkya as under ((Bṛha Upa. 2-4-5)

**न वा अरे पत्युः कामाय पतिः प्रियो भवति, आत्मनस्तु कामाय पतिः प्रियो भवति। न वा अरे जायायै कामाय जाया प्रिया भवति, आत्मनस्तु कामाय जाया प्रिया भवति। .............. न वा अरे लोकानां कामाय लोकाः ...... न वा अरे सर्वस्य कामाय सर्वं ...**

**Na vā arē patyuḥ kāmāya patiḥ priyō bhavati, ātmanastu kāmāya patiḥ priyō bhavati| na vā arē jāyāyai kāmāya jāyā priyā bhavati, ātmanastu kāmāya jāyā priyā bhavati| .............. na vā arē lōkānāṁ kāmāya lōkāḥ ...... na vā arē sarvasya kāmāya sarvaṁ...**

Verily, not for the sake of the husband is the husband loved, but he is loved for the sake of the self. Not for the sake of the wife is the wife loved, but she is loved for the sake of the self. Not for the sake of the sons, my dear, are the sons loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self.

Likewise, not for the sake of wealth, animals, world, everyone... are all loved. But, they are loved for the sake of the self.

Husband is dear to the wife not for husband’s sake, but for her own sake. Similar is the case with the husband. Wife is important as long as she satisfies him. Husband is comfortable because of his wife since she is interesting to him. If each says that the other is important for other’s sake, it is self deceit. One holds Vedas high not because they are reverential, but because they give one the comfort. Activities like social service, scientific research, etc. are noble and beneficial to the society. People involved in such activities seem to be under the impression that they are doing so for the sake of activities. In reality, these activities are dear to the persons involved as they give comfort, joy, satisfaction and happiness to them personally. If any activity does not contribute to one’s stock of happiness, one will not do that. Therefore, what is that atman (self) to which all your concerns are really directed? This atman or this reference point, for whose delight you are seeing worthwhileness in all things/activities, is to be found out.

So the first method of investigation is ātmaparīkṣā under the guidance of a competent teacher. Who is a competent teacher? Scriptures are very careful in prescribing the rules for that.

**तद्विज्ञानार्थं स गुरुमेवाभिगच्छेत्।**

**समित्पाणिः श्रोत्रियम् ब्रह्मनिष्ठम्॥-**Muṇḍaka Upa.1-2-12.

**Tat-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum-ēva-abhigacchēt,**

**samitpāṇiḥ śrōtriyam brahma-niṣṭham.**

For the attainment of knowledge of SELF one has to approach the teacher who is not only a scholar but also is established in Brahman.

A competent teacher is one who should have double qualifications. There are two eligibility factors. What are they? He must be well versed with the śāstrā-s. That alone is not sufficient, because he may be repeating the śāstra in a parrot like way, without himself being a brahmaniṣṭha_,_ without having touched the source. So, while śrotriyatva_ _is necessary, brahmaniṣṭhatva is also necessary. He must have known the truth, not only by śāstrarūpeņa but also by anubhavarūpeņa_. _The two factors put together are necessary to be a teacher**.**

**2. Sukha-Duḥkha Parīkṣa- सुखदुःखपरीक्षा ।**

This is the second method suggested by the śāstra. As already discussed in the introductory talk, every person craves for more and more happiness or sukha. At the same time, he wants to get rid of suffering or duḥkha. He is continuously and constantly struggling for sukha-prāpti and duḥkha-nivṛtti. In order to know the truth, Vedānta asks the student to do the parīkṣa of duḥkha or sukha, as the case may be, in greater depth. That is, one has to delve deep into the problem itself and find the solution by analysing the same to its minute details.

Before we get into the discussions it should be clearly borne in mind that our entire deliberations relate to **Mental Level** or the Psychic Level or Citta Level or Intellectual Level and not at physical level.

## SUKHA-DUḤKHA PARĪKṣA 
(AN ANALYSIS OF HAPPINESS AND SUFFERING)

The credit of discovering this path definitely has to go to me. In my days of intense suffering, I was frantically searching for solutions in Vedānta śāstrās by thorough study of the texts along with the invaluable commentary by Śankara on them. This in-depth search of mine led to the discovery of the above path. When presented in the public, many took it with disbelief and they naturally wanted sanction in Vedāntic Texts or Śāstra Pramāna. In Chāndogya Upaniṣad (7-22)** **Sanatkumāra (the teacher) tells Nārada (the student) that:

**यदा वै सुखं लभतेऽथ करोति।**

**Yadā vai sukhaṁ labhate atha karōti.**

One will involve oneself in that activity only which gives him Sukha or happiness.

**सुखं लब्ध्वा करोति - Sukhaṁ labdhvā karōti.**

One will not venture into that activity which will not result in happiness.

**सुखमेव लब्ध्वा करोति।**

**Sukham-ēva labdhvā karōti.**

One is goaded into an activity if he gets only happiness.

**सुखंत्वेव विजिज्ञासितव्यमिति ।**

**Sukhaṁtvēva vijijñāsitavyam-iti.**

Hence, we have to investigate or do the parīkṣa of sukha only. Therefore the student requests the teacher:

**सुखं भगवो विजिज्ञास इति॥**

**Sukhaṁ bhagavō vijijñāsa iti.**

Oh my Lord, let me know about the secrets of Sukha.

In Taittirīya Upaniṣad, (2-8) the aspect of Ānanda or Happiness or Sukha is discussed in detail:** **

**सैषानन्दस्य मीमांसा भवति।**

**Sa-ēṣa-ānandasya mīmāṁsā bhavati.**

The teacher calls the student for an investigation of ānanda.

When the teacher suggests sukha-duḥkha parīkṣa, the student immediately reacts, saying that everything about sukha and duḥkha is known already. What more is there to be studied? Look at the reaction of the student. He can categorically tell what his knowledge about sukha-duḥkha is. He declares that he knows about sukha in the sense that music gives him joy, a sweet dish gives him joy, company of welcome friends gives him joy, and a very understanding wife gives him joy. If these are not available, then he is not happy. He further elaborates that if his son/daughter is not studious, he is not happy. Pleasant situations give him joy. Indriya āsvādana gives him joy. The contact of five indriyā-s with the corresponding viṣayā-s, give him joy. The minus of that puts him into sorrow. So, he declares that he knows everything about sukha and duḥkha.

The teacher sets aside the conclusions drawn by the student. He wants the student to investigate Sukha and Duḥkha **content wise and not agency wise.** Here one should pause a little, contemplate and try to catch the difference between knowing the thing agency wise and the same thing content wise. The general opinion is that certain things put one in a happy mood and certain other things put one in an unhappy mood. This was not the study the teacher wanted the student to go into. **He wanted the student to closely watch his state of mind when the student declared that he was happy. Similarly, the teacher wanted the student to study the Cittasthiti (mental state) when he felt he was unhappy.**

This type of investigation, none of us have tried when we are in moments of sukha or duḥkha. Instead, we had restricted our studies of happy or unhappy state at the indriya level all the time. That is all the study we made. Content-wise we have to examine what is sukha and what is duḥkha. We should observe this difference. What was my mental state when I said that the whole of Sunday was a bad day? What is my mental state when I say that it is beautiful, I am so fine? This parīkṣa may look very simple, but it has not occurred to anybody in the world to do the parīkṣa this way. It is exclusively the suggestion from the Upaniṣads. No philosopher, no system of philosophy could give it in such simple terms. In no religion or practice it has been emphasised that sukha-duḥkha parīkṣa should be on the lines where you examine the state of the mind when you are happy and the state of the mind when you are not happy.**The suggestion is unique to the Upaniṣads**. What is the psychological state, what is the psychological posture when you are happy and when you are not happy? A very simple examination but it is a very profound one. It can take you to a new discovery. That’s why I mentioned yesterday that Vedanta is a difficult science, but when properly understood, it is the easiest of all the sciences.


### DUḤKHA PARĪKṣA (EXAMINATION OF SUFFERING)

Let us take up duḥkha parīkṣa to start with and later on go to sukha parīkṣa. What is Duḥkha parīkṣa? Take any duḥkha moment and see what the cittasthiti is. That’s all. Every day we have many moments of duḥkha. Observe what is the state of the mind at that time? Take the case of the day previous to the examination results of a student. The parents of the person are anxious and the student is anxious. The student’s interest is either to get into the computer science course or to get into the medical course, because they are the highest paying jobs. Just imagine the state of parent’s mind or the student’s mind and identify yourself with that situation. Oh! Would I get my first class? Will I lose that? All my plans will be broken if I don’t get it. Would it be a donation seat? Or would it be a seat earned on merit? What then? What are the alternatives? I have such high expectations about the result.

What's the nature of mind at that time? Anxiety! Insecurity! Fear! Doubt! The student wants to relax, but he cannot. He or she is agitated, disturbed. See the revised way of studying duḥkha, not constituent-wise, not ingredients-wise, not characteristics-wise,

The most powerful example that I always remember to illustrate, is to imagine the mental state of your wife or daughter or your sister when a baby is about to be delivered in the family. Admitted to the hospital/ nursing home, the lady is moved to the operation theatre. Watch the husband or father or the mother of the lady in question. They are all anxious, moving up and down the corridor of the hospital. Would it be a simple labour case? Would it be a forceps case? Would it be a caesarean case? Would the child and the mother be safe? The state of mind of the concerned person, when observed, points to **Uncertainty, Anxiety, Impatience, Fear,**which are all attributes of duḥkha.

Similarly, Rāga-attraction,** **Dveṣa-repulsion, Bhaya-fear, are also facets of duḥkha. Jealousy comes when you have only one car and your neighbour has more than that. You grudge him. You feel small. It's that inferiority complex that bothers you- this is a duḥkha attribute. Mind is agitated, excited and troubled. You try to further see the common factor through a scientist's eye-that is, to reduce many things into as few things as possible.

It is a wellestablished fact in Vedānta that the entire set of activities of a human being, both physical and psychological, are nothing butPrāṇic Activity only. Prāṇa is defined as ‘Gatiḥ Prāṇaḥ’-** गतिः प्राणः**. Movement is Prāṇa. Movement is vibration or pulsation. Chāndogya Upaniṣad** **declares that:

**…स यदा स्वपिति प्राणमेव वागप्येति । प्राणं चक्षुःप्राणं श्रोत्रं प्राणं मनः प्राणोह्येवैतान् सर्वान् संवृङ्क्त इति।**

**…sa yadā svapiti prāṇam-ēva vāk-apyēti.  prāṇaṁ cakṣuḥ prāṇaṁ śrōtraṁ prāṇaṁ manaḥ prāṇō-hi-ēva-ētān sarvān saṁvr̥ṅkta iti.**

 (Chāndogya Upa. 4-3-3)**  **

When a person is in deep sleep his speech gets merged into general prāṇic activity. Likewise his seeing, hearing, thinking, etc. - i.e., all his physical and psychological activities - merge into a single prāṇic activity or a general vibration.

The above can be easily grasped if we think of a person who is in coma. Except the beating of the pulse there is no other activity in him. All other physical and mental activities stand merged in this mere pulsation- general prāṇic activity.



* Our thinking centre (centre of our mind which is called as Citta) is filled with Prāṇaic Activity, Vibration or Movement.
* Any activity involves variation in its occurrence – it may be very slow, slow, normal, fast, very fast etc.

As already discussed above, the teacher’s direction of investigating Duḥkha is to watch the state of mind when one says that he is not happy or is suffering. Accordingly, if one examines his own mind or Citta Centre when he is angry it is highly agitated, the level of activity is at a very high speed, there is fastness, there is restlessness, citta is filled with throbbing prānic activity. Although he is not in a position to watch his state of mind at the peak of his anger, he can do so when he calms down a little. We would have seen people physically disturbed and even trembling during such angry situations. When we analyse this, we can say that Rāga, Krodha (Anger), Jealousy, Bhaya (fear), Anxiety, Uncertainty, Impatience, Hurry etc., are all synonyms of **SPEED** only. All these situations amount to fastness or hyper activity of the mind (citta) called **VEGA** in Sanskrit. Thus, all such moments are moments of Duḥkha or suffering. Let us take up the following Śloka of Bhagavad-Ġīta (5-23).

**शक्नोतीहैव यः सोढुं प्राक्शरीरविमोक्षणात् ।**

**कामक्रोधोद्भवं वेगं स युक्तः स सुखी नर:॥**

**Śaknōti-iha-ēva yaḥ sōḍhuṁ prāk-śarīra- vimōkṣaṇāt,**

**Kāma-krōdha-udbhavaṁ vēgaṁ sa yuktaḥ sa sukhī naraḥ.**

One who is able to withstand the impulse of lust and anger before death is a yogi, and a happy person.Man can be happy only when he is able to control or drop the speed arising out of Kāma (desire), Krodha, and Bhaya etc. which are the moments of Duḥkha.

**दुःखेष्वनुद्विग्नमनाः सुखेषु विगतस्पृहः।**

**वीतरागभयक्रोधः स्थितधीर्मुनिरुच्यते॥**

**Duḥkhēṣu-anudvigna-manāḥ sukhēṣu vigata- spr̥haḥ,**

**vīta-rāga-bhaya-krōdhaḥ sthitadhīḥ- muniḥ-ucyatē.** (Bhagavad-Ġīta, 2-56)

A person whose mind is unperturbed by sorrow, who does not crave for pleasures, and who is completely free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called Sthitaprajña --- a sage of steady intellect.

In Bhagavad-Ġīta, while dealing with the characteristics of a balanced person or Yogi it is said that – such a person will not get disturbed, his mind does not get agitated or his mind is rid of Vega during the moments of Duḥkha. That is, he has conquered the speed of Rāga, Bhaya, and Krodha in all such situations.

When examined, one can see that any disturbance, any misery, and any pain amounts to violence inside- it can be an excited mind, an agitated mind with unruly forces operating inside. If you apply the cleverness of a scientist, all these can be brought under one term –**speed or vega** or fastness. That’s the advantage the scientist has over the others. He can bring all these things into a few minimal terms. Hundreds of nearly different things can be brought into one term, so that handling is easy. So,**duḥkha is speed**. What a permitted conclusion!

**Hence, the solution** is, wherever there is fastness, replace it by slowness. It is our experience that an agitated person instead of walking will almost be running. A speed at one point is a speed revealed everywhere. If he is fast inside and is chewing, it can be fast chewing. If he is swallowing, it is fast swallowing. My relative who was a specialist in cancer layer study in Cincinnati, USA, had the habit of chewing the gum. When he focussed and when he was fast, this speed of chewing also increased. He had observed this and shared with me. He was not a student of Vedānta, but look at the observation.

<u>Speed felt at one centre is revealed at all centres. Speed corrected at one centre, purifies all other centres</u>. Now that you have the answer-walk slowly- talk slowly-think slowly. Try to get angry slowly. Then it is no anger at all! Softness brought at one centre induces softness at other centres like the thinking centre, the walk centre, the talk centre and the respiratory centre. Try to apply slowness and see the difference. Comfort sets in immediately. I have tried this experiment and got results. You can best appreciate this truth when you start applying them. You can see the difference and appreciate the śāstra then. If you want to walk, do it slowly. Walking slowly starts purifying all these centres. Then one is very much relaxed.

There is another component of duḥkha, which we have to study. In fact it is a subtler aspect. Once you become an intellectual, you begin to think seriously. And what's that thinking - to know, to understand, to grasp. That’s again another burden. Why do you call it a burden? Is it not the power in you? Intellect is the best tool in the hands of man. All this technology is because of his intellect. Employing that intellect, the medical science has advanced. Anaesthesia itself has become so sophisticated that it is very convenient to surgery. A roof can be bent in any direction because of the combination of concrete and reinforcements. All this technology is the result of focussing_. _But the point is that it is burdensome and that is the reason why focussing is turned down by śāstra. One is naturally disturbed with this position of śāstra and this can be anybody’s objection to the śāstra. Focussing is the most powerful tool in the hands of man due to which the advancement of technology is possible. But the point is that this attention or focussing is burdensome. Fortunately, we are making and breaking this focussing. Nobody is continuously concentrating for more than half an hour, even the most studious. Even the big researcher reaches the break down point very early. The fatigue point is reached and he shakes off. That’s a natural safety mechanism built in man. Otherwise, man would have broken himself down, would have turned mad, and would have hit himself against a wall! You shift from the serious mood to a lighter mood. But once you start encouraging this quality of overdoing this focussing, the balance is tilted. Generally, we err in the wrong direction and we begin to suffer.

Imagine the fatigue experience of such a person. We must know the goodness or badness of a thing in its exaggerated version. Otherwise it becomes difficult to appreciate! You must push the pendulum to the extreme point and then see the momentum it carries. But, once you exploit this intellect and start doing much of it, you begin to suffer. Excitement, fear, desire for objects of enjoyment, desire for fame; can be managed to certain extent. But the endless pursuit for creativity is difficult to manage. If you watch the professors in any research institute, either they are in the laboratory doing research or they are stuck in their home also preoccupied with the same thought of research. They cannot come out of this focussing. Hence, subtler version of suffering is **focussing.** Basically we are ‘all-pervasive’ beings or** sarvayvāpī- सर्वव्यापी.**



* When you are not in suffering state you are expansive, unloaded, diffused, very light, and non-dense and hence you are in a state of Vistārata- all-pervasiveness.
* But when you are in a moment of Duḥkha, you are sacrificing your everywhereness and coming to a pinpoint.
* In the language of a Quantum Physicist – you are in a **CONING**phase- tending towards pointedness.
* If one observes a cone, the tip of the cone is pointed and the base is wide.
* Focussing is coning into a point. Reducing to a point or to an aperture.
* Since you are a burdened stuff, your mind acquires the highest density because it has limited volume- That is why you feel the load on you.
* We have sacrificed our true nature of expansive state and are badly caught up in searching, trying to solve, trying to know etc. We have shrunk ourselves into a narrow stuff.

Unaware of this obvious truth, I made a mess of my life for 20 years, always focussing, to a point that I lost my sleep, I lost my appetite, and no medication would help me. I went to a very famous doctor only to be told that no medicine would help me and I had to gain balance of mind through control of aspirations. I was always researching on something or the other. I was having a firm faith and conviction that I was doing a very big thing or a noble act.

I am showing a very big aspect of human being, especially that of an intellectual. I was proud of my research skills. I thought I was a big fellow because I could easily focus on various things. All the while I was under the impression that I was doing the best thing - solving problems – such as, how to give a simpler house for the villager with which I was not concerned at all as I was a chemistry professor. My research was to device a method to simplify a house construction and make it cost effective. How to avoid a beam for the door and have only the shutter, how to avoid plastering for the wall so that it could save 20% of the total cost, how to build a house without foundation? It was not my field at all. Even then, I had designed all carpentry work. You may say that it is a wonderful research for society's benefit and for one’s own delight, but it was exhausting for me.

I owe everything to Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa because I was able to open the knot of suffering. I deeply understood the vedāntic solution when no teacher could tell me what my problem was and where I erred. Most of the teachers went by vedāntic definitions Satyam Jñānam Anantam Brahma, Anoranīyān Mahatomahīāyn, etc. Once again, if you become a serious student and start studying these declarations you will end up confused. What does one understand by saying ‘you are smaller than the smallest, bigger than the biggest’ (Anoranīyān, Mahatomahīyān)? To a scientist that is a very big inconsistency. How can anything simultaneously be smaller than the smallest and bigger than the biggest?

One of my friends was a director of a computer science research centre. He was in his fifties, heading twenty top scientists and was the chief of the unit. While we were discussing one day, he said that he had become prematurely ten years older due to pressure of work and focussing. An American, who was a big researcher, head of a team of researchers, confessed to the fact that he was 10 years older than his actual age. Then why not give it up? See the difficulty. How can he give up, as the investor of money into that research unit is demanding results? The investor or money giver claims results. Otherwise there is a fear of the funds being stopped. So, that leads to more and more focussing. What next? How to complete this research in one or two weeks? Though it can be a remarkable achievement from one point of view it is alarming from the other point of view.

We cannot say that focussing - **ēkāgratā- एकाग्रता,**is a wrong thing, but ekāgratā was my cause for suffering when I overdid it although it gave me good credit for an extraordinary performance.

I want you to appreciate this point. The world of technology and the civilization has missed this big point. While we may glorify it from one point of view, we should condemn it from the other point of view. The urge to over perform through attention or concentration is a killer of peace! You are paying a big price for your technological achievements. Why should not people here in America realize this one? Look at the wisdom from the East? At what cost are you getting these achievements-new discoveries, especially in the medical field and in the engineering field. If there is adequate rest for the **buddhikośa- बुद्धिकोश –**the intellect**- **it is okay. This is the missing element in the 21<sup>st</sup> century civilization. And what is the technique that can complement that missing element? It is the Indian wisdom- the Vedāntic wisdom. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (3-9-39) asserts-

**अनास्थैव हि निर्वाणम् दुःखमास्था परिग्रहः।**

**Anāsthā-ēva hi nirvāṇam duḥkham-āsthā parigrahaḥ.**

While attachment (focussing) is sufferring, detachment (diffusion) alone leads to liberation.

Focussing, pinpointedness, concentration, coning, etc. all result in untold suffering or Duḥkha. Whereas, Vistārata or diffusion or expansive state of mind gives you Sukha or happiness or deliverance from Duḥkha. Therefore drop burdensome/tiresome focussing and concentration and adopt a**Let go** **attitude** as far as possible. This is called **Udāsīnabhāva- उदासीनभाव.**

This focussing is the main aspect of Duḥkha for an intellectual. The duḥkha of a non intellectual or worldly person is to hanker for small things such as satisfaction of the tongue, attainment of status and recognition etc. Even the role of the social worker is to think about the ways of serving the society. What about the householder then? He worries about the children, about the wife, about the bank deposit? How does it help him to come out of duḥkha? As said in Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (6-9-418)-

**द्वित्वैकत्वदृशौ चित्तं तदेवाज्ञानमुच्यते।**

**एतयोर्यो लयो दृष्टयोस्तज्ज्ञानं सा परा गतिः॥**

**Dvitva-ēkatva-dr̥śau cittaṁ tat-ēva-ajñānam- ucyatē,**

**ētayōryō layō dr̥ṣṭayō-tat-jñānaṁ sā parā gatiḥ.**

That itself is ignorance if eirher the mind cognises several objects at a time or concentrates on one object only. If both these modes of the mind dissolve then that is the highest and exalted state.

If cāncalya is a bandhana then ēkāgratā also is a bandhana. When these are put an end to, then that is liberation.

Anyway, **speed and focussing** are the two aspects of duḥkha. It is a very big piece of research whatever we have discussed in these ten minutes. Duḥkha is completely understood through these two words- speed - **vega- वेग**and focussing (Lakshya). Thus, duḥkha is either an agitated state of mind or a focussed state of mind. <u>If agitation is replaced by **naidhānya- नैधान्य**, gradually and consciously it will result in less and less of duḥkha. Whenever focussing becomes burdensome, replace the same by de-focussing or diffusion (‘let go’ attitude - udāsīnabhāva).</u> And again the result will be elimination of duḥkha. More you diffuse, more will be the expansion of your shell. Ramaṇa and R<u>ā</u>makṛṣṇa would often say 'I don’t know where I exist. I am not centred.' The point here is that they did not even know where they were. To that extent the diffusion had taken place. We identify ourselves with some place or work as a reference point when we ask ourselves as to where we are. Whereas, a Jñāni would say that he cannot see himself and confirms that he has lost his focus. That’s the experiential announcement of a jñāni.

As doctors put it, half the remedy is achieved by proper diagnosis. So if you are convinced that the points raised above are the symptoms of Duḥkha, then replace**Vēga by slowness** **and focussing by expansion**. This is the solution to the problem of duḥkha. That was our research to come out of duḥkha. Sankochatā or constriction or narrowing down is replaced by Vistāratā-**विस्तारता** -everywhereness, spreadness.

That’s where a scientist is at an advantage over the pundit as far as Vedānta is concerned. We are at a distinct advantage than our forefathers who did not know this vocabulary. They did not know this scientific phraseology because they didn’t know aspects like density, potential etc. Duḥkha is localization. Non localized- spread version is the solution for the state of burden. So once you know this, you have the answer.

**<u>Role of One’s Freedom Element</u>.**

The student appreciates the whole point and expresses that he is fully convinced about the solution for duḥkha. But, he urges that not to be fast and not to focus is not under his control. The main objection is that situations drive a person mad. There are a number of problems to be attended to simultaneously within limited period of time and this cannot be avoided. Logically, this is a valid point to consider. In the language of psychology, one is determined by the stimulus-response theory. There is the stimulus, there is the situation and one has to respond helplessly. Many examples can be considered. Take the case of a household lady. She is suffering because her husband is very indifferent to domestic work. How do you expect her to be comfortable and relaxed? It is an attack on the whole study we made here.

Psychological transactions are not just governed by the law of stimulus and response. A new factor comes into the study and it is the**freedom** element. You have a choice, you have a freedom, and you have an option. It is not deterministic. Till now, you never thought so. In fact this is the ignorance on the part of man. Everyone thinks that the situations are so demanding that they drive one to suffering. Although one knows the answer, still it cannot be applied. This is a very important objection.

It is here that I did a bit of deeper research. It is here that text books in psychology can take a fresh lesson from Vedānta. One is the theoretical aspect and the other is the application part of it. Śāstra says man is not a creature of circumstances. He can react or he can refuse to react. The situations cannot thrust themselves on him. The option is with him, the freedom is within him, the choice is with him.

Śankara’s brilliant research gives us the truth. What is mind? Mind is a very peculiar thing and it has this capacity:

**कर्तुं अकर्तुं अन्यथा वा कर्तुं शक्यम् ।**

**Kartuṁ akartuṁ anyathā vā kartuṁ śakyam.**

(Śankara, Brahmasutrabhāṣya)

A person has an inherent freedom to do, not to do or to do it differently.

What a wonderful truth! The mind can do this way, it can do the other way, it can do neither this way nor that way, it can stay quiet .For example, one can be harsh to one’s parents or one can be soft, thinking that they deserve his respects since they are elders. Alternatively, one can be neither harsh nor soft and can be neutral.

Here is the difference between the **jaḍa** and the **cetana,**the inanimate and the animate. In the case of a **jaḍavastu** like football- it cannot manipulate itself. When left in a place for fifty thousand years, it stays there. It cannot vary by itself. If one pushes, then it moves. It is a helpless mass, it has no choice. It is governed totally by the stimulus and response.

**Cetana**on the other hand, has the freedom of action, a facility not available with jaḍavastu. Let us say – a fellow has hurt me. I have a reason to get into depression or hit back with anger. Or, I can as well say ‘let him have his own opinion, why should I bother?’ **The evil forces dissolve by applying the second suggestion.**This is the available freedom** **in us.

To say that the external situations determine one’s mental state is a wrong thing. With the recognition of the freedom element in him, a person can have a strong volition, will or autonomy. Everyone’s home becomes beautiful if he can grow as wise as this. Any difference of opinion can be accepted. An opinion suggested by the other person may be foolish. But one need not be disturbed by that because of the freedom element human beings have. Look at the contribution of Vedānta to individual suffering and therefore to global suffering!

I can put this one argument into the textual language. <u>This freedom of choice can be applied even with regard to my three natural phases of existence namely, jnāt</u>ṛ<u>tva or perceiving, bhokt</u>ṛ<u>tva or selecting and ka</u>r<u>tṛtva or doing. I could use these qualities or I could be without them.</u> Śāstra is not forcefully thrusting something on you. This is the result of an investigation which we have done. Hence, I am pure consciousness, chinmātra svarūpa- not disturbed, not affected by situations. The individual should recognise and apply this freedom element inbuilt in him to come out of suffering.


### SUKHA PARĪKṣA (HAPPINESS ANALYSED)

Now let us examine the concept of Sukha as understood by our** **R̥ṣi-s. One may say that Duḥkharāhitya or absence of Duḥkha is not Sukha. It is the general notion that Sukha is positive and comes from:



* Objects of enjoyment – Bhogasukha- Enjoyment derived through the five senses – sense of vision, hearing, smell, taste and touch.
* Social Service – serving the poor, disabled, economically challenged etc. It may be any activity – either trivial or profound.
* Job satisfaction.
* Satisfaction in one’s profession.
* Achieving name and fame in society.

All the above give you positive feeling. So, what is there to examine? Why at all we should bother about investigating Sukha? The experience of almost all of us, especially the persons who are internally sensitive, is that there is saturation in every kind of worldly Sukha/happiness. Everything becomes stale at some point of time or the other. Hence, the search for everlasting happiness or pure ānanda or śāśvatasukha becomes necessary. Unfortunately we are all searching for this in the outside world. Here comes Vedānta to our rescue and asks us to investigate any moment of happiness, <u>content wise and not agency wise.</u>

The observation or watching is to be done at the thinking centre i.e., Citta or mind Centre, as we had done with Duḥkha Moments**.** We have to observe the mind as to what happens at the moments of sukha and observation has to happen at the ājñāchakra or the space between the eyebrows.

Sip a cup of coffee or tea or listen to music of your choice or taste a sweet dish and see what happens at the thinking centre. **Shift your attention from the agency, that is, coffee or music or sweet dish**to the **thinking Centre** and just **Watch.** For the first time in your life you will experience a wonder. Bulk of the mind does not exist during that moment, the mind cannot think of any problems, the mind refuses to think, the mind doesn’t want to think, the mind is incapacitated to think at that moment of joy. World doesn’t exist for you. Your problems are thrown out and you are carefree- you are free of any responsibility. The burning problems that you had all along cannot touch you now in the enjoyment of coffee, or sweets or whatever.

You have touched your pūrvasthiti/amanī- bhāva/manorāhitya/cittaviśrānti. You are in your**ātmāsvarūpa- आत्मस्वरूप**. You are set in your brahmasvarūpa. You are in your no-mind state. You are in your thought free state which is your **nijasvarūpa- निजस्वरूप**. Here, you may disagree to accept that Bhogasukha is**Brahmasukha- ब्रह्मसुख**. But śāstra and Śankara mention it in a different way. Now you listen to bhāṣhya from Śankara.

**Laukikōpi ānandō brahmānandasya ēva mātrā.**

**लौकिकोपि आनन्दो ब्रह्मानन्दस्यैव मात्रा॥**

(Taittirīya Upa, Śankarabhāṣya, 2-8-197)

Don’t you see that this bhogasukha is only a fraction of that brahmasukha? What a daring statement! Is it not obvious? This means that every moment of sukha is an empty state of mind which is--Your kāraṇasthiti-Your advaita sthiti- a non dual state- a no-mind state. There is nothing like noble sukha and ignoble sukha. The agency may be noble, or ignoble. But sukha per se is Brahma. And Śankara actually adds a line from Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upa -4-3-32

**एतस्यैवानन्दस्यान्यानि भूतानि मात्राम् उपजीवन्ति ॥**

**Ētasya-ēva-ānandasya-anyāni bhūtāni mātrām upa-jīvanti.**

Tom, Dick and Harry or anyone in this world, can experience this ānanda which is the pure expansive state and a state of utter nothingness. One is touching that no mind state and is getting the feel of joy. Every experience of happiness is a state where mind for a moment has become empty-rid of its problems, rid of its anxieties, cares and worries. Can sukha be this simple? I fought with the truths of Upaniṣads for two years. That was my struggle. That was my research. Can it be this simple? But every time I tried an experiment using some bhogavastu, sukhānubhava is very much felt by me. I am confident in saying that every one of you will get this experience also. Śāstra puts this as amanībhāva. Gowḍapāda in his kārika (Māṇ.Up.3, Ka.32) of Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad has this beautiful thing to say:

**आत्मसत्यानुबोधेन न सङ्कल्पयते यदा।**

**अमनस्तां तदा याति ग्राह्याभावे तदग्रहम्॥**

**Ātma-satya-anubōdhēna na saṅkalpayatē yadā,**

**amanastāṁ tadā yāti grāhya-abhāvē tat-agraham.**

While modifications of mind stop having realised Self, no mind state is attained due to the absence of graspable phenomenal world.

What is the meaning of realizing yourself?--you have to touch that no-thought state.-you get into that no-mind state. A no-mind state is verily brahma. The śloka from Kaṭha Upaniṣad (2-6-10) is proclaiming this very same truth.

**यदा पञ्चावतिष्ठन्ते ज्ञानानि मनसा सह ।**

**बुद्धिश्च न विचेश्टते तामाहुः परमां गतिम्॥**

**Yadā pañca-avatiṣṭhantē jñānāni manasā saha,**

**buddhiḥ-ca na vicēśṭatē tāmāhuḥ paramāṁ gatim.**

When the five sense organs are not functioning, when the mind is not functioning, when even the buddhi is not functioning, that is your holy state. That is your exalted state. That is your true nature. That is your blissful state. The terminal śloka of that Nārada Sanatkumāra ākhyāyika (Chāndogya Upa 7-24) says-

**यत्र नान्यत्पश्यति नान्यच्छृणोति नान्यद्विजानाति स भूमा॥**

**Yatra na-anyat-paśyati na-anyat-śr̥ṇōti na- anyat-vijānāti sa bhūmā.**

When you do not perceive anything, when you are not hearing anything, when you are not in the knowledge of anything that is your expansive state. The meaning of the word Bhūma is that of vyāpakatva- a state of expansion.

**यो वै भूमा तत्सुखं नाल्पे सुखमस्ति भूमा वै सुखम्॥**

**Yo vai bhūmā tat-sukhaṃ na-alpe sukham-asti bhūmā vai sukham.** (Chāndogya Upa 7-23)

Bhūma state is really the blessed state, the blissful state as against the confined state which is not blissful and profound. Man considers that watching details is the right action. Actually it is ‘alpatva swīkāra’- that is, a constricted state of mind. All the research work that we are into is the work of scrutiny which is a toiling phase. Indriya vyāpāra means capturing details. Bhūma vai sukham- **that let-go state is sukha**. Vedānta is not brainwashing you.

**नापूर्वं वक्षति श्रुतिः**। **Na-pūrvaṁ vakṣati śrutiḥ.**

Śruti** **doesn’t tell you anything that is not within the zone of your experience.

**ज्ञापकमात्रम् हि शास्त्रम्**- **Jñāpaka-mātram hi śāstram -**- Śāstra is but a reminder of whatever you know. Every experience of sukha, is verily a mind in broken state—a decomposed mind---a non functioning mind. In fact, the thought formation forces cannot connect themselves into a thought. What a realization! You see that every joy is an empty state of mind-an expansive state of mind- an **advaitasthiti- अद्वैतस्थिति.**

Even sukha, on examination, reduces itself to a no-mind state. If the frequency moments of sukha are increased very much, you are just nonexistent and the shell is terribly expanded for a moment. This is the same as the state of vistārata described as a remedy to Duḥkha. There is a gradation in Duḥkha state -continuous duḥkha – ati-duḥkha - somewhat duḥkha - very slight duḥkha - the curve reaches a no mind state - you cannot even think further. A further inference of this one, a bigger version of this process, makes one to conclude that, sukha and duḥkha, being separate entities, are interconnected. They are very much like conductivity and resistance. Reciprocal of resistance is conductivity. Reciprocal of conductivity is resistance. Less and less of duḥkha is more and more of sukha.** **Thus there are only two aspects of Duḥkha-

One is the Speed, at thinking centre or cittasthāna (mind centre – Ājñācakra – space between the eye brows). The other is the focussing-which is constant minding, resulting in one pointedness and this is termed as sankocata. This is also termed as a coning phase. In order to overcome these two aspects of duḥkha:



1. Replace speed or Vega by slowness or Naidhānya at the mental level.
2. Replace Sankocata or focussing by diffusion. This is the let go attitude or udāsīna bhāva

Sukha is:

Mind or cittasthāna becomes empty in the moments of happiness derived through agencies. A no mind state is created for a fraction of a moment. Consciously hold on to the no mind state so generated and try to stay there as long as possible, abandoning the agency that gave you the state. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (5-9-43) declares -

**दृश्यदर्शनसम्बन्धे सुखसंविदनुत्तम।**

**दृश्य संवलिता बन्धस्तन्मुक्ता मुक्तिरुच्यते॥**

**Dr̥śya-darśana-sambandhē sukha-saṁvit- anuttama,**

**dr̥śya saṁvalitā bandhaḥ-tan-muktā muktiḥ- ucyatē.**

Born is the happiness when the seer and the seen are in contact. But, it is still bondage when the seer is attached to the seen and it is freedom when detached from it.

I will take up questions from you to sort out any doubts on whatever we discussed till now.

**Q**Does not a material sukha, what you explained now, leads to hankering for more bhoga?

**A.** Yes, but we get a glimpse of that śāṣvata sukha in this bhogasukha. Therefore one has to see this welcome element and stay firm in it and then reject the hankering for bhoga.

**Q**Does** **the peace of mind, as described above relate to viṣayasukha?

**A.** This is another good objection on sukha. But it is that peace of mind that is referred to as sukha in the tradition also. Again the two questions overlap. Actually in our viṣayasukha moment, the penultimate positions are in excitement whereas the real point is in peace. We are tempted to say that this excitement is a sukha element. The penultimate centres are in excited state and therefore one is tempted to conclude sukha carries the element of excitement which is the previous position or the taditarasthāna. The after position or the samīpasthāna is the peaceful expansive state. When we discuss the mechanism of sukha in the next lecture, we will discuss the things involved in the mechanism of bhogasukha and then clarity would come to all of you.

**Q**If we slow down our activity, it will certainly be good, but in the eyes of the people that would look very odd and embarrassing?

**A.** All those things have to be managed of course. When you slow down your activity, it has an effect on the whole system. The system becomes so relaxed that it becomes impossible to do any work at one point of time. One simply wants to spend time in silence. Slowness becomes a point of comfort when these rules are applied. When one centre in the body slows down, every other centre takes the suggestion and slows down.

The other point is this attention business. It is here that a student finds difficulty. He likes to be focussing all the time as it improves the performance. But the truth is otherwise. One may perform better, but one has to pay the price for that effort, which ultimately works on the system itself. Truths cannot change themselves to one’s convenience. The fact is that if one holds on to concentration for a longer time, the system complains. This conclusion doesn’t go well with modern ideas of performance and production. That is what one has to manage. One can't fight against the truth. If the truth is questionable then it is fine. Otherwise the argument does not stand.

I remember one instance when I had to undergo a minor operation. I was waiting in the preparation room and the thing got delayed as the surgeon was very busy performing another major operation. He was a doctor of repute and he had the habit of going through every detail to make sure that things went on well and there should be no cause for failure. This put him under serious focussing. When he came out of the theatre I could see him puff and crash into the sofa and leave a very big sigh of relief. Why did he do that? The body system was saying that he needed rest very badly. That was a very good observation for me and that was a very good case where I could certify the truths of the Upaniṣad-s. Why does one shift from a serious mood to a lighter mood? Why does one get to an act of sipping a cup of coffee after a hard working day? Why does one say that he needs relaxation? The fact shows that serious mood is a state of **suffering**. Lighter mood is a state of contentment or **tṛpti_. _**That’s a proof.

**Q.** Don’t you think we have to do a balancing act because at certain point we have to continue our lives?

**A.** Fine. That is the compromise. Right, but we should appreciate the point that it is necessary to take a break.

**Q.** But that does not mean I stop concentrating. I may be taking a break but I am still in that mood? We cannot stop our attention mood as it is very important in life?

**A.** No. The śāstra is examining facts and their nature. That’s the point. How much of śāstra you will use for your life is another question. That’s a matter of necessity. That’s a matter of the situation or the profession in which you are placed. I am not advising everyone to give up focussing or speed. But one very important point you must remember here is, that when I am talking of speed**it is not the physical speed. It is the internal speed. The speed** **of the mind within** **is thousand times faster than the speed at the physical level.** One has to keep this always in mind when we talk of reducing speed.

**Q.** Is it possible to drop speed when you are focussing?

**A.** Yes, I will add a little more. I told you about that doctor's plight, because that’s a more serious question. Most of the times we tend to seek adjustments, compromise, taking approximate positions. So, whenever focussing is a must, you tag on slowness to it. If you are slow, focussing is acceptable for the system. Slowness can decrease the evil effects of focussing. Any amount of focussing is sustainable when the other element is taken care of, namely slowness. Once you go with the study yourselves, many more truths come out. That’s why everybody would be a teacher on his own once he starts looking inside. That leisureliness will enlarge the shell. Every time you are in the leisurely mood, or the let-go mood, you are an enlarged shell. You are a big sphere. In that sphere if you focus, you are doing that peripherally. We use the word for that, peripheral focussing, and casual focussing. It is a fact. The śāstra uses a very big word to refer to this: udāsīnabhāva, **उदासीनभाव**, anāsaktibhāva, **अनासक्तिभाव**, sākṣībhāva-**सक्षीभाव.**

**Q.** Can focussing be possible when you are in diffused state?

**A.** It is possible. They can co exist. The two can stay concurrently. People say that Vedānta takes one away from one’s profession. It proves again and again that worldly and mundane pursuits do not become hurdles for sukha. Therefore you don’t have to become an ascetic or other worldly. It is a paradox. Defocused focussing means bulk of you, mentally, is positioned in a happy way. A part of you is involved in that mundane process. That is how every jñāni manages. Lord Kṛṣṇa would be most efficient-but very casual, but at the same time very careful in details. So a jñāni need not walk away from life. If he chooses to walk away like Ramaṇa, it is okay, like Rāmakṛṣṇa, it is okay. Performance-wise one can excel the other man who does not know these secrets.

**Q.** If one gets into such a grove of slowing down, will it not affect the overall performance of the person?

**A.** This is exactly the reaction of every group that I meet with. Will the whole technology drop down if every man slows down? Everybody is unnecessarily rubbing too much on the wrong side. Why don’t you live with nature? Environment is safe when you don’t peck and interfere. Really speaking, this is the highest point. We understand that during the days of Kṛutayuga people were so much satisfied that they did not even bother to build a hut for them to live in. What is wrong if that fellow is as happy as the modern man with all this technology around him? We must be able to give this point to the advocates of technology. A fellow who is sitting under the tree is equally happy doing nothing. Then how is he inferior? Point out one defect about that. **Bhartṛhari** in his **Vairāgya Śataka-**वैराग्यशतक (53) -quotes-

**वयमिह परितुष्टा वल्कलैस्त्वं दुकूलैः।**

**सम इह परितोषो निर्विशेषो विशेषः**॥

**Vayam-iha parituṣṭā valkalaiḥ-tvaṁ dukūlaiḥ,**

**sama iha paritōṣō nirviśēṣō viśēṣaḥ.**

A sage comes across a king and develops a conversation. Oh King, you are with your silken garments and I am with my bark garments. If the happiness you have is because of the silk and the happiness I have is because of this crude cloth, how are you superior to me?

What logic! How are you superior to me if both of us are equally happy, you with all your comforts and I with no comforts?

**स तु भवतु दरिद्रो यस्य तृष्णा विशाल। ।**

**मनसि च परितुष्टे कोऽर्थवान् को दरिद्रः** ॥

**Sa tu bhavatu daridrō yasya tr̥ṣṇā viśāla,**

**manasi ca parituṣṭē kō-arthavān kō daridraḥ**.

When the mind is self satisfied how to differentiate a rich man from a poor one? This is the challenge the Indian wise men always had on positions of importance. It is not abhāva-vairāgya.

**Q.** I don’t think that the issue is with the internal happiness vis a vis technology. It should somehow be possible to bridge both. Take the case of Arjuna, who did not want to fight before he heard the message from Kṛṣṇa, afterwards he fought. On the one hand he is peaceful internally and at the same time he has a duty to perform. This is where the problem arises. What is your opinion about this?

**A.** You have to be careful while you apply this knowledge to the society in general. Therefore if the society is different, don’t disturb the society, allow it to have mixed levels. Society must have the benefit of development of technology. A hypothetical question would be as to what happens to civilisation if technology is completely dropped. When everyone is happy with minimum needs, what’s wrong with that one? I wish such a world comes into existence. That was the message of Kṛṣṇa. Of course much discussion has to take place. And another reason why Arjuna was coaxed into karma by Kṛṣṇa was that he was still not fit for taking up a life of a mendicant.

Theoretically one may understand this, but one may not be fit for total vairāgya. At the conceptual level we may appreciate. You can’t deny yourself the study, pursuits, achievements and all that. System transformation doesn’t take place simultaneously with your understanding of concepts. There is a time lag. There is a phase difference. We must wait. Only one person who could succeed totally and suddenly drop activities of the world was Ramaṇa Maharṣi. He realized this point. People made these objections on him and he just laughed at them. Some people choose the vedāntic way of living while others are willing to focus and carry on with work keeping their balance of mind for the benefit of humanity.

**Q.** Arjuna, after he listened to Sri Kṛṣṇa initially was willing to lay down his arms and keep quiet. But the Lord would not allow him. Why?

**A.** Arjuna appreciated the sānkhya ideas, just as we are now appreciating the logic of Vedānta to be true and correct. He appreciated the truths of Vedānta and then he said he would surrender and keep quiet. But Kṛṣṇa knew that Arjuna’s body-mind system was not prepared for that. Simply understanding the truths of the Upaniṣads is not sufficient. The forces within, bhoga-utsāha, karma-utsāha are still operating. I will come to that point when we do ātmāparīkṣa. Therefore his advice to Arjuna was to do karma and expend the unbearable energy.

We know that keeping quiet is the ultimate answer for happiness. But, structurally we are not prepared for that. That is where the idea of karmayoga comes. Karma sanyāsa is recommended as the ultimate position. The next step of compromise or adjustment is karmayoga because we cannot keep quiet. The whole of third and fourth chapters in Bhagavad-Ġīta (3-1) deal with the subject of karma yoga versus karma sanyāsa. Arjuna puts this very question—

**ज्यायसी चेत् कर्मणस्ते मता बुद्धिर्जनार्दन।**

**तत्किं कर्मणि घोरे मां नियोजयसि केशव॥**

**Jyāyasī cēt karmaṇḥ-tē matā buddhiḥ-janārdana,**

**tat-kiṁ karmaṇi ghōrē māṁ niyōjayasi kēśava.**

He asks Kṛṣṇa, ‘Why are you forcing me to the war which is very bad although you know well that knowledge is superior to action?’ He has appreciated this discussion and says that Kṛṣṇa has proved that keeping quiet is all joy. The answer is - Arjuna is not fit for keeping quiet yet.

**Q**: There comes the question of 'expectation'. How do you explain the removal of expectation of returns from action?

**A.** The other point where Vedānta makes a mark is to let that person examine whether he can be happy without doing. Most of us cannot remain so, though logically that position is correct. Even I cannot do that. Why? There is the boredom force acting within, which is driving one to activity. I will come to that in the next lecture when we do ātmaparīkṣa. The reason for anyone who says that he is doing work for so many good causes is that he cannot keep quiet. The proof for this is very simple. If I challenge you to sit quiet for ten minutes without doing anything, you may say that it is very easy. But if I ask you to remain quiet for half an hour, then you fail the test. Why?

Vedānta gives an answer to that point in the **yogaśāstra- योगशास्त्र**. There is what is called a life force, a vital force or **kundaliniśakti- कुण्डलिनीशक्ति**, if you care to use a technical word. It is there at the **mūlādhāra- मूलाधार** and is continuously releasing **sūkṣmaśakti- सूक्ष्मशक्ति** or**prāṇaśakti** into the system, to every part of the body. It flows up into the **ūrdhvasthāna- ऊर्ध्वस्थान**and comes to **ājñācakrasthāna- आज्ञाचक्रस्थान**, where pressure is built up.** **If the rates at which it is produced and expended are not equal, then you develop a pressure. And the pressure so developed drives you into activity. This is the most reasonable explanation.

The proof is very simple. Sit in the house without any work. That is the biggest test, to check whether you are growing in the vedāntic way or not. No wife to talk to. No kitchen where you can go and get some salted cashew nut or anything of that kind. No tape recorder to play music. Sit and try. Try this simple experiment. Everybody in the world fails. Why?

This is the explanation. Continuously energy is being released. Fortunately for man, as quickly as it is released he is expending it. The child cries away its energy. The fool talks away his energy. Man walks away his energy. A clever man thinks away his energy and therefore each one is comfortable. The subtlest burden is the pressure of boredom forces. He is spending this blocked up energy in ever so many ways that the system gets used to it and therefore he is comfortable where as he gives credit to karma, saying that Karma gave him joy. Spending of the energy is the only means by which one is becoming empty at the Ājñācakra. This mechanism is giving him joy and not karma as such.

This is the way we are all happy. Karma is a means of expenditure of this unbearable energy. Once that is spent away we are in the non-doing phase at the ājñācakra. We become empty, that is, we reach the no-mind state called amanībhāva. No activity-state is the point of joy, is the content of joy. This mechanism is giving him joy and not karma as such.

**Q.** Does it divert the energy?

**A.** Yes, incidentally this question is to be answered. If intake of coffee or any other bhogavastu leads to bhogasukha, then why don’t we have more and more of coffee or more and more of bhoga? The answer lies here. Although bhogasukha works by this mechanism, it has a defect as this drifting of the energy, shifting of the energy to the indriyasthāna is only temporary. Every indriya has a limit point. This skill to draw the energy has its limitation. The first sweet is enjoyable, the second sweet is acceptable and the third sweet is repulsive. Even at the cost of annoying the host you say, ‘sorry I cannot take it’, Why? The tongue fails to draw the energy. At that point, the energy goes back into its original place, into its swasthāna and again you are restless. That is the reason why we call the bhogasukha as short lived. When the energy expenditure mechanism to overcome the boredom is overdone, it results in restlessness again. Preceded by a disturbed state, succeeded by a disturbed state and for a small interval of time in-between, the mind quietens. Hence, bhogasukha is short lived.

<u>If you can reduce the creation of energy itself or its release by s</u>ā<u>dhana then the dependence on Bhoga gets dropped and you are in lasting happiness.</u> Then, you can naturally expand your shell. In a small sphere, the amount of thrust or the impulse on the unit area is more. Suppose the sphere is very big, the same thrust or impulse on a much bigger sphere is much smaller. Distributed over a larger area, you don’t feel the burden at all. So, if you apply the rule of naidhānya or apply the principle of vistārata, then the boredom forces are automatically absorbed or dissolved away and you don’t complain. This is a permanent method to be happy. So, a vedāntin is not running away from bhoga for ascetic reasons.

**Q** I appreciate your point very much that parīkṣa of Duḥkha is necessary to come out of it, but why one should do parīkṣa of sukha as it is a glorified state already?

**A.** This parīkṣa is required because we are always experiencing this ānanda. Humans are in continuous touch with the svarūpa, but does not take notice of that one. This is the unfortunate situation of man. He doesn’t know that svarūpasthiti is ānanda. To remove this ignorance, serious study is required. That’s all. The role of bhoga in the experiment is only incidental. Laddoo or the sweet dish or coffee did not carry the principle of ānanda. It is incidental that Laddoo brought about an expansive state inside, an empty state inside. The point of importance is this one. After understanding this point, our attention should get shifted. Our value system should be revised. Bhogavastu has a marginal role. This has necessitated the sādhana actually. Should you struggle for ānanda? The clever sādhaka on the other hand uses the bhoghavastu as a means to get the glimpse of brahmasukha, drops bhogavastu and holds on to the sukha only.

**Q**Is puruşārtha not necessary-then?

**A**. That’s the trouble with all the people. People have mystified the whole thing. I can give you hundreds of stanzas to show that this is the ultimate. It is very clear in Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa—

**यन्मनो विलयं याति तद्विष्णोः परमं पदम्**।

**Yanmanō vilayaṁ yāti tat-viṣṇōḥ paramaṁ padam.**

What is viṣṇupada - vaikuṇṭa? Yatra manaḥ vilayaṁ yāti -where mind gets extinguished that is svarūpa. That is puruśārtha. That is mokṣa. This stanza, Yatra manaḥ vilayaṁ yāti tadviṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ.—does not refer to the vaikuṇṭa with seven doors, Jaya and Vijaya keeping guard of that one etc. Yatra manaḥ -where mind is absent, that is vaikuṇṭa.

**Q** When thought is formed in the mind, there is no differentiation whether it is thought for happiness or otherwise. Then where is the thoughtless mind?

**A**. What happens in the bhogasukha is that there is an excitement co existing with peace. Therefore we are tempted to say that happiness is that excitement. Really speaking, there are two overlapping parameters. If you disassociate them, the real point of contribution, which is the ‘peace element’, comes to the fore. I will dwell on the topic of how Bhogasukha brings about peace in my next lecture.

**Q** Śankara says that bhogasukha gives a glimpse of brahmānanda. Don’t you think bhoga is excitement and where is ānanda there?

**A.** Content wise they are identical. The doṣa about bhogasukha is, that it is short lived. With the withdrawal of bhoga, again you come back to the objective world of seeking. That’s the doṣa. This point I will take up in detail in the next lecture-the mechanism involved in bhogasukha, what is the erroneous element and how to make a correction of that.

Thank you for listening.



## AVASTHĀ-TRAYA-PARĪKṣĀ 
(EXAMINATION OF THREE STATES OF EXISTANCE)

We shall do a revision on whatever we discussed in these lectures so that they remain fresh in your minds. Recapitulation is fine as it strengthens the thought pattern and sets deep rooted in your minds.We have found that Vedānta can give a solvable approach to the problems of various facets of our life. We found that there are two sides. One is the ritualistic side. Distinguished from this, you have the Parīkṣa side or the investigation side. Two routes of investigation were suggested - one is Sukha-Duḥkha-parīkṣa and the other is ātmāparīkṣa. In the first one, you do the investigation on the involved question or the involved issue which we covered exhaustively. Equally productive is the other method- ātmaparīkṣa - suggestion to examine the self, to understand one’s true nature. In fact śāstra recommends this parīkṣa more often. Most of the scholars or most of the traditional Vedāntic literature emphasises on ātmaparīkṣa. In my previous lecture I had mentioned about the discussion found in Bṛhahadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad between Yajñavalkya and his two wives Kātyāyani and Maitrēyi. When** **Maitrēyi asks the husband to show her the way for everlasting happiness, he says that the only way is to find out one’s true nature.

**आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यो मन्तव्यो निदिध्यासितव्यो मैत्रेयि ।**

**Ātmā vā arē draṣṭavyō mantavyō**

**nididhyāsitavyō Maitrēyi.** (Bṛh. Upa, 2-4-5)

Oh Maitrēyi, SELF is to be heard of, contemplated upon and get established into.

You must rightly understand your true nature and then try to stay there. That’s the way to come out of sorrow. Every Upaniṣad has a method of investigation called **Prakriyā - प्रक्रिया**. Prakriya is a logical framework, a logical structuring, by which you can understand your real nature. A style of thinking which ultimately puts you into your true nature is called a prakriya. Every Upaniṣad has at least one prakriya. Prakriya is the juice of the Upaniṣad. That’s the key point. Some of the Upaniṣad-s carry more than one prakriya. Let us take up two such Prakraiya-s for our discussion. Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad offers the prakriya called **Avasthātraya Parīkṣā - अवस्थात्रयपरीक्षा**. Taittirīya Upaniṣad offers the prakriya called the **Pancakośa Viveka- पञ्चकोशविवेक**. We will discuss them one after the other.

Tradition holds the Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad in very high esteem for the reason that in four mantras the entire discussion on the subject gets to a conclusion. You are yet to see brevity of that order in scientific regions. In fact, the Upaniṣad is held so high in parampara that a student who is serious about enlightenment is directed to go to Māṇḍūkya.

**एकं माण्डूक्यमेव अलं मुमुक्षूणां विमुक्तये।**

**Ēkaṁ māṇḍūkyam-ēva alaṁ mumukṣūṇāṁ vimuktayē**.** **Muktikopaniṣad

If a person is very serious about liberation, all that he has to do is to study Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad to clear all his doubts. That is the importance with which tradition places Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad. The Upaniṣad straight away goes into depths of human existence. After extolling Omkāra, the Upaniṣad goes to affirm that everything in this universe is Brahma.

**सर्वं ह्येतद्ब्रह्म अयमात्मा ब्रह्म सोऽयमात्मा चतुष्पात्**।

**Sarvaṁ hi-ētat-brahma ayam-ātmā brahma sa-ayam-ātmā catuṣpāt.**  (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad  2)

**sarvaṁ hi ētat brahma -**All this is Brahma. Let us understand this technically. There is a Causal stuff which is single and unique and that has become this Jagat - this Universe.

**ayam ātmā brahma -**I am also Brahma-This ‘Me’ is also Brahma.

A thought which came to my mind that ‘sarvam hi ētat Brahma’ includes ‘ayam ātmā Brahma’. This repetition seems to be redundant. I was wondering as to why the Śruti is repeating the phrases.

Śankara observes this and gives an explanation and an answer for this ambiguity. This is the point where science and Vedānta differ. We are all academicians and think in a very simple way. Scientists think that the origin of this universe can be got by understanding this existence externally. Whereas, Indian thinking or Vedāntic approach suggests that the Causal Stuff of this universe can be realised only by studying the inside of ourselves. There is no way of getting to the causal stuff by a study of the outside world and this is the set premise in Vedānta.

Śankara however makes a point here. Why did the Indian thinkers go inwards to find the origin of this universe? Why did they not go outwards as the physicist is tempted to go? If we can get a satisfactory answer to this one, we have made big strides. These activities or these entities of the external world are inflexible. These bull forces which are mutually acting, for example, shining of the Sun, blowing of the wind, cloud formation due to evaporation etc are all rigid having no flexibility. All these activities are mechanical in nature and thus they are inflexible forces.

But the forces within us on the contrary have malleability and flexibility. One can manipulate the inside forces. One can manipulate to be fast or slow or remain stationery. By a mere suggestion that one should be quiet, one becomes quiet. Where from these activities arise? One can do an experiment inside and soften them to their source. This is Śankara's position.

**प्रत्यगात्मतया एव ब्रह्म ग्राह्यम् नान्यथा ।**

**Pratyagātmatayā ēva brahma grāhyam na anyathā.**Śankarabhāṣya.

This causal stuff of the universe cannot be grasped by the study of the outside. I am sure the physicist will come to the point of deadlock one day and turn to eastern ways. They have already started recognising the importance of observer in experimental physics. Because of the role of the observer, observations become defective. He disturbs the phenomena and there is no way by which one can avoid this observer. The scientists have come to that position of impasse. Śāstra recognizes this point. One can retrace these steps as far as the inside forces are concerned. That is what I am doing, called **nāḍiśuddhi prāṇāyāma - नाडिशुद्धि प्राणायाम**. Slow down the inner forces until you touch the origin. Such a manipulation is possible inside- not possible outside. Therefore the manipulation of the activities inside is a convenient method for understanding the source of the universe. Some of the physicists appreciated this point in those international conferences where in I had to enforce this point because it makes a reference at the basic level itself. We will now continue with the ātmaparīkṣa**.**

**Sa-ayam-ātmā catuṣpāt** - That ‘I’ (that Me- ātmā-Brahma-Self) has four components. Let us see the first component.

**जागरितस्थानः बहिष्प्रज्ञः सप्ताङ्ग एकोनविंशतिमुखः स्थूलभुग्वैश्वानरः प्रथमः पादः।**

**Jāgarita-sthānaḥ bahiḥ-prajñaḥ sapta-aṅga ēkōnaviṁśati mukhaḥ sthūla-bhuk-vaiśvānaraḥ prathamaḥ pādaḥ.     (**Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 3)** **

He is identified as **Vaiśvānara.** His sphere of activity is the Waking State**.** He is conscious of the external world of objects. He has seven limbs and nineteen outlets. He enjoys the gross objects of the world. The nineteen outlets of the waking state are – the five organs of perception, the five organs of action, the five aspects of our vital breath – Prāṇa (Prāṇa, Apāna, Vyāna, Samāna, and Udāna), the Mind, the Intellect, Egoity (Ahankāra) and Citta. If any one of them is missing, our experience of the world shall, to that degree, become imperfect. In the waking state, we are outwardly conscious and are enjoying gross objects of the world through the above gateways.

Let us not worry about the details as they are not very important to our study. This is one aspect of me which is called Jāgṛth Avastha. I have a world outside of me, the details of which I can capture through the five sense organs. I am a perceiver of the outside world. Having perceived, I apply likes and dislikes such as-this is a good carpet that is a bad carpet, he is a fine person, he is not a fine person, etc. These are called rāga-dveṣa. Having perceived the world outside of me, I begin to choose and select. This facet of mine is called **Jñātṛtva - ज्ञातृत्व** –the knower's capacity, the seer's capacity.

Having applied my selection, to get what I want and avoid what I do not want, I work towards that. This facet of mine is called **Kartṛtva - कर्तृत्व**, the doer ship.

Having chosen and worked, I want to enjoy the fruits of my so doing. This facet of mine is **Bhoktṛtva - भोक्तृत्व**, the capacity to enjoy.

Jnātṛtva, bhoktṛtva, kartṛtva - this is ‘Me’ in my Jāgṛth.

I do not think that even a scientist can simplify to this degree of accuracy. My tens of thousands of activities have been brought down now to three terms - **I am a perceiver, am emotionally** **involved and a doer**. Millions of my activities have been condensed into three terms, that’s a brilliant scientific performance even by today's standards. This is what Vedānta does. Thus one who enjoys the external world as above in his waking state, is called as **Sthūlabhuk-** **स्थूलभुक्** - enjoyer of gross objects. He is also otherwise called as Vaiśvānara in this state. This is the first state of ‘I’ – the wakeful state – **Jāgarita- Sthāna - जागरितस्थान.**  The second state of ‘I’ is:

**स्वप्नस्थानोऽन्तःप्रज्ञः सप्ताङ्ग एकोनविंशतिमुखः प्रविविक्तभुक्तैजसो द्वितीयः पादः।**

**Svapna-sthānaḥ-antaḥ-prajñaḥ sapta-aṅga ēkōnaviṁśatimukhaḥ pravivikta-bhuk-taijasō dvitīyaḥ pādaḥ.** (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 4.)

His second state is called as **Taijasa.** His sphere of activity is Dream State. He is conscious of internal world of objects. He has seven limbs and nineteen outlets. He enjoys the subtle objects of the inner world. This state is called as Svapna State**.**

This Dream State is the same as the first one (Jāgṛt-Avastha) but the difference being that you are seeing inside where as in the first state you are seeing outside. Now, there is an inside world, the dream world, exactly a replica of the Jāgṛt with all the details. This is the world of your own making. In this world, you fail in an examination although you have passed the same in the Jagṛt phase forty or fifty years ago- you may walk twenty miles and still are not tired. So you have another phase of existence where the region of perception is different from that of the first phase but the experiences are common to both the phases. Even in this phase, you perceive things, you involve emotionally and you are a doer here also.

We have by now understood our two states of existence i.e., wakeful State and dream State. Nothing big has come out of such a study. We are sufferers both in Jāgṛt and Svapna States.

However, we have one more state which is generally missed by us. It is neither wakeful State nor the dream State. That third state of existence of ours (Or that ‘**I**’) is called **Dreamless Sleep State.**Psychology has given least importance to this state whereas Vedānta gives all the importance. It's an experience which the world takes no notice of. The whole study of Vedānta is built on this one experience without which there is no Vedānta at all. So, in this phase, there is neither transaction of the outside world nor transaction of the inside world. This “I” also has experience of this deep sleep. This state is beautifully defined in Upaniṣad as:

**यत्र सुप्तो न कञ्चन कामं कामयते न कञ्चन स्वप्नं पश्यति तत्सुषुप्तम् ।    (**Māṇḍ Upa. 5.)

**Yatra suptō na kañcana kāmaṁ kāmayatē na kañcana svapnaṁ paśyati tat-suṣuptam.**

That is the state of deep sleep wherein the sleeper (that ‘I’) does not yearn for any desires nor does he see any dreams – That is the third state of the ‘I’ – **Suśupti**–** **Dreamless Sleep.

No scientist could have given a better definition to the sleeping state. In this state there are no thoughts, no emotions no cognition, no emotional involvement, no work. The karmendriyā-s are resting, the jnānedriyā-s are resting, the talk centre is resting, and the mind is also not there. None of the three lakṣaṇā-s, Jñātṛtva, kartṛutva and bhokṛutva which are found in the jāgṛt and in the svapna phase are seen here. Well, definition wise it is alright, what is so big about it?

One can feel that in Jāgṛt or waking state he is transacting with what is best for him while in deep sleep he is doing nothing. But, as per Vedānta one cannot belittle this state which is the best and richest experience of man. The deep sleep state is clearly described in the Upaniṣad as:

**सुषुप्तस्थान एकीभूतः प्रज्ञानघन एवानन्दमयो ह्यान्दभुक्चेतोमुखः प्राज्ञस्तृतीयः पादः॥**

**Suṣupta-sthāna ēkībhūtaḥ prajñāna-ghanaḥ ēva-ānandamayō hi-ānanda-bhuk-cētōmukhaḥ prājñaḥ tr̥tīyaḥ pādaḥ.**(Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad  3)** **

This ‘I’ is called **Prājñā.** Here, in deep sleep, all experiences become undifferentiated. He is verily a homogeneous mass of consciousness in entirety. He is full of bliss and enjoying bliss and whose door is conscious wisdom – This is the third state of the ‘I’**–** called as Suśupti- Dreamless Sleep**.**

In the jāgṛt or svapna state your enjoyment gives you only a fraction of ānanda, but in Suśupti state you are eating ānanda itself. What a beautiful metaphor! Bhuk means eater, enjoyer. Ānandabhuk means eater of ānanda itself. Ānandamayaḥ means ānanda personified. Given this extra information, you cannot take the sleep state in a light way. It is valuable because, your very question is tackled here. There is a ready answer to your starting question - your search for joy.

In nidrā you have no objects of enjoyment. You are not walking with your girlfriend. You are not having your ice cream stuffed with nuts, no vanilla, none of these things, no word of compliment, no word of flattery, and no company. You shine in your native glory. Happiness is not outside. You are yourself a mass of happiness. That is a fact born out of your own experience. Generally, when one misses one night’s sleep, it does not bother him much. But, one gets disturbed with more number of sleepless nights. One starts worrying and even becomes desperate. So desperate that he consults a doctor for a sleeping pill! Why this sort of urge? Should not the serious thinker study this aspect more comprehensively? What fresh information about the source of joy! Whatever conclusions we made in our sukhaparīkṣa, are the very conclusion that are available to us here in ātmaprīksha. <u>Non-doing is the essence of joy.</u> In nidrā, you are utterly in non-doing state. The limbs are resting, the talk centre is resting, the jñānendriyā-s - the sense organs are resting, and the mind is also resting. There is no activity at any functional centre whatsoever. And that must be the cause for Ānanda.

If the constituents of nidrā are these and nidrā is a very happy state, then the constituents of nidrā must be responsible for that happiness. That is simple logic. What are the constituents of nidrā? **na kañcana kāmaṁ kāmayatē na kañcana svapnaṁ paśyati - न कञ्चन कामं कामयते न कञ्चन स्वप्नं पश्यति ।** There are neither thoughts nor emotions. You have a definition of sukha once again. It is proved by experience that involvement is not sukha whereas non involvement is sukha. If the world were to appreciate this point, the whole civilization, takes a new turn. You don’t require anything for joy. You are yourselves a stuff of joy. When you stay in non-doing state, the triad- knower, knowing and the known - have completely collapsed. The knower himself is out of scene, but still exists

That’s the entire lesson you draw from the nidrā experience. So what is the lesson? This is how I put it: if you can incorporate the qualities of nidrā into jāgṛt, you have the solution. Commenting on Nidrā, Bṛhahādaraṇyaka Upaniṣad (4-3-22) goes to poetic heights. It explains as to what happens to everyone during the phase of Nidrā.

**अत्र माता अमाता भवति पिता अपिता भवतिस्तेनो अस्तेनो भवति भ्रूणहा अभ्रूणहा भवति अनन्वागतं पुण्येन अनन्वागतं पापेन तीर्णो हि तदा सर्वाञ्छोकान्हृदयस्य भवति.**

**Atra mātā amātā bhavati pitā apitā bhavati stēnō astēnō bhavati bhrūṇahā abhrūṇahā bhavati ananvāgataṁ puṇyēna ananvāgataṁ pāpēna tīrṇō hi tadā sarvān-śōkān-hr̥dayasya bhavati.**

Aatra māta amāta bhavati. What are you here in jagṛt? You are burdened with your motherhood. Oh, this child doesn’t eat. This child overeats. He is indifferent to studies. He is a bookworm**.**Whereas in nidrā, she is rid of the motherly cares.

Pitā apitā bhavati. The father has come out of his responsibilities, rid of his fatherly responsibilities, fatherly cares, and fatherly duties.

Steno a-steno bhavati -Similarly you are also free from your wrong side. The thief has lost his thief hood.

Bhrūṇaḥ abhrūṇaḥ bhavati - Killing the embryo in those days was a very big sin. A sinner who kills the embryo has come out of his sin in sleep.

Ananvāgatam puṇyena- ananvāgatam pāpena -  not pursued by your virtuous calls, not pursued by your sinful calls.

Tīrṇo bhavati tadā sarvān śokān hṛdayasya- You have crushed the ocean of duḥkha. All possible worries, anxieties, lurking inside the mind have disappeared. One has come out of them.

**एषाऽस्य परमा गतिरेषाऽस्य परमा सम्पदेषोऽस्य परमो लोक एषोऽस्य परम आनन्द एतस्यैवाऽऽनन्दस्यान्यानि भूतानि मात्रामुपजीवन्ति॥**

**Ēṣaḥ-asya paramā gatiḥ-ēṣāḥ-asya paramā sampadḥ-ēṣaḥ-asya paramō lōka ēṣaḥ-asya parama ānanda ētasya-ēva-ānandasya-anyāni bhūtāni mātrām-upajīvanti.** (Bṛh. Upa. 4-3-32)



* This is your happiest state.
* This is the highest state to be achieved.
* This is your highest way of existence.
* All the creatures in the universe sustain and survive only because of an iota of this bliss.

By taking a lesson from this one and living rest of your life in obedience to this truth, how can you be miserable?

May be a very dreadful proposition, but that’s the true proposition for complete happiness. That’s the essence of vedānta. The truth cannot change to your convenience. Your value systems must be revised in conformity with the truth. It cannot be the other way because truth is truth. If a person appreciates this logic, he comes out of duḥkha. What one has to do from now on? Nothing can touch one because one can afford to be that way. What prevents one from being that way in the wakeful state? Although nearly half of your lifetime is spent in nidrā state, you are unwilling to evaluate that. What a tragedy with man!-wonders the śāstra. You have the answer to the problem of suffering this way.

Nobody can say that he got lost when he went in to sleep and a new person came on the scene when he woke up. That would be absurd, as it is a continuity of the self. In nidrā there is only prāṇa vyāpāra. Karmendriyā-s are not functioning, Jñānendriyā-s are not functioning, talk centre is not working, and Citta is not doing anything. For this reason one must be happy. Whatever are the ingredients of Nidrā must be the factors responsible for that joy, obviously. Nidrā is non dual and blissful state. It is any body's admission. Thus a no mind state is the common factor we have arrived at while doing the Sukha-Duḥkha Parīkṣā as well as Nidrā Parīkṣā.

**Q.** Can a man ever be zero inside?

**A.** It is a very intricate question. I have a model for liberation, where I have the convenience of calculus language. There is nothing like a zero function at all to me. Mukti is not ‘non doing’ utterly - we both agree that anything less than one divided by ten to the power of ten is negligible. If the softness obtained is of that order, then it is liberation. Each R̥ṣi is liberated, if there is a line of activity less than that permitted agreed line. Then, nothing bothers them and they are comfortable. But there can be spandana vyatyāsa. But, the spandana is so less that they don’t complain at all. So, that is mukti. This is the calculus language I worked out. According to me, this is a better method of understanding mukti. Then you can explain how a feeble spandana-Īśvara, otherwise a non doing thing, start creating. If Brahma is defined as utter non doing, then the question arises as to how can doing come from non doing? How can opposite qualities be related in the janya-janaka sambandha? How can darkness produce light? How can non motion produce motion? This is the difficulty with the classical model.

Whereas in our model Brahma is not a total inactive principle (avyāpāra) as the tradition puts it. But it is atyalpa spandana that can magnify. You see the convenience of Calculus which gave me happier position in understanding Brahma. I suggested this to many scientists who appreciated this model. Bhṛgu is different from persons like Dūrvāsa with regard to their levels of citta samādhāna but they are beyond duḥkha because their citta had achieved an optimum degree of samādhāna. Even with us if there is an increase of ten percent of the samādhāna, we stop complaining. Twenty percent samādhāna makes us to drop the complaining nature. That means, time is beautiful, life is beautiful, time passes sweetly, then there could be a state of mahā samādhi. Rāmakṛṣṇa is different from Ramaṇa. Rāmakṛṣṇa was more participating, but Ramaṇa was the opposite of it. He would talk only when a question was put. Otherwise there was total silence. So, hundreds of mukthā-s could be accommodated with variation in their levels of vyāpāra within this calculus model. <u>Nidra</u>, the non doing state of mind is glorified in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad  (4-3-19) as follows:

**तद्यथास्मिन्नाकाशे श्येनो वा सुपर्णो वा विपरिपत्य श्रान्तः संहत्य पक्षौ संलयायैव घ्रियते एवमेवायं पुरुष एतस्मा अन्ताय धावति यत्र सुप्तो न कंचन कामं कामयते न कंचन स्वप्नं पश्यति ॥**

**Tat-yathā-asmin-ākāśē śyēnō vā suparṇō vā viparipatya śrāntaḥ saṁhatya pakṣau saṁlayāyaiva ghriyatē ēvam ēva ayaṁ puruṣa ētasmā antāya dhāvati yatra suptō na kaṁcana kāmaṁ kāmayatē na kaṁcana svapnaṁ paśyati.**

It explains this aspect very beautifully, śyeno vā_ _suparṇo vā, Viparipatya - a big bird, flying and flying and flying …_ _śrāntaḥ- tired of beating its wings, svanīḍam_ _viśati - wings reaches to rest in its nest, and becomes empty.

Śankara in his Bhāṣya on the above comments as:

**यथा जागृत्स्वप्नयोः‍ जीवस्य पक्षिणः परिपतनजः इव श्रमः भवति । तत् श्रम अपनुत्तये संसारधर्म विलक्षणम्**

**क्रियाकारकफल आयास शून्यम् स्वामात्मानम् विशति ।**

**Yathā jāgṛt svapnayoḥ jīvasyapakśinaḥ paripatanjaḥ iva śramaḥ bhavati.**

**tat śrama apanuttayē saṁsāradharma vilakṣaṇam kriyākārakaphala āyāsa śūnyam svāmātmānam viśati.**

Yatha- like wise,

jāgṛt svapnayoḥ- jīvasya pakṣiṇaḥ paripatanajaḥ iva śramaḥ bhavati- in the very same way , this Jīva, this sufferer both in the jāgṛt and svapna phase always doing and cognising, emotionally becomes tired.

tat śrama apanuttaye samsāra dharma vilakṣaṇam kriyā kāraka phala āyāsa śoonyam swam ātmānam viśati.--to come out of this toiling phase, one comes to the sleep state.

How apt is this comparison! What a metaphor! While we think that we should give value to work or achievement, Śāstra says that one must give value to the sleep phase without which man would have become lunatic, crazy, if he were not alternating between these two phases. This nidrā phase is the recouping phase. You have a dip into this ānanda, strengthened by that, reinforced by that, refreshed by that, you are able to work again. What is the lesson? Even in the wakeful state, if you can always be that way as if you are untouched by details and you are in that expansive state with leisurely activity, then you have attained peace of mind.

Further, nobody can say that he was non-existent in the sleep phase and a new person came the next day. That would be the most ridiculous conclusion. In fact, at one place if one has left his pen or his spectacles, next day he gets them back from the same place. This is the continuity of existence. The fellow who was non-existent for all practical purposes, during nidrā, the very same fellow is there for all of us to see the next day.

Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad describes <u>the fourth state-TURĪYA</u> as-

**प्रपञ्चोपशमं शान्तं शिवमद्वैतं चतुर्थं मन्यन्ते॥**

**Prapañca-upaśamaṁ śāntaṁ śivam-advaitaṁ caturthaṁ manyantē.** (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad  7)

The end of evolution, peaceful, non-dual is deemed as the fourth state of ‘I’. This fourth state is also called **Turīya.**

**स आत्मा स विज्ञेयः - sa ātmā sa vijñēyaḥ**

 (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣat 7)** **

That is SELF. Why don’t you discover this aspect of You?

You know there are four states of existence viz Jāgṛt, Svapna, Suśupti, and Turīya. Now what is Turīya? Nidrā incorporated into the Jāgṛt phase is Turīya. Turīya is no mystery- na kañcana kāmam kāmayate-no emotions - na kañcana svapnam paśyati- no planning, scheming, thinking - thoughts are absent, emotions are absent. If you are able to bring in the qualities of Nidrā into Jāgṛt phase, you are always happy. Can action go on in such a state is the question. It can very well go on as we do not go away from work. Once you know this point most of you can be in the expansive state which is carefree and unconcerned. This can happen as if it is a reflex action. We do not have to volitionally do anything. While walking you do not say next step, it just goes on sequential, although bulk of me is resting. Co-existence of the nidrā dharma inside and vyāpāra outside is possible. Then you are a Jeevan Mukta. Then your efficiency increases. A Vedāntin is more efficient in his work. Arjuna became more efficient, Rāma came back to kingship. This is what we refer to as- sākṣī bhāva, udāsina bhāva, anāsakti bhāva. Activities can go on without involvement. You take the attitude of **‘let go’**, but functions can go on. While talking of three guṇās and their divisions Lord Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna in Bhagavad-Gīta (3-28)

**तत्त्ववित्तु महाबाहो गुणकर्मविभागयोः।**

**गुणागुणेषु वर्तन्त इति मत्वा न सज्जत** ॥

**Tattvavittu mahābāhō guṇa-karma-vibhāgayōḥ,**

**guṇā-guṇēṣu vartanta iti matvā na sajjata**.

He, who knows about the classification of the Guṇā-s and their respective functions, understands that the qualities of sense organs move amidst qualities of sense objects is not attached to the actions**.**

I can talk, I can transact, and I can walk ten miles, while the citta is zero. A mechanical work does not require brain or the thinking portion. Śāstra says manage it that way, life will be beautiful, charming, and every one can do that.

How Nidrā is different from Turīya? The answer is, in Nidrā you are not liberated, you are not yet Brahman, you are not pure ātman, because you come back from nidrā into jāgṛt Avastha. That means the forces operating in Jāgṛt must be there in the seed form in Nidrā. (Māṇ. Upa.1-Kā.13)

**द्वैतस्याग्रहणं तुल्यमुभयोः प्राज्ञतुर्ययोः।**

**बीजनिद्रायुतः प्राज्ञः सा च तुर्ये न विद्यते॥**

**Dvaitasya-agrahaṇaṁ tulyam-ubhayōḥ prājña- turyayōḥ,**

**Bīja-nidrāyutaḥ prājñaḥ sā ca turyē na vidyatē.**

Non-cognition of duality is common to the Prājñā and Turīya. But Prājñā is associated with the causal state of sleep, and that does not exist in Turīya. This is the difference between Nidrā and turīya. Nidrā carries the Jāgṛt forces in a seed form, in a potential form, in latent form. They are not eliminated. Gauḍapāda makes a beautiful point. Though non doing is a common factor between nidrā and turīya, there is a difference. There is a residue in nidrā which is absent in turīya. That is why you come back. All the forces are there intact, like hunger, jealousy, etc., and none of the forces were eliminated there; they are existing in seed form.

When you go to nidrā, you have not tackled the forces at all. It is possible to tame and dissolve consciously the forces by softening. One can soften even the respiration rate. In nidrā there is cittalaya and in turīya there is cittanāśa. It has taken the form of mere vibrations instead of specific vibrations like seeing, listening, talking and all that has become mere prāṇic activity. A specific form is replaced by a general prāṇic activity. <u>In turīya, even the general prāṇic activity is diffused. You diffuse into everywhereness, there is no spandana at all, that is the difference – This is known as cittanāśa.</u>

**Q.** Nature has given all the means of comfort for people to enjoy and people in turn help the nature to sustain the balance. Thus I feel it is necessary for one to use them and one cannot sit quiet without using them. What do you think?

**A.** That is our notion, that’s our belief. But, what do you say to this experience which is part of you? How can you turn this down? What's your logic? It is so glaring that nothing extraordinary is required for one to be in a state of ānanda. If this is the problem with you, then the śāstra says that this human problem is due to lack of parīkṣā having made wrong conclusions about things you are suffering.

**Q.** But we are not ready yet as we are bound by vāsanās?

**A.** Yes, all that we accept.

**Q.** But the quietness what you try to achieve makes you more inert, more lazy and all that?

**A.** Remove that aspect. If you can bring the qualities of nidrā into jāgṛt, you are a liberated person. But you are asking me a funny question - Do you want me to be continuously in sleep? The answer is – be consciously indifferent (sleep like state) to all the external activities in the wakeful state. The normal sleep which is not under your control is defective in the sense you have no mastery over that. You cannot wilfully go to sleep. Something drags you to sleep where as you can wilfully sit and empty the mind in the jāgṛt phase. These are the words for that- Conscious sleep- Volitional sleep - Ajādya nidrā as śāstra puts it - awakened nidrā – Jāgrannidrā - calculated sleep - self managed sleep. The indriyā-s are not corrupted. They are readily available, but you don’t put them to work. Every person has to find out for him or herself the level at which he/she can practice this depending on the maturity of his/her sādhana, but first of all we have to appreciate the Indian thinkers for the announcement of this truth. Can any scientific mind object to the conclusions made out in the Upaniṣad-s?

**Q.**How can we differentiate between Bhogasukha and nidrā?

**A.** That is exactly the Indian way of thinking. You are prepared to exchange any bhogasukha to nidrā. Suppose we look at an alternative for one to be happy. Just sit quiet with the innocence of a child, with nothingness inside. Śankara, commenting on happiness in the Sādhana Pañcaka, (Śloka 5) concludes very clearly:

**एकान्ते सुखमास्यताम् परतरे चेतस्समाधीयताम् ।**

**Ēkāntē sukham-āsyatām paratarē cētaḥ- samādhīyatām.**

Very simple. Just sit wherever you are. Just sit and empty the mind. Ēkānte sukahamāsyatāṁ, means simply stay put. Difficult, I agree. Can we find fault with this value system and with this hint from the Upaniṣads for global civilization? Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen recently said that the poorest country in this part of the world is the happiest one because they apply this vedāntic finding. There are statistical rigorous scientific findings. So where does happiness lie?

**Q.**Why was this truth which is so simple to adopt was hibernating these many years? Why has it not seen the light of the day?

**A.** Very good question. Because, it is difficult to follow/practice. The point one has to bear in mind is that the truth must be accepted. Secondly, one has to enter into sādhana phase. Life's value systems must change. Life's habits must change. That’s the important question. Don’t think that in India everybody is this way. That’s making a wrong conclusion. Most of the people in that country also are after materialism. Everyone in that country, given a chance wants to come to America because this is a country of plenty. But the society at large must appreciate this wisdom and they should be the path setters. If the intellectuals were to appreciate and adopt them in their lifestyle, then the ordinary people will automatically follow. **Mahājanāḥ yena gatāḥ sa** **eva panthāḥ** - **महाजना: येन गता: स** **एव पन्था:।**The average person treads on the path set by noble people.

We shall take up another prakriya, Pancakośa Viveka, in our next lecture and see how it takes us to deeper levels of understanding our true nature.


## PANCA KOŚA VIVĒKA 
(KNOWLEDGE OF FIVE SHEATHS OF EXISTANCE)

Another equally important prakriya about understanding the ‘self’ isbeautifully explained in Taittirīya Upaniṣad and it is quite interesting. We will now deliberate on this prakriya as it is called as Pañca-kośa-viveka which is contained in the Bhṛguvalli (2) of the said Upaniṣad.

**भृगुर्वै वारुणिः वरुणं पितरं उपससार अधीहि भगवो ब्रह्मेति ॥**

**Bhr̥gurvai vāruṇiḥ varuṇaṁ pitaraṁ upasasāra adhīhi bhagavō brahmēti.**

There is seeker called Bhṛgu. He goes to his teacher who is also his father by name Varuṇa.What question he goes with?** **Master, give me the wisdom of the self; tell me about the self or the causal stuff of the universe.

**तस्मा एतत्प्रोवाच अन्नम् प्राणं चक्षुः श्रोत्रं मनो वाचमिति॥**

**Tasmā ētat-prōvāca annam prāṇaṁ cakṣuḥ śrōtraṁ manō vācam-iti.**

The Teacher Varuṇa told his disciple that Food, i.e., the body (Śarīra), Vital Force which operates inside the body, the tools of cognising, i.e., eyes, ears, mind, etc., are the doors to realize brahman.

**यतो वा इमानि भूतानि जायन्ते। येन जातानि जीवन्त। यत्प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्ति। तद्विजिज्ञासस्व। तद्ब्रह्मेति॥**

**Yatō vā imāni bhūtāni jāyantē, yēna jātāni jīvanti, yat-prayanti-abhisaṁviśanti, tat- vijijñāsasva, tat-brahma-iti.**

The Teacher gives the most scientific definition of Brahman or the ultimate reality or the Causal stuff of the Universe as -whatever is the causal stuff from whichthis world is born, whatever sustains this universeand in whatever stuff into which the world dissolves,that is Brahma.

This is an excellent definition according to cosmology or even according to theoretical physics. Then the teacher asks the student to sit and do tapas (meditate)-that means the teacher doesn’t give the ultimate truth because the student does not gain by simply listening to the truth. Investigation by the person alone would open the door to the answer. Truth had to be discovered, only then it would become valuable.Then the student after deliberation within himself comes to the following conclusion-

**अन्नं ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात्। अन्नाद्ध्येव खल्विमानि भूतानि जायन्ते। अन्नेन जातानि जीवन्ति। अन्नं यत्प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्तीति॥**

**Annaṁ brahma-iti vyajānāt, annāt-hi-ēva khalu- imāni bhūtāni jāyantē, annēna jātāni jīvanti, annaṁ yat-prayanti-abhisaṁviśanti-iti.**

The student understood that this body is "I" and is called as anna. Anna (the food)** **is brahma, because all living things originate from anna-lives because of anna and return to the same anna. The teacher neither accepts his word nor suggests any answer but sends him back to investigate again. “By intense thinking seek Brahman”.

**तपसा ब्रह्म विजिज्ञासस्व। तपो ब्रह्मेति।**

**Tapasā brahma vijijñāsasva, tapō brahma-iti.**

It is at this point we should also make a study as to why the R̥ṣi sent back his student to study further. If I were this body, then after death no one should feel sorry for me because this body is very much present here. Śankara, in his Bhajagovindaṁsays that even the wife of that person who is dead, is afraid of that body-gatavati_ _vayou_ _prāṇāpāye_ _bhāryā_ _bibhyati_ _tasmin_ _kāye _–**गतवति वायौ प्राणापाये भार्या बिभ्यति तस्मिन् काये।**_ that means even the woman who was so intimate when the person was alive feels that the body should be disposed off as quickly as possible. Why? The wife did not see the husband in the body. She saw the husband only in the living body when the body had life.  Why? The body is not me, by common sense. The life that goes with the body is the precious thing. The body becomes lifeless on death. Then after further thought, the student returns and says**–**

**प्राणो ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात्। प्राणाद्ध्येव खल्विमानि भूतानि जायन्ते। प्राणेन जातानि जीवन्ति। प्राणं प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्तीति॥            -** (Bhṛguvalli 3)

**Prāṇō brahma-iti vyajānāt, prāṇāt-hi-ēva khalu-imāni bhūtāni jāyantē, prāṇēna jātāni jīvanti prāṇaṁ  prayanti-abhisaṁviśanti-iti.**

He comes to the conclusion that prāṇa, the vital force is that “I”.   It is from prāṇa that all these living beings are born. Being produced from it, they live by it and in the end become one with it. The spandana, the vibration, the movement inside, which makes transactions possible for the body is that “I”. The teacher directs the disciple to do further investigation to arrive at the Truth. **Tapasā** **brahma vijijñāsasva**

The disciple is asked to ponder as to what is wrong with prāṇa?    Why that “I” really is not that Prāṇa. If one has just the body and prāṇa, we all very well know that it is useless to him and to others. This is the case with the person who is in the state of coma who will be just like bellows working to and fro - vegetating stuff as the doctors put it. So prāṇa is not that “I”. There is something more. Cognition, grasping things, usefully using them and working with them is something worthwhile.  Otherwise who wants that just respirating body! The student after further struggle returns with the report that-

**मनो ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात ।**

**Mano Brahma-iti** **Vyajānāt.**  -  (Bhṛguvalli 4)

He concludes that MIND** **is that “I”. Mind through indriyā-s can capture things, can use it for one’s own joy or whatever it is. Indriya Vyāpāra dictated by Mind (Manas) is that real “I”. So this me is the mind- not the mere Prāṇa.  But the teacher dismisses him once again and orders him to do tapas and find the real truth.

Why is the mind not "me" has to be questioned here.-what is the shortcoming about mind being identified with “I”?  The simple explanation could be, mind can only take perceptions- that’s all- it cannot discriminate. It cannot see what is good for the living thing and what is bad for that, what is useful and what is not useful, what is injurious and what is not injurious. That’s the stage of the child.  Till three/four years, a child does not know how to find out what is good or bad, due to which it can cause injury to itself.  Mind is there, perception of objects is there, but judgment is not there. So self destruction could be possible. If you had only Manokośa and no Vijñānakośa, then discrimination is not possible. If both potassium cyanide and sugar are given together, one can consume former for latter and may end his life due to lack of understanding. So, Manokośa is incomplete because there is no discrimination, the faculty to know what is good or what is bad, what is useful or what is not, etc. Later, the student after further investigation asserts that-

**विज्ञानं ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात् ।**

**Vijñānaṁ Brahma-iti Vyajānāt.**  - (Bhṛguvalli 5)

Intellect is - that “I”. The teacher dismisses this point also. All of us know that Vijñānakośa** **is the one of discrimination, and judgment.  Why did the teacher dismiss it?  This stand of the teacher is an unacceptable position to all of us, since we assume that Vijñānakośa is the ultimate. That is the cream of man, that is the best of man and it is through this kośa humans do things, earn food, clothing and shelter. The primitive man could not have lived without that, as protection from predators was not possible without Vijñānakośa. So, Vijñānakośa is the best of me.

If one looks at the old temples and the present day structures, where columns and beams are used, it will immediately occur to everyone about the wonders of Vijñānakośa.  In olden days, they could not think of a beam more than five or six feet and they had to have hundreds of them in a huge structure. Now it is possible to build a large span of 60ft or 80ft without a pillar in between with the knowledge of this kośa. Today, surgery has become so easy with very high advancement in the anaesthesia technology. All this has been possible because of this kośa. So, Vijñānakośa is the best of man for his welfare and for thewelfare of the community. So, it looks that the study of the ātman is complete with “I” being equated to Vijñānakośa.   Most of the systems of philosophy stopped here. Tobe moral, to be ethical, sharing what we have with the have-nots is the outcome of this understanding. Despite these benefits, why the teacher did not accept this kośa as the ultimate is the point to ponder over.

Now, we have to discuss as to what are the shortcomings of this kośa.  If we can appreciate where the Vijñānakośa is defective then we have appreciated Vedānta. Do we have a pre Vijñānakośa state of existence? Granting that we have a pre Vijñānakośa state, is it worthwhile? Do we have enough pramāṇa or evidence to prove that?  If we can answer successfully these questions then we have appreciated the theme of Vedānta.   Between manokośa and Vijñānakośa, the difference is that manokośa involves random thinking. It doesn’t arrange things whereas Vijñānakośa has sequential thinking, therefore very productive, very performing. In the cause--result way we think and get results.

Let us take an example. Take the case of a lady who is managing the house hold affairs and taking care of children and other needs of the house. If you watch carefully, she has so many needs to be attended to simultaneously, like attending to the child’s needs before putting him/her to the school bus, attending to the husband’s needs before sending him off to office, preparing food at the same time. So many things are disorderly and all these have to be attended to in a hard pressed time frame.  All these call for full performance of the vijñāna- kośa. After all these activities, she throws herself on the couch nearby, with a deep sigh of relief from what she has done with the problems. By dropping herself, her Vijñānakośa is also dropped. She wants to go to a state of no work, which is comforting for her and she wants to remain in this state for some time at least before she starts working again. This is an indication that there is a subtler and valuable phase of existence with no more problems bothering her.

Similarly, if you watch a researcher, he also shakes off after a serious work and sits quietly sipping a cup of coffee or whatever. It turns out to be a fact that Vijñānakośa, however grand it appears, is incomplete and is taxing. Any vyāpāra is taxing whether you like it or not. After hard work, every one of us feels relieved and that is the point where Vedānta alone shows the secret of happiness. The lady in our example is willing to throw away the Vijñānakośa as it is taxing and go to a pre Vijñānakośa state which is more comforting. This is the new wisdom that Vedānta gives to man, a missing element for the present day civilization.

Performance is all right. If possible, let us all do it leisurely without target, not giving full pressure to our system.  Unfortunately, we are all put to very strict goals and we take that as the aim of life. We do not seem to think that we can perform better if we do things at a lesser pace. We are always worried that someone else would excel our performance. To come out of this, we have to take a dip in the state of no work which is amṛtasthāna, whereas performance is āyāsasthāna. Resting rejuvenates man, like taking a tonic. If one had stayed on in Vijñānakośa continuously he would have broken down. Fortunately, <u>we are oscillating between rest and performance</u> without knowing the dangers of this Vijñānakośa. This knowledge about things has to be corrected in the light of our experience. Although we have been unknowingly experiencing moments of relaxation, we have not recognised thesame. Taittirīya Upaniṣat (Brahmānandavalli 2-7-3) puts this very beautifully-

**कोह्येवान्यात् कः प्राण्यात्। यदेष आकाश आनन्दो न स्यात॥**

**Kō-hi-ēva-anyāt kaḥ prāṇyāt, yadēṣa ākāśa ānandō na syāt.**

Who would have done respiration if there was no ānanda in ākāśa dharma or a no mind state?

We touch our ākāśa dharma by <u>letting go the confinement.</u> If we did not touch this emptiness or the quietness in us, how couldwe have lived, how could we have respired? Our inhalation and exhalation would have been impossible and we wouldhave broken down - **yeśa hi eva ānandayati - एषह्येवानन्दयति.** This ākāśa dharma is only the source of joy or ānanda. So the student discovers the last truth-

**आनन्दो ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात्। आनन्दाद्ध्येव खल्विमानि भूतानि जायन्ते। आनन्देन जातानि जीवन्ति। आनन्दं प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्तीति।**(Bhṛguvalli 6)** **

**Ānandō brahma-iti vyajānāt, ānandāt- hi-ēva khalu-imāni bhūtāni jāyantē, ānandēna jātāni jīvanti, ānandaṁ prayanti-abhisaṁviśanti-iti.**

From ānanda you are born, your activity is sustained.  It is because of the ānanda that you experience here,you get back to your ānanda- sthāna** **when you die. It is the SOURCE, which is the sustaining stuff, the‘ONE’ into which activity dissolves. When the student discovered that, he had nothing else to verify because he was so certain that he did not approach the teacher to verify whether he was correct or not. So, the Upaniṣad ends with the mantra—

**सैषा भार्गवी वारुणी विद्या। परमे व्योमन् प्रतिष्ठित।।**

**Sā-ēṣā bhārgavī vāruṇī vidyā, paramē vyōman pratiṣṭhita.**(Bhṛguvalli 6)

This is the great wisdom given by Varuṇa, the father and the teacher, to the student Bhṛgu. What did this knowledge do to the student?  Itput him in to that limitless emptiness or the expansiveness that we are all structured with. Upaniṣad further boldly puts it-Upaniṣad affirms that all persons irrespective of cast, creed, religion or place are eligible to attain this ānanda and one who knows about this comforting silence, enjoys the amanībhāva- permanent happiness.

**प्रतितिष्ठति अद्वये आनन्द मात्रे आत्मनि प्रतितिष्ठति।**

**Prati-tiṣṭhati advayē ānanda mātrē ātmani prati-tiṣṭhati.**

He gets established in that stateas it is his true self and every one of us could touch that state because it isour very natureand stay there as long as one wants.

There is one more point there. When you touch that mahāvishrānti, that expansion, it is not the helpless expansion or helpless silence of the idiot.  It is thatexpansionwhich is the abode of all the activities. It is the base of creativity. You are not powerless there. You can do any amount of performance, you can apply kumbhana that can shake the world and can lift mountains. Power and silence can coexist. It is further declared in Bhṛguvalli 7 that:

**अन्नवान् अन्नादो भवति। महान् भवति प्रजया पशुभिः ब्रह्मवर्चसेन महान् कीर्त्या।**

**Annavān annādō bhavati, mahān bhavati prajayā paśubhiḥ brahma-varcasēna mahān kīrtyā.**

You get all mundane gains. You get all creative energies. If you touch that state, you get plenty of material wealth. How can non-doing beget all these? That’s the cosmic law. If you position yourself there, by a mere sankalpa, you can achieve whatever you want.

Annavān bhavati, annādo bhavati - **अन्नवान् भवति**। **‍अन्नादो भवति**। - Indriya patutwa increases. Annādameans digestive power.

Mahān bhavati prajayā- paśubhiḥ - **महान् भवति प्रजया‍ पशुभि:**। People applaud you, people praise you, and look at you with great respect. All mundane gains automatically come to a man who is a brahmajñāni- who is brhmaniṣṭa- It is very difficult to grasp the mechanism involved. Possible explanation is that when there is cittaśuddhi of that order, it may be possible to materialise things of your choice. Here we may get a doubt as to whether the Śāstra is ridiculing lower levels. Śāstra is not ridiculing the lower levels at all.

Prāṇamayakośa**- प्राणमयकोश** -is much superior to annamayakośa- because the burden of mass is gone. You have lifted yourself. At the prāṇamayakośa level, mass is gone. If you observe a rocket, every few seconds some mass is reduced as it soars higher. Anger is a linear property as it is in prāṇamayakośa. It is confined.

But when you come to manomayakośa, you are in three dimensions- you are everywhere. Manomayakośa has brought in the element of expansiveness losing the defect called linearity. This kośa is superior to prāṇamayakośa when you identify with each kośa. But, what is wrong with manomāyakośa and how is vijñānamayakośa superior? Upaniṣad beautifully puts it thus-

**तस्य ऋतम् दक्षिणः पक्षः‍। सत्यम् उत्तरः पक्षः। योग आत्मा।**

**Tasya ṛtam dakṣiṇaḥ pakṣaḥ, satyam uttaraḥ pakṣaḥ, yoga ātmā**.

I was bothered about the word Yoga, as how its use has come in here, in the context of vijñānakośa? I could gather that yoga in this context means samādhāna. That is the point of difference between manas and vijñānakośa. So, if you sit in an endless space, you can at once see thousands miles. This means that you are just all that space. It is not that you moved from here to there. Your sarvavyāpitva has set in. One component of Brahmalakṣaṇa is already achieved. But then what is wrong? How is it still different from Brahma? Though vistārata has been achieved, cancalatva of the mind has not gone. It is due to Vistārata, that Vijñānakośa is extraordinary- that is why creativity has come in. It is very superior since naidhānya has set in. That is why achievement is possible both in science and technology and in understanding self.

When you compare vijñānakośa and ānadakośa, expansion is common, cognition also is common.  There is a bit of focusing in former without which performance is not possible. Ānadamayakośa has no dwaita bodha. Creation is assembling of things in an order. In ānanda- simply pictures and sounds are there, but no assembly takes place as in vijñānakośa.

Vistārata is there in manokośa, but naidhānya is not there. That has come in vijñānakośa and that ānanda has already come to you because of relaxation. But, dwaita-bodha is destroyed only in ānandakośa since focusing is not there.

**तस्य प्रियमेव शिर**:**। मोदो दक्शिण**:**पक्श**:**।** **प्रमोदो उत्तर**: **पक्श**:**।** **आनन्द आत्मा**।.

**Tasya priyamēva śiraḥ- modo dakṣiṇaḥ pakṣaḥ** **pramodo uttaraḥ pakṣaḥ- ānanda ātmā.**

The characteristic of Ānandakośa is that it is near to Samādhi state. One can ask the difference between ānandakośa and vijñānakośa-Śankara clarifies that in Vijñānakośa, individualisation or localisation has not gone. That is, object has a locus –KHANDATVA in this Kośa. But, in Ānandakośa this defect is not there.

Now, the question arises as to whether Ānandakośa itself is the ultimate position? Śankara puts forth his argument thus:

Ānanda is included in Pancakośa. Thus, a kośa wnich represents confinement cannot be a property of Brahma. Hence Ānandakośa cannot represent Brahma, since confinement is still there in that Kośa.

Secondly, **brahmapuccham pratiṣṭha - ब्रह्मपुच्छम् प्रतिष्ठ ।** This is the portion of mantra in Upaniṣad while defining Ānandakośa. If Ānandakośa is identical to Brahma, then the portion of this Mantra is irrelevant. Every stage, you go to a higher level by dropping an extra of the previous Kośa. Similarly, when you forget a valuable thing at the higher level, missing of which, you come to a lower kośa. As such Ānandakośa is Brahma, but corrupt.

So we have looked at a beautiful prakriya enunciated in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad, where you touch the silence and show that there is silence in all of us and which is superior to vijñānakośa for the reason that it is the comforting state and is the ānandasthāna.  Ānandasthāna is the source of tremendous energy by which sequential thinking and all other values of vijñānakośa are possible because of which technology has grown.  Present civilisation is suffering because they have concluded that vijñānakośa is the ultimate and end of all.

Hindu thoughtprovides this missing element to the global civilization.

Now I will take up questions for you.

**Q.** Ānandakośa is superior to Vijñānakośa and there is no question about this. Just because it is considered superior, why not we think that there is something superior to ānanda?

**A.** If there is anything superior please point it out.

**Q.** Buddha questioned this point?

**A.** He did not.  After enlightenment he was always happy. Incidentally he gave the message of compassion to the world and asked everybody to enjoy that ānanda. Why did he advocate sanyāsa to everybody?  He said that ānanda is your very nature. Suppose you are in the sākṣībhāva, you can do any amount of work. In fact your work efficiency increases. You’re not tired at all because you are getting a tonic there. With that spirit one has to function.  Vedānta doesn’t prevent anyone from functioning. Suffering while in activity is the one that Vedānta attacks and says that it is not needed.

**Q.**Do we take rest to be active or are we active because we want work?

**A.** The answer would be, if activity doesn’t make you complain, go ahead.  If there is some system inside where you are doing activity in the leisurely background then go ahead. When you yourself complain, your priority must change. If you want rest but feel that the work dries you up and you complain, then this wisdom comes to your rescue. Suppose you are active and not worried about it, then it is fine, there is a safety valve mechanism or protective shield that is taking care of you.  It is working well at the deeper centres.

**Q.**Ānanda and vijñāna serve each other. Am I right or wrong?

**A.** In the background of ānanda, if you are in vijñānakośa, then it is fine. There is nothing like compartments- everything is a blending, everything is in continuity. You can be stationed at various levels like-vyāpāra helplessly done or vyāpāra done without sacrificing relaxation or no vyāpāra at all. There could be phases; it is all one Brahma in different phases. Pure consciousness is one thing. Consciousness coupled with activity is another. Freedom element of consciousness is considerably lost in the animal kingdom-still worse in the plant kingdom- totally lost in the rock kingdom. A bit of freedom has flowered in the animal kingdom and plant kingdom, much more in the human beings where corticular activity has started. <u>Through the freedom of choice for doing a thing or not doing a thing, you go to regions of ānanda.   That is the tool for spiritual growth.</u>

**Q.** Most of such questions get dropped off once you get the ānanda, and the mind gets relaxed.   Why?

**A.** When we are in sākṣībhāva, Indriyā-s by themselves can perform, there being a very faint silver thread connection. For example, we are in that state of relaxation induced by the talk and discussions when we are in satang.   In satang we do not aim at getting new information at all-we talk about peace and ānanda and therefore everybody isput into that state. Satsanga is—

**तच्चिन्तनं तत्कथनमन्योन्यं तत्प्रबोधनम् ।**

**Tat-cintanaṁ tat-kathanam-anyōnyaṁ tat -prabōdhanam.** (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha 3-2-108)

I am_ _benefited now and you are also benefited as both of us are in expansive state. What is brhama abhyāsa? It is, **cintana, kathana annyonya prabodhana - चिन्तन, कथन अन्न्योन्य प्रबोधन ।**

**एतदेकपरत्वं च तदभ्यासं विदुर्बुधाः॥**

**Ētat- ēka-paratvaṁ ca tat-abhyāsaṁ vidurbudhāḥ.** (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha 3-2-108)

Mutually inducing -you talk a word about peace, I get that, -I talk a word aboutpeace, you get that.

**Q.** Are we not always in that phase?

**A.**It is not that easy. If you are, then you might be doing that sādhana for more than twenty years! For a fresher, this focusing has to go and he has to stabilise in the state of relaxation, then he can be really happy in spite of activity.

Now we say drop this focusing and hold on to the let go state.  A stage comes when let go state is in abundance and you can focus also without any botheration. This model is called peripheral focusing. It can also be called non focusing attention. Many such words can be used to represent the state. It is a matter of time and sādhana.

**Q.** Why can’t we start at the very early age like training a child?

**A.** If you encourage a child to keep quiet, then it encourages the child to develop laziness more than the spiritual sādhana.   A bit of discipline, a bit of effort, a bit of persuasion, but within safe limits is necessary. Otherwise it degenerates since there is no vicāra. The child wants all the bhoga but does not want to toil for the same. Control or samyama has to be taught over a period of time and cannot be done hastily.  Samādhāna is missing in this civilization which is pushing the child into the rat race.

The child cannot pick up all the good vāsanā-s if left free and without any imposition from the parent.  Suggestion can be given to the child, gently and not pushing things authoritatively. Then these healthy attitudes will become stronger in the child’s mind. Unless maturity develops for discrimination, it will not be an easy path. Maithri, karuna, mudita, upekşa ideas are very good for the child’s growth, instead of selfishness, irritability, hatred.  Aśubha-vāsanā-s are to be replaced by śubha-vāsanā-s That is where our responsibility comes. Give all the ideals of Indian heritage like Dharma, Tyāga, and Nigraha.   We should inculcate these things into the child. Then the child is fit for Vedānta. If you put the child to a tight discipline, there is a break point and the child runs away to other pleasures. That is why Vedānta has to be introduced gradually.

To conclude our today’s discussion:

Now we are convinced that we should always be happy under any circumstances. But we cannot be like that because we have known the truth only by theory.  Our system is not prepared for such an immediate transformation as we are heavily conditioned. System transformation does not happen simultaneously with this knowledge because of gathered vāsanā- that is the real problem Therefore mere śāstra paricaya is not sufficient, but a phase of sādhana is required to undo the accumulated forces, which are called saṁskāra-s or vāsanā-s.  Vāsanākṣya is required (dissolving the vāsanā-s) and that is a long drawn programme. It may take many lives, but with continuous practice, improvement takes place and every decrease of vāsanā is increase of ānanda. Please take this point carefully and do not run to the conclusion that one day you will get that brāhmic state and till then the whole thing is absurd. It is a very confused position in Vedānta. Therefore, the thing what you have to look for is the increase of ānanda every day.  You should not hurry to get the brāhmic state. It will come by itself once you are ripe.
