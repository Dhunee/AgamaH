title = "02 METHODS OF SĀDHANA"

+++

Now, we will look into details about the different methods of sādhana. We will elaborate four principle methods which lead us to the state of happiness. They are Yogamārga, Jñanamārga, Śubhakarmamārga and Prema and Bhaktimārga. An important point to be noted here is that all these mārgā-s have no distinct demarcations. They overlap and sometimes merge into the other. The purpose of elaborating them under different titles is to give you an idea of their distinct features.

**YOGAMĀRGA AND JÑĀNAMĀRGA**

The Yogamārga is a path of action. Jñanamārga is the path of right understanding. Patanjali, in his yoga sutra says:

**योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः**। - **yōgaḥ-citta-vr̥tti-nirōdhaḥ**

This is the first sutra. Yoga is to quieten the mind, to soften the mind or to mellow the mind. How do you achieve this?

**अभ्यासवैराग्याभ्याम् तन्निरोधः।**

**Abhyāsa-vairāgyābhyām-tannirōdhaḥ**.

This second sutra is an answer to the first one. He lays down the premises. Two techniques are suggested- abhyāsa_ and _vairāgya_._

The same point as it were, is bodily passed on in Bhagavad-Ġīta. Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna to practice **manonigraha—**to tame the mind. But Arjuna is confused—

**चञ्चलं हि मनः कृष्ण प्रमाथि बलवद्धृढम्।**

**तस्याहम् निग्रहं मन्ये वायोरिव सुदुष्करम्॥**

**Cañcalaṁ hi manaḥ kr̥ṣṇa pramāthi balavat-dhr̥ḍham,**

**Tasya-aham nigrahaṁ manyē vāyōriva suduṣkaram.**(Bhagavad-Ġīta, 6-34)

Arjuna says it is very difficult to do that- he would rather be able to tame the wind rather than the mind. Kṛṣṇa agrees with him and says-

**असंशयं महाबाहो मनो दुर्निग्रहं चलम्।**

**अभ्यासेन तु कौंतेय वैराग्येण च गृह्यते॥**

**Asaṁśayaṁ mahābāhō manō durnigrahaṁ calam,**

**abhyāsēna tu kauṁtēya vairāgyēṇa ca gr̥hyatē.**

(Bhagavad-Ġīta, 6-35) 

There is no doubt that mind is very unsteady, very fickle and it is very difficult to subdue it. Mind can be subdued by abhyāsa_ and _vairāgya. Whatever Pathanjali said, the very thought is here -- to show the consistency in tradition is maintained-

What is abhyāsa and what is vairāgya? Abhyāsa is actually taming the forces. Vairāgya is vedāntavicāra- or renunciation born out of vicāra.

This thought is made even clearer in Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa. Rāma asked the question as to how to tame the mind? Vāsiṣṭa says-

**द्वौ क्रमौ चित्तनाशाय योगो ज्ञानं च राघव ।**

**योगस्तद्वृत्तिरोधो हि ज्ञानं सम्यगवेक्षणम् ॥**

**Dvau kramau citta-nāśāya yōgō jñānaṁ ca rāghava,**

**yōgaḥ tat-vr̥tti-rōdhō hi jñānaṁ samyak avēkṣaṇam.** (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha, 5-9-72)

My dear Rāma, there are two methods for quietening the mind, for purifying the mind. What are they? They are Yoga and Jñāna. Suppose there is speed and disturbance of mind. In Yogamārga you slow it down by riding on it. Whereas in Jñnānamārga you slow down with right understanding. This definition is more comfortable and convenient. So, Jñāna is right understanding of things, thereby replacing wrong notions by correct notions. That is the jñānamārga which results in renunciation of wrong values which is VAIRĀGYA in the real sense.


## JÑĀNA-MĀRGA (PATH OF KNOWLEDGE)

Jñanamarga, as Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa’s definition goes, is**samyak avekṣaṇam-** whatever wrong notions we have, about the nature of sukha and about our own nature, we correct them by right ideas. This is the safest method and is most productive. A sick person can do that, a paralytic patient can do that, a woman with a child can do that, a suckling mother can do that, a boy can do that because there is no toil in this process and there is no struggle. By simple suggestions, one can counter duḥkha.

By correct counselling, by auto suggestions, one can achieve the desired results. Therefore it is the easiest, safest but most productive. When the mind slips into disturbance, advise the mind to become quiet. You can do that when you are in a train; you can do that when you are driving, you can do that when you are in the office. When you get a stroke of annoyance tell yourself that annoyance is not necessary and is not your true nature.

Our system is equipped with these two tools. By a long practice of suggestion, one removes the forces inside and by applying the principle of LET GO one is able to conquer the mind**.**Our system can change under the influence of suggestions. Whenever there is duḥkha in the form of speed, suggest to slowdown. Whenever there is increased focussing, suggest the system to undo the pressure built up at the ājñācakra by suggesting ‘let go’.

If you are comfortable with the speed in your profession, continue the same as long it is not burdensome to you. When the system complains, start using the method since it works wonderfully. Always remember the triple gems as we call them- **śravaṇa, Manana and Nididhyāsa** -**श्रवण, मनन, निदिधयास -**Śravaṇa is listening and forming a base thought. Manana is that where all secondary questions are sorted out. Nididhyāsa is the one where the process of softening, which has already begun due to sravaṇa and manana, culminates in the peaceful state**.**

Let us recollect briefly the discussion on sukha- duḥkha parīkṣa which will be relevant to sādhana. What is duḥkha per se? What is sukha per se? It is a few minutes of study for a bright mind. Plenty of sukha moments are there, plenty of duḥkha moments are there for us to study. One’s daughter has not returned home although it is quite late in the night, she may be in trouble and without help, resulting in anxiety, fear, uncertainty. Any duḥkha moment boils down to one thing and that is speed.

Another aspect of duḥkha is to get caught in a point. You try to solve a problem, you don’t get it, and you are in a confined state. In two universities your son has got admission. You start thinking as to which one is better? This gives rise to focussing, minding. This also causes duḥkha. We don’t see the wrong side of focussing, fortunately, because we more often focus and let go. I said there is a safety mechanism by which we let go the state of focussing automatically within a short time. Then we are safe. We don’t complain about focussing. You see the evil of focussing when it is overdone. Suppose you have a problem for which there is no remedy, you keep on focussing in its full version, its exaggerated version. Then there is a breakdown. All our mundane problems, all our professional problems are solved with the tool called focussing, concentration, ekāgrata_,_ one-pointedness. Research is possible because of focussing. There is no second say about it. But then, look at the other side of focussing and what problems it creates, says the śāstra.

That’s why at the first level of listening, we shouldn’t drop focussing abruptly. Understand that you are still in the performance stage. Start practicing Vedānta in the approximate way-strike a compromise. Do the focussing leisurely. Focussing is acceptable if slowness is tagged on to it. Focussing is burdensome when speedily done. Use your intelligence when performance is a must. You are not in a stage where you give up the worldly activities. You want the gains from the world. There is nothing wrong in going after mundane type of sukha. Vedānta is not preaching asceticism, remember that. On the other hand vedānta makes you fit for action when it is required. Arjuna did not run away after listening to Kṛṣṇa after all the preaching in the battlefield. He declared:-

**नष्टो मोहः स्मृतिर्लब्ध्वा त्वत्प्रसादान्मयाच्युत ।**

**स्थितोस्मि गतसंदेहः करिष्ये वचनं तव ॥**

**Naṣṭō mōhaḥ smr̥tiḥ-labdhvā tvat-prasādāt- mayā-acyuta,**

**sthitaḥ-asmi gata saṁdēhaḥ kariṣyē vacanaṁ tava.** (Bhagavad-Ġīta, 18-73)

My confidence is restored. My scruples are gone. My fears are gone. I can enter into the battlefield of life more effectively.

Therefore, one has to tag on to slowness when ekāgrata is a must, when performance is a must. The burden of focussing is reduced very much at that point. That’s the skill. And when speed is required, be in the expansive state. Or when you are expansive, speed does not become a point for complaint.

You know, when a cricket match is going on and when your side is scoring runs, you will be shouting. You will be up on your seat. But it is not taxing as you are in an expansive mood. If an athlete focuses totally on the thread line he has to reach, that builds up pressure and he will break down. Instead, if he keeps his mind relaxed his performance gets enhanced. **So any amount of focussing is acceptable for the system in the background of slowness and vice versa**.

I would always do that. My son and I would try to solve the chemistry problems of our industry. I could hold on for a couple of hours, whereas he would be tired after one hour. He may be cleverer than me. But then I could hold on, because I go about the whole thing slowly whereas he is too fast or in confusion. Vedānta gives you tricks to become a better performer in your profession, may be medicine, may be engineering, may be teaching. If you apply that in your research work, qualitatively and quantitatively, your research will be of a higher order. Number of papers produced and the quality of papers will be decidedly superior. So, by understanding these points you should not be giving up focussing. Bhagavad-Ġīta puts this very nicely-**Yogaḥ karmasu kauśalam- योगः कर्मसु कौशलम्**. It is a cleverness with which we have to approach the whole problem**.**

**Here there is a question whether all these things are in one’s hands?**

The śāstra at once shows that it is certainly in one's hands. Everybody always feels that there is suffering because things around him are bad- boss is bad, child is bad, wife is bad, house is leaking etc-This is met wonderfully when śāstra says one has a**freedom**of operation and is not bound by circumstances. One does not have to bend down to the circumstances that make one so helpless. Śankarā’s enormous faith-

**कर्तुं अकर्तुं अन्यथा वा कर्तुं शक्यम्।**(Śankarabhāṣya)

**Kartuṁ akartuṁ anyathā vā kartuṁ śakyam.**

Man is an extra ordinary species in the universe, unlike inanimate objects which do not have this freedom of decision. He has the ability to do what he feels is right. For example- he can sit or refuse to sit; he can talk or keep quiet- he has the operational freedom even to think or not to think. For the first time, in the evolution process, one sees the freedom element available only in man. So, one has to use this freedom diligently to attain peace. This point must be remembered or must be appreciated for his growth to be possible, for peace to increase. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa explains clearly as to what is mind-

**स्वयमेव पीनताम् याति स्वयमेव तानवं याति ।**

**~वा~ स्वयमेव प्रसरते स्वयमेव सङ्कोचमेति च ॥**

**Svayam-ēva pīnatām yāti svayam-ēva tānavaṁ yāti.**

**~vā~ svayam-ēva prasaratē svayam-ēva saṅkōcamēti ca.** (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa. 6-9-19)

It's an unusual species in the universe. It can magnify itself. It can quieten itself. It is not dictated by an external agency. All these years, you were under the belief that your psychological transactions were completely governed by stimulus response theory. Even psychology and psychiatry, nearly stayed by this notion, determinism**. Kārya-kāraṇa-sambandha- कार्यकारणसंबंध** - cause--result sequence. An abuse on me, I am disturbed. Praise on me, I am comfortable.

No, says śāstra. This is a vulnerable law as far as psychological transactions are concerned. It is true with physical laws. An apple when ripe, pulled by the force of gravity, has got to fall down. Not so with us. We can refuse to be affected internally by the outside world, is the key point in Vedānta. Nothing can touch us- a death, a sorrow, a failure, lack of recognition in society, ill health - major factors of discomfort need not just touch us. **Cidānanda-rūpaḥ śivohaṁ śivohaṁ- चिदानंदरूपः शिवोहम् शिवोहम्** -I am pure, I am auspicious, I am chinmātra, I am mere consciousness, untouched by situations- this is our brahmadharma_,_ and this is our ātmadharma. In fact, if you want me to define brahmadharma or ātmadharma –It is a state of inside which is not touched by anything in the world. You don’t know how profitable it would be when we apply it. It has a solution to all your problems, a subjective solution and therefore permanent. Other solutions are external, objective, and segmental. This is total, subjective, therefore fully in your control. Just use it. You are liberated. The beauty of Vedānta lies in its application. Six months you try this, you are a different person.

My friend, who is a post doctoral fellow, professor in the Institute in Bangalore, was a highly irritable person although he was a very talented person, a rank holder all his career. He used to get upset even for very silly things outside his domain and would lose control on him and would put himself in a miserable plight. Once he listened and appreciated the simple logic put forth by me and he at once shifted his focus and set himself right. He took the situation with utter calmness. He told me that. ‘Shastriji, I applied your method and it worked wonderfully’. That’s Vedānta. Vedānta is extraordinary because it is so convincing and logical.

Take for example the yogāsana posture -ardhamatysendrāsana- it did not defeat your forces of pressure in you. But, only LOGIC defeated your forces. A single correct logic is equal to hundred practices, equal to one thousand pūjā-s. Because, pūja is a mechanical activity. During the pūja time you are comfortable. Outside the pūja time, you have every reason to be fretting and fuming, to be upset. Therefore how can pūja help you? Pūja is wonderful. During the pūja hours there is piety, sacredness, a sense of purity, and you are quiet and fine. But your notion that one must get upset at every wrong situation has not changed. You see the difference. You see the dichotomy. A very religious person is relaxed and is calm during the religious hours. After the religious hours, he thinks he has every reason to get disturbed, to get angry. He spends lot of money to perform a religious function for some benefits and then blames that pūja did not give the results. How can ritualistic religion remove the problems related to wrong notions?

Let us take up righteous indignation! There is no argument in the world to drop righteous indignation. But, here is an argument in vedānta. Righteous indignation is anger which is reasonable. One has made a mistake and therefore I have a right to get annoyed and to scold him. Given the fact that one is unreasonable, why at all it should upset me? This is an argument known only in Vedānta. You should appreciate that. One is so structured that nothing can touch him. He is the master of his ceremonies. One’s mental state is very much in one’s hands. If you can ruminate on this and get convinced your life changes and this is all vedānta. With this knowledge you simply slide into immeasurable levels of peace and calmness and this is not an exaggeration.

One needs to start contemplating with oneself thus - I sit and I am disturbed. Why should thoughts come at all? I have the freedom to think or not to think. At every point I have freedom**.**The thoughts having come, why should they emotionally affect me? When you let the forces go, simply peace sets in. These are the two arguments to increase your peace.

I can illustrate many moments when we are disturbed. If my wife is talking more comfortably with people around, I am envious. ‘She is not that comfortable with me, she is so comfortable with others!’ is my mental thought. Small little things can upset your ego and you feel hurt. She takes me for granted but she is so comfortable with other male members in the group. These are subtle problems. Inferiority complex, jealousy, poignant forces squeeze you to desperation. You lose sleep for several days. Such forces can be melted away in one suggestion built on vedāntic truths that there is an inherent freedom inside you and that **freedom stuff is called ātmā.**

Now I will take up questions from you.

**Q.** Although I agree that we have control, there are certain times when we have to lose control?

**A.** When I say I have control I am just referring to that normal freedom. If there is tooth ache, I have no control over the pain. Freedom that I am referring to is at the psychological level. If you insult me, if you hurt me, I can refuse to react**.**

Don’t apply this law for the body problems like stomach ache, head ache, pain due to an injection etc. Most of our sufferings are psychological. The freedom that is referred is at the citta level, not at the body level. One should not make a mistake here. I agree with you that, the first stroke of anger cannot be controlled. But, with gradual and repeated application of this knowledge, one gets desired results. It may take months, years, and for some people never in this life. It all depends on one's state of mind and stock of Vāsanā-s.

What I want to impress here is that, one should use this method to soften one’s stand on various problems. Please understand that there is this freedom in you. Using it or not using is up to you. Most of the time we calm down by auto suggestion. That is the freedom I am referring to. Now I am applying this freedom at all levels. **This is all my sādhana.**

Thirty years ago, I was always concentrating. I was always researching. I defeated my horrible concentrating tendency by this argument. It is not your nityadharma as the śāstra puts it. It is an āropita dharma. It can come and go. Whatever is the āropita dharma, by the very definition, you can drop it. Your objection that it cannot be dropped overnight stands well. But the whole sādhana is excellently described by Kṛṣṇa in Bhagavad-Ġīta as:

**यतो यतो निश्चरति मनश्चञ्चलमस्थिरम् ।**

**ततस्ततो नियम्यैतादात्मन्येव वशं नयेत् ॥**

**Yatō yatō niścarati manaḥ-cañcalam asthiram,**

**tataḥ-tatō niyamya-ētāt-ātmani -eva vaśaṁ nayēt.**Bhagavad-Ġīta, 6-260

From whatever cause the restless and unsteady mind wanders away, let him refrain from that. Let him bring it under the control of self alone.

When mind goes vary, keep telling your mind that you will be steady; you will contain the forces. In course of time you will be able to attain manonigraha

**Q.** But we all live together in a family or society or workplace and encounter problems- when something goes wrong, particularly when it is not your fault, the annoyance is there. Even if you suppress it at that point, sometime later it throws up at some other point. What of that?

**A.** Not necessary- This again is the result of our conditioning. Therefore it shows up. Now you are not suppressing it, you have proved to yourself that, even when the other person is at fault, you don’t have to work up yourself. So this quietness is based on the knowledge of your independence, your freedom, your autonomy. In the earlier method, it was suppression for decorum sake- that means you have every reason to get disturbed but you are not doing that at that moment. You were holding the very act of response, whereas here you have no cause to get disturbed. This is the realisation that you got from the study. Other fellow is at fault and you get disturbed. Given that other fellow is at fault, why you should get upset is a thing not known to man. Ātma is swatantra_, _alipta, untouched by anything good or bad. This new knowledge makes it clear that **it is not suppression but it is sublimation**. Let there be hundred errors in the world around -that need not touch me-**asaṅgo ayaṁ puruśaḥ- असङ्गो अयं पुरुषः -**a big vedantic saying. I remain untouched- this is what you have realised. 

**Q.** What about the instance when your children put you in that irritable mood. Then I have to react, in order to change him.

**A.** If the child keeps on doing mistakes, there you do the necessary correction**.**The whole śāstra is referring to the mental level. At the vyavahāra level you do any amount of correction without getting upset. Otherwise we make a mess of things. If a child is not corrected then the child is not rightly educated. We must tell that in many different ways like sāma, dāna, bheda, danḍa, and make the child understand. But, getting mentally worked up is not necessary

**Q.**More often we do the same mistake again and again although we know that it could have been the other way. Then the guilt feeling starts and this disturbs the whole pattern. What do you say for that?

**A.** It is for this main purpose of getting rid of the guilt feeling one resorts to sādhana. After all what is sādhana? One has to let go the feeling that one is insulted or talked lightly about. **One should not chew the cud.**One should develop a state of indifference to such acts which give rise to anger, hatred, etc. One should set the clock in the reverse direction and take things in such a way that it does not create imbalance in the system. We should not develop the guilt feeling at all. A bit of repentance is fine, but balance of mind should come immediately.

This should happen in the case of desires also. Slowly but steadily one should get that understanding. A mere knowledge that it can be washed out is not sufficient. That is why vāsanākṣaya takes place slowly. One has to wash this down slowly and steadily, like the damped oscillations of a pendulum. It does not come down suddenly, but slowly. We should not try to justify our anger but must take a different attitude of letting go the things**.**For a few days it works slowly and thereafter it simply jumps to a higher level. The best way of negating an incompatible situation is by putting a question to you as —SO WHAT? This line of approach automatically brings down the impact of unruly forces.

By auto suggestions, self counselling, gentle counselling, a time comes when the forces are all reduced-this is the manana portion. Repeatedly recalling what we have listened in śravaṇa is manana.

Whenever you trip, whenever you falter, whenever you lose your poise, apply this method and a stage comes when the vāsanākşaya happens so much that even the suggestion is not necessary. This is nididhyāsa - śravaṇa improves into manana and manana improves into nididhyāsa. Nididhyāsa is a gentle sitting wherein the forces are so low that you can just diffuse them.

**Ātmaparicaya - आत्मपरिचय**, **ātmābhyāsa - अत्माभ्यास and ātmaniṣṭha - आत्मनिष्ट -**are the three methods of identification for the progress.

**śravaṇa is_ _ātmāparichaya -**that is, identification of the true nature.

Then**manana is ātmābhyāsa -**repeatedly reminding the same. 

And the steady state established through this process is**nididhyāsa**or**ātmāniṣṭha_._**

Sukhaparīkṣa showed you another big truth. While our notion was, sukha is in the objects of enjoyment, Śāstra asked us to examine the nature of that sukha as to what happened to the mind at that point of your enjoyment. It was very clear to all of us that the mind refuses to think at that point, mind does not want to think, mind is incapacitated to think. In the grandeur of the ānanda the mind rests. The mind becomes decomposed, thought free. Technically speaking, mind has reached nearer to the causal state; mind has reached its pūrvasvarūpa- ātmasvarūpa or the brahmasvarūpa.

But, bhogasukha gives momentary joy preceded by restlessness and succeeded by restlessness. It is fractionated, segmental, incomplete and admixed joy. **But we get a glimpse of that śāśvatasukha in this bhogasukha.** Therefore one has to see this welcome element and stay firm in it and then **drop the agency.**

**Q.** If I go to a person and tell him to try coffee as a tool for sukha he is not satisfied, as he basically does not like coffee. How to convince him?

**A.** That is easily answered. Coffee cannot give joy to everybody. One’s taste is what is important. To some, sweet is repulsion. You cannot take the example then. I have tried many different types of things to show that expenditure of energy takes place as per the model suggested by me when certain centres are activated. I would have a music put on. Of course, music of my choice, otherwise, resonance vibration would not happen. Just before listening to the music, I would watch myself how much restless I was. While listening to the music the restlessness goes. Why? The explanation is that the centre of hearing is expending the excess energy thereby giving relaxation at the mental level. If the music is stopped, then again pressure builds up soon. This is a proof that music pushed you to a no mind state resulting in joy.

Most of you know the wire and the tuning fork experiment. There is a distance between the vibrating body (the tuning fork) and the wire. If you take the tuning fork near the wire, then the wire vibrates in resonance. When the right matching frequency is there, a very large slice of the energy is shifted to the wire and it starts vibrating. If we place a small piece of paper on the wire, the paper flies off to show that the wire is vibrating.

**Q**: What about Boredom?

**A.** As we saw earlier, when the music is applied comfort sets in because boredom force is burnt away by the principle of resonance vibration as demonstrated in the above experiment. A very large slice of the energy can be drawn away. Śṛuti and the Vedānta have explored this very well.

Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad makes a beautiful comment. Why don’t you watch the happiness of sex, which is the highest happiness in the esteem of man? The Upaniṣad makes a point.

**तद्यथा प्रियया स्त्रिया सम्परिष्वक्तो ।**

**न बाह्यं किञ्चन वेद नान्तरम् ॥**(Bṛh. Upa, 4-3-21) 

**Tadyathā priyayā striyā sampariṣvaktō,**

**na bāhyaṁ kiñcana vēda nāntaram.**

The best of sukha is the laingikasukha. But why don’t you see the mechanism involved? What courage on the part of vedantic scientist? How did the woman give you joy? Or, what did the woman give you in the name of joy? She put you into the no-thinking state.

**Na bāhyaṁ kiñcana vēda -**You know nothing of the outside. Hundreds of problems bothering you do not touch you at that moment.

**Na antaraṁ kiñcana vēda -**You know nothing of the inside. I mean, you don’t even study the mechanism because that will take away the joy.

**एषोऽस्य परम आनन्दः, एषास्य परमा गतिः।**

**ēṣaḥ-asya parama ānandaḥ, ēṣāsya paramā gatiḥ.** (Bṛh. Upa, 4-3-21) 

This is your exalted state. This is your richest state -world doesn’t exist for you. You are a zero inside. There is a vacuum. The knower, the known, and the knowing process are all dissolved. **Tripuṭināśa-त्रिपुटिनाश**has happened. It is a sheer emptiness. In ever so many ways it is showing you what is that **ānandasthiti** which is nothing but an expansion inside.

**Q.**Why one cannot have śāśvatasukha by involving more and more of bhoga?

**A.** If taking coffee leads you to brahmasukha, then why don’t you have more and more of coffee? Why don’t you have more sweets in order to get that brahmasukha continuously? The answer lies here. **Although bhogasukha works by this mechanism, it has a defect. It is short lived.** This shifting of the energy is only temporary. Every indriya has a limit point to draw or shift the energy to its respective centre. The first sweet is remarkable, the second sweet is acceptable, and the third sweet is repulsive. Even at the cost of annoying the host you say, ‘sorry I cannot take it’, why? The system cannot manage. The tongue fails to draw that energy. At that point, the energy goes back into its original place, the ajnācakra and again you become restless. That is the reason why bhogasukha is short lived. During bhogasukha, preceded by a disturbed state and succeeded by a disturbed state, for a small interval of time in between, the mind quietens.

If you can reduce the creation and the release of energy itself, the permanent effect remains. Without this ineffective method of shifting the energy to another indriya centre, if you can naturally reduce the release of energy itself by slowing down (adopting naidhānya way), then you can naturally expand your shell which is vistārata

In a small sphere, the amount of thrust or the hit on the unit area is more. That's simple physics. Suppose the sphere is very big, the same thrust or hit on a much bigger sphere is much smaller. Distributed over a larger area, you don’t feel the burden at all.

So, apply the rule of **naidhānya - नैधान्य**, apply the principle of **vistāratā**- **विस्तारता_ or _vaishālyatā**- **वैशाल्यता**. Then the boredom forces are automatically absorbed or swallowed away and you don’t complain at all. This is a permanent method to be always happy.

**So, a vedāntin is not running away from bhoga for ascetic reasons. He, as a happy person, can be in vistārata with or without bhoga.**

**Q**. What happens if we reject objects of bhoga?

**A**. We shouldn’t do that. We would injure the system. We need not stop taking sweets, etc. All this is necessary. Abruptly we cannot stop bhoga. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa gives us a very good wisdom. In the first phase of sādhana one should do 25% of this vicāra 75% of bhoga and at the second phase 50% of this vicāra and 50% of bhoga and at the third phase 25% of bhoga 75% of vicāra is to be practised. At the final stage one can always keep quiet depending upon his level of cittaśuddhi.

**Q.** Does viśayasukha or bhogasukha alone is the contributing aspect of gaining peace of mind?

**A.** This is another good objection on sukha. But it is the peace of mind that is referred to as sukha in the tradition. Actually in our viśayasukha moment, although the penultimate position is in excitement, the real point is in peace. We are tempted to say that this excitement is a sukha element. The penultimate centres are in excited state and therefore one is tempted to conclude that sukha carries the element of excitement. But the real thing is that the penultimate position, that is the taditarasthāna as we put it in Sanskrit, is in excitement whereas the samīpasthāna_ _or the ultimate position has an expansion which constitutes peace.

Our difficulty really is, when we are talking about happiness, we are just using words, but we do not know what happiness is in rich measure. That is why recapitulation of content of sukha is not possible, as we deal only in words saying that ānanda is bliss. The best of ānanda we know is the nidrā phase. So, if you can get a feel of that ānanda, in wakeful hours, then you come into real touch of that state.

Some time it happens. Profit by that, says the śāstra. Irrespective of the moments when you have a high measure of peace and satisfaction, you are becoming familiar with that quality of mind which is close to brahmasukha_._ Why not continue to stay like that. Gauḍapāda puts it beautifully in Kārika, 44, Chapter 3 of Māṇ. Up:

**लये सम्बोधयेत् चित्तं विक्षिप्तम् शमयेत्पुनः।**

**सकषायं विजानीयात् समप्राप्तं न चालयेत् ॥**

**Layē sambōdhayēt cittaṁ vikṣiptam śamayēt punaḥ,**

**sakaṣāyaṁ vijānīyāt samaprāptaṁ na cālayēt.**

(If the mind becomes inactive, arouse it from laya; if distracted, make it tranquil. Understand the nature of the mind when it contains the seed of attachment. When the mind has attained equanimity, do not disturb it again.)

When you get that tranquillity, hold on, do not disturb that. Then it is a mahāsādhana. There are hundreds of occasions like going to pilgrimage, going to a forest side, going to a river bed, going to temples etc where you put yourself into that calm state. So, any occasion which gives peace in the heightened measure makes recollection of that state easy.

**Q**. While one is practicing this method and attain a reasonable amount of purity of mind devoid of anger and jealousy, external forces like selfishness of people around you, dishonesty, unfaithfulness, etc may disturb you from time to time. How to come out of this?

**A**. The answer to this is given in Chāndogya Upaniṣad:

**सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म तज्जलानीति शान्त उपासीत ।**

**Sarvaṁ khalu-idaṁ brahma tajjalānīti śānta upāsīta.** (Chāndogya Upa 3-14-11)

Everything is verily Brahman. Contemplate, with devotion, on its creation, sustenance and dissolution.

There is nothing like wrong, filth or foul, everything is brahma. Pettiness is an activity version of Brahma. Dishonesty is an activity version of Brahma. Unfaithfulness is an activity version of Brahma--the same pure Brahman is manifested in those phases there. Everything is the functioning version of Brahma. Therefore it is respectable, worthy of salutation. When one takes this stand then complaining goes. Unless complaining goes, you cannot be comforted.

You are fine with yourself. But, when you see all these around, within the family and outside, do not get disturbed by it. If you ask me how performance can go on in such a state, you do the necessary interference and corrections but keep in mind that the same pure Brahma has become all this. In Rudra mantra and Devi- stuti, you will find that salutation to all types of people. The hint from the śāstra is that you cannot accuse any one- you cannot find fault with others- then the satisfaction comes automatically. Śankara’ puts it as:

**कामक्रोधरहित आसन् उपासीत ।**

**Kāma-krōdha-rahita āsan upāsīta.**

Worship the world and the various forces therein without any attachment or dejection.

So, this additional information should be remembered by the students who take to Jñānamārga. It goes by the method of suggestion. You begin to operate gently at every situation in life.

**Q.**What is your opinion about meditation in order to attain the state of happiness?

**A.**Meditation, according to Vedānta, is comfortable sitting or relaxed sitting. One could always be happy as in nidrā where one spends six or seven hours without any worry or burden. Vedāntic meditation is non-focusing. You need not have even the support of omkāra or candle light gazing or things like that. Instead, sit and enjoy—

**एकान्ते सुखमास्यतां ।**

**परतरे चेतस्समाधीयताम् ॥**(Sādhanapañcaka, 5)

**Ēkāntē sukham-āsyatāṁ,**

**paratarē cētaḥ-samādhīyatām.**

Enjoy the blissful solitude, through equanimity of mind.

How easy! What a recommendation! You are asked to be comfortable- that’s all. If you are convinced of the vedantic truths, just relax so that every joint gets loosened, even at the muscular level, let alone at the mental level**. It looks funny but true.**That is meditation.

And if focusing comes, a small attention comes. Just advise yourself that it is not necessary and you begin to diffuse. You begin to get back your quality of expansiveness. Layers and layers of diffusion can happen with this way of relaxed sitting culminating in expansiveness.

**That is why, when people say that realisation is instantaneous and total, I have reservations about it and I feel that the expansion is a gradual process.**

**Q**. Are there different levels of expansion?

**A**. When you say, you are comfortable you have expanded from the focusing stage to a leisurely state. Even in nidrā or sleep, total expansion has not occurred. But, prāṇa spandana is there. Otherwise, why would the forces come back once you are awake? Relatively we are more expansive and the expansion can go on until cessation of prāṇa happens.

**अप्राणो ह्यमानाः शुभ्रो ह्यक्षरात् परतः परः।**

**A-prāṇō hi-amānāḥ śubhrō hi-akṣarāt parataḥ paraḥ.** (Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad, 2-1-2) 

The glorious state of tuirīya is beyond the mind, prāṇa and the unmanifeseted.

What are you?--no prānic vyāpti at all, no cittavyāpāra, no prāṇavyāpāra. That is the tuirīya state.

**Q.** Can you elaborate the difference between nidrā and turīya?

**A.** Śankara goes in detail as to why Nidrā is not the ultimate. Most people stop at Nidrā in the avsthātrayaparīkṣa. How does turīya differ from nidrā? For both the states, there is no cognition – there is no dwaithavyāpāra. There is absence of perceiving jagat and perceived jagat. Then why don’t you call nidrā itself as the ultimate? Gouḍapāda, in the Mānḍuklya Kārika beautifully answers this state-

**बीजनिद्रायुतः प्राज्ञः सा च तुर्ये न विद्यते ।**

**Bījanidrāyutaḥ prājñaḥ sā ca turyē na vidyatē.**

(Māṇ. Up 1, Kā. 13)

The seed of ignorance which is prevalent in sleep, is absent in tuirīya.

In nidrā, although a no mind state is reached, vyāpāra has not ceased. Triputi has gone- manovyāpāra has gone- but nonetheless you are in vyāpāra. Prāṇaspandana is there**.**Relative centres were perhaps blocked. Once these centres resume work again, you are very much in vyāpāra. You immediately ask for your bed coffee or rush for your news paper as soon as you get up--- all the forces are back in action. **You thought you were very quiet but the forces were all in the bīja or seed form, that is, in the form of small spandana or vibration**. You just slipped into sleep but, somehow and somewhere the forces were not tamed by a process. So you come back. Citta-laya had happened in nidrā_, _citta-nāśa had not happened.

How does the sādhaka then tackle this?--He begins to tame the forces and kills them. The forces are vanquished in the sādhana phase. Therefore there is no residue. There is nothing like coming back to any worldly desires. A man going to samādhi this way, when he comes back he is equally soft- that is all. This is called Jāgrannidrā. That’s the difference between nidrā and turīya. Śankara clearly explains the difference between nidrā and turīya thus in Śankarabhāṣya 22 on Kārika, 2 of  Māṇ. Up. 1

**दर्शनस्मरण एव हि मनः स्पन्दते। तदभावे हृद्येव अविशेषेण प्राणात्मना अवस्थानम् ।**

**Darśana-smaraṇa ēva hi manaḥ spandatē, tadabhāvē hr̥di-ēva aviśēṣēṇa prāṇa-ātmanā avasthānam.**

When the dream phase is not there, when the jāgrat phase is also not there, how do you exist? You are merely in the pulsating phase in nidrā. Chāndogya Upaniṣad (4-3-3) declares-

**स यदा स्वपिति प्राणमेव वागप्येति, चक्षुःप्राणं, श्रोत्रं प्राणं मनः प्राणं, प्राणोह्येवैतान् सर्वान् संवृङ्क्त इति ॥**

**Sa yadā svapiti prāṇaṁ-ēva vāk apyeti, cakṣuḥ prāṇaṁ, śrotraṁ prāṇaṁ, manaḥ prāṇaṁ iti- Prāṇo-hi-ēva-ētān sarvān samvṛṁkta iti.**

In nidrā, every activity has gone in to that general activity. Each specialized activity has taken a general version but has not been eliminated. Prāṇa has absorbed in its womb all the specialized activities like seeing, listening, talking, and thinking. But activity has not gone in nidrā. Therefore it comes back in the jāgṛt phase. By consciously taming the forces in jāgṛt never to re-appear again, you slip into turīya state.  Therefore a jñāni cannot become angry again, since anger has been conquered consciously-boredom has been conquered consciously-focusing has become diffused, over a phase of sādhana.

**Q.** Are we afraid of the state of Turīya?

**A.** Yes... Man is afraid of that utter non doing state. That is why one has to take things in a gentle way. My own definition of turīya is—it is a state where Jāgṛt is not amplified, nidrā is not amplified. But, that is the source from which general activity and specialized activities have sprouted. In the wakeful hours you sit and say to yourself not to worry, not to excite yourself and by such auto suggestions you reach turīya. That will be conscious undoing of forces which you have not done when you go to sleep.

Over a period of sādhana, even the verbal version, I am fine, I am not doing anything must also stop. In Nidrā we don’t have the feeling that we are happy. Obviously both the verbal version and the pictorial version stop thereby a process of slowing and softening occurs. That is why we should not be bothered about the ultimate position. That is only for academic reference.

**Q.** What do you mean by existence of thoughts in verbal or pictorial way?

**A.** Thought can exist in only two forms- pictorial version or the audio version, i.e., the verbal version. For example, when I say that I am going to Bangalore-it could be my Bangalore house. Bangalore is reduced to śabdarūpa or the citrarūpa. If you analyse still further- you may not have these two details in the mind. But you may be in the process of forming a thought which is called**Cetyonmukhata -**in a mood to know, in the process of crystallizing into a thought which can be called in my words as ‘CONING’. One can be in coning state without getting a picture or a sound for a thought to shape itself. Even that is a duḥkha sthāna. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha explains the cit_ and _cētya aspects very well:

**चेतश्चेत्योन्मुखत्वेन दुःखायायमहं स्थितः**।

**cētaḥ-cētyōnmukhatvēna duḥkhāyāyamahaṁ sthitaḥ**.   (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha. 6-9-382)

**Cit**is svarūpa** -**a diffused version of you.

**Cetya**is the one which has shaped itself in to objects**- Nāma, rūpa, karma-**picture or sound or a movement.

In between these two there is a process called **Cetyonmukhata-**in the process of shaping itself in to a thought. If Cētya has not set in, then whatever you are I (ego) - the creating phase, the attentive I--the suffering I, taxing I, tiring I. It is the jnātṛ. In nidrā this I is dropped. <u>But it is not the ultimate **‘I’** </u>

What a penetration as a scientist -Coning takes shape while formation of each thought. When the coning effect is not there, that is to say, when thoughts are not coming at all, that is the state of comfort. <u>We should sit for meditation in such a way that concentration/attention should be absent.</u> <u>Then only meditation becomes comfortable.</u>

**Q.** Why is coning not comfortable?

**A.** Because you are in the knowing phase, you should drop that knowing phase also. If you ask any person who sits for meditation, he is bound to say that he gets disturbed after ten minutes, because this knowing phase itself is burdensome. That should go in order to get ānanda or bliss in any meditation.

A child doesn’t stare. A child is not educated into staring at you- that’s the beautiful thing. If you look through an Ophthalmoscope into such eyes it shows a diffused look. We actually train the child to stare and spoil the diffusion of the child. Instead of diffusion the child develops the habit of looking into details only to observe things.

**नाल्पेसुखमस्ति भूमैव सुखं । –**(Chāndogya Upa 7-23)

**Na-alpē-sukham-asti bhūmaiva sukhaṁ.**

Bhūma is stretched state. Ānanda is not in looking at small things. But science says that you should look into small details. But Vedānta says otherwise. If you want ānanda, drop this habit of looking at small things. The indriyā-s are used to focussing. Attention is the pre state of every thought. Even in meditation, if you sit in a concerned way as to know who you are, then it is burdensome. IF you GIVE UP THAT concern, then, that is ānanda. One has to let things go or let thoughts go, and then only one can progress further. This is the truth, but it is anti performance as per science. It is a hard fact.

**Q.** Is there any upāsana mentioned in the Upaniṣads for the practice of meditation?

**A.** A very interesting incident is narrated in Chāndogya Upaniṣad wherein methods of sādhana or UPĀSANA are mentioned. It is, as it were, that the entire gamut of sādhana methods is put, in just five words.

A teacher is taking leave of his students after they have completed their course. One student however is left out and he is asked to wait. The student is very much pained and starts wondering if he had not satisfied the master.

The teacher goes out of the Āśrama for a few days and the student refuses to take food, as he is very much disturbed. He goes to the special room where agni upāsana takes place and sits quietly. Two or three days elapse and Agni which is burning in that room has a sense of guilt and offers a boon to alleviate the sin he has acquired by letting the student in Agnigṛha without food.

Agni announces- well, I give you a special wisdom as a compensation for the tapas you did so that you can liberate yourself.

**प्राणो ब्रह्म कं ब्रह्म खं ब्रह्म । -**(Chāndogya Upa. 4-10-4)

**Prāṇō brahma kaṁ brahma khaṁ brahma.**

Prāṇa is the general activity- you can go to the origin by using the śabda version of the jagat and go on softening till a threshold point comes where you are omkāra-mātrā. That also silences itself into svarūpa. You can also have prāṇa as the activity of the jagat-like emotions and feelings which are not coming in the śabda format or the dṛṣya format. To soften these, you have to do **prāṇopāsana-** by softening the prāṇavyāpara to such a level as to reach the no mind state. This is **Prāṇo hi Brahma**. Drop all complexities of the verbal version or the word version and try to stay in omkāra and you will soon be in svarūpa. Prāṇopāsana is to quench the śabda version of the jagat.

The next is** Khaṁ brahma.** Khaṁ means ākāśa. Do the **ākāśa Upāsana**- that is handling the rūpa position. Details and multiplicities are to be reduced into a mere focusing state and then expansion has to be tried. Go by the picture way- and come to a point where you are just cognizing and then smash that cognition by letting go the point formation.

The next one is**kaṁ Brahma.**Ka is ānanda. What is svarūpa? ānanda mātrā--- effortlessness. Do the anusandhāna of ānanda. **Ānanda upāsana** is to remain happy and contented at all times, relax and be at ease, even when unpleasant things are there.

That is the real prescription to a sādhaka. These are inner sādhana methods one has to take up relentlessly.


## YOGA MĀRGA (PATH OF YOGA)

**Yogaḥ citta vṛtti nirodhaḥ**as per Patanjali. **yogo cittarodhohi-**as per Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha.  In the later, through suggestions you are softening the mind and purifying it, whereas in the former, you are actually controlling the forces. I hope you see the slight difference there. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha further declares that:

**मनः प्रशमनोपायो योग इत्यभिधीयते ।**

**Manaḥ praśamanōpāyō yōga iti-abhidhīyatē.**

(Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha 3-9-132)

Mellowing the mind is termed as yoga. It is tuning the mind from the harsh state to gentle state. So, sit and quieten the mind. You decide an interval of time where your duty calls would not come and disturb you. That is the skill with which you have to work. You have to be in a relaxed state for attaining peace.

One could ask this question as to whether it is possible to soften the mind by suggestion.

Yes, it is possible. For example, when you are walking, you are fast and ahead of your wife and your wife asks you to walk slowly and you immediately start walking slowly. How did you change from walking fast to walking slow? Yoga method is naturally available in the system. This system is capable of yoga method as it is capable of adopting Jñānamārga. Both methods are compatible with human system. Manipulations are possible. You can vary the rate of the forces inside. A doctor comes to you- wants to examine the chest for inflammation and he puts the stethoscope and asks you to take deep breath. How did you vary your breathing? You did that under the instruction from a doctor. This is a facility available at all functional centers of the human system.

**Let us study the vāksthāna-**that is the place from where sounds emanate. It is possible to stretch (elongate) the śabda or sound and go to the moola or its root until a sentence decomposes into words, words decompose into letters, letters decompose into OM, and then OM decomposes into silence.. Through śabda, as a vehicle, you can apply the slowing process, until you touch the origin. Remember the famous sentence of Shri Rāmakṛṣḥṇa Paramahamsa. Sandhyā merges into gāyathri, gāyathri merges into OM and OM merges into silence.

This is beautifully shown in Mānḍūkya Upaniṣad while dealing with parts of OMKĀRA- **Akāra** as crude,**Ukāra** as sutler, **Makāra** still sutler. Then the Upaniṣad says- **amātraḥ charthopādaḥ-**there is the unuttered sound. That means, it goes to the pre state, a very sūkṣma phase, then it becomes silence- just the idea of touching the origin or swarūpa.

The next centre is the**respiration centre-**śvāsa-sthāna. Wonderful tool because it is coarse and is workable. Respiration for most of us is random, irregular and if one starts regulating the same- through the famous Nāḍiśuddhi Prāṇāyāma you get your stillness. Even hidden cellular disturbances vanish with the practice of simple nāḍiŚuddhi prāṇāyāma. The process of nāḍiśuddhi pranāyāma has to be acquired from a person who has a good knowledge about it. One should not try without guidance, otherwise one may harm oneself.

These are more external, grosser, and easier for the average man. Each one is excellent in its application, in its benefits. Much of your physiological problems are solved. In addition to giving you the peace required, the grandeur of the practice is, that all other centres get purified if one centre is taken care of**.** The inner vega is changed into naidhānya. Spiritual growth happens in you.

**Q.** Can we work on the breathing coupled with expansion techniques?

**A.** When the system is conducive, you can work. It cannot be a single tool. It can be all combinations. The whole point is that mind should become zero. It is not that some tools are superior and some tools are inferior. Anything is useful.

**Q.** Naidhānya as you say is to reduce the release of energy. Can we not do that at the breathing level?

**A.** Generally respiration is irregular. How to cultivate the slowness at the crude centre, the nostrils? Take the breath slowly, hold it and then release it slowly. After a few months of practice, you start breathing slow automatically. But the śāstra says that all this is not necessary. One has to mentally slow down. Then everything falls in place. One can recite Gayatri Mantra very fast or... could be recited leisurely. One can incorporate slowness at the talk centre or at the respiration centre.

**Q.** No doubt fastness of mind is troubling us. Fear of slowing down the mind is actually causing the mind to be fast. Is it so?

**A.** This is the problem with people who complain when they_ don’t get sleep_. If it was one day of not getting sleep, then there is no problem. The next day he starts worrying about not getting sleep. When the worry or the fear about not getting sleep aggravates or exaggerates then, he should realize that, fear must go. That fear so created, develops a bigger fastness than the existing fastness. After two days of no sleep, he tends to conclude that his system may be damaged or he may be unfit to operate. And then, fear takes away the sleep all the more. First of all he must remove this fear. Not much happens if one loses sleep for many days. System can manage it. It has a cushion. A medical friend of mine told me that two hours of sleep per day is enough for any healthy person. Some people’s system learns to relax even in the wakeful hours and hence less sleep is sufficient.

Taking every vyāpāra as a holy one is a brahma sādhana. Every indriya vyāpāra is a mechanism by which the boredom forces get diffused resulting in a relaxed state. The sunken state turns into expansive state.

**सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म तज्जलानीति शान्त उपासीत ।**

**Sarvaṁ khalu-idaṁ brahma tajjalānīti śānta upāsīta.** (Chāndogya Upa 3-14-11)

**तज्जं तल्लं तदिति  - Tajjaṁ tallaṁ taditi.**

It is born out of silence. It ends in the silence and is sustained by the silence. Upāsīta-we must take the jagat very reverentially. We are always selecting, denouncing, criticising which we should put an end to.

**कालातिवाहनायैव विनोदाय क्रियोदिता ।**

**Kālātivāhanāya-ēva vinōdāya kriyā-uditā.**

(Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha. 6-9-244)

All these kṛyās are just there to pass time! One need not run away from life and vyāpāra. Every karmakāṇḍa prescription is to quench this vega. This would be the interpretation to the benefit of the karmakāṇḍin, who did not know this benefit. He thought that God is there and that He would give him some favour. But the other part of the story here is that chittaśuddhi is happening. Karmakāṇḍin is reaping the benefits of Vedānta automatically.


## ŚUBHAKARMA (PIOUS NEUTRAL ACTIVITIES)

We have understood the main difference between Jñānamārga and Yogamārga and have studied the various methods that can be adopted to mellow the mind. The question arises now as to why we should look for other methods of sādhana when these two methods are more than sufficient to put us in the desired path.

If one carefully examines, these two paths are very difficult to adopt for common people like us who have great load of rajas and tamas compared to those who are advanced in their pursuit.

If one sits for meditation for long periods, pressure builds up at the ajnācakra and one feels like getting up. In fact if a fresher sits for meditation, in two minutes he wants to get up and be done with. That goes to prove that even two minutes of meditation is not possible. One may even end up getting headache.

If the mental composure is of that order for people like Vāmadeva or Śuka, the moment they listened to the truth they are in the state of samādhi. What about people like us then? Similarly applying yoga by slowing down the breath is also not easily possible.

That is why people like us should not try these methods unless we are under the guidance of a teacher. For most of us these methods work only in a limited way. Then how can we proceed? Is there no method for us?

When we come to sādhana, unless vāsanākşaya starts taking place in us, progress cannot be achieved. Every one of us including a sanyāsi who has given up worldly activities has to undertake continuous process of vāsanākşaya. For different people, stationed at various levels of progress, the teacher can only give the message. The student has to take up his own assessment as to where he stands in the path through extrapolation.

We all have a large stock of load or burden of vāsana that has accumulated over a long period and it is not easy for us to get a relaxed state unless we dissolve all forces like greed, anger, attachment, miserliness, jealousy and self pride. Since one overrides the other it is almost impossible for us to get away from them. Every time we make some progress, we seem to get back to the starting point. Unless serious efforts are put to contain these forces, it is not possible to get a relaxed state of mind.

Do not bother about how long it should be done. You should reach a stage where, even the questioning attitude should collapse. Udāsīnabhāva has to set in. Questioning is a severe state of mind. Searching is an energized state. By solving the question, the energy does not vanish. Only by dropping the question itself, the energy tones down. Both vāsanākṣaya and manonāśa are interdependent. We have to develop an attitude of let go of things to start from scratch.

Our ancient Rishis thought about all these and devised many simple methods to be adopted during our own life cycle to weed out the habits which are deep rooted in us. They made it mandatory for everyone to take up these programmes as a matter of discipline. They went to the extent of saying that these are ordained and not questionable. Hence they incorporated daily rituals like worship and meditation. The methods like performing rituals and offerings to God, creating many gods to suit every type of person and giving one the freedom to choose, were all meant for mellowing  the mind

All our activities are driven by rāga, dveṣa, bhaya, krodha, kāma etc. We are moulded into involving with wrong values due to loads of vāsanā-s or wrong conditioning. In view of this, we end up in generating more and more unruly forces getting very badly caught in the whirlpool of life. Karmakāṇḍapractices are devised in such a manner as not to be performed in a hurry. The objective is togain slowness. The whole intention of karmakāṇḍais to attain cittaśudhi. Knowing the implications of karmakāṇḍa and practicing the same or simply practicing without knowing the implication makes a mountain of difference.

All our ancestors, my father, my uncle, my grandfather, everybody was a karmaniṣṭha of a very high order. But, they were peaceful at the time of worship only. They would fret and fume the next moment after they are done with the rituals. That was because, they did not understand that the benefits gained from karmakāṇḍa had to be prolonged for a longer span. The peace they got from this was not continued by them, for lack of understanding of why and how of karmakāṇḍa methods.

The peace got during the karmakāṇḍa hours should percolate to the other hours also. Otherwise it has no meaning**.**Śankara’s position is very clear that all karmakāṇḍa methods are meant for purifying one’s own mind and nothing else**- Citta-śuddhyarthaṁ- चित्तशुद्ध्यर्थं.** So, karmakāṇḍa has to be practicedonly for that gain and nothing more.

So, when you are unable to sit peacefully, get into an activity <u>like religious activity, pious activity, neutral activity, mechanical activity, any passive activity. </u>The Hindu mind showed its genius this way. Do not try to sit quiet, since sādhana will not happen forcibly. Engage yourself in activities which fulfil the condition suggested here. Whole of Hindu methodology and Hindu’s everyday life is built on doing sacred pūja, engaging in religious chanting, doing japa which are all **non- exciting**.

Everyone is spending his or her energy in eating, talking chatting, and so on—All these activities can be brought under the gamut of sādhana provided, you expend the energy in such activities <u>where the mind is not disturbed in the process</u>. All such activities can be called as NEUTRAL ACTIVITIES. That is all the prescription.

This is the most important portion of sādhana wherein karmakāṇḍa practices are to be re accepted. I have coined the word for this as **ŚUBHAKARMA.**

We are going to prove here that for vedāntic gains, karmakāṇḍa is the only way though it looks incompatible. When the stock of vāsana is more the only way to reduce the same is through karmakāṇḍa practices. You go back to japa, you go back to sahasranāma paṭhaṇa, and you go back to formal pūja. Once again, this primitive, trivial, seemingly absurd lookingprogramme is what we have to go back to.

Jñānamārga would be inapplicable with students havingbig stock of rajas and tamas--even yogamārga cannot be applied. Then what is the solution for them? Do we not have a way out? And that is exactly where Indian genius has worked out wonderfully. The best of Indian research to me is thedevelopment of karmakāṇḍa details. The westerners mock at the way we have number of Gods, instead of one God. They even laugh at the idea of Gods having many wives and their children whom to be worshipped!

One can choose a god of one’s taste and preference. It is a plus point to Hinduism, not a minus point. I worship Lakshmi if I want wealth, I worship Sarasvati if I want scholarship. If I want a peaceful contemplating God, I choose Īśvara. I can design my god to suit my taste, and relate myself with the deity. This is the defence of karmakāṇḍa. The karmakāṇḍa, which is seemingly rejected, now comes as our saviour! Karmakāṇḍa caters to any human being, depending on his/her mental status. These are derived to reach the required goal. When a learned man is chanting the mantra-s with accurate intonation and one hears them, the result is a peaceful state. The peace that we have to acquire in the name of Brahmasādhana is achieved.


## SĀKĀRADHYĀNA (MEDITATION ON A FORM)

We will now discuss the details of practice to be undertaken at each functional centre. Let us first take up the **CITTA**or the mind centre.

If you sit and start contemplating on Brahma (Nirguṇabrahma), you will only waste your time ending up in developing headache. Instead, have a picture of God of your choice and engage your mind on that. It is a wonderful tool in your hands. Now you relate yourself with your Iṣṭadevata. If you are a Hindu you have many gods to choose. If you are Christian, then keep a picture of Jesus or Mother Mary. A certain amount of sanctity is also established by that process which will be helpful. You can even think of your Guru. If both god and guru are not acceptable to you, then have a candle light to gaze. You are connected with a person or thing which <u>does not excite the mind</u>.

How can likes and dislikes play when you have connected yourself with a deity? Selfishness, hurry or dislike does not come to the mind. So, the citta gets purified and at the same time energy is spent away and emptiness sets in. The required gain is there because boredom forces are spent away in this way. That means, the levels of speed and focusing come down and you have an exponential expansion. Your expansive state of mind is automatically got.

Śubhakarma is the method we should adopt since we are not fully prepared for pursuing Jñānamārga or the Yogamārga. We are not fully prepared for the first two. If your system is prepared for yoga or prāṇāyāma then it is fine. In addition, spend some hours in sākāradhyāna to establish yourself firmly on the path. There is no Hindu family that doesn’t do these things. How can it be a ridiculous point about a culture, when examinedin this light, as it takes you to near brāhmic state? If one understands this concept clearly, the shame associated with multi god concept vanishes.


## JAPA (CHANTING OF HOLY NAME)

Till now we looked at the optical centre- a picture. The next centre is the **Śabdasthāna** or sound as a medium.

When you come down to the śabdasthāna, the same principle has to work that the bothering energy must be spent away and during that process mind is not excited. The prescription given under this centre is called **JAPA.** Continuous repetition of God’s name or a Mantra or a chosen word introduced at this centre is termed as japa

This is the one tool that every teacher recommends. Every religious school does prescribe japa. The internal process involved during japa is expending the bothering energy thereby resulting in the mind becoming calm. The teacher would ask the disciple to have a name as japa during meditation practice. The reason for prescribing japa was that it would make meditation easy. Incidentally the recitation process drew all the excess energy creating relaxation.

Japa is an activity at the throat centre where sounds originate and this results in spending away most of the energy. This is at a place lower to the mind centre. Much of the prāṇic energy that is coming to the mind centre is spent away at the throat centre itself. Thus, much less energy reaches the ājñā centre (Cittasthāna) resulting in expansion. That is all the science involved. There is no religious dogma here but all religions have incorporated this part of science.

Frequently asked questions on the practice of japa.

**Q.** Should the japa be long or should it be a short one?

**A.** In the beginning, use a longer phrase. It will yield better results. That was why Gāyatri mantra was prescribed at the beginning. More energy is required in chanting this long mantra. So, feeding of energy to a higher centre is reduced and expansion process starts. The chanting is the programme and expansion is the gain. Japa by itself is not important, but the resulting expansive state is important.

**Q.** Should it be recited loud or mentally?

**A.** In the beginning both can happen. After sometime it is better to do the japa mentally. This development will automatically come when you are steadfast in sādhana.

**Q**. Should the recitation of japa be fast or slow?

**A.** The system takes care of that one. When a sādhaka is disturbed due to circumstances, then automatically the chanting becomes faster. The system manages the speed of the japa. That is the natural law there. After ten minutes or so, when some energy is spent away, the system restoration takes place and japa goes on at the required pace.

**Q.** Should it be mono-syllable or multi-syllable?

**A.** To start with multi syllable is better than OM, till the attention improves.

**Q.** Should it be taken from a Guru or can one recite without the initiation from the Guru?

**A.** If you have the conviction about the mechanism, there is no need of any Guru. If you have a sense of guilt, then go to a teacher, pay his dakṣiṇa or fees and get it from him. That may give you the necessary devotion. Use your own discretion here. I did not take to any Guru, whereas my wife went to a guru! The main purpose of this initiation is to see that you do the japa regularly and not give up and to overcome a feeling of guilt or lack of devotion. Whatever be the programme, it is the result that is more important. Please remove the fear factor that God will punish you if you were to err in your religious practices. God is highly benevolent and helpful.

**Q.** Should the japa be done only in God’s room?

**A.** Please do it if you can, but it is not necessary. You can choose any place which should be disturbance free till you attain a level of sādhana. As you progress in the path, any amount of noise or disturbance or lack of cleanliness does not bother you. It is good to be disciplined in the beginning, to make sure you are installed in the practice of regular japa. Please remember that japa is only a tool and this is also not needed after you strengthen your conviction. If thoughts can be replaced by this pure word, where can rāga, dveṣa, kāma and krodha arise? Mundane thoughts must be replaced by japa, is the intention.

A lady came to me one day and said that she took my word in letter and spirit and started the recitation. Mental chanting had become so natural that she was unable to stop the japa even when she was in the toilet. This was her worry, whether it was a right thing. How blessed she was compared to any one of us, as her whole life has become japamātrā! This can happen to one in a million. I had to assure the lady that she is blessed so much and asked her to continue the same.

**Q**. I do not believe in God’s names at all and what other mantra should I use?

**A**. You can use any word for japa as long as it does not give harmful thoughts. Look at the science behind. There is no religion here. A portion of that bothering energy is to be spent in a pious way or in an unexciting way. That is all what is needed. That’s why I termed it as mechanical activity or meaningless activity. The rule to be served is that excitement must not be there in citta. Actually there is no religious sacredness here. If you could have sacredness, it could be an added point.

**Q.** Are you prescribing this for everybody? For example even for those people who say that there is no need to go to the temples or for those who say that they can see God within themselves?

**A.** In that case there should be some other mode of expenditure through any other neutral activity. Many people do not believe in going to temples. But there is nothing wrong in it. You have the alternatives like mechanical activity, repetitive activity-meaningless activity. It is like the same biblical saying asking one to count up to ten slowly- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10- when you are angry. While doing that, the bulk of the energy is spent away which would have otherwise given rise to anger and the reaction thereof. This is the remarkable vision of the rishis.

When you are placed in helpless situation take to some type of japa. It is a mahāsādhana as all mundane forces are dissolved. Forces like speed and focusing get dropped and mind starts dying.

Japa starts decomposing itself when you know that slowing has to be practiced and whatever japa that is being uttered reduces to Omkāra.

Shri Rāmakṛṣṇa has rightly said that sandhyāvandana merges into mere GAYATRI JAPA. Gayatri japa merges into OM and OM when stretched, merges into silence and that is svarūpa. Mānḍūkya Upaniṣad puts this as- amātraḥ Caturthaḥ pādaḥ-there is no activity or vyāpāra at all when silence sets in. 

**Q.** What about mukti?

**A.** The point of importance is that we have reversed the direction. Bhagavad-Ġīta states:

**अनेकजन्म संसिद्धः ततो याति परां गतिम् ।**

**Anēka-janma saṁsiddhaḥ tatō yāti parāṁ gatim.**(6-45)

After many lives of vāsanākṣaya, purification starts and one attains the end point.

**बहूनाम् जन्मनामन्ते ज्ञानवान् माम् प्रपद्यते ।**

**Bahūnām janmanām antē jñānavān mām prapadyatē.**(7-19)

Even a Jñāni gets liberation after many many lives. That is the true position. We cannot underwrite that sādhana phase. But siddhānta is the base for sādhana; otherwiseyou have no base at all!

**Q.** If many more janmās are required for our liberation, in what way we are better than others?

**A.** We are better because we know things now about the process to become better human beings. Others may take twenty thousand lives without any improvement because they have no ways tosee the difference. In fact one is spoiling oneself by getting more angry, more jealous and craving to get more and more material things. Once you get this Jñāna, craving for things gets controlled and there is a big shift in the process of evolution. How long it takes should not be a matter of concern or a point to be bothered about.**Our happiness today is better than that of yesterday. A week after it will be still better is the point to be appreciated.**

I could not continuously sit for a few minutes without any work at one point of time, but now, once I started this sādhana, I really enjoy sitting without any prop. I was getting worked up in ten minutes then but I can now sit comfortably for four hours over a period of sādhana. That means, it is possible to stay diffused once you are in the path of sādhana.

One load of kāma or desire lessened or one load of anger decreased, results in aton of joy. That is a fact. But, whatever practice we adopt we should have the following in our mind: The elements of Naidhānya (slowing down) and Vistārata (defocusing) are to be brought in. Hurry and anxiety are to be totally avoided. <u>All our discussion and the various methods indicated mainly refer to MENTAL LEVEL</u>. Do not draw lines of demarcation between various types of sādhana-s. Each method iscomplementary and supplementary to others. Do not sit in watertight compartments. BECOME A REAL SĀDHAKA. The forces are so severe that we cannot tackle the entire stock by simply sitting. This stock of force is too big to manage and this is our problem. That is why both yogamārga and Jñānamārga fail.

**Q.** Is it not a fact that activity gives joy? If not, then what else?

**A.** The proof is very simple. Sit in the house without doing anything. That is the biggest test, to check whether you are growing in the vedāntic way or not. No wife to talk to. No kitchen where you can go and get some snacks. No music to listen to. Everybody in the world fails. Why?

This is the explanation. Continuously energy is being released. Fortunately for man, as quickly as it is released, he is expending it. The child cries away its energy. The fool talks away his energy. Man walks away his energy. A clever man thinks away his energy and therefore he is comfortable. He is spending in ever so many ways that the system becomes relaxed and therefore he is comfortable. And he gives credit to KARMA OR ACTIVITY, saying that Karma gave him joy. Spending of the energy is the only means by which you are becoming empty at the sūkṣmasthāna resulting in a no mind state. That’s givingyou joy.

This is the way we are all happy. Karma is a means of expenditure of this unbearable energy. Once that is spent away, you are in the non-doing phase. You are in Amanībhāva, i.e. you reach the no-mind state. No-activity-state is the point of joy. Whereas our notion is 'karma gave us joy', 'bhoga gave me joy'. This is ignorance.

So the advice is not to hold the huge amount of these energy forces. That is why Karmakāṇḍa in Hindu tradition is highly placed. Śankara justifies this as it leads to cittaśuddhi.

Tradition gives you a simpler method. What is this principle? Don’t hold the forces. You will injure your system and the sādhana fails. Instead of becoming softer you become irritable. For many it has happened. Sampradāya says that one should not take up sanyāsa unless he or she is fit for that. It is good togo on with one's gṛhastha āsṛama. Do not deny the ānanda that life gives you and try by getting into a harder way. There is a simpler way

**Q** Whenever we practice these neutral activities, we are likely to step into acts of indifference or tamas. Don’t you think one has to be very careful while applying this method?

**A.** Whether it is indifference or lack of application is a matter of judgement. My answer to that question is- you can be dishonest to others and pretend. But you cannot be dishonest to yourself. If you want the fruits of the action, you should not act with laziness as it amounts to casual approach. One need not run away from profession in the name of Vedānta but carry on the duties removing the hurry element. Then you are growing in respect of peace. We are prone to become indifferent in the name of vairāgya. So we have to judge ourselves carefully.

**Q.**How do you really know if tamas gave you comfort or the sādhana?

**A.** Tamas gives comfort, but tamas is not lifting. We must come out of tamas and get into satva. These śubhakarmā-sare such that they remove the tamas. Along with the removal of rāga, dveṣa, they also remove the tamas. The japa, sahasranāma, aşţottara paṭhana, formal pūja, abhisheka, śodaśa pūja- all that keeps you awake and combat the tamas.

**Q** As per your earlier statement, I am more relaxed when I am in tamas. What you mean by this?

**A.**We can take the three phases of liquid as an example. Ice is a condensed formand is confinement representing Tamas. When it becomes liquid, mobility has already set in and this state represents Rajas. When the kinetic energy remarkably increases then it gets the form of water vapour which is expansive and this state represents Satva. When the vapour molecule ruptures then that results in vyāpakatvaor anantatā.

Pṛthvi becomes āpa, āpa becomes vāyu and vāyu becomes ākāśa. Then it is pure self.

When any matter annihilates it gives out tremendous energy and when that energy spreads away it gives you silence.

I would like to repeat an excellent definition given by one of you the other day on sattva, rajas and tamas. Coming to human mind:

Desiring without actingis – **Tamas.**

Desiring with acting is ------ **Rajas.**

No desiring and acting is--- **Sattva.**

No desire and no activity is -**Turīya.**

**Q.** I had a similar difficulty. I do sahasranāma with whatever zeal I have. But somewhere in the corner of mind, I am being told that yogamārga is better for me. How will I know which mārga is good for me?

**A**. That is a good question. One has to decide for himself. For example I spend most of the time in solitude. Someone else may spend his time in work. You have to be careful not to get succumbed to sleep. You have to be alert and wakeful. Ultimately sādhakā has to tread the path carefully.

**Q.** Is it good to continue the same sādhana if it gives you happiness?

**A**. That is one good yardstick (mānadanḍa). The other test is to check whether peace and happiness have increased or not. If you are doing your sahasranāma, energy expenditure takes place and you are happy. But, is it also giving you progress in sādhana is an important point you have to test. The test is, when you sit quiet, you must be more comfortable and not pressured. Then the sādhanā-s are working. Ultimate test is –one should be comfortable without any prop what so ever. This is a very delicate question one should examine and the good point is -you should err on the safer side. Therefore do karma, instead of prematurely sitting and getting in to tamas even without your knowledge.




## OTHER NEUTRAL ACTIVITIES

For some people, japa is not sufficient for expenditure of large amounts of energy. For them, still a courser activity is required for spending the stock of energy. Japa is inner articulation. For that reason, our ancestors suggested the use of loud chanting of names of the Lord. Again this is a neutral activity. They designed the Sandhyā-Vandana which was a still coarser method. Performance of this involves time, resulting in spending larger amounts of the bothering energy.

Hindus have the practice of offering Śodaśa Pūja to God every day. They have Aṣṭottara-Nāma-s or Sahasra-Nāmā-s for each Deity. They have a number of Vrata-s which are being celebrated throughout the year. Each such Vrata is having its own discipline and code for itsperformance resulting in expenditure of energy.

The above list is not exhaustive and Karmakāṇḍa is full of such practices giving plenty of choice to us. Since japa was an inner activity and was not sufficient, loud chanting would help drain the energy. This would not only clear stock of energy but also induces concentration. Om Keśavāya namaḥ etc. was incidental. If you can watch the ājñācakra while the chanting goes on you will find that you are in comfort.

Although our elders prescribed these methods, they could not explain why such an activity was needed since they did not understand the mechanism involved. They themselves would fret and fume once they were finished with the pūja hours. The citta that had gathered a small amount of peace during the pūja would be more than spoiled soon after they came out of pūja. The gains were lost and therefore big progress could not happen. Anger did not go, depression did not go, and complaining did not go due to lack of understanding. Now that we know this, we should make use of the methods suggested to attain peace within ourselves. If the student of karmakāṇḍa knew that he was doing the pūja for cittaśuddhi then he would have extended the peace that was generated during pūja and attain better mental state. Once he knows why he has to do pūja, then the whole problem is sorted out. Minus this knowledge it was only a local gain and not a complete gain.

If present generation gets such clarity of mind, what was thought as meaningless and incompatible religious practices, becomes beneficial and meaningful.

I laughed at Hinduism in my college days, ridiculed the gāyatri japa and all that. Now, I am the very fellow advocating gāyatri to everyone. A very big scientist from an Institute in Bangalore, who swore by Sartre and ridiculed everything that is in Hinduism, is now learning Puruṣasūkta and other mantra-s, once he got an exposure to this science of Vedānta and its importance. Concentrating on GOD is not as tiring as concentrating on a mundane thing because of the role of rāga and dveṣa in the latter and absence of it in the former. That has to be taken notice of. That is why ultimately when we come to sādhana, we shift from the unholy to the holy. If you keep thinking of God, violent emotions do not bother you, do not cripple you.

A famous Mexican philosopher who knew this point advised his student to get the lessons in non doing. How did he teach? He asked his student to walk around his house clasping both the hands, keeping them behind his back, thirty times in the morning, thirty times in the afternoon and thirty times in the evening. The student took this seriously and did as prescribed by his teacher for six months. This sort of neutral activity put the student in the phase of non doing.

**Q.** Even though I am doing japa and sahasranāma the mind is getting preoccupied. How to sort this out?

**A.** Do not bother. Because, the quantum of pre occupied energy which set the preoccupying thought, is one tenth now as nine tenths are spent in japa and thus its effect is much less now.

Please note that any mechanical activity, like sweeping the floor can be turned into Yoga when you cannot sit for mediation due to inner pressure. Everyone, including me becomes helpless at certain times and the point is to ignore the helplessness and proceed with sādhana. The rush for things has to go. Vegetable cutting does not require buddhi. These methods are for a non believer in religion. One has to have some work to spend the energy- that is all the purpose of any method of sādhana. So, take up work in the kitchen which does not excite you. Irrespective of the nature of the work involved your attention should be on the result. In fact, all karmakāṇḍin-s should have got very high benefits by their practice but they did not get it. Knowing why of the method makes all the difference.

## KARMAYOGA (PATH OF SELFLESS ACTION)

If you say you have no time for doing any of the above mentioned sādhanā-s since your profession takes away much of the time, there is an alternative method for such situations. For such persons Karma yoga is the remedy.

Bhagavadgīta dwells on this in great detail and wherein Sri Kṛṣṇa elaborates on the approach to one’s activities. This, I think is the biggest research tried only in Bhagavadgīta. We shall take up the important points from that and see how it fits in to our sādhana. There are four main aspects in karma yoga.

The first presumption is-**saṁṅgaṁ tyaktvā - संङ्गं  त्यक्त्वा**.  That is, we have to do work without any excitement or attachment. This is an excellent prescription we can adopt in our life. Although it is not as easy as it is said, we can certainly make effort in this direction and improve our lives.

The second presumption is –**Phala-anusandhāna- rāhitya – फलानुसंधानराहित्य.** If you are unable to leave the excitement and or attachment to action, at least do work without always contemplating on the benefit you get out of it.

The third presumption is- **Īśvara-arpaṇa budhyā vā - ईश्वरार्पण बुध्या वा**. Just accept that you are only a proxy and the result that you get out of the work done is taken care of by HIM and you are only his obedient servant. This relationship with the Almighty, when tagged on to the work you do, gives you an expansive state.

The fourth presumption is-**Yajña dṛṣṭyā vā - यज्ञदृष्ट्या वा.** Every action performed by you can be turned into a Yajña wherein the indulgence is replaced by moderation in action. If one is invited for a lunch or a dinner with an Indian family, one has to wait patiently till all the food is served on the plate. Then the host offers the food to the Lord by saying Kṛṣṇārpaṇamastu -**कृष्णार्पणमस्तु**. Let all the food be offered to the Lord. After a brief prayer, everyone starts taking the food. This is an example of Yajñadṛṣṭi. This goes to show that one should not rush to satisfy the indulgence of the tongue. Likewise other indriyā-s can be mellowed down. Every bhoga can be turned into a Yajña. The feeling that bhoga is cheap is removed here, patience is introduced and a lesson in waiting is incorporated. If this attitude is taken up then any action could be converted into yajña. We will now study how a jnāni melts up activities of bhoga also by applying this attitude. This will be an excellent tool for sādhana.

An idiot’s suffering is due to pulls and pressures. The superior or sensitive man’s suffering is because of imagined idealism. This is very clearly brought out in TaittirĪya Upaniṣad (2-9-2):

**किमहम् साधु न अकरवम्, किमहम् पापम् अकरवम्**॥

**Kim-aham sādhu na akaravam, kim-aham pāpam akaravam.**

Normal people who are nobler in their values and notions suffer by the guilt sense of either not doing a good act or acting against their own self imposed values (For example, indulging in bhoga). A policeman in them always sits on judgement in their every act and thus citta aśānti is caused. Whereas, a Jñāni is not touched by any of these perturbations. He takes even bhoga as upāsana. Recognising the stock of conditioning (Vāsanā-s) that he still has, he involves a means to expend the bothering forces. How? When any activity including bhoga is approached with this orientation it becomes a Yajña. It is an upāsana. It is not cheap. It is feeding the agni called helplessness or restlessness by havis called involvement as in a homa. This is beautifully highlighted in Bhagavad-Ġīta (4-26) thus:

**श्रोत्रादीनीन्द्रियाण्यन्ये संयमाग्निषु जुह्वति ।**

**शब्दादीन् विषयानन्ये इन्द्रियाग्निषु जुह्वति ॥**

**Śrōtrādīn-īndriyāṇi-anyē saṁyamāgniṣu juhvati,**

**śabdādīn viṣayān-anyē indrayāgniṣu juhvati.**

Some yogis offer hearing and other senses, the temptations of indriayā-s, into the fire (agni) of restraint. Some other yogis feed fire of the senses or indriyā-s with corresponding bhogaviśayā-s or objects of enjoyment in a Yajña way. That is indulgence by bringing an element of Naidhānya. You do not approach a bhoga in a rush or restless way. Go to bhoga patiently. Take it as a havis offered by you to various fires called forces of indulgence with the corresponding viśayā-s. Quench the hunger of indriyā-s through such a Yajña. Everything is to be done as prescribed in Bhagavadgīta (4-24):

**ब्रह्मार्पणं ब्रह्म हविर्ब्रह्माग्नौ ब्रहणाहुतम् ।**

**Brahmārpaṇaṁ brahma haviḥ-brahmāgnau brahaṇa-āhutam.**

Brahman is the oblation. Brahman is the clarified butter constituting the offerings. Homa is being done by Brahman.

Apply leisureliness in all your acts and thus convert every act into a Yajña. All your conditionings get burnt away or melted away not to return again to bother you.

One should cultivate the habit of making the observer in him to slow down. When the activities are slowed down even the observer who is the mischief maker also mellows down. Mellowing process covers the observer also

In fact, Vedānta says that finally the correction should be undertaken at the observer level. However, killing the observer is a tough method like felling a tree. One has to cut the branches first before cutting the root. The following attitude helps very much.

**कायेन वाचा मनसेन्द्रियैर्वा बुद्ध्यात्मना वा प्रकृतेः स्वभावात्‌करोमि यद्यत् सकलं परस्मै नारायणायेति समर्पयामि ॥**

**Kāyēna vācā manasā-indriyaiḥ-vā buddhyātmanā vā prakr̥tēḥ svabhāvāt-‌karōmi yadyat sakalaṁ parasmai nārāyaṇāya-iti samarpayāmi.**

Whatever work I do, whether it employs my body, mind, speech, indriyā-s, intellect, or work done according to natural laws, is done in the name of the Lord and offered to Him only.

Now, I will take up questions from you.

**Q.**The very idea of reducing speed and defocusing shakes my vitals. I cannot imagine a situation where these two are not there! What is the holiness or otherwise about it. Can’t we have a better word?

**A.** A good point. Quite often speed is required, quite often focussing is also required. Holy and unholy is not the point here. If that was the point, the whole parīkṣa gets a religious shade. But, the speed with which one goes to a temple to worship also becomes burdensome.

Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (4-5-20) even goes to the extreme point of saying, that one has to give up even the desire to get liberated.**Mokṣārthitvaṁ api tyaja- मोक्षार्थित्वमपि त्यज । **

**बन्धो हि वासनाबन्धो मोक्षः स्यात् वासनाक्षयः।**

**वासनाम् त्वं परित्यज्य मोक्षार्थित्वमपि त्यज ॥**

**Bandhō hi vāsanā-bandhō mōkṣaḥ syāt vāsanākṣayaḥ,**

**vāsanām tvaṁ parityajya mōkṣārthitvam-api tyaja.**

Even the desire to get eternal happiness should be dropped if one wants liberation. The mind has to be a clean slate. So, the question of holy/unholy does not arise at all. Rather that exalted state is one of totality. Focussing at an acceptable level is burdenless. That way it is well taken. That’s why the śāstra said at one stage, to become pure, give up adharma and hold onto dharma,

And in the next stage –Mahābhārata, Shantiparva (Mokṣadharma, 329-40) declares that one has to give up both dharma and adharma when Dharma also becomes a burden.

**त्यज धर्ममधर्मञ्च उभे सत्यानृते त्यज ।**

**उभे सत्यानृते त्यक्त्वा येन त्यजसि तत्त्यज ॥**

**Tyaja dharmam-adharmam-ca ubhē satya-anr̥tē tyaja,**

**ubhē satya-anr̥tē tyaktvā yēna tyajasi tat-tyaja.**

Drop both righteousness and un-righteousness, truth as well as un-truth. Having relinquished both, give up even the desire to drop.

**Q.**Suppose you take the whole thing in a detached way, there is an auto mechanism in you that will give you relaxation instead of pressure. Is that so?

**A** By some refinement in your ways, if you can focus yet defocus simultaneously, then it is fine. Please listen carefully. I can reduce my entireness into a small shell and then focus and become a point. That is taxing. On the other hand I can retain my expansive nature and focus at periphery. This is not taxing. This is what a karmayogi will do. This is what a clever scientist could do. In fact, these are the improvements. When entireness reduces into a point then it will be suffering. Instead, once this mechanism is known, I can be much enlarged, very expansive and at a peripheral level, I can focus. That doesn’t burden me because I have a big shell. A small amount of energy filled into a bigger shell doesn’t tax me and nonetheless the gains of focusing are there.

**Q**Can you give us an example as to how focussing is possible at the periphery keeping expansion intact?

**A.**By adopting casual approach, things can go on at the periphery and you can be free from the problem of getting into a shell. That’s a matter of cultivation. If you cultivate this, then **let go** happens automatically. We call this by many terms like. Udāsīnabhāva. Anāsaktibhāva. Sākṣībhāva. These are the technical words. If any problem comes, take the stand. **'So what'.**When you take that stand you become diffused at once. In that background you can still focus. That will be productive, but not taxing. It is not taxing because you are in a big shell. It can take any amount of shock, any amount of energy inside that shell and you remain comfortable.

**Q.** This is something like our leaving everything to Lord Nārāyaṇa and get the comfort by not taking the burden on ourselves.

**A.** Exactly the same way. This is surrender bhāva. The sankocata is gone. In that background if you do research, it is not a burdensome research at all.

**Q.** When we leave the rest to GOD are we not already in the non focussing state?

**A.** Very fine. When you leave the rest to God, you are in the defocused state although you may not know the mechanism. When you take up a position as–‘oh God, you take care of me, you are there and you can solve my problems better’- the fatigue is gone. The personal element is gone. You get spreadness. In fact, a person who is in theBhaktimārga can defocus much better than or much more quickly than the yogi who struggles to tame the forces. Actually, the choice of the sādhana is yours. But, the end result must put you in that expansive state.

**Q** Can we have our own method for diffusion of mind?

**A**. Vedānta is very liberal. By whatever argument, if you can diffuse, it is accepted. If beating a table or turning a wheel can diffuse you, fine- please do it. That’s the Indian design. When you go on rounds in a temple, the very act takes away the energy. By your simple trust in God, your mind expands. Don’t bother about the method- being reasonable or unreasonable. If the result is there – take to that method.

I have envied people who can surrender in a twinkle of the eye whereby focusing goes and ego is smashed. That is the quickest method.

**Q.** Should we be bothered about the time taken for achievement?

**A**. Not even that. In fact, the more we bother about it, the more distant we are from the goal.

**Q**What about the urge to get liberation fast? Does it by any chance hinder our progress in the direction of attaining the goals? Unless there is a strong urge, there cannot be a motivation for reaching the desired results.

**A.** In fact, a recommendation in Vedānta is to give up the urge to get liberated. Therefore the advice then as per Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa is-You give up the strong desire that you are still not liberated and also give up the urge that you should get liberated somehow. If this urge to get liberated goes, then it is liberation. That urge itself is the impediment actually. One has to give up even the tools used for attaining liberation. These questions will come strongly in the minds of sādhakā-s and one has to be very careful not to be influenced by them.

**Q.** How can you explain Nishkāmakarma?

**A.** Vega or speed has to be removed and the phala anusandhāna rāhitya is to be practised. Then, the karma can be done without the burden and can be done more efficiently also. Niśkāmakarma is a karma performed without attachment to both the karma itself as well as the result thereof. Īśvara arpaṇa buddhi--leaving everything at the feet of lord and accepting whichever way the result takes you to**.**Śankara repeatedly refers to this one. Surrender the result of action to HIM and hence the taxing element is gone. Then, the result of performance is not paramount. That means you are happy as the focusing goes and the speed goes.


## PREMA AND BHAKTI (LOVE AND DEVOTION)

We went through śubha-karmamārga which was very important since we cannot always use -Jñānamārga and Yogamārga. We have to incorporate karmakāṇḍa methods of doing pūja, reciting sahasranāma, etc. as an alternative. Apart from these any karma which is not exciting can be taken up in our daily lives as a portion of our time table wherein the boredom forces can be easily dissolved. One needs to take care that the activities so taken up should not raise kāma and krodha. Number of such tricks are available and one can use them just to spend the time and energy. Forget that some God gives you benefit. It is the śubhakarma which will keep you in a peaceful mode. Unknowingly you are in a soft state of mind during those hours. You are nearer to brahmasthiti. What was left over in our study was another method which is called **Bhaktimārga- भक्तिमार्ग**, **or Prēmamārga- प्रेममार्ग**.

Prēma is a very soft state of mind compared to our several other states of mind. This is called ADŪRAKEVALĪBHĀVA- an inch removed from the peaceful state or the state of self. In contrast with violent states like anger, jealousy, etc., this is a very soft state. That is why parampara called it adūra- not removed- near to peaceful state. If a sādhaka were to stay in this soft state for longer duration, he will gently slip into that brahmasthiti which is the goal of every person.

It is difficult to describe that state! It is as good as someone trying to describe the sweetness of sugar. The only way of understanding that state is to get into it and feel that state. We have many occasions in our daily life to get into this state, as every one of us is equipped with that prēmabhāva.

The husband has returned from a tedious office job in the evening and his wife rushes to him with all smiles with a cup of coffee. The state of that woman then is called prēmasthiti.

When any one of you are walking on a street and see a small boy fall from bicycle and hurts himself you at once run to him and lift him with soothing words. You are in the prēmasthiti. On all such occasions we are in prēmabhāva.

Prēma is a natural state in every one of us**. Prēma goes with tyāga and they are inseparable constituents.** Love and sacrifice go together. If we can get it in amplified state then it becomes prēma-utkarshasthiti. That is what we see in Sri Rāmakṛṣṇa. This is called prēma-bhakti. Whatever softness we try to achieve over years of tapas, can be got in ten minutes through prēmabhāva.

While taming of mind being so difficult, one stroke of prēma can put you into soft state. Both the comforter and the comforted are in a diffused state of mind. We will take one or two examples from Mythology to see how the whole thing fits in.

It is a story from Rāmāyaṇa. We have seen in the anecdote of Bharata and Rāma, how Rāma sacrificed the throne to fulfil his father’s wishes while Bharata rejected the throne got by her mother’s wishes. Here prēma goes with tyāga. When Bharata goes to Rāma and tells him that the foolishness of his mother cannot be supportedand begs Rāma to come back and take charge, Rāma declines the offer and insists that Bharata should return and rule the kingdom. Bharata requests for his pādukā-s and keeps them on the throne and rules as a proxy.

Another episode is the situation when Rāma is returning after fourteen years of exile in the forest. He is in Bharadwāja āshrama. Rāma gets a feeling that Bharata may be interested in ruling the kingdom, in which case he was ready to relinquish it for his brother’s sake. He instructs Hanumān to ascertain from Bharata if he still wanted to be the king. What a tyāga on the part of Rāma for the sake of happiness of his brother.

On the other hand, study the case of Bharata. He did not have iota of displeasure on Rāma’s return. In fact, he was eagerly awaiting his arrival. Here we see that the sacrifice of Bharata is of a much higher order than that of Rāma. Rāma thought that Bharata would be on the throne clad gorgeously and having looks of a King. But, we find Bharata in a ṛṣi’s attire, living in the parṇakutira (a thatched hut) forty miles away from Ayodhya along with āśrama inmates. He was with knotted hair, emaciated by the separation from his brother, eating only fruits available in the forest and looking virtually like a tapasvi. With utter self control, he was ruling the kingdom typically as a trustee. Bharata is so excited to hear the news of Rāma returning andgets ready to serve his brother after handing over the kingdom. This is an instance of prēma and tyāga reaching the exalted state.

The next situation in Rāmāyaṇa is Rāmā’s coronation ceremony where, after the event, gifts are to be given. The gifting ceremony is going on and the respected dignitaries are presenting themselves before Rāma. The last person in the line is Hanumantha. Rāma is at a loss as to what gift he should give him. Hanumantha was everything to him and he cannot equate any commodity to the love and service of Hanumān. The series of events that took place in Rāmyaṇa was because of him. It was impossible for Rāma to decide what gift he could give him when he was with him although. He decides that the best thing that he can give is a warm hug and so he gets down from the throne and hugs him with tears rolling down his cheeks. In turn, Hanumān says that his life has become worthwhile. Both are charged with emotion with the sense of gratitude and sense of fulfilment. That is the state of ecstasy and is the culmination in prēmabhāva.

Another example we can take from Mahābhārata- the case of Draupadi who is a famous mythological character and who thrived by Prēma and Bhakti. In the cases of Dūrvāsa ātithya, the Vastrāpaharaņa and restoration episode in the court of king Dṛtarāṣṭra, etc, Kṛṣṇa assures her every time and her wishes are fulfilled. God comes to the rescue of bhakta whenever the devotee is in an exalted state of prēma and bhakti. He goes to the level of bhakta and helps him. He did not preach Vedānta at that time. Here, we should see the subtle difference between the two. Prēma has a touch of intimacy. In Bhakti the familiarity is replaced by reverence. Both are soft states but Bhakti carries an aspect of reverence.

**While prēma goes with tyāga, Bhakti goes with reverence, submission and surrender.**

In arpaṇābhāva, ego is dropped. When you go to the Divine as a bhakta, a wonderful mechanism is operating there. You are surrendering to HIM without any scheming or planning. Aham and mama (me and mine) are both gone. Quietening of mind happens instantaneously. Even a hard core scientific person becomes soft in this mood. Whenever you touch the feet of an elder person you get into that soft state. This is the beauty of Bhakti.

Triputināśa happens for a Jñāni by vairāgya. For a bhakta, the same thing happens by a simple surrender. Both of them reach that state which is the abode of peace.

So to conclude, Prēma and Bhakti are the best tools in the hands of man to attain the brahma- bhāvana. All other methods require effort and discipline to attain the same state. One of the best methods of sādhana is the Prēmayoga or the Bhaktiyoga. One has to get convincedabout the importance and then it is easy to attain the state.

**Q.**Prēmabhāva with God is alright. But, when you extend this to our own family members like wife, brother, sister and children, due to our vāsanā-s we don’t get that reverence or the poojyabhāva. A sort of bondage or attachment is created which is an impediment to our goal of vairāgya. How to break this and get away from that likely bondage?

**A.**It is a very good question. We have to forget the attachment or moha component here. In most of the cases, prēma supersedes the moha element. The contentment that mother and the son get between them masks the moha aspect. This in turn gives a spiritual lift. The special interest we take in our kith and kin is a negative part of the whole story, whereas we have to see only the upliftment part in prēmabhāva. One has to be a conscious sādhaka and should not get involved in moha. Only then it becomes universal, even among family members:

**सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः ।**

**सर्वे भद्राणि पश्यन्तु मा कश्चित् दुःखभाग्भवेत् ॥**

**Sarvē bhavantu sukhinaḥ sarvē santu nirāmayāḥ,**

**sarvē bhadrāṇi paśyantu mā kaścit duḥkhabhāgbhavēt.**

May all be happy.

May all be free from disabilities.

May all see the good in others.

May none suffer from sorrow.

Then, the above concept begins to set in the mind. In the whole process, ego should vanish and that is the main concern for the sādhaka. You should understand that when the mind becomes empty at that moment of prēmabhāva, where is the question of moha?

**Q.** The ecstasy developed through prēma can cause a lot of mental damage. How do we rate this?

**A**. There is certainly an element of torment, no doubt. This is because of the excitement element without which one may not get the adūrakevalībhāva.

**Q**. But most of the bhaktā-s turn hysterical?

**A.** The deep involvement in the bhajan and the dance puts them into deep levels of emptiness because of the huge energy expenditure. There is gentle load on the system which makes them go out of tune. But, that is only momentary. After years of training when mahāshānti sets in, this also will crumble down. Forgiving becomes natural and one does not have any enemies in the world. Fault finding stops for such a person.

In Nārada Bhakti Sūtra, there is a definition of prēma which can be easily distinguished from kāma-**tat sukha sukhitvaṁ- तत् सुख सुखित्वम् - Gopikā prēmavat, rādhāprēmavat- गोपिकाप्रेमवत्, राधा प्रेमवत्**. What is so special about Rādhā or Gopikā-s when they loved Kṛṣṇa? When they loved him it was for his joy and not for their personal joy. It was for the comfort of Kṛṣṇa and not for their comfort. Rukmiṇi's prēma and Satyabhāmā's prēma are gently different. Satyabhāma wanted Kṛṣṇa to alleviate her boredom and bring in contentment. Kṛṣṇa was for her joy. Whereas, Rukmiṇi found comfort in attending to Kṛṣṇa and making him happy.

The gains of doing ten days of tapas can be had by one stroke of surrender. You must watch a simple housewife. How she surrenders to the Lord saying that she is helpless and unable to solve the problems. She says that she is too small to do tapas and difficult sādhana. She can only surrender and get mentally assured that Lord will take care of her---

**अन्यथा शरणं नास्ति त्वमेव शरणं मम ।**

**तस्मात् कारुण्यभावेन रक्ष रक्ष जनार्दन ॥**

**Anyathā śaraṇaṁ na-asti tvam-ēva śaraṇaṁ mama,**

**tasmāt kāruṇya-bhāvēna rakṣa rakṣa janārdana.**

I have no other refuge, Thou art my sole refuge,Out of sense of compassion, protect me, O Supreme Lord!

This is called **Śaraṇāgatibhāva, शरणागतिभाव -**, or **prapattibhāva- प्रपत्तिभाव or arpaṇabhāva-**. In a minute the ego is destroyed and the mind surrenders. This is a very quick method which we cannot underscore. In a stroke it can bring down the citta to zero level. A house wife can be very much successful in Bhakti and surrender.

I did all this detailed study in order to drive home the point in you that our forefathers had such excellent lofty ideas and ideals. We should wonder at the skill of the vedāntic Indian researcher in formulating this wide range of sādhanā-s. After this research, all my questions were solved.

That is why one cannot say which sādhaka is at a higher level and which sādhaka is at lower level. That is in bad taste. Whosoever works, with whatsoever tasks, is a noble soul and we should offer our prostrations to him. Any school of thought for that matter has to be accommodated. Even the crudest way of pūja when I see, I feel wonderful in my heart and I get into a trance. Do not decry the simple austerity measure under taken by the women in the house, like fasting in the night for satisfying the pūja requirements. Do not laugh at her daily bhajans or śloka chanting. You dare not make a word of censure there. You may do things different from her methods, like prāṇāyāma, āsana, etc. Every method is holy by itself.

**Q.** When you are referring different methods of sādhana, you mentioned that it is slow and takes time to achieve. But how do you say that surrender brings in instant results? If that is so, then why people ignored this method?

**A.**The surrender is one of the tools to empty the mind because one completely negates one’s role. In the process, reduces his ego to such a level that the mind becomes empty, thus putting one in peace. But this also is not an easy method. It requires a **lot of courage and conviction**to do this. The immense faith in the Almighty that he would solve the problem, cannot come all of a sudden.

But the one good thing is that ego is almost killed in this process very fast. In other methods, we are taming the forces by bringing down focussing and speed. This also is time dependant, as de conditioning is not instantaneous.

In other methods, ‘I’ has to be removed consciously. Whereas, in surrender the 'I' is easily done away by asserting that you do not have a role and leave it to the Almighty to take care of things. The Jñānamārga may suit one. The Yogamārga may suit another. Karma Yoga may look easy for some. Samarpaṇabhāva or Bhakthimārga may be easy for some other. So, each one has to do some introspection and take to what is best for him and remain steady in that practice with all humility and conviction that the path chosen will certainly lead to the goal. After all, we are doing all this to achieve inner peace.

You should know that there are two 'I's. One is the thinking 'I' and the other is an emotionally caught 'I' or the focusing 'I'. Vega and focussing were the burdens in which my 'I' was resting. When the attentive 'I' goes, what is the residue? In what form can this 'I' stay? This is the last lakṣaṇa of the 'I", the thinking 'I'.

Show me an 'I' beyond that. Ahaṁkāra is not vanity. It means that I am a doer. The doer at the cittasthāna is the thinker. Thinker or the thinking is the last lakṣaṇa of the vulnerable 'I' or the suffering 'I'. When that goes where is the 'I'? It is an expansion-brahmasvarūpa. Inśaraṇāgati, you surrender yourself. That means you surrender thinking or the thinking 'I'.

But, when you are looking at the process of surrender, you are still in the ego state. The observer also has to be surrendered. It is easy to surrender bhoga and other things. But, one has to surrender the mischief maker, lingering fellow, i.e., the observer. That is why samarpaṇa method becomes easier than other methods, only when you understand the mechanism. In other methods you kill the 'I' by not doing, not thinking, and not getting excited and this is a matter of time and effort.

**Q.** Sir how do the pursuits and goals that one has set up fit into vedāntic pursuit of happiness?

**A.** That’s a very good question and a very contextual question. What else can be a goal of man? It ought to be one’s happiness or the happiness ofone’s near and dear? If you are more liberal it can be the happiness of the globe. **Sarvē bhavantu sukhinaḥ -**सर्वॆ भवन्तु सुक्खिन:**.** Let all beings be happy throughout this Universe.Every pursuit of man, trivial or profound, is in the direction of happiness. At the smallest level, it is indriyabhoga**.** At the next level, it is the joy of achievement. At a still higher level, it is the joy of service, giving something worthwhile to the society at large. Everything becomes Joy, comfort, ānanda. Why does one serve staying by the side of a sick patient spending six hours of the night? It is to get the joy of comforting the sick. Don’t you think that this joy is superior to others? Nonetheless it is the joy of comforting a human, the sick person. Everywhere the ultimate motivation is ānanda and sukha.

Thank you, one and all, for staying with me and sharing my thoughtsall these days and I hope that all of you attain inner peace, which is the only thing to be attained in this world. Benefit by the vedāntic truths and lead a happy life as Upaniṣad-s proudly announce:

**जीवेम शरदश्शतम्।**

**नन्दाम शरदश्शतम्।**

**मोदाम शरदश्शतम्॥**

**Jīvēma śaradaśśatam,                                               Nandāma śaradaśśatam,**

**Mōdāma śaradaśśatam.**


## DHARMA (RIGHTEOUNESS) – AS A TOOL OF SĀDHANA 

_Shastriji”s concept of Dharma throws light on a variety of modern way of thinking and the apprehensions of the younger generation regarding the old value systems enunciated in the dhārmic principles. A totally new dimension has been opened by Shastriji by way of his arguments which capture the imagination of the youngsters.  His primary aim of using any method to tame the mind to attain peace and tranquillity leads one to think positively about applying dhārmic tenets in one’s own daily lives as a means of sādhana to achieve happiness.  The reader has to keep this in mind while reading the chapter on Dharma as a means of sādhana   ---  Editor_

The truths of the Upaniṣad-s form the theoretical base, supporting the other two components namely Karma and Dharma. We have a wing called Karmānuṣṭhāna which is prescribed by the Karmakāṇḍa portion of the vedas, with so many rituals, pūjā-s, prayers, Gods, demigods and their spouses. You can call them power centres if you don’t like the idea of Gods.

The same can be compared to a central Government where in, we have a Prime Minister and many subordinate ministers who are conducting duties as per the instruction of their head. There is a replica of what is in our macrocosm life. For example, Varuṇa represents the water component, Agni represents a thermal component, Sūrya represents a light component etc.

There is a cetana, which by a powerful kumbhana establishes a potential as a result of which, kinetic energy can flow. He can keep on releasing thermal or light energy which is backed by a terrible kumbhana. Our kumbhana (holding the breath) is of half minute duration. When you go to your expansive phase, you can have a kumbhana outside of your body and that can be established for years. That is how these power centres are operated.

Closely integrated with the karma aspect, there is the Dharma aspect also. This is the sādhana portion of the karmakāṇḍa. The theory portion of Dharma is covered in the message of Upaniṣads. Man thought that sukha was in the objects of enjoyments and the indriyā-s connecting them. A connection between the viśaya and viśayi gives us the sense of joy. That is a surface truth. But the real truth is that when viśaya and viśayi come together, the joy or sukha results in an empty state of mind.

See the enormous difference between the first and the second conclusion. Eating gives me joy. Any sweet dish gives me joy. The corresponding indriya and the required object getting a contact produces the happy state – 

**विषयिविषयसम्बन्धजनितः सुखः॥**

**Viṣayi-viṣaya-sambandha-janitaḥ sukhaḥ.**

If the question was pushed further as to what gave you joy inside, the answer would be that the mind became empty because of a peculiar mechanism of contact. The real content of happiness is not in the bhogavastu. It is only a means, but in reality, citta or the mind becoming empty by which you touch your nijasvarūpa or brahmasvarūpa. This is the common thing in the whole of Universe which is brahmamātrata. A terrible silence or a terrible non doing principle is the basic composition of everything on this earth. The essence of Indian thinking is to realize this and experience that non doing state—which is otherwise known as attaining MOKṣA, which is the goal of every one.

Dharma_, _artha_, _kāma and mokṣa, are the four puruśārthā-s_ - _is the essence of Indian thinking. Indian vision has given utter clarity about these and there is no mystery about this. Every time you are in happiness, you are touching your source. A magnified version of that joy is svarūpa. If you are continuously there in a steadfast way, that is liberation. Karmakāṇḍa leads you to that state. Taming the unruly forces is the point of importance in karmakāṇḍa.

Dharma is also a portion of karmakāṇḍa. Dharma is the practical side of knowledge. It is the working region of the theory we have learnt through upaniṣadic study.

What is Dharma? A simple definition of Dharma is very difficult. Our sages have given three or four orthodox definitions. They are biblical in their representation. We shall look into them.

**धारणात् धर्म इति अभिधीयते** ॥

**Dhāraṇāt dharma iti abhidhīyatē**.

One thinker puts a definition as, ‘anything that holds on to is Dharma’. The universe is held -the cosmic flow is maintained and therefore it is Dharma. Whatever sustains the progress of the universe is dharma. It sounds dignified but that does not help in our practice**.**

**धर्मो रक्षति रक्षितः  - Dharmō rakṣati rakṣitaḥ**.

If you practice dharma, dharma itself takes care of your welfare. Your Iha- इह and Para- पर are taken care of if you live in a dhārmic way... Again this definition also is vague as far as its practice is concerned. Śankara always gives importance to this, as it is more orthodox -

**चोदनालक्षणःधर्मः  - Cōdana-lakṣaṇaḥ dharmaḥ  -**

Wwhatever śāstra is telling you in terms of dos and don’ts is dharma.

All these do not give us a sustainable position as far as practice is concerned. This is more orthodox in nature. This also did not help me when I went as an earnest research student. Notwithstanding this difficulty, we have number of dhārmic tenets or dhārmic practices observed in every Hindu home even without knowing definition of dharma. In Taittirīya Upaniṣad-Śikshāvalli, the following are a few dhārmic injunctions:

**Satyam vada, Dharmam cara- सत्यं वद धर्मं चर।** Always speak the truth and follow dharma.

**मातृदेवो भव, पितृदेवो भव, आचार्यदेवो भव।**

**Mātr̥dēvō bhava, pitr̥dēvō bhava, ācāryadēvō bhava**

Hold Mother as God, Father as God, Teacher as God etc. These are all orders from a guru to the disciple when he leaves the ashram after the study.

Whereas it is not mandatory in the west to take care of their parents in their old age, it is a dictum in Hindu Dharma. All the problems of providing separate shelter and facility for the old are just struck off by an injunction in Hindu tenets which says that they have to be looked upon as ‘gods’ and hence to be cared for. What a safe society it becomes when dharma tenets are applied? **Mātr̥vat paradārāṁśca  - मातृवत् परदारांश्च**। Look at this great thinking. Every woman other than your wife is a mother like to you. If man were to practice this dharma, all crimes born out of illegitimate relationships get routed out and society becomes safe. Rape and kill is a very common affair now a days and this can be eradicated if one were to follow this tenet. In Taittirīya Upaniṣad (3-7, 8) we have following mantra:

**अन्नं न निंद्यात् तद्व्रतम् ।**

**Annaṁ na niṁdyāt tadvratam.**

**अन्नं न परिचक्षीत तद्व्रतम् ।**

**Annaṁ na paricakṣīta tadvratam.**

**अन्नं बहुकुर्वीत ।**

**Annaṁ bahukurvīta.**

**न  कञ्चन वसतौ प्रत्याचक्षीत तद्व्रतम् ।**

**Na kañcana vasatau pratyācakṣīta tadvratam.**

His vow is that he should not deprecate food. One should not neglect food. One should try to increase the quantity of food one has. If someone comes and asks for a place to stay, one should not turn him away.

Taken in a worldly sense, if the money earned by whatever means is used for making food and distributing, then it is not unholy. What a daring statement! Even a scoundrel cannot be denied food. Nobody should die of starvation was the motto. So far as other gifts are concerned, one has to see merits and demerits in distribution but not when it comes to cooked food.

**Dāna** and **Aparigraha**are the next two important tenets. Half the crime in our society is due to hunger and wrong sex. Once the society is assured of the food and shelter, where is the crime? Big issues are simply taken care of by a simple practice of this tenet of Dharma. Every Hindu family indulges in charity. From the birth of to the cremation stage, charity is practiced.

If you see a Hindu lady performing a ritual, she gives away a coconut along with a piece of cloth, as gift after the pūja. Tagged on to that is aparigraha. As far as you are concerned, you politely refuse a dāna and say that you are bound by a ritual and cannot accept anything. Though you are in need, you refrain from taking, just to protect dharma. These two disciplines are put on a high pedestal. If practiced by all, there cannot be poverty in the society. If haves can decide to lead a simple life, their excess money will flow back to society for welfare of the needy.

While we have any number of dhārmic tenets in our society, I am not able to get at one single definition by which I can classify an act as dhārmic or otherwise. What is the common factor in all these dhārmic tenets? We still do not have a clear vision of Dharma. This calls for a deeper study of dharma. While this is one aspect of Dharma, we have another aspect where there is an excuse even when the dhārmic tenets are broken.

Let us take the case of Ahalya who was the dharma patni of sage Gautama. She fell in love with Indra who stealthily came and had sex with her and then she is cursed by the sage and becomes a stone. Rāmapāda sparṣa releases her from that state and then the ŗşi Gautama accepts her. Here, we have to see an important point. A pativrata who has to keep herself committed to dharma by thought, deed and action (kāyā vācā and manasā) had erred and keepers of Dharma could have banished her. But the Ŗşi accepts her. How do we justify Dharma here? We feel that there is an inconsistency. We have given the status of a mahāpativratā to Ahalya in spite of specific violations of dharma.

Take the case of Draupadi. While the pātivratya-dharma allowed only one husband, she is a woman who takes five men and still considered a pativratā. Our own definitions are contradicted and there seems to be no consistency in dhārmic values, is the argument of a modern day thinker. Can we be so foolish as to be inconsistent?

Take the case of sage Parāśara. He has come near a shore and is waiting for a boat. He sits in a boat and sees that a girl is rowing the boat. He invites her for company. She is shocked and is reluctant and says that she is still a virgin. She requests the sage to take the permission of her father as she has no objection to marry him as he is a worthy person. The sage brushes away her request and persuades her. The girl is afraid that a Mahaŗṣi can curse her and accepts the request reluctantly and that event gives birth to Vyāsa. If we examine this incident, even ordinary persons like us would not have done such a thing. This urgency is not pardonable. Situation is all the more important since he is a Mahaŗṣi. It is surprising to note that he is called Bhagavān Parāśara before the act and after the act also. Look at the complexity.

When we come to the story of Kṛṣṇa, it is terrifying again. He is called a thief till he was five, when he is a boy he is an eve teaser, when maturity comes he is an unscrupulous fighter in warfare. To protect the Pāndavā-s in their war against the Kauravā-s, he makes Ghatodgaja- a victim, Abhimanyu- a victim. Karṇa is treacherously handled. Bhīşma is cleverly disposed of. Droṇa is made to give up arms at the stroke of a lie. Despite this, he is considered as God. Can Dharma be so bad?

Dharma which looked so simple, takes up such strides where specific violations of dharma have been committed. Overlooking these objections, all the above involved characters continue to be glorified in religion. So, there is a need to go deep into the study of dharma. To substantiate all these and accommodate them in the tenets of dharma, bothered me for years... I had to do five years of research to get some satisfactory answer.

We shall try to define dharma. If one has to give a simplest initial definition, one can say dharma is** NYĀYA.** Nyāya is, good returned with good. If you give me a gift on a festival day, it is reasonable for me to return the same on some other day. It follows therefore - bad returned with bad also. This is called tit for tat - Punish the evil and reward the good is a vision of nyāya. This is all the scope of nyāya and no further. But dharma goes beyond nyāya. What is that which goes beyond this nyāyadṛṣṭi and offers something more? Where does dharma excel nyāya?

To give an example, take the case of professor who earns a fat salary. His neighbour is a poor school master who earns a meagre salary. The professor celebrates festivals with all pomp and pleasure where as the school master celebrates the same in a very humble way. Professor does not share his wealth with the school master. He need not do that. This is nyāyadṛṣṭi. If on the other hand, he understands the situation and goes to the neighbour with some gifts and sweets and offers them to the teacher without hurting the pride of the teacher, then he has lifted himself from the levels of nyāya to the regions of dharma. See the difference. He is setting a new dimension which was not available till then. Sharing is not an obligation here. A virtue called sharing has come into the picture here. This is how dharma excels nyāya. We have number of examples in our life to substantiate this point.

I have the example of a colleague of mine who led a bachelor’s life and was very miserly as far as his comforts were concerned. But, he had the greatness of looking after his mother who was eighty years old, spent all his money and got his six sisters married. This was the level of sacrifice he did, ignoring his own personal life. He would go to the extent of paying the fees of students in his class who were not in a position to meet the deadline. This is not called for in the regions of nyāya and goes somewhere beyond.

Many references from the Upanişad-s are available and I will place before you a story from one of them. Three representatives, one from Devaloka, one from Dānavaloka and one from Mānavaloka went to Prajāpati, the creator, to seek wisdom. Prajāpati, being a very inert person uttered only one word ‘da’ to satisfy all the three of them. Each person understood this as it suited him. The devatā-s took it as ‘dama’, the dānavā-s took it as ‘dayā’ and the mānavā-s took it as ‘dāna’. Dānava-s thought that they were very harsh. So they felt that they should show compassion and be less cruel. They felt that they had to cultivate dayā. Manavā-s thought that they had to practice dāna as they were miserly and the devatā-s understood that they had to have moderation in their indulgence and took it as Dama,

These three can be taken as the tenets of dharma. We were trying to search for a right definition as to which is the right dhārmic trait and now we have these three aspects which can be used to test them. Dayā or **Prema,**Dāna or**tyāga**and Dama or** nigraha **are the three aspects of the dharma principle. If anything is valuable in any religion it is these three things. Even Jesus Christ approved of these three aspects for a holistic living. Compassion was not available in the regions of Nyāya till the above dhārmic tenets were introduced in the religion.

We can now see the subtle shades that distinguish one from the other. In the eastern world we can give examples of hundreds of persons who practiced dharma. Now that we have a complete definition of dharma, one is considered dhārmic if any one of the three principles mentioned above is practiced. I will take three examples from epics to show these aspects-**Compassion**or prema,**charity**or tyāga and **control**or nigraha.

I will take an episode from Rāmāyaṇa. The situation is the coronation of the heir to the throne of King Daśaratha. The king has decided to appoint Rāma as his heir and an announcement to this effect has been made and the message is conveyed to queen Kaikeyi. Kaikeyi does not approve of this and wants to cash on the two boons the king had given to her some time ago. She wants Rāma to go to the forest for fourteen years and her son Bharata to be installed on the throne. King Daśaratha is bound by his words to the queen. Kaikeyi manages to get Rāma to her chambers to inform the decision.

The context here is very important. Rāma has been accepted as king and preparations are in full swing and there is joy everywhere. Rāma expects that he would be greeted by both the king and the queen. But the queen tells him otherwise. What a lift at the announcement of coronation and what a fall when he has been told that he has to go to forest, clad in the dress of an ascetic. There was not a simple frown on Rāma’s face. That showed the preparedness of Rāma for upholding dharma, by honouring the word given by his father to the queen. He was ready to accept the order at the drop of a hat and give up kingship. But the queen is in a hurry to send him away as quickly as possible to make sure that Rāma did not change his mind. That was her anxiety. Rāma is called maryādā- purusha as he was never disturbed at any time. Rāma tells the queen that he will not change his mind even if the world tries to persuade him, since he has accepted the order of the queen who is like mother to him. This is where we can see the difference between Nyāyadṛṣṭi and dharmadṛṣṭi.

In front of all other queens and sage Vasiṣṭha, Lakṣmaṇa, the brother of Rāma, argues and tells his brother that there is no need for him to go to the forest and puts forth three points to support the Nyāyadṛṣṭi. Firstly, it is the birth right of the eldest son to become the king. The promise or boon given by the king has no place there and Rāma need not fulfil his promise. Secondly, the king being old seemed to have lost his senses and is unable to decide which is good and which is bad and hence there is no need to obey the king. Thirdly, the king seems to have got attracted by the young queen by blind love, hence Rāma need not take the word of the king seriously. If they decide to take the kingship by force, as his brother, he would singlehandedly destroy them. Hence, Rāma should not have any fear in ignoring the words of the foolish queen. He further asserts that Rāma is the most deserving son of Daśaratha for kingship. This was the Nyāyadṛṣṭi put forth by Lakṣmaṇa. Even Kausalya and sage Vasiṣṭha also say that the order is unjust. Rāma at this juncture puts forth his points in favour of his decision. He says that one should not look at the issue as put forth by Lakşmaṇa. That was not the way of studying the problem. There is no place for debate when the duty of the son is, to obey the father’s words and free him from that burden. The dharma of any son is to protect the words of the father. Under such a situation, no argument to dislodge the order was acceptable. So, the case is settled as dharma tenets have to be upheld and arguments of Nyāya do not fit in. When other equally noble souls argue on the basis of Nyāya, Rāma takes a different stand upholding the dhārmic values. This shows up to what level one can go and be mentally prepared to accept whatever comes in the way. That was how Rāma applied nigraha and tyāga components of Dhrama.

Another example from Rāmāyaṇa is worth mentioning where Rāma acts in a balanced way when the war between him and Rāvaṇa becomes imminent. He was told that Rāvaṇā’s brother Vibhīşaṇa, with his four followers, is coming to his camp. A deliberation is on whether to accept him or not since he is from the enemy quarters. Rāma is quietly watching when Sugriva says that Vibhīşaṇa should not be let in as he might be having foul motives. He may be trying to find out the war strategy. Lakşmaṇa is in agreement with that point of view. Hanumantha at this point makes a balancing act by saying that he has judged them as noble souls when he visited Lanka for the first time. Hence, they should be given a hearing. Rāma, after listening to all these arguments, says that the case here is not of any fear of someone with evil designs. Being a kshatriya, it is his Dhrama to give protection to anyone who came to him for help. Vālmiki’s śloka from Rāmāyaṇa is excellent here**.**

**सकृदेव प्रपन्नाय तवास्मीति च याचत ।**

**अभयं सर्वभूतेभ्यः ददामि एतद्व्रतम् मम॥**

**Sakr̥dēva prapannāya tava-asmi-iti ca yācata,**

**abhayaṁ sarva-bhūtēbhyaḥ dadāmi ētat-vratam mama.** (VālmikiRāmāyaṇa)

Rāma is at his best- If a person comes _to_ him once saying that he is helpless and is at his mercy, he will give protection from all the enemy forces which is acting against him. This is the dharma of a kşatriya and particularly of a king like him.

These are lessons to show us how dharma differs from Nyāyadṛṣṭi and how far you can stick to dharma if you so desire and make your life noble.

Now we take another story of Bhīşma from Mahābhārata. We know about the King Śāntanu and Bhīşma is born to him from Queen Ganga. He is also known as Devavrata. One day while Śāntanu was hunting, he feels a fragrant smell and follows the trail of that and finds a girl of eighteen. He falls in love with her. He is unable to express the pangs and gets depressed and stays lonely in the palace. Devavrata comes to know of this and tries to find out the reason through the people who had accompanied his father on the hunting trip.

He goes in search of that girl (matsyagandhi, girl with fragrance due to the boon given by sage Parāśara) and informs her father that King Śāntanu had sought her for marriage. The father of the girl is happy and puts a condition that the son born out of his daughter should be made the king of Hastināpur. This was a very big request to be accepted as Devavrata could lose the position of a king. But, he readily obliges and takes a vow that even his children would not take the throne. To fulfil this end, he would remain a bachelor. He made two promises that he would reject not only the kingship but also marriage with any woman. This was a terrible sacrifice for the sake of his father. Even the devatā-s were stunned by such an impossible vow. And they named him Bhīşma.

This goes to show to what level one can sacrifice to make a mark for himself. If any one of us were in that position, we would not have dared to make such a promise. We would have probably advised our fathers that they should abandon the lust at that age! We would have asked them to change their ways if such a situation arose. But here is a boy of eighteen or twenty who deserved the company of a woman more than his aged father, at the drop of a hat, agrees to the request of not only losing his right to marry but also lose the kingship. While we are always tempted to go by Nyāyadṛṣṭi, Devavrata went by the Dharmadṛṣṭi.

The next example is the story of Karṇa from Mahābhārata. Karṇa is a tragic hero of Mahabhārata, unfairly treated by the mother. Karṇa was invincible and Indra, who was anxious of the safety of his son Arjuna, comes in the disguise of a Brahmin. Indra knew that Karṇa had a vrata that he would not refuse the request of anyone who came to him asking for a help especially when he is doing the ritual of Arghyapradāna (oblations). Indra demands that he should part with kavaca which was with him since birth, by pouring water along with the gift. In spite of warning by his father Surya who clearly tells Karṇa that the person who has come to ask is none other than Indra himself and the gift would result in his death in the battlefield, Karṇa still obliges the Brahmin. That was the Dharmadṛṣṭi, where as the Nyāyadṛṣṭi is to think whether or not it is right to oblige when a seeker comes with a foul intention. Karṇa, who respected his vrata more than anything, did not care if the intention of the seeker was good or bad.

So, these are examples to show in a subtle way how a Nyāyadṛṣṭi differed from Dharmadṛṣṭi and are examples to reach those ideals as much as we can. But, the real question begins here.

Here, let us recollect the incident which I narrated some days ago wherein the post doctoral student of Theology rejected the religious tenets outright stating that religion is a joy killer.

Can you see the ruthless attack on religion in two directions! It has no self defence by way of arguing itself as right. Everyone wants to have a free life of indulgence and thinks it is his right. Indulgence gives him joy. More indulgence is more joyful. It is quite a natural demand as the purpose of life is happiness.  religion can probably defend itself against such a reasonable attack.

We cannot call that student foolish to be dismissed or ignored as he is a post doctoral student. The student in question says that unless the religion or the advocates of religion, give a justifying answer, he is not satisfied. The best part of the booklet was that the teacher confesses that he had no answer nor he could find any answers in the religious texts.

In the present days, if one observes the world over, youngsters are going into ways of too much of distraction and spoiling themselves in the name of worldly pleasures which are giving them misery instead of happiness. So, tenets of Dharma have to be carefully studied and adopted in every mode of our life.

Most of us argue that dhārmic principles are dependent on time and place and so also nyāya and there is no constant factor. That is the problem we are facing today. If Dharma had the constancy and is independent of time, then all our religious practices should not have changed. Most of us do not practice them. In the days of religious tightness, lot of prescriptions used to be there and people adhered to them. Whether Dhārmic values should remain intact and rigid is to be answered when we think of redefining Dharma.

It is possible to restructure Dharma when we are in a position to understand the why of Dharma and have a full vision of dharma. Our notion earlier was dharma is for dharma’s sake. Now we have a higher vision. Whereas, all of us thought that the values of Dharma are highest, the doctoral student threw a challenge on us. He insisted that prema, tyāga and nigraha are simply a negation of indulgence. He went on to say that sukha was in Bhoga and religion was putting a check on his joy.

The student is right in saying that everybody is in need of joy. That cannot be questioned. But then, it can be shown, by applying restraints, which is the best factor of every religion, everlasting joy can be easily attained. This was shown in detail when we discussed the concept of sukha and duḥkha-parīkṣa. Religion does not take you away from joy. Religion can help you to reach a lasting joy. Bhogasukha gives momentary joy preceded by restlessness, succeeded by restlessness. Religion gives you complete stretch of joy. Once that is accepted, the whole world can turn religious. The great ethical, moral, religious, dhārmic values simply get restored. That is the beauty of Vedānta.

When everyone questions the religious methods and its practises, the doctoral student in question may seem right as far as logic goes. But, he is unable to see what an amount of effort has gone in formatting these ideas to give him permanent happiness if he were to accept them after a careful study. Dharma gets restored even without our knowledge if IndriyaNigraha is applied as a balancing act in all our actions.

The seemingly mischievous question, but very well laid out from the postdoctoral student, is very well met and therefore religion has a strong point to defend itself. All the religions have Prema, Tyāga and Nigraha as common values. We can now appreciate every religion. Now, this is a wonderful explanation which tells us why of Dharma. <u>All the three tenets prema, tyāga and nigraha ultimately take you to pure state of mind or a no mind state</u>. And this state, as we have seen, is the state of ānanda. Even Bhogasukha, corresponds to a momentary mental peace. So Dharma is one which can take me to mokṣa, a quietened state of mind, a soft or gentle state of mind. Dharma is not an end in itself but a means to a nobler state of mind which is ānanda. We can now give a more encompassing and richer definition to Dharma. <u>Whatever action which takes one to a state of mahā śānti is Dharma.</u> This is a better and more convenient definition than the earlier one of Prema, Tyaga and Nigraha.

We also have problems while dealing with some aspects of dharma. How do we justify some of the acts mentioned below as dhārmic acts?

Take the case of Bhishma of Mahābhārata who stood by the Kauravā-s and fights battle with the Pāņdavā-s although he knew that they were not the right people. His only explanation for supporting the bad King is to satisfy the promise given by him to Matsyagandhi that he would protect the kingdom and her progeny. He affirms that, as a citizen also, it is his dharma to protect the king and he stands by it.

In another case in Rāmāyaṇa, Vibhīşana deserts the king Rāvaṇa although he was his brother, as Rāvaṇa turns a deaf ear to all his good advice. Vibhishana goes to the enemy camp to avoid his non righteous brother. He not only goes there but tells all the secrets and helps Rāma in defeating Rāvaṇa.

Two people under identical situations take opposite views. In the case of Bhīşma, he decides to stay with the bad King. Whereas, Vibhīşaṇa decides to disown the bad King though he was his own brother and had given him the support all through. What is this confusion? It is a good case for attack by any one. In spite of this, in the eyes of deciders of Dharma, both are termed as Mahātmās. Both are termed as Dharmiṣṭā-s. If dharma were to be an end in itself, both cannot be right. If dharma were to be for dharma’s sake the two cannot be termed as Dharmiṣṭhā-s. Only one can be right and the other can be wrong. But we have now got a superior definition. <u>Whatever takes you to permanent happiness is Dharma</u>. Bhīşma acted as a custodian of a promise. Bhīşma as a vrataniṣṭha had no axe to grind. He was not acting as a coward. He had no cheap mortal motives. For purification of his mind or for higher scruples he stood by the side of a bad king taking it as his Dharma.

Same is the case with Vibhīşaṇa who was against any injustice being committed by his own brother. He was not craving for the throne. He was acting with the background of keeping his mind clean. The action is not as important as the motive behind. Here we can argue as to why Bhīşma did not act as Vibhīşaṇa. It is the question of one’s preference. Thus both are termed as Dharmiṣṭhā-s <u>An act done in the background of Chittashudhi or for the expansion of Chitta is Dharma</u>.

In the case of Paraśurāma who slayed his mother at the behest of his father, the argument can be on both sides. Here he stuck to the dictum, Pitṛudevo Bhāva. He could have taken the other stand and followed the dictum MātŗDevo Bhāva and disobeyed his father. In both the cases, he would have been a Dharmiṣṭa. Here, we can see that it is one’s own delicate preference which needs to be honoured. There is no running away or escapism or cunningness.

The benefit of understanding the concept of dharma at the fundamental level is to restructure Dharma. If Dharma was an end in itself then there is no salvation. We would all be adharmi-s from that angle. Kālidāsa in his epic poem Raghuvamśa described the four stages of man while referring to the dynasty of Raghu.

**शैशवे अभ्यस्त विद्यानां यौवने विषयैषिणाम् ।**

**वार्धके मुनिवृत्तीनां योगेनान्ते तनुत्यजाम्॥**

**Śaiśavē abhyasta vidyānāṁ yauvanē viṣayaiṣiṇām,**

**vārdhakē muni-vr̥ttīnāṁ yōgēna-antē tanu- tyajām.**

It shows how our ancestors gave importance to the four stages in the evolution of man. The first was the learning age called śaiśava or bālya. Then came the period of youvana of gṛhasta where there was freedom for enjoyment. Then they moved gently away from Bhoga during their old age by leading an ascetic life in the forest called vānaprastha. Finally, it was sanyāsa where even the smallest bhoga was given up to prepare for leaving the body.

There was no absoluteness about these things, as it was a matter of convenience. At respective stages it was possible for people to practice without any difficulty. All these dhārmic values were insisted upon for mental peace. Now, we can have any number of different ways in which the same peace could be cultivated.

Let us take a person who does not do worship of Gods. Is he an adharmi? NO. We have deliberated earlier that all kinds of pūjā-s are neutral activities which help in cleansing of minds. The said person may be practicing prāṇāyāma or meditation. So Dharma has alternatives. So, restructuring of Dharma is possible. Highly traditional people, rooted purely in dos and don’ts of the laws laid down did not understand the scope of dharma.

If the intention of the śāstrā-s were for upliftment of humanity then there are alternatives to the harsh and ungraceful ways practiced hitherto. Hundreds of substitutes are possible. A substitute for sandhya can be japa for longer times. One need not feel sorry that he has given up sandhya, now that he has a better tool with him. The subtler the level of sādhana, the superior you are as a protector of dharma. Whatever takes one to permanent mental peace is Dharma. <u>Please continue the practices with an understanding as to why they are prescribed and not with blind faith.</u>

Now we will analyse the following cases-the affair of Ahalya, Draupadi’s marriage, the cases of Parāśara and Kṛṣṇa where they all deviated from Dharma visibly, explicitly.

Ahalya was cursed with stone hood. Here, we have to take the curse as immobility for the body, with mind being intact. as we know that ātmā cannot die. Being the wife of a Ŗşi, the process of introspection and purification must have started by realising the fault. The period during which she was in stone hood was a period of tapasya for her. The tapasya was to conquer the forces of mind during correction phase. Here, let us understand as to what is pātivratya and why it was prescribed for a woman. Every prescription given either for man or woman is for his/her self control and growth. And pātivratya is one such prescription for woman for her spiritual growth and cittaśuddhi. Through conquering the instincts for sex, one manages cittaśuddhi. In the episode of Ahalya, after going through years of tapasyā of self purification, if she stands unaffected, unperturbed by the best of male beauty, Rāma, standing before her, we can say that she has conquered sex. Thus the intensions of pativratya are restored. Intension of any discipline is to push you up in the ladder of self purification – in this case it is pativratya, or conquest of sex by vicāra.

Draupadi’s case is interesting since she comes to an understanding with her five husbands that every year she will accept only one of them as her husband. The other four will stay as her brothers. If Arjuna is her husband Yudhiṣṭira is treated as her husband’s elder brother and that is all. How is this possible? It is an attitudinal change and is a possibility. In our daily life also, we will be seeing woman staying with her husband in a joint family where other male members of the family are treated as brothers. Every time Draupadi submitted herself to the discipline of staying with one husband only as per pātivratya-dharma. Once the intentions of the discipline are understood and appreciated, anything can be seen in that light.

Parāśara’s case is the most difficult of the three examples. Even an ordinary man can conclude that he has committed the sin by misbehaving with an unmarried girl. Parāśara could not even wait till he met the father of the girl and take his permission for marrying the girl. In spite of this, it is strange that he is called Bhagavān Parāśara! How do we account this absurdity? We have to apply the definition of Dharma in this case as follows - Dharma is one which takes you to mental balance through a series of disciplinary processes. When there is a scope for adharma or temptation, they can be conquered easily. Parāśara had reached the pinnacle of control of mind. Nothing in the world can shake him from that steadfastness. He has completely conquered the temptations. Cittaśuddhi of the highest order has been achieved by him. What is then dharma or adharma for such a person? Normal definitions of dharma do not apply to such people. Such laws are applicable to persons like us who are not completely free from worldly pleasures. So, whatever a sage like Parāśara does is dharma, be it sex or otherwise. Nothing can tilt him. Abstinence from temptations will not add further to his stability. The laws which were till now operative, will not operate on such a person. They are above such laws. They are called Dharmātīta.

Explained in a simple way, there are three major differences in the behaviour of human beings on earth.



1. **Un-ethical is the animal way of behaviour (Immoral).**
2. **Ethical is the natural way of sticking to human values (Moral)**
3. **Freedom from ethical values and dropping them when needed is not unethical, but it is A-ETHICAL or A-MORAL - above and beyond moral values.**

The laws of Dharma do not apply to persons of third category. This freedom from laws of Dharma are applicable to only such persons who have touched the source of creation and who have the capacity to confer boons or even to curse. For them, these laws are childish or elementary. They can take liberties with the laws of nature. This power we could see in Parāśara. He had the extraordinary powers of creation and thus could restore the virginity of Sugandhi. No one should quote Parāśara and take liberties. Parāśara could ward off the guilt sense or impurity sense on the part of Matsyagandhi in a trice.

This is the extra vision and courage of Hinduism which is not found elsewhere in the world. One could go beyond Dharma. This is the region of freedom which a brahmajñāni or Gods have access to. All others stop at the region of Dharma. Why did Parāśara do such an act? To show that such regions of freedom, that of Eshwara, exist. In this context we have a bold śloka in Bhagavad-Gīta (18-17):

**यस्य नाहंकृतो भावो बुद्धिर्यस्य न लिप्यते ।**

**हत्वापि स इमान् लोकान् न हन्ति न निबध्यते॥**

**Yasya na-ahaṁ-kr̥tō bhāvō buddhiḥ-yasya na lipyatē,**

**hatvā-api sa imān lōkān na hanti na nibadhyatē.**

Whoever does it in dispassion, in utter detachment and who is not affected by the event, even if he takes a sword and cuts off the whole mankind, he is not deemed to have killed anybody and the killing does not tarnish him. Another famous śloka from Bhagavad Gīta (2-45)-

**त्रैगुण्यविषया वेदा: निस्त्रैगुण्यो भवार्जुन ।**

**निर्द्वन्द्वो नित्यसत्वस्थो निर्योगक्षेम आत्मवान्॥**

**Traiguṇya-viṣayā vēdāḥ nistraiguṇyō bhava arjuna,**

**nirdvandvō nitya-satvasthō niryōgakṣēma ātmavān.**

Arjuna, this moral, ethical, etc, are within the regions of Satva, Rajas and Tamas. When one grows beyond the three guṇas, action right or action wrong has no meaning. Then, where is the Dhrama or adharma? That is what a Jñāni is. If application of dharma in the case of sage Parāśara is understood, then all absurdities of Kṛṣṇa are understood.

We have mundane examples also. We also take such short cuts in our life. As a scientist, we do it many times. Take for example of chemistry lab where an examination is going on and if a student makes a mistake of touching a small weight in his hand instead of using the forceps, marks will be deducted for that, as it is against the rules of weighing. Similarly the burette and pipette are to be rinsed before any solution is put in them. This is also a rule and no excuse will be given if someone violated this rule. Whereas, the Professor does not bother about this and easily handles the weights in his bare hands since he knows that, that much degree of accuracy is not needed in a particular test. Why? Because the purpose is served. But, the student is not spared as a matter of discipline. Whoever knows the implications of the law can violate the law without any objection, if the purpose is served.

A lineman of an electricity department handles a live wire with a simple gloves which is not permitted for others. He knows the intensity of electricity flowing through the line. A knowledgeable man who knows the why of a law, can violate the law if the point is served by it.

A simple Bhajan can be irritating for a person who is adopting a different method to calm his mind. Whereas, for the person doing bhajan it is a wonderful sādhana. A spiritual growth like bhajan can be a noise to another person. So, the laws are only conventional.

To summarise, it is important to adopt the principles of prema, tyāga and nigraha, which are the basis of dharma, cautiously after a full understanding of the consequences arising out of such practices and lead a life of complete happiness. This is the avenue open to one and all.


Thank you for listening.
