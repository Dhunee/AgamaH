0 INTRODUCTION Nowadays it is very essential to know Acharya Shaṅkara&rsquo;s teachings in its true perspective according to his Prasthānatraya Bhashyas, because Shaṅkara-Vedānta has been misunderstood and misinterpreted by the sub-commentators on Shri Shaṅkara&rsquo;s Bhāṣyas. Accordingly the seekers are confused and confounded by many distortions, misinterpretations and misguiding versions of Shaṅkara&rsquo;s original Bhashyas. To comprehend the fullest import of the teachings of Shaṅkara, we have to take the traditional works of Gaudapāda&rsquo;s Kārikā on Mānḍukya Upanishad, Upadesha Sāhasrī, an independent work of Shri Shaṅkara and Sureshvara&rsquo;s Vārtikas on Taittiriya and Brhadaranyaka Bhashyas of Shri Shaṅkara and his independent work called Naishkarmya Siddhi." />

Accordingly the seekers are  confused and confounded by many distortions, misinterpretations and misguiding versions of Shaṅkara&rsquo;s original  Bhashyas. To comprehend the fullest import of the teachings  of Shaṅkara, we have to take the traditional works of  Gaudapāda&rsquo;s Kārikā on Mānḍukya Upanishad, Upadesha  Sāhasrī, an independent work of Shri Shaṅkara and Sureshvara&rsquo;s Vārtikas on Taittiriya and Brhadaranyaka Bhashyas  of Shri Shaṅkara and his independent work called Naishkarmya Siddhi. All these contain the idea of pristine pure Vedānta in unequivocal voice. Teachings based on these works are not easily available to the aspirants of  Shaṅkara-Vedānta. To remove this scarcity, Shri Shri  Satchidānandendra Saraswati Swāmiji of Karnataka State,  has made a sustained effort to show the genuine teachings  through his writings. The first book is published in Kannada viz. &ldquo;Shānkara Vedānta Sara.&rdquo; In the introduction to this  book Swamiji has declared that &ldquo;never before in any part  of the world a book of this type which contain subject wise classification of the sentences of the Bhashya and  traditional books referred to above has been published.&rdquo;  In this direction he has published hundreds of books in  three languages viz. Kannada, Sanskrit and English.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me I came across Shrl Swamiji and  studied most of his books and followed his guidances for nearly twenty years (1954-55 to 1974-75). I have also  propagated this teaching in some parts of Karnataka, Andhra  Pradesh and Maharashtra and also to some foreign aspi rants. By this experience of 25 years of teachings and  discussion with various kinds of people I have gathered  some definite ideas regarding the methodology of teaching  this pristine pure Shaṅkara-Vedānta.</p>
<p>According to this methodology an aspirant should  know at first the fundamentals of Shaṅkara- Vedānta,  which work as a key to open the treasury to Shaṅkara  Vedānta. Without a thorough understanding of these fundamental principles, the aspirant will not be able to follow  or to grasp the subtle teachings of the Prasthānatraya  Bhāshyas.</p>
<p>At the outset it may be mentioned that these fundamentals (= basic rules of interpretation) are mainly five in  number</p>
<ul>
<li>Relying on the intuitive experiences of universal  acceptance and comprehensive vision of life (sārvatrika-pūrṇānubhava)</li>
<li>Realising the Witnessing principle of life which is  beyond ego (sākṣi-darśana)</li>
<li>The methodology of deliberate Superimposition and  subsequent Rescission (adhyārōpa-apavāda-nyāya)-the Vedantic  devices adopted in the Upanishads for the purpose of teaching the nature of Absolute Reality.</li>
<li>The distinction of the empirical standpoint and  transcendental standpoint, i.e. Vyavahāra Dr̥shti and Paramārtha Drshti (vyāvahārika-dr̥ṣṭi-pāramārthika-dr̥ṣṭi)</li>
<li>Understanding the difference between the Sadhanas  of Vastutantra and Kartrtantra, i e.  knowledge depending on ontological facts (vastutantra) as against action depending upon human will or effort (kartr̥-tantra or puruṣa-tantra).</li>
</ul>
<p>These five are the vital principles to know Shaṅkara Vedānta. Strictly speaking these are the foundations on which the edifice of Shaṅkara-Vedānta is built. Unless and until the seeker can discern these fundamentals, it will be very difficult for him to reconcile the seemingly coniTadictory statements of Bhashyas. There have arisen divergent views (misconceptions) not only among the followers of  adverse schools (like Madhva, Ramanuja etc,) but also  among those that owe their atlegiance to Shaṅkara&rsquo;s tradition itself (like Bhamatikara, Vivaranacharya etc). These differences of opinion are, due mostly to either disregarding these basic rules of interpretations or overlooking the  needful importance to these five fundamentals mentioned  above. According to Shri Satchidanandendra SaraswatI  Swamiji&rsquo;s teachings based on Shaṅkara Bhashyas, if we try  to understand the various standpoints adopted for the  purpose of teachings, then all our misconceptions and doubts  will get removed. For this purpose I propose to explain here these five fundamentals briefly, as interpreted by the  Revered Swamiji of Hotenarsipur, only to understand the  subject-matter of Shaṅkara-Vedānta in its true perspective.</p>
<p>Shri Swamiji, my Gurudev, has explained these five  fundamentats in his various works. I propose to put them  in one book-form. These fundamentals have been culled  out from the various works of Shri Swamiji. So they are not  new inventions of my own. I am indeed greatly indebted  to my Guruji for this.</p>
<p>After going through this book very carefully. an  aspirant will realise that he is in a position to study the  Shankaira Bhashyas. Apart from this, he will be able to  realise that the teachings of Acharya Shaṅkara are consistent with life and experience and these form definite means  to get peace and tranquility in this very life. Hence this  book is appropriately titled &lsquo;Guide-lines to Shaṅkara Vedānta&rsquo;.</p>
<p>( 5 )</p>
<p>Without the guidance of the Upanishads as taught by a Guru, who is well-versed in the traditional method of  instruction (shrotriya) and who is realized or intuited the ultimate reality (brahmaniṣṭha). the nature of Reality cannot be  easily comprehended. For this purpose I have discussed  the full significances of ten important suggestions (guidances) of Shri Swamiji: as· mentioned in his book &ldquo;Misconceptions about Shaṅkara&rdquo; in the Appendix.</p>
<p>The credit for writing this book should go to  Shn R. B. Gopinath, Bangalore and Shā Manas Kumar Sanyal of  Calcutta. Both are ardent students of Shaṅkara-Vedānta and  keen followers of the teaching of Shri Shri Satchidanandendra Saraswati Swamij. May the Almighty and Shri Sadguru bless them in all the aspects of life.</p>

<p>CHAPTER-1</p>
<p>The first fundamental: Relying on the intuitive  experiences of universal acceptance and comprehensive vision of life.</p>
<h3 id="1-specific-feature-of-vedantas">1. SPECIFIC FEATURE OF VEDANTAS</h3>
<p>(UPANISHADS)</p>
<p>According śrī śaṅkara though the Upanishads are indivisible part of Vedas, the teaching contained in the  Upanishads is quite unlike the other types of teachings like rituals (Karmas), meditations (Upāsanas),+++(5)+++ taught in Vedas. Hence the deliberations on Brahman i.e. Brahma-Jijnāsā has been taught separately from the deliberations on Dharma, i e. Dharma-Jijnāsā which mainly teach us the rituals and meditations.</p>
<p>To perform rituals etc., one should  observe Varnas, Ashramas, age, condition etc. So it is not  applicable commonly to alt. This Dharma-Jijnāsā runs on  the common belief that &lsquo;I am so and so, I am a doer of  actions, I am happy, I am miserable&quot; etc. accepting agentship and enjoyership. This part of the text of Veda is authoritative in its own field. This is accepted by Shaṅkara  as it has been accepted by other Mimāmsakas as he is himself a follower of Sanātana Vaidika Dharma.</p>
<p>But his main contention is that apart from this Dharma-Jijnasa there is Brahma-Jijnasa, i.e. deliberation on Brahman which  is also taught by Veda in the last portion thereof which  are called Aranyakas (Upanishads). This Brahma-Jijnasa is based on Universal acceptance and comprehensive vision of life. Though this is the fact, these two forms of Jijnasas  are not rival to each other, because Brahma-Jijnasa nourishes the Dharma-Jijnasa in one aspect +++(śamadamādi-sādhanārtham - svasmin, jīvāntarē ca)+++ and the Dharma Jijnasa will lead to Brahma-Jijnasa in another aspect.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Thus they are complementary to each other. Hence Shaṅkara declares in Brha Bhashva-2/4/10 thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>वेदस्य हि निरपेक्षं स्वार्थे प्रमाणम् … तस्माद् यत्तेनोक्तं तत् तथैव प्रतिपत्तव्यम् आत्मनः श्रेय इच्छद्भिः - ज्ञानं वा कर्म वा।<br>
&lsquo;The Veda is absolutely valid with regard to its subject-matter. … Therfore those who aspire after the  well being must accept the verdict at the Vedas on knowledge or on rites; as it is. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was also shown by Shaṅkara how the conflict with the injunctions about the rites and duties is to be resolved by a reference to the distinction between the enlightened  and unenlightened men.+++(5 kimuktam??)+++ {S-Bh-1 /3/19}</p>
<p>According: to Shaṅkara, the Dharma-Jijnasā i.e. the deliberation on religious matters has taken for granted the common belief of the agentship and enjoyership. It has not set out to determine the true nature of the Self. So it is authoritative in its field only. For this purpose  Shaṅkara declares in his Adhyasa Bhashya:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is a fact that a man performing religious duties or Karma does not attain the exquisite fruits of  scriptural duties unless he has acquired a knowledge through belief in the Shastras that his essential nature of Atman is separate from his body, senses  etc.+++(5)+++ Still a knowledge of the absolute Reality that  is the Self is not a pre-requisite for such a man who  is ignorant of his true nature, for the knowledge of  Reality has no relevance here, and it is opposed to  agentship of action in as much as the nature of  Atman (as taught in Vedānta) is beyond hunger and  thirst, free from such differentiation as Brahmin  caste, Kshatriya caste etc, and is not subject  to birth and death (Brha-3/5/1 &amp; 3/4/6).+++(4)+++ And  the scriptures, which are operative before the dawn of the real knowledge of the Self cannot transgress the limits of their dependence on people grouping in  nescience&rdquo;+++(4)+++</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it is evident that the scriptural texts belonging to  the Karma-Kanda is meant for those ignorant people who  do not know the essential nature of Atman. And in the  ultimate Reality of Atman, there are really no castes, no  relationships with body, sense organs, mind, intellect etc.  and no categories of the nature of action, means of action  and fruits of action at all. So Shaṅkara distinguishes the Brahma-Jijnasa from Dharma-Jijnasa. For this reason when  he comments on the first Shariraka Sutra, he discusses as to what the word &ldquo;अथ&rsquo;, i,e. &lsquo;afterwords&rsquo; denotes. Here we have to observe that it is not the meaning of this word  that after completing Dharma-Jijnasa alone one will be fit  for Brahma-Jijnasa. But before or after the Dharma Jijnasa he who has got the pre-requisite qualities such as</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) discrimination between eternal and non-eternal ( nityānitya-vivēka );</li>
<li>(ii) dispassion for the enjoyment of the  fruits of work here and here after (ihāmutrārtha-phala-bhōga-virāgaḥ)</li>
<li>(iii) a perfection of such practices as, control of mind,  control of senses and organs etc ( śama-damādi-sādhana-sampat ); and</li>
<li>(iv) an intense desire for liberation ( mumukṣutvañ ca ) can under take a deliberation on the Upanishadic texts for getting a  direct knowledge of Brahman. So these are the inevitably  required qualities to deal with Brahma-Jijnasa. These are  called as SadhanaChatustaya Sampatti .+++(4)+++</li>
</ul>
<p>One important difference between these two types of  deliberations on Dharma and Brahman is shown in Sūtra  Bhashya-1/1/2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>न धर्मजिज्ञासायामिव श्रुत्यादय एव प्रमाणं ब्रह्मजिज्ञासायाम् ।<br>
किन्तु श्रुत्यादयो ऽनुभवादयश् च यथासम्भवमिह प्रमाणम्,<br>
अनुभवावसानत्वाद् भूत-वस्तुविषयत्वाच् च ब्रह्मज्ञानस्य ।</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this sentence Shaṅkara emphatically declares that  the deliberation on Brahman should and must culminate  in one&rsquo;s own intuitive experience. So here the Vedāntic Anubhava (Vedantic intuition) is also a Pramāna, but not merely the Shruti alone just as it is in the case of Dharma-Jijnasa. In the case of religious duty, the utterances of  the Shrutis etc. would be the only means of knowledge, because no direct experience is needed in support. But the knowledge of Self, which relates to an already existing entity, culminates in experience. Hence it is evident  here, that the Brahma-Jijnasa starts on the firm ground of  universal acceptence and comprehensive vision of life.  Hence this is the first fundamental of Sharikara Vedānta - relying on common experience and taking the full view of  life. As an elaboration we shall explain the significance of  common experience or universal acceptance and comprehensive vision of life in the following pages.</p>
<h3 id="2-universal-acceptance-or-common-experience">2. UNIVERSAL ACCEPTANCE OR COMMON EXPERIENCE</h3>
<p>To determine the reality we have to rely on the firm  ground of common experience meaning the experiences  which are common to all irrespective of caste, creed, gender,  age, stage of life (Ashrama), time, place etc. For example,  the knowledge about fire that it is hot, the knowledge about  ice that it is cold Qr direct perception just as we see external things through our eyes (the acquisition of knowledge  through a contact of the eye with some objects) etc. These  types of common experiences never change their nature.  Shaṅkara thus says in Brha Bhashya - 2/1/1 5 :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) &ldquo;For a thing can never change its nature, just as  fire invariably burns and illumines straw, tender  grass etc, that come in contact with it. If it does  not, we cannot assert that fire burns or illumines&rdquo;  (Brha Bh-2/1/15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shaṅkara has hence declared in his Brahma Sātra  B hāshya-2/2/11 thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(ii) तच् च सम्यग्-ज्ञानम् एकरूपम् , वस्तुतन्त्रत्वात्। एकरूपेण ह्य् अवस्थितो योऽर्थः स परमार्थः।  लोके तद्-विषयं ज्ञानं सम्यग्-ज्ञानम् इत्युच्यते — यथाग्निर् उष्ण इति।<br>
And that true enlightenment has no diversity, since  it must conform to an existent fact (वस्तुतन्त्रवत्).  That content of knowledge is said to be the most  real since it ever remains the same and in the  world. the knowledge of that kind is said to be right  knowledge as for instance, the knowledge about fire  that it is hot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Shaṅkara gives the example that the fire is hot this denotes the universal experience (common experience- भूयो-दर्शन).</p>
<p>For this purpose he often uses such words- दृश्यते, अदर्शनात्, दृष्टत्वात्, अदृष्टत्वात् etc. in his Bhashyas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(iii) &ldquo;In all the bodies, liquids such as secretions, blood  etc. are seen ( दृश्यते) to present in abundance.&rdquo;  [ s. Bh-3/1/2 ]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(iv) &ldquo;For the organs cannot either go or stay any where unless they have a material support, since this is contrary to experience, it is not noticed (अदर्शनात्)  in any living creature.·&rsquo; [ S. Bh- 3/1/3 ]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(v) &ldquo;Accordingly it is a matter of common experience  (लोके ऽनुभवः) that the nacre appears as siver and  a single moon appears as two.&rdquo; [-Adhyasa Bhashya]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So to determine the reality we have to rely on the  common experience, i.e. a truth can be called as such only  if it is acceptable and verifiable by everyone at all times.+++(4)+++  Shaṅkara emphatically declares in Gita Bhashyas (18/16)  that, &ldquo;even a hundred Shruti texts cannot be considered to  be valid if they pronounce fire to be cold or non-luminous,&rdquo;  In Brha Bhashya (2/1/20) also he says: &lsquo;you cannot prove  that fire is cold or that the sun does not give heat, even by citing a hundred examples, for the facts would already be  known to be otherwise through another means of knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 न हि श्रुतिशतमपि ‘शीतोऽग्निरप्रकाशो वा’ इति ब्रुवत् प्रामाण्यमुपैति ।</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To determine the transcendental reality Shaṅkara has  followed the footsteps of the utterances of the Shrutis  which denote and culminate in the universal acceptance  (i-e. common to all persons) and comprehensive tri-basic  vision of life (i.e. which follows the experiences of the  three states of waking, dream and deep sleep). So the  truth should be based on this firm ground and not on the  experience of an individual soul. Shaṅkara himself  never said that it is my own experience.+++(5)+++ He says, everything  should be proved by direct universal intuition and reasoning  based on such intuition as far as possible. The truth  should not be based merely on the utterances (study of  teachings) of any great Soul or Omniscient being or Prophet or Philosopher or the thinker, nor does it depend on  the implicit faith alone in the mere utterances of the scriptures. Truth, however, is one and what is against common  experience must be rejected, whoever says it even if he be  the Lotus-born ( Brahma).</p>
<p>Strictly speaking the Advaita  Siddhanta is not creation of Shaṅkara but it is universal  truth based on common experience. The transcendental  Reality is called as Brahman or Atman in the Upanishads and  in Gita. It is declared in these Shastras that this Reality  is the Self of all. For examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;एक देवः सर्वभूतेषु गूढः” (Shvetashvatara-6/11)<br>
एकस् तथा सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा (Katha-2/2/9, 19, 11)<br>
क्षेत्रज्ञं चापि मां बिद्धि सर्वक्षेत्रषु (Geeta-13/2)<br>
“ईश्वरः सर्वभूतानां हृद्देशे.. तिष्ठति” (Geeta-18/61)<br>
“समोऽहं सर्वभूतेष” (Geeta-9/29) etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By this we can understand that the transcendental  Reality which is taught in the Upanishads and in Gita is  the Self of all. So it should be cognised on the basis of  common experience alone and not on the individual mystic  experiences which have been gained by some practices  like Yoga, Samadhi etc. These types of individual mystic  experience are there but they are not useful to determine transcendental Reality which is called PARAMARTHAHA.+++(5)+++  ShrI Shaṅkara has clarified that pure Consciousness which is the Witnessing Self can be cognised and experienced as  it is our own true Self which can neither be denied or  accepted. It is transcendental, but can be experienced intuitively. Shaṅkara gives supreme importances to universal  experiences (but not on individual experiences) in determining the validity of the statement of scriptures.</p>
<p>So it is proved here that to know the signifticance of  Shaṅkara-Vedānta we should rely on the universal acceptance -common experience. This is called Sārvatrika  Anubhava (सार्वत्रिकानुभवः) . Now we shall de:al with  the comprehensive vision of life i.e पूर्णानुभव.</p>
<h3 id="3-purnanubhava">3. pUrNAnubhava</h3>
<p>OR COMPREHENSIVE VISION OF LIFE</p>
<h4 id="1-non-vedanta-view">1 Non-vedAnta view</h4>
<p>A. Partial view of life according to the physical  science and all other systems of Philosophy  except Vedānta</p>
<p>The common experience of the wor1dly life is divided  into two parts, i.e. the subject and the object. The external  world is the obiect and the perceiver of this is the subject.  All empirical experiences consist of the subject-object relationship. On this supposition all other sciences, first want  to discover the truth regarding the objects. In this process  also every science. e.g. Physics, Chemistry, Engineering  etc. takes a part and partial view of the objective world.  From this standpoint there are so many subject-matters  which, are variously divided and every science deals with a  particular subject-matter.</p>
<p>Apart from this the Psychology also deals with the subject which consists of analysing the  mind of other persons and creatures which are objects  for their own mind. According to this there are so many  varieties such as human psychology, child psychology etc. Sometimes they take the subjective mind of their own and  they infer regarding the objective mind on the basement of the behaviour of other persons, creatures etc.</p>
<p>So the material science and the psychiatry which are very important these days-; have not got -or retied on the comprehensive vision regarding the universe. For example, even in the case of a person who has studied the whole of the solasr system which is the universe one will come to the conclusion that in view of there being so many solar systems in the vast universe it will be impossible to know everything in this universe. From this standpoint, all scieinces are dealing with a part of the universe and not a the universe as  a whoie with comprehensive aspect. This is the position  of the material sciences.</p>
<p>The above sciences deal with the objects which are regulated by time, space and causation. Hence the sciences which are dealing with the part of the universe are bound  by these factors and they have no capacity to extricate  themselves from these regulations.</p>
<h4 id="2-vedantic-view">2 Vedantic view</h4>
<p>B VEDANTIC VIEW REGARDING THE UNIVERSE</p>
<p>In Vedānta the whole pnenomenon o&rsquo; the universe is  divided into there planes :</p>
<ul>
<li>i) the Divine plaNe : Adhidaivika Prapancha</li>
<li>ii) the Material plane- Adhibhautika Prapancha,</li>
<li>iii) the Corporeal plane- Adhyatmika Prapancha,</li>
</ul>
<p>The first is the divine plane which means (from the  Sanskrit root- div, to shine} the sun, the moon, the stars,  ptanets etc, Which are miltions and billions in number;  the divine worlds according to the religious beliefs such  as heavenly worlds upto Brahma- Loka- including all these,  the Vedānta takes in one group as divine plane or Adhi Daivika Prapancha.</p>
<p>The material plane means the world which we see- the  conglomeration of the five elements-  Ether, Air, Fire, Water and the Earth -  all types of bodies of all creatures, all the  things which we see and all types of scientific machines  etc, which are already invented and to be invented in future such as computers, robots, etc- all these are to be taken  in this plane, ie the material plane or Adhibhautika Prapancha.</p>
<p>The corporeal plane is connected with the subject, while the above said two planes are coming in the category of the objects or the objective world. In this  corporeal plane are the body, vital force, organs of action and  sense organs, mind, intellect and feelings of sorrow and  pleasure etc, including the Me-notion are included.  This group is called as Corporeal plane Of Adhyatma Prapancha, because all these are assembled together just like any machinery like a watch assembled with dial,  springs etc.. This group is called in Vedānta as kArya-kArNa  Sanghata,. This iss the technical term of Vedānta  which denotes the corporeal plane. A these form the  third group.</p>
<p>Besides these three planes, we have to take the infinite  idea of time, space and causation. The time-space factor  appear in our daily life as if they are real and beginningless  and endless and hence infinite. The questron will be  absked that, &ldquo;In which time does the time factor appear ?  In which place the idea of space is there&rdquo; Because without the concept of time or space there will be no kind  of dealings such as thinking, talking and acting. For this  purpose philosophers who started thinking regarding the  truth of time and space which are meta-physics have come  to different conclusions in this matter:</p>
<p>a) Some say that the distance between two things is  called as space and the intervening period between two  events is called as &lsquo;time&rsquo;.</p>
<p>b) Others say that the above view is not correct  because to count the things 1, 2, 3, etc. the space is required as the substratum-. So also in the case of events, without  the substratum ot time, there will be no counting of series of events.</p>
<p>c) Others hold the view that the notion of tim-e and  space- are there where there is the mind and hence these are the a priori notions of the mind.</p>
<p>d) Others say that time, space and causation -  all these are relative to each other. There is no absolute time, space or causation. Neither time nor space has any existence  of its own; each exists or seems to exist only in constant relation to and association with other. So, all all dealings are coming under the relativity alone. There may be an absolute truth, it may be God (= a Great Geometer) also. This final conclusion is drawn by Einstein.</p>
<p>Here we have to remember that &ldquo;bereft of time factor, there will be no  causation,&rdquo; because cause means that which exists  inevitably before the effect (Kārya Niyata pUrva vRttiH  KAranam). This is the judgement ot Nyaya-shastra (Indian logician). So, the idea of causation cannot be considered apart from the time factor.</p>
<p>The Vedantic view of the Universe comprehends an  the infinite tdea of time, space, causation etc, with  all the multiplicity of the universe including the &ldquo;Me notion &quot; and is considered as a single unit of the appearance of the universe. This whole unit of the  universe appears in the waking state. Shri Shaṅkara explains the nature of the universe itself in a comprehensive  way in his S-Bh- 1/1/2 as foUows :</p>
<p>&quot; &hellip; this universe that is manifested through name and  form, that is associated with diverse agents and experiencers, that provides the support for actions and results  having well-regulated space, time and causation, and that  defies all thoughts about the real nature of its creation&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is the Vedantic view of comprehensive vision of  the phenomenon of the universe.</p>
<h4 id="3-method-of-experiencing">3 Method of experiencing</h4>
<p>C. Method of observing the life as a whole:</p>
<p>The physical sciences seek the aid of instruments,  gadgets and appliances to establish their truths, and even so they can never reach any finality because they thrive  only in one state-the waking state, discarding the universal  experiences of two other states of life i.e. dream-state &amp;  deep sleep-state.+++(5)+++ This is evidently a partial view of life and the truths arrived at thereby are also only partial.  But Vedānta takes into considertion the whole life in all  its manifested and unmanifested forms, i.e. the Vedānta  takes the human experiences of all the three states viz,  Waking, Dream &amp; Deep sleep to arrive at its conclusions. So  Vedantic conclusions which are based on intuitive experiences, become irrefutable and valid for all times. No other  system of philosophy except Vedānta bases its enquiry  on a comprehensive tri-basic view of life and on the  principle of universal acceptance.</p>
<p>Where there is an appearance of the waking state, the state contains the whole of the above said unit (mentioned  in the previous article No. III B). When the waking state  disappears, there is no appearance of the above said dualistic universe. For example, in deep sleep there is no  appearance of the waking state. Where there is the  appearance of the dream, in that state also another kind  of the unit of universe appears just as it is described in the  case of waking state. But when dream state disappears the whole unit of that universe also disappears.</p>
<p>So in Vedānta, the comprehensive vision of appearance  and disappearance of the dualistic world is taken together.  These two are described as manifested and unmanifested  forms of the universe. These are technical terms used in  Vedānta as Vyakta  and Avyakta  in  Gita-8/18; Sat and asat in Gita -13/12;  Kshara and Akshara  in Gita-15/16;  Vidita and Avidita in Kena-Upanishad, Murta and Amurta in Brhadaranyaka Upanishad&ndash;2/3/1 ; Sambhuti  and Asambhuti  in Ishavasyopanishad-12 etc. Here Shaṅkara  says the meaning of these as व्याकृत and  अव्याकृत in Sutra Bhashya-2/1/27.</p>
<p>The revered Swamiji of Holenarsipur has given this  practical and all embracing outlook of comprehensive  vision of life while explaining Tribasic method of Vedānta,  ie. AVASTHATRAYA based on Shaṅkara Bhashya Mandukya-Mantra-5 in his Mandukya Rahasya VivrtiH. Here he  explains the whole range of life which is divided into parts:  That is darshana Vriti (-the states of waking &amp; dream  where one sees something else) and Adarshana Vrtti (-the  states of deep sleep and trance wherein one sees nothing)  [दर्शनादर्शनेन वृत्त्योः तत्वाप्रतिबोधलक्षणस्य स्वापस्य तुल्यत्वात् Man-Bh-5]. In Upanishads and in Gita the same method  is taken as shown above. Taking these both sides of life  ( = the whole of life in all its manifested and unmanifested forms) and determining the truth is an important thing  in Vedānta All types of experiences just as common  man&rsquo;s experiences, mystic experien es of Yogis, Upasakas  and so on, are all included in the Vyakta or Darshana Vrtti.  And in deep sleep, when there is no appearance of the  dualistic world, it is said from the standpoint of waking state that it ( =dualistic world) exists in the unmanifested  seed-form, meaning that it disappears for the time being  etc.+++(5)+++ This experience is common to all and is called  avyakta or Adarshana Vrtti. It is an undeniable fact that  there is no third category of experience besides the two states - Darshana Vritti and Adarshana Vrtti. (1. The three states are the objects of knowledge for, there  cannot be anything knowable besides these three states)</p>
<p>This is comprehensive vision of life. This is common to all and so it is  universal acceptance. This is the method of observing the  life as a whole. This type of analysis is not based on any  individual experience. The individual experiences which are gained through efforts are bound to time, space and  causation factors but one&rsquo;s own being which is the subtratum of the Darshana and Adarshana Vrttis is clearly beyond the dualistic condition such as space, time etc.  The locus or substratum of all these various illusory phenomenon of manifested and unmanifested forms is certainly the pure consciousness-the Atman alone which is really  real.+++(5)+++ On this firm ground of one&rsquo;s own Being ( =the  Witnessing principle of life) is Shaṅkara-Vedānta built.  Those who have overlooked the principle of Tri-basic view  are unable to understand Shaṅkara properly.</p>
<p>Thus after observing this comprehensive view of life,  one can easily cognise his own Being which is the  substratum of these two appearance and disappearance of  the universe. This Being is the real nature of the Self. So  Shri Shaṅkara describes this comprehensive view of life  in MandUkya Bhashya-3 thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>सर्वस्य प्रपञ्चस्य साधिदैविकस्य अनेनात्मना अतुष्पात्त्वस्य विवक्षितत्वात्<br>
meaning &ldquo;in as much as the intention is to show that the entire phenomenal universe and the world  of Gods, together with this gross cosmic Self, contribute  to the constitution of the four aspects of Atman.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="4-sārvatrika--pūrṇa-anubhava">4 Sārvatrika  Pūrṇa Anubhava</h4>
<p>D. Correct meaning of the term Sārvatrika  Pūrṇa Anubhava:</p>
<p>Commonly in Shaṅkara Vedānta, to realise the true  nature of the Self a common belief was prevailing is that  we have to get some individual mystic experience like  Samadhi, etc.+++(5)+++ On this belief the aspirants were trying to understand Shaṅkara&rsquo;s teachings. Till Shri Shri Satchidanandendra Saraswati Swamiji dawned on the horizon of  Vedānta, there was no usage of this first fundamental, i.e.  universal acceptance and comprehensive vision of life. The  word &ldquo;Sārvatrika  Pūrṇa Anubhava&rdquo; denotes the above said criterion. The readers are referred to Sanskrit introduction to Mandukya Rahasya Vivrtti by Swamiji -Anubhavasya  Pramukhyam-the predominance of Anubhaba. Here he has  given he correct meaning o~the term &ldquo;Anubhava&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;Anubhava&rdquo; is not used is Vedānta in the sense  of perceptions, feeling or emotion or newly acquired mystic experiences through the practices of Japa, meditation or practice of Patanjala Yoga which are called mystic  experiences, which are concerned with the individuals and which also vary from one individual to another.+++(5)+++ But that  which is common to all, by which the waking, dream and  deep sleep states are directly intuited and which reminds  the experience of the dream and deep sleep directly to the  waking intellect+++(5)+++ and that which gives room to differentiate  the waking state from other two states and which is not relying on the functions of the sense organs or the mind  etc. and which is itself the true nature of conciousness of  one&rsquo;s own, that Witnessing Self itself is called as Sākṣhi  Anubhava or Intuition in Vedānta.</p>
<p>This clarity regarding the word Anubhava representing  the true Shaṅkara Prakriya has not been told by any  Vedintin except by Shri Swimiji of Holenarsipur in the  hoary history of Vedānta. So this is a revelation in the  field of Shaṅkara-Vedānta brought about by Shri Swamiji.  By this, Vedānta has been rescued from the belief that the  Advaita Vedānta also is a cult just like Dvaita, Vishishṭādvaita etc. Swamiji has thus showed that this is the  universal truth which could be understood by anyone if  one has got the capacity of understanding.</p>
<h3 id="4-conclusion">4. Conclusion</h3>
<p>IV. CONCLUSIVE REMARKS REGARDING THE FIRST  FUNDAMENTAL :</p>
<p>Thus the comprehensive vision of life and universal  acceptance is the first fundamental of Shankara-Vedānta.  In Shruti and Smrtis the transcendental reality, i.e. the  reat nature of the Self is described as the Self of all.+++(5)+++ So  here we have to take the common experience of all. For  example:</p>
<p>In Upanishads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>एको देवः सर्वभूतेषु गूढः - Shvetashvatara-6/11<br>
एष सर्वेषु भतेषु गूढो आत्मा- Katha 1/3/12<br>
एकस् तथा सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा-Katha 2/2/9, 10, 11 etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in Geeta :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“समोऽहं सर्वभूतेषु&rdquo;-Geet -9/29<br>
“समं सर्वेषु भूतेषु तिष्ठन्तं परमेश्वरम्&rdquo;&ndash;Geeta&ndash;13/27<br>
“अहमात्मा गुडाकेशः सर्वभताशयस्थितः”- Geeta - 10/20<br>
&ldquo;ईश्वरः सर्वभूतानां हृद्देशे तिष्ठति”-Geeta-18/61<br>
&ldquo;क्षेत्रज्ञं च मां विद्धि सर्वक्षेत्रेषु'-Geeta&ndash;13/2 etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way the comprehensive vision of life which is explained above is another important thing is Shankara-Vedanta.</p>
<p>This is hinted by the following Mantra :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>POORNAMADHA POORNAMIDAM Brha&ndash;5/1/1.
पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात् पूर्णमुदच्यते । पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ॥</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is hinted that by the word idam, the appearance and disappearance of the universe is to be  taken as a whole. This is the comprehensive vision  regarding the world. By the world अदः it is  denoted that one&rsquo;s own true nature of being which is the  substratum of the appearance and disappearance of the  universe, Le. the Brahman or the real nature of the Self.  And then one should observe the pervasiveness of this self in the appearance of the whole universe ( पूर्णम् उदच्यते ). By this; when the universe is falsified. Then this falsfication is called as, पूर्णस्य पूर्णम् आदाय।  Shaṅkara writes here as TIRASKRITYA,. i.e. by.  negating the universe which is only an attribution due to  ignorance, by Brahma-Vidya. After negating, tbe infinite Brahman alone remains ( पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ).</p>
<p>So here the life in its reality is the pure Being and the  substratum of the, appearance of the universe which is the infinite and the universe which is the appearance of the pure being (from the standpoiot of ignorance) are also taken as  a whole. Apart from these two- the pure being as substratum and the appearance of the universe due to ignorance,  there is no third type of experience in our life. Hence this  is the correct view of comprehensive vision of life. No other science except Vedānta has got this type of comprehensive vision of life. All other sciences have relied on  the biased opinion of waking state alone and taking the  individuality as our true- nature. But in Vedānta, the microcosm (व्यष्टि अहंकार -the individual Jeeva )-and the macrocosm ( समष्टि अहंकार -the coslnic Self, i.e the Hi&rsquo;ra-r  nyagarbha) are taken together as one unit (which are of  adventitious and ephemeral nature) along with the substratum which is our true nature. Hence this view is a method  of seeing: life as a whole. This is the first fundamental of Shaṅkara-Vedānta. If an aspirant understands this it  will be easy for him to know all other teachings of Shānkara  Vedānta.</p>
<p>Now we have to discuss on the second fundamentat  principle. i.e. Cognising the Witnessing Principle of life  which would be very easy after knowing the above first  fundamental of Shaṅkara-Vedanta. We shall see this in  subsequent chapter.</p>
<h2 id="2-witnessing-principle">2 Witnessing principle</h2>
<p>Tha 2nd Fundamental: Cognising the Witnessing principle of life which is the substratum of Vyakta &amp; Avayakta.</p>
<p>NATURE OF WITNESSING SELF:</p>
<p>Sri Shri SatcmdanaAdendra Saraswati Swamiji has  declared that until and unless one cognises that the Witnessing principle, which is his true nature and which is  called as the Witness of Anubhava or sAkshi  Anubhava, is quite separate nom the two types of experiences such as,</p>
