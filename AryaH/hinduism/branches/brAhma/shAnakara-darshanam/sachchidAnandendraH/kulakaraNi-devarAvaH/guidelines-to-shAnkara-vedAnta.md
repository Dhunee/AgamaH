### INTRODUCTION  
Nowadays it is very essential to know Acharya  Shaṅkara's teachings in its true perspective according to his  Prasthānatraya Bhashyas, because Shaṅkara-Vedānta has been  misunderstood and misinterpreted by the sub-commentators  on Shri Shaṅkara's Bhāṣyas. Accordingly the seekers are  confused and confounded by many distortions, misinterpretations and misguiding versions of Shaṅkara's original  Bhashyas. To comprehend the fullest import of the teachings  of Shaṅkara, we have to take the traditional works of  Gaudapāda's Kārikā on Mānḍukya Upanishad, Upadesha  Sāhasrī, an independent work of Shri Shaṅkara and Sureshvara's Vārtikas on Taittiriya and Brhadaranyaka Bhashyas  of Shri Shaṅkara and his independent work called Naishkarmya Siddhi. All these contain the idea of pristine pure Vedānta in unequivocal voice. Teachings based on these works are not easily available to the aspirants of  Shaṅkara-Vedānta. To remove this scarcity, Shri Shri  Satchidānandendra Saraswati Swāmiji of Karnataka State,  has made a sustained effort to show the genuine teachings  through his writings. The first book is published in Kannada viz. "Shānkara Vedānta Sara." In the introduction to this  book Swamiji has declared that "never before in any part  of the world a book of this type which contain subject wise classification of the sentences of the Bhashya and  traditional books referred to above has been published."  In this direction he has published hundreds of books in  three languages viz. Kannada, Sanskrit and English.  

Fortunately for me I came across Shrl Swamiji and  studied most of his books and followed his guidances for nearly twenty years (1954-55 to 1974-75). I have also  propagated this teaching in some parts of Karnataka, Andhra  Pradesh and Maharashtra and also to some foreign aspi rants. By this experience of 25 years of teachings and  discussion with various kinds of people I have gathered  some definite ideas regarding the methodology of teaching  this pristine pure Shaṅkara-Vedānta.    

According to this methodology an aspirant should  know at first the fundamentals of Shaṅkara- Vedānta,  which work as a key to open the treasury to Shaṅkara  Vedānta. Without a thorough understanding of these fundamental principles, the aspirant will not be able to follow  or to grasp the subtle teachings of the Prasthānatraya  Bhāshyas.  

At the outset it may be mentioned that these fundamentals (= basic rules of interpretation) are mainly five in  number  

- Relying on the intuitive experiences of universal  acceptance and comprehensive vision of life (sārvatrika-pūrṇānubhava)  
- Realising the Witnessing principle of life which is  beyond ego (sākṣi-darśana)  
- The methodology of deliberate Superimposition and  subsequent Rescission (adhyārōpa-apavāda-nyāya)-the Vedantic  devices adopted in the Upanishads for the purpose of teaching the nature of Absolute Reality.  
- The distinction of the empirical standpoint and  transcendental standpoint, i.e. Vyavahāra Dr̥shti and Paramārtha Drshti (vyāvahārika-dr̥ṣṭi-pāramārthika-dr̥ṣṭi)  
- Understanding the difference between the Sadhanas  of Vastutantra and Kartrtantra, i e.  knowledge depending on ontological facts (vastutantra) as against action depending upon human will or effort (kartr̥-tantra or puruṣa-tantra).    

These five are the vital principles to know Shaṅkara Vedānta. Strictly speaking these are the foundations on which the edifice of Shaṅkara-Vedānta is built. Unless and until the seeker can discern these fundamentals, it will be very difficult for him to reconcile the seemingly coniTadictory statements of Bhashyas. There have arisen divergent views (misconceptions) not only among the followers of  adverse schools (like Madhva, Ramanuja etc,) but also  among those that owe their atlegiance to Shaṅkara's tradition itself (like Bhamatikara, Vivaranacharya etc). These differences of opinion are, due mostly to either disregarding these basic rules of interpretations or overlooking the  needful importance to these five fundamentals mentioned  above. According to Shri Satchidanandendra SaraswatI  Swamiji's teachings based on Shaṅkara Bhashyas, if we try  to understand the various standpoints adopted for the  purpose of teachings, then all our misconceptions and doubts  will get removed. For this purpose I propose to explain here these five fundamentals briefly, as interpreted by the  Revered Swamiji of Hotenarsipur, only to understand the  subject-matter of Shaṅkara-Vedānta in its true perspective.  

Shri Swamiji, my Gurudev, has explained these five  fundamentats in his various works. I propose to put them  in one book-form. These fundamentals have been culled  out from the various works of Shri Swamiji. So they are not  new inventions of my own. I am indeed greatly indebted  to my Guruji for this.  

After going through this book very carefully. an  aspirant will realise that he is in a position to study the  Shankaira Bhashyas. Apart from this, he will be able to  realise that the teachings of Acharya Shaṅkara are consistent with life and experience and these form definite means  to get peace and tranquility in this very life. Hence this  book is appropriately titled 'Guide-lines to Shaṅkara Vedānta'.  

( 5 ) 

Without the guidance of the Upanishads as taught by a Guru, who is well-versed in the traditional method of  instruction (shrotriya) and who is realized or intuited the ultimate reality (brahmaniṣṭha). the nature of Reality cannot be  easily comprehended. For this purpose I have discussed  the full significances of ten important suggestions (guidances) of Shri Swamiji: as· mentioned in his book "Misconceptions about Shaṅkara" in the Appendix.  

The credit for writing this book should go to  Shn R. B. Gopinath, Bangalore and Shā Manas Kumar Sanyal of  Calcutta. Both are ardent students of Shaṅkara-Vedānta and  keen followers of the teaching of Shri Shri Satchidanandendra Saraswati Swamij. May the Almighty and Shri Sadguru bless them in all the aspects of life.

Guidelines to Shaṅkara-Vedānta  

## 1 Universal experience
CHAPTER-1    

The first fundamental: Relying on the intuitive  experiences of universal acceptance and comprehensive vision of life.  

### 1. SPECIFIC FEATURE OF VEDANTAS 
(UPANISHADS) 

According śrī śaṅkara though the Upanishads are indivisible part of Vedas, the teaching contained in the  Upanishads is quite unlike the other types of teachings like rituals (Karmas), meditations (Upāsanas),+++(5)+++ taught in Vedas. Hence the deliberations on Brahman i.e. Brahma-Jijnāsā has been taught separately from the deliberations on Dharma, i e. Dharma-Jijnāsā which mainly teach us the rituals and meditations. 

To perform rituals etc., one should  observe Varnas, Ashramas, age, condition etc. So it is not  applicable commonly to alt. This Dharma-Jijnāsā runs on  the common belief that 'I am so and so, I am a doer of  actions, I am happy, I am miserable" etc. accepting agentship and enjoyership. This part of the text of Veda is authoritative in its own field. This is accepted by Shaṅkara  as it has been accepted by other Mimāmsakas as he is himself a follower of Sanātana Vaidika Dharma. 

But his main contention is that apart from this Dharma-Jijnasa there is Brahma-Jijnasa, i.e. deliberation on Brahman which  is also taught by Veda in the last portion thereof which  are called Aranyakas (Upanishads). This Brahma-Jijnasa is based on Universal acceptance and comprehensive vision of life. Though this is the fact, these two forms of Jijnasas  are not rival to each other, because Brahma-Jijnasa nourishes the Dharma-Jijnasa in one aspect +++(śamadamādi-sādhanārtham - svasmin, jīvāntarē ca)+++ and the Dharma Jijnasa will lead to Brahma-Jijnasa in another aspect.+++(4)+++ 

8

Thus they are complementary to each other. Hence Shaṅkara declares in Brha Bhashva-2/4/10 thus:  

> वेदस्य हि निरपेक्षं स्वार्थे प्रमाणम् … तस्माद् यत्तेनोक्तं तत् तथैव प्रतिपत्तव्यम् आत्मनः श्रेय इच्छद्भिः - ज्ञानं वा कर्म वा।  
> 'The Veda is absolutely valid with regard to its subject-matter. … Therfore those who aspire after the  well being must accept the verdict at the Vedas on knowledge or on rites; as it is. " 

It was also shown by Shaṅkara how the conflict with the injunctions about the rites and duties is to be resolved by a reference to the distinction between the enlightened  and unenlightened men.+++(5 kimuktam??)+++ {S-Bh-1 /3/19}  

According: to Shaṅkara, the Dharma-Jijnasā i.e. the deliberation on religious matters has taken for granted the common belief of the agentship and enjoyership. It has not set out to determine the true nature of the Self. So it is authoritative in its field only. For this purpose  Shaṅkara declares in his Adhyasa Bhashya:  

> "It is a fact that a man performing religious duties or Karma does not attain the exquisite fruits of  scriptural duties unless he has acquired a knowledge through belief in the Shastras that his essential nature of Atman is separate from his body, senses  etc.+++(5)+++ Still a knowledge of the absolute Reality that  is the Self is not a pre-requisite for such a man who  is ignorant of his true nature, for the knowledge of  Reality has no relevance here, and it is opposed to  agentship of action in as much as the nature of  Atman (as taught in Vedānta) is beyond hunger and  thirst, free from such differentiation as Brahmin  caste, Kshatriya caste etc, and is not subject  to birth and death (Brha-3/5/1 & 3/4/6).+++(4)+++ And  the scriptures, which are operative before the dawn of the real knowledge of the Self cannot transgress the limits of their dependence on people grouping in  nescience"+++(4)+++  

So it is evident that the scriptural texts belonging to  the Karma-Kanda is meant for those ignorant people who  do not know the essential nature of Atman. And in the  ultimate Reality of Atman, there are really no castes, no  relationships with body, sense organs, mind, intellect etc.  and no categories of the nature of action, means of action  and fruits of action at all. So Shaṅkara distinguishes the Brahma-Jijnasa from Dharma-Jijnasa. For this reason when  he comments on the first Shariraka Sutra, he discusses as to what the word "अथ', i,e. 'afterwords' denotes. Here we have to observe that it is not the meaning of this word  that after completing Dharma-Jijnasa alone one will be fit  for Brahma-Jijnasa. But before or after the Dharma Jijnasa he who has got the pre-requisite qualities such as  

- (i) discrimination between eternal and non-eternal ( nityānitya-vivēka ); 
- (ii) dispassion for the enjoyment of the  fruits of work here and here after (ihāmutrārtha-phala-bhōga-virāgaḥ)  
- (iii) a perfection of such practices as, control of mind,  control of senses and organs etc ( śama-damādi-sādhana-sampat ); and  
- (iv) an intense desire for liberation ( mumukṣutvañ ca ) can under take a deliberation on the Upanishadic texts for getting a  direct knowledge of Brahman. So these are the inevitably  required qualities to deal with Brahma-Jijnasa. These are  called as SadhanaChatustaya Sampatti .+++(4)+++  

One important difference between these two types of  deliberations on Dharma and Brahman is shown in Sūtra  Bhashya-1/1/2.  

> न धर्मजिज्ञासायामिव श्रुत्यादय एव प्रमाणं ब्रह्मजिज्ञासायाम् ।  
> किन्तु श्रुत्यादयो ऽनुभवादयश् च यथासम्भवमिह प्रमाणम्,  
> अनुभवावसानत्वाद् भूत-वस्तुविषयत्वाच् च ब्रह्मज्ञानस्य ।

In this sentence Shaṅkara emphatically declares that  the deliberation on Brahman should and must culminate  in one's own intuitive experience. So here the Vedāntic Anubhava (Vedantic intuition) is also a Pramāna, but not merely the Shruti alone just as it is in the case of Dharma-Jijnasa. In the case of religious duty, the utterances of  the Shrutis etc. would be the only means of knowledge, because no direct experience is needed in support. But the knowledge of Self, which relates to an already existing entity, culminates in experience. Hence it is evident  here, that the Brahma-Jijnasa starts on the firm ground of  universal acceptence and comprehensive vision of life.  Hence this is the first fundamental of Sharikara Vedānta - relying on common experience and taking the full view of  life. As an elaboration we shall explain the significance of  common experience or universal acceptance and comprehensive vision of life in the following pages.  

### 2. UNIVERSAL ACCEPTANCE OR COMMON EXPERIENCE

To determine the reality we have to rely on the firm  ground of common experience meaning the experiences  which are common to all irrespective of caste, creed, gender,  age, stage of life (Ashrama), time, place etc. For example,  the knowledge about fire that it is hot, the knowledge about  ice that it is cold Qr direct perception just as we see external things through our eyes (the acquisition of knowledge  through a contact of the eye with some objects) etc. These  types of common experiences never change their nature.  Shaṅkara thus says in Brha Bhashya - 2/1/1 5 :  

> (i) "For a thing can never change its nature, just as  fire invariably burns and illumines straw, tender  grass etc, that come in contact with it. If it does  not, we cannot assert that fire burns or illumines"  (Brha Bh-2/1/15)  

Shaṅkara has hence declared in his Brahma Sātra  B hāshya-2/2/11 thus:  

> (ii) तच् च सम्यग्-ज्ञानम् एकरूपम् , वस्तुतन्त्रत्वात्। एकरूपेण ह्य् अवस्थितो योऽर्थः स परमार्थः।  लोके तद्-विषयं ज्ञानं सम्यग्-ज्ञानम् इत्युच्यते — यथाग्निर् उष्ण इति।  
> And that true enlightenment has no diversity, since  it must conform to an existent fact (वस्तुतन्त्रवत्).  That content of knowledge is said to be the most  real since it ever remains the same and in the  world. the knowledge of that kind is said to be right  knowledge as for instance, the knowledge about fire  that it is hot.  

Here Shaṅkara gives the example that the fire is hot this denotes the universal experience (common experience- भूयो-दर्शन). 


For this purpose he often uses such words- दृश्यते, अदर्शनात्, दृष्टत्वात्, अदृष्टत्वात् etc. in his Bhashyas.  

> (iii) "In all the bodies, liquids such as secretions, blood  etc. are seen ( दृश्यते) to present in abundance."  [ s. Bh-3/1/2 ]  

> (iv) "For the organs cannot either go or stay any where unless they have a material support, since this is contrary to experience, it is not noticed (अदर्शनात्)  in any living creature.·' [ S. Bh- 3/1/3 ]  

> (v) "Accordingly it is a matter of common experience  (लोके ऽनुभवः) that the nacre appears as siver and  a single moon appears as two." [-Adhyasa Bhashya]  

So to determine the reality we have to rely on the  common experience, i.e. a truth can be called as such only  if it is acceptable and verifiable by everyone at all times.+++(4)+++  Shaṅkara emphatically declares in Gita Bhashyas (18/16)  that, "even a hundred Shruti texts cannot be considered to  be valid if they pronounce fire to be cold or non-luminous,"  In Brha Bhashya (2/1/20) also he says: 'you cannot prove  that fire is cold or that the sun does not give heat, even by citing a hundred examples, for the facts would already be  known to be otherwise through another means of knowledge."  

> 1 न हि श्रुतिशतमपि ‘शीतोऽग्निरप्रकाशो वा’ इति ब्रुवत् प्रामाण्यमुपैति । 

To determine the transcendental reality Shaṅkara has  followed the footsteps of the utterances of the Shrutis  which denote and culminate in the universal acceptance  (i-e. common to all persons) and comprehensive tri-basic  vision of life (i.e. which follows the experiences of the  three states of waking, dream and deep sleep). So the  truth should be based on this firm ground and not on the  experience of an individual soul. Shaṅkara himself  never said that it is my own experience.+++(5)+++ He says, everything  should be proved by direct universal intuition and reasoning  based on such intuition as far as possible. The truth  should not be based merely on the utterances (study of  teachings) of any great Soul or Omniscient being or Prophet or Philosopher or the thinker, nor does it depend on  the implicit faith alone in the mere utterances of the scriptures. Truth, however, is one and what is against common  experience must be rejected, whoever says it even if he be  the Lotus-born ( Brahma). 

Strictly speaking the Advaita  Siddhanta is not creation of Shaṅkara but it is universal  truth based on common experience. The transcendental  Reality is called as Brahman or Atman in the Upanishads and  in Gita. It is declared in these Shastras that this Reality  is the Self of all. For examples:  

> "एक देवः सर्वभूतेषु गूढः” (Shvetashvatara-6/11)  
> एकस् तथा सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा (Katha-2/2/9, 19, 11)  
> क्षेत्रज्ञं चापि मां बिद्धि सर्वक्षेत्रषु (Geeta-13/2)  
> “ईश्वरः सर्वभूतानां हृद्देशे.. तिष्ठति” (Geeta-18/61)  
> “समोऽहं सर्वभूतेष” (Geeta-9/29) etc.  

By this we can understand that the transcendental  Reality which is taught in the Upanishads and in Gita is  the Self of all. So it should be cognised on the basis of  common experience alone and not on the individual mystic  experiences which have been gained by some practices  like Yoga, Samadhi etc. These types of individual mystic  experience are there but they are not useful to determine transcendental Reality which is called PARAMARTHAHA.+++(5)+++  ShrI Shaṅkara has clarified that pure Consciousness which is the Witnessing Self can be cognised and experienced as  it is our own true Self which can neither be denied or  accepted. It is transcendental, but can be experienced intuitively. Shaṅkara gives supreme importances to universal  experiences (but not on individual experiences) in determining the validity of the statement of scriptures.  

So it is proved here that to know the signifticance of  Shaṅkara-Vedānta we should rely on the universal acceptance -common experience. This is called Sārvatrika  Anubhava (सार्वत्रिकानुभवः) . Now we shall de:al with  the comprehensive vision of life i.e पूर्णानुभव.  

### 3. pUrNAnubhava   
OR COMPREHENSIVE VISION OF LIFE

#### 1 Non-vedAnta view
A. Partial view of life according to the physical  science and all other systems of Philosophy  except Vedānta  

The common experience of the wor1dly life is divided  into two parts, i.e. the subject and the object. The external  world is the obiect and the perceiver of this is the subject.  All empirical experiences consist of the subject-object relationship. On this supposition all other sciences, first want  to discover the truth regarding the objects. In this process  also every science. e.g. Physics, Chemistry, Engineering  etc. takes a part and partial view of the objective world.  From this standpoint there are so many subject-matters  which, are variously divided and every science deals with a  particular subject-matter. 

Apart from this the Psychology also deals with the subject which consists of analysing the  mind of other persons and creatures which are objects  for their own mind. According to this there are so many  varieties such as human psychology, child psychology etc. Sometimes they take the subjective mind of their own and  they infer regarding the objective mind on the basement of the behaviour of other persons, creatures etc. 

So the material science and the psychiatry which are very important these days-; have not got -or retied on the comprehensive vision regarding the universe. For example, even in the case of a person who has studied the whole of the solasr system which is the universe one will come to the conclusion that in view of there being so many solar systems in the vast universe it will be impossible to know everything in this universe. From this standpoint, all scieinces are dealing with a part of the universe and not a the universe as  a whoie with comprehensive aspect. This is the position  of the material sciences.  

The above sciences deal with the objects which are regulated by time, space and causation. Hence the sciences which are dealing with the part of the universe are bound  by these factors and they have no capacity to extricate  themselves from these regulations. 

#### 2 Vedantic view
B VEDANTIC VIEW REGARDING THE UNIVERSE

In Vedānta the whole pnenomenon o' the universe is  divided into there planes :  

- i) the Divine plaNe : Adhidaivika Prapancha   
- ii) the Material plane- Adhibhautika Prapancha,  
- iii) the Corporeal plane- Adhyatmika Prapancha,  

The first is the divine plane which means (from the  Sanskrit root- div, to shine} the sun, the moon, the stars,  ptanets etc, Which are miltions and billions in number;  the divine worlds according to the religious beliefs such  as heavenly worlds upto Brahma- Loka- including all these,  the Vedānta takes in one group as divine plane or Adhi Daivika Prapancha. 

The material plane means the world which we see- the  conglomeration of the five elements-  Ether, Air, Fire, Water and the Earth -  all types of bodies of all creatures, all the  things which we see and all types of scientific machines  etc, which are already invented and to be invented in future such as computers, robots, etc- all these are to be taken  in this plane, ie the material plane or Adhibhautika Prapancha_  

The corporeal plane is connected with the subject, while the above said two planes are coming in the category of the objects or the objective world. In this  corporeal plane are the body, vital force, organs of action and  sense organs, mind, intellect and feelings of sorrow and  pleasure etc, including the Me-notion are included.  This group is called as Corporeal plane Of Adhyatma Prapancha, because all these are assembled together just like any machinery like a watch assembled with dial,  springs etc.. This group is called in Vedānta as kArya-kArNa  Sanghata {Gi-13j20,. This iss the technical term of Vedānta  which denotes the corporeal plane. A these form the  third group.  

Besides these three planes, we have to take the infinite  idea of time, space and causation. The time-space factor  appear in our daily life as if they are real and beginningless  and endless and hence infinite. The questron will be  absked that, "In which time does the time factor appear ?  In which place the idea of space is there" Because without the concept of time or space there will be no kind  of dealings such as thinking, talking and acting. For this  purpose philosophers who started thinking regarding the  truth of time and space which are meta-physics have come  to different conclusions in this matter:  

a) Some say that the distance between two things is  called as space and the intervening period between two  events is called as 'time'.  

b) Others say that the above view is not correct  because to count the things 1, 2, 3, etc. the space is required as the substratum-. So also in the case of events, without  the substratum ot time, there will be no counting of series of events.  

c) Others hold the view that the notion of tim-e and  space- are there where there is the mind and hence these are the a priori notions of the mind.  

d) Others say that time, space and causation -  all these are relative to each other. There is no absolute time, space or causation. Neither time nor space has any existence  of its own; each exists or seems to exist only in constant relation to and association with other. So, all all dealings are coming under the relativity alone. There may be an absolute truth, it may be God (= a Great Geometer) also. This final conclusion is drawn by Einstein. 

Here we have to remember that "bereft of time factor, there will be no  causation," because cause means that which exists  inevitably before the effect (Kārya Niyata pUrva vRttiH  KAranam). This is the judgement ot Nyaya-shastra (Indian logician). So, the idea of causation cannot be considered apart from the time factor.  

The Vedantic view of the Universe comprehends an  the infinite tdea of time, space, causation etc, with  all the multiplicity of the universe including the "Me notion " and is considered as a single unit of the appearance of the universe. This whole unit of the  universe appears in the waking state. Shri Shaṅkara explains the nature of the universe itself in a comprehensive  way in his S-Bh- 1/1/2 as foUows :  

" ... this universe that is manifested through name and  form, that is associated with diverse agents and experiencers, that provides the support for actions and results  having well-regulated space, time and causation, and that  defies all thoughts about the real nature of its creation".  

This is the Vedantic view of comphrehensive vision of  the phenomenon of the universe. 

#### 3 Method of experiencing
C. Method of observing the life as a whole:    

The physical sciences seek the aid of instruments,  gadgets and appliances to establish their truths, and even so they can never reach any finality because they thrive  only in one state-the waking state, discarding the universal  experiences of two other states of life i.e. dream-state &  deep sleep-state.+++(5)+++ This is evidently a partial view of life and the truths arrived at thereby are also only partial.  But Vedānta takes into considertion the whole life in all  its manifested and unmanifested forms, i.e. the Vedānta  takes the human experiences of all the three states viz,  Waking, Dream & Deep sleep to arrive at its conclusions. So  Vedantic conclusions which are based on intuitive experiences, become irrefutable and valid for all times. No other  system of philosophy except Vedānta bases its enquiry  on a comprehensive tri-basic view of life and on the  principle of universal acceptance.  

Where there is an appearance of the waking state, the state contains the whole of the above said unit (mentioned  in the previous article No. III B). When the waking state  disappears, there is no appearance of the above said dualistic universe. For example, in deep sleep there is no  appearance of the waking state. Where there is the  appearance of the dream, in that state also another kind  of the unit of universe appears just as it is described in the  case of waking state. But when dream state disappears the whole unit of that universe also disappears.  

So in Vedānta, the comprehensive vision of appearance  and disappearance of the dualistic world is taken together.  These two are described as manifested and unmanifested  forms of the universe. These are technical terms used in  Vedānta as Vyakta  and Avyakta  in  Gita-8/18; Sat and asat in Gita -13/12;  Kshara and Akshara  in Gita-15/16;  Vidita and Avidita in Kena-Upanishad, Murta and Amurta in Brhadaranyaka Upanishad--2/3/1 ; Sambhuti  and Asambhuti  in Ishavasyopanishad-12 etc. Here Shaṅkara  says the meaning of these as व्याकृत and  अव्याकृत in Sutra Bhashya-2/1/27.  

The revered Swamiji of Holenarsipur has given this  practical and all embracing outlook of comprehensive  vision of life while explaining Tribasic method of Vedānta,  ie. AVASTHATRAYA based on Shaṅkara Bhashya Mandukya-Mantra-5 in his Mandukya Rahasya VivrtiH. Here he  explains the whole range of life which is divided into parts:  That is darshana Vriti (-the states of waking & dream  where one sees something else) and Adarshana Vrtti (-the  states of deep sleep and trance wherein one sees nothing)  [दर्शनादर्शनेन वृत्त्योः तत्वाप्रतिबोधलक्षणस्य स्वापस्य तुल्यत्वात् Man-Bh-5]. In Upanishads and in Gita the same method  is taken as shown above. Taking these both sides of life  ( = the whole of life in all its manifested and unmanifested forms) and determining the truth is an important thing  in Vedānta All types of experiences just as common  man's experiences, mystic experien es of Yogis, Upasakas  and so on, are all included in the Vyakta or Darshana Vrtti.  And in deep sleep, when there is no appearance of the  dualistic world, it is said from the standpoint of waking state that it ( =dualistic world) exists in the unmanifested  seed-form, meaning that it disappears for the time being  etc.+++(5)+++ This experience is common to all and is called  avyakta or Adarshana Vrtti. It is an undeniable fact that  there is no third category of experience besides the two states - Darshana Vritti and Adarshana Vrtti. (1. The three states are the objects of knowledge for, there  cannot be anything knowable besides these three states) 

This is comprehensive vision of life. This is common to all and so it is  universal acceptance. This is the method of observing the  life as a whole. This type of analysis is not based on any  individual experience. The individual experiences which are gained through efforts are bound to time, space and  causation factors but one's own being which is the subtratum of the Darshana and Adarshana Vrttis is clearly beyond the dualistic condition such as space, time etc.  The locus or substratum of all these various illusory phenomenon of manifested and unmanifested forms is certainly the pure consciousness-the Atman alone which is really  real.+++(5)+++ On this firm ground of one's own Being ( =the  Witnessing principle of life) is Shaṅkara-Vedānta built.  Those who have overlooked the principle of Tri-basic view  are unable to understand Shaṅkara properly.  

Thus after observing this comprehensive view of life,  one can easily cognise his own Being which is the  substratum of these two appearance and disappearance of  the universe. This Being is the real nature of the Self. So  Shri Shaṅkara describes this comprehensive view of life  in MandUkya Bhashya-3 thus:  

> सर्वस्य प्रपञ्चस्य साधिदैविकस्य अनेनात्मना अतुष्पात्त्वस्य विवक्षितत्वात्  
> meaning "in as much as the intention is to show that the entire phenomenal universe and the world  of Gods, together with this gross cosmic Self, contribute  to the constitution of the four aspects of Atman."  

#### 4 Sārvatrika  Pūrṇa Anubhava
D. Correct meaning of the term Sārvatrika  Pūrṇa Anubhava:  

Commonly in Shaṅkara Vedānta, to realise the true  nature of the Self a common belief was prevailing is that  we have to get some individual mystic experience like  Samadhi, etc.+++(5)+++ On this belief the aspirants were trying to understand Shaṅkara's teachings. Till Shri Shri Satchidanandendra Saraswati Swamiji dawned on the horizon of  Vedānta, there was no usage of this first fundamental, i.e.  universal acceptance and comprehensive vision of life. The  word "Sārvatrika  Pūrṇa Anubhava" denotes the above said criterion. The readers are referred to Sanskrit introduction to Mandukya Rahasya Vivrtti by Swamiji -Anubhavasya  Pramukhyam-the predominance of Anubhaba. Here he has  given he correct meaning o~the term "Anubhava". The word "Anubhava" is not used is Vedānta in the sense  of perceptions, feeling or emotion or newly acquired mystic experiences through the practices of Japa, meditation or practice of Patanjala Yoga which are called mystic  experiences, which are concerned with the individuals and which also vary from one individual to another.+++(5)+++ But that  which is common to all, by which the waking, dream and  deep sleep states are directly intuited and which reminds  the experience of the dream and deep sleep directly to the  waking intellect+++(5)+++ and that which gives room to differentiate  the waking state from other two states and which is not relying on the functions of the sense organs or the mind  etc. and which is itself the true nature of conciousness of  one's own, that Witnessing Self itself is called as Sākṣhi  Anubhava or Intuition in Vedānta.  

This clarity regarding the word Anubhava representing  the true Shaṅkara Prakriya has not been told by any  Vedintin except by Shri Swimiji of Holenarsipur in the  hoary history of Vedānta. So this is a revelation in the  field of Shaṅkara-Vedānta brought about by Shri Swamiji.  By this, Vedānta has been rescued from the belief that the  Advaita Vedānta also is a cult just like Dvaita, Vishishṭādvaita etc. Swamiji has thus showed that this is the  universal truth which could be understood by anyone if  one has got the capacity of understanding.  

### 4. Conclusion
IV. CONCLUSIVE REMARKS REGARDING THE FIRST  FUNDAMENTAL :  

Thus the comprehensive vision of life and universal  acceptance is the first fundamental of Shankara-Vedānta.  In Shruti and Smrtis the transcendental reality, i.e. the  reat nature of the Self is described as the Self of all.+++(5)+++ So  here we have to take the common experience of all. For  example: 

In Upanishads:

> एको देवः सर्वभूतेषु गूढः - Shvetashvatara-6/11  
> एष सर्वेषु भतेषु गूढो आत्मा- Katha 1/3/12  
> एकस् तथा सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा-Katha 2/2/9, 10, 11 etc.

And in Geeta :

> “समोऽहं सर्वभूतेषु"-Geet -9/29  
> “समं सर्वेषु भूतेषु तिष्ठन्तं परमेश्वरम्"--Geeta--13/27  
> “अहमात्मा गुडाकेशः सर्वभताशयस्थितः”- Geeta - 10/20  
> "ईश्वरः सर्वभूतानां हृद्देशे तिष्ठति”-Geeta-18/61  
> "क्षेत्रज्ञं च मां विद्धि सर्वक्षेत्रेषु'-Geeta--13/2 etc.

In this way the comprehensive vision of life which is explained above is another important thing is Shankara-Vedanta.

This is hinted by the following Mantra :

> POORNAMADHA POORNAMIDAM Brha--5/1/1.
> पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात् पूर्णमुदच्यते । पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ॥

Here it is hinted that by the word idam, the appearance and disappearance of the universe is to be  taken as a whole. This is the comprehensive vision  regarding the world. By the world अदः it is  denoted that one's own true nature of being which is the  substratum of the appearance and disappearance of the  universe, Le. the Brahman or the real nature of the Self.  And then one should observe the pervasiveness of this self in the appearance of the whole universe ( पूर्णम् उदच्यते ). By this; when the universe is falsified. Then this falsfication is called as, पूर्णस्य पूर्णम् आदाय।  Shaṅkara writes here as TIRASKRITYA,. i.e. by.  negating the universe which is only an attribution due to  ignorance, by Brahma-Vidya. After negating, tbe infinite Brahman alone remains ( पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ). 

So here the life in its reality is the pure Being and the  substratum of the, appearance of the universe which is the infinite and the universe which is the appearance of the pure being (from the standpoiot of ignorance) are also taken as  a whole. Apart from these two- the pure being as substratum and the appearance of the universe due to ignorance,  there is no third type of experience in our life. Hence this  is the correct view of comprehensive vision of life. No other science except Vedānta has got this type of comprehensive vision of life. All other sciences have relied on  the biased opinion of waking state alone and taking the  individuality as our true- nature. But in Vedānta, the microcosm (व्यष्टि अहंकार -the individual Jeeva )-and the macrocosm ( समष्टि अहंकार -the coslnic Self, i.e the Hi'ra-r  nyagarbha) are taken together as one unit (which are of  adventitious and ephemeral nature) along with the substratum which is our true nature. Hence this view is a method  of seeing: life as a whole. This is the first fundamental of Shaṅkara-Vedānta. If an aspirant understands this it  will be easy for him to know all other teachings of Shānkara  Vedānta.  

Now we have to discuss on the second fundamentat  principle. i.e. Cognising the Witnessing Principle of life  which would be very easy after knowing the above first  fundamental of Shaṅkara-Vedanta. We shall see this in  subsequent chapter. 

## 2 Witnessing principle    

Tha 2nd Fundamental: Cognising the Witnessing principle of life which is the substratum of Vyakta & Avayakta.  

NATURE OF WITNESSING SELF:  

Sri Shri SatcmdanaAdendra Saraswati Swamiji has  declared that until and unless one cognises that the Witnessing principle, which is his true nature and which is  called as the Witness of Anubhava or sAkshi  Anubhava, is quite separate nom the two types of experiences such as,  

~). Pratvava 'Anlllbha'<fa-t'he peTc~t'on which 'Comes  with tfile cClAtact of other objects through sense  organs, and  

cā)Vedana Anubhava-the emotiQns or fee'ings or  menta~ conceptions which occur bereft of the  functions of sense orgal1s . <)Illy in the mind, just as  aogerT happiness, devotion, jealousy etc. including  the mystic experiences of Yoga philosophy,  

it is impossible to recogn1se that theTe is OUf true  nature which is calted as Anubhava Swa.fupa and in  which all types of experiences culminate and which is the  'witness of aU . modifications of Antahkarana including the  6Me-notion' and hence it is difficult to penetrate the secrets  of Shati~ara-Vedānta. Echoing this Vifw,Stui Shaākafa has  declared' in his Sātra-Shashya-1/1 /4. that p  

Objection: Atman being the object of the 'Me-notion  it is not reasqnable . to say that he is known only from the  Upanishads.  

Reply: Not so. For we have refuted this position  by saying that this Atman is the Witness of that Ego.

This is (hie bed-book 01 tne nuge buālcfing of'  S.'181ikara- Vedānta'. SO' at firs.t an asprrant shO'tJld cognise,  tois Witness as one's own Self through the teachin~ of the Shastra and the Guru. Aftef" cognising this; he 'iN'fll be abl&  to' take a stand in this-true nature and tooo he wit' be fit to lInderstand the secrets of the" teachings of Shaṅkara Vedānta. This is the most mportao~ plf~nc~pl& illl: Sool=tkara-- " ectantao.  

Commonly to the empirical deal~ng5 when Ofle wants to  know something, ' he does sO with his- instruments such as;  mind, inteUect and :;.anse organs. With the aid of these·  instrum~nts one gains too f<now.edge of the externat  phenomena. This pashion is caHed as the kno'Wership OLf  Pramatr ( sr+fTQ:) This Pramatr ' is descrrbed tn the  above Bhashya-sentence as Aham Pra~'VaVa 'Kartr (a:$- lf(' ) m,eaning, knower. doer enioyer etcr, and aU  

these are included in one word, i.e. the 'Me-notion' or: the  'sense of r . This type of procedure is enough to know the  other objects as well as the psycologicalplane. But in  Vedānta, it is a very difficult and subtle task as one has to  cease his identification with mind-tntellect-sense organs  through discrimination according to the teachings of the  Shastr'a and the Guru. So here an introvert mind is  necessarily required.  

When an aspirant turns inward upto the Witnessing  principle of life. which is beyond the 'Me-notion', at that  time he remains as the Witness and he can objectify his own 

COGNISING THE WITNESSING PRINCIPLE OF LIFE 25    

'Me-notion' or 'Ego', This remaining as the Witnessing Princi ple is calle'd here as cognising the Witnessing Principle of  life. Here 'cognising' means· quite unāke the .cognising of  the other objects. Here it is just remaining as the Self.  To stay in one's own nature is called by Shaṅkara as  "f.iT~qTc{T;:rif"- Gi-Bh-3j30 & 18/49; ~T­ 

+rerf;r11T r;:ri['-Gi-Bh-18/54.  

I n this connection, one should not misunderstand  that the 'remaining as the Self' means we shall attain a  state like Nirvika/pa Samādhi etc., where there are no  dealings. That is why Shaṅkara has warned in S.Bh 

2/1/14, thus:  

"This also follows from the teaching that the embodi ed soul, is Brahman in essence . in the. passage, 'that is the  That Thou art, Shvetaketo'. This identity of the embodied  soul, that is taught, is a self-established truth and it  is not to be accomplished through some extraneous effort.  

" . ~ ~ffil. ~T~T~{~ FtmT~m~ ~a, ;{ ~y;:q{ I"  

"'  

From this it follows that like the idea of the ro(:>e re moving the ideas of snake etc. (superimposed on it), the  acceptance of the unity of the individual Self with Brahman,  as declared in the scriptures, results in the removal of the  idea of an individual soul bound up with the body, that is a  creation of beginningless ignorance. When this fa·lse  notion that embodied soul is the real Self is removed, all  those activities become sublated which are based on that  assumptions, which are created by ignorance, and for  supplying a rationa Ie for which a separate diversified part  is imagined in Brahman. It is farther shown by the  Upanishad, with the help of such passages as, 'But when  to the knower of Brahman everything has become the Self  then what should one see and through what l' (Brha 2/4/13) etc, that in the case of one who has realised  Brahman as the Self, all empirical dealings cease that are 

26 GUIDE-LINES TOSHANKARA-VEDANTA    

concerned with action, instruments _and results. It cannot  be said that this negation of dealings (in the Self) is  confined to a certain state (during liberation only), for the  identity of the Self and Brahman stated in, 'That Thou art'  is not contingent on any particular state."  

So here, the determination or the descerning factor on  the firm ground of one's O'Nn intuitional experience,  is the main criterion.  

II DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTELLECTUAL EXPERI ENCE AND INTUITIONAL EXPERIENCE:  

Now we have to understand as to what is the intui tional experience, because to cognise or to take a stand in  the Witnessing Principle of life, the intuitional experience  ( BTaft 3l'~ ) is the only means and not the intellectual  process of thinking ( ~;fTcr ). So in Vedānta when  we say discrimination or Vichara (f4::qr~) etc, it is not  the thinking process of the intellect as being an Ego, but  the introvert process of relying on the intuitional experi ence of life, and only here one will reali~e one's own  intuitional Self which is separate from the intellect or the  mind. Even though the mind is required to follow the  intuitional experience, here, it turns inwardly unlike its  habitual flow towards the outer objects through the sense  organs. That is why Shaṅkara says :  

II-The mind that is purified by the instructions of the  scriptures and the teacher. and control of body and  sense org~ns etc. become the instrument for realizing  the Self". (Gi-B h-2/21 )  

So at first the aspirant should discriminate ihe in tuional experience from the intellectual process of thinking.  The discriminating process is given below:  

How do we know that there is 'Me-notion'? How do  we know that 'I dreamt' or 'I slept happily' ? How do we  know that 'I am awake now'? Commonly all are puzzled 

COGNISING THE WITNESSING PRINCIPLE OF LIFE 27    

and think that they know these things through their mind.  But strictly speaking, the mind has no capacity to objectāy  the "Me-notion", because one generally says, 'My mind is  wandering here and there' etc. So the 'Me-notion' is the  User of the mind, The mind which concerns to the waking  state has .no capacity to extricate itself from this state and  pa$S on to the other states such as dream or sleep~  Suppose the waking mind really goes to the dream, then  it would have said that 'I have come here temporarily  from the waking state etc," just as a man says when he  travels temporarily to other places from where he originally  belongs to But in our experience we do not find such a  happening in the dream state. And in deep sleep there is  no trace of mind at all. This is in the experience of all. If it  is there it would not be called as deep sleep. So, the  presence or the absence of the mind is understood through  one's own nature of Witnessing Principle of life and it is  expressed through the mind and the intellect taking the  grab of 'Me-notion'. Due to lack of this deep discrimina tion all wrongly think that 'we know everything through  mind or intellect." Hence through the teachings of the Guru  and the Shastra, we have to discriminate the intuitional ex perience (~N~SR~) from the intellectual process of  

thinking ( :snIDr~lf~ ).  

In the above said manner when we say 'I dreamt' or  "slepJ happily: --these experiences are called as intui tional experiences in Vedānta, The word Intuition  ( ~ ) has got different meanings according to dictionary  but here in Vedānta the meaning of this word is:  'Tuition' (=Bodha or knowledge) which comes from 'in'  (= inside) to the intellect, so it is called as Intuitional ex perience. To get these experiences there is no need of any  of the activities or functions of the sense organs or the  mind. 't comes directly from the inner bosom , which is our  true nature. So our nature which is absolute nature of  consciousness directly reminds the experiences of dream  and deep sleep to the waking mind. So in Vedantic term i-

28 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA-VEDANTA  nology it is called as Sakshi Anubhava (. man ~ )'  This Sakshi Anubhava is quite separate from Anubhavas  which have been described above as perceptions, concep tions etc.    

When we are in the range of perceptions or emotions  (conceptions), inevitably we have taken the identification  with ou r mind and sense organs. But when we turn our  observations towards this intuitional experience, at that  time we lose our identification with our mind or the  Antahkarana and automatically we remain in our true nature  and objectify the Antahkarana by our true nature. This is  the difference between the ordinary thinking process of  the mind and the discriminating process of Vedānta.  For this purpose it is said that Viveka or Vichara does not  mean the ordinary process of thinking of the intellect. To  

take a stand in orie's own true nature of the Witnessing  Principle of life, this type of discrimination is the only  means and through this means only the cognition of the  Witnessing Principle of life, meaning getting Sakshi  Anubhava is possible. From this standpoint when one  follows the Vedantic teachings orie will easily grasp and  realise at last the non-dual absolute Self as the whole and  sole real ity.  

III. THE WITNESS AS DISTINCT FROM ACTIVE EGO.  

Process of Discrimination  

At first an aspirant should know that there are two  types of 'I' One is the acting 'I' ('Me-notion' in empirical  life) .and the other, the real I' (Sakshi or Witness of all).  In empirical dealings also these two types of 'I' are pre 

vailing -just as an actor tak~s part in the drama as the king  or an emperor and on the stage he acts just like a king  having all the adjuncts such as dress etc. At that time, he  says ~I am an emperQr' and performs all the actions related  to that part. This is the acting ~I'. But what he really is 

a mao in the world-that his being is the real 'I'. HavingCOGN1SrNG THE WITNESSJG PR~NCIPLEOF LrFE 29

This ~ndividuality  <lppears as if it is reat due t(} adjuncts like mind, intellect1  sense organs, body etc. which are OAty false appearances  :and of adveRtit~ous and eplitemet'al Aature, 1'estri~ted to a  particular state-either wakiflg Of dream, aAd aTe conjured  "up by ignorance.

iAdividuaHty wnich appears due to adjuncts. At th-at t~me  also" it continues to exist as j't was before.  

Shai1'kara deciares this thing in 'his Sutfa Bhashya 3/2/7 :  

'3l'fq :q ;r R«=l ~e{~!f ~&rCJfT ~qRt;fr~, ~!fr;:r qr~rQ.. I ~ert;tmTffi:crlf \3'Q'~m!ffi~ q~crRt~T"  q~lf d~:(I+rft'L ~,!ca- qfCfm J ~Rr (=f~crre{'"  ~T"f ferGtRrmRr ~Cf.It II'

And the same tthing "e confirms in S. Bh-1/1/9 thus:  

UThe individual soul Keeps awalte 50' tong as ~t is under  the influence ot the charactl3ristics of those obiects of  sense-percep~i,on which ill appr-ehends as. a result of its  contact w~t"" the cond~t;ion.~ng tactors cOflstiluted by  the diverse- manifestations of the min.d. .t assumes  the name of mind while seeing dreams under the

"  

rn these two Bhashva-Q,uotations we have to observe  the words PararupāpattimivB, meaning He appears as if  He has become an indi.vidual Jiva which is not his true  nature but only a gaFbed one.. Similarly in the second  quotatā.on the word Praāna Iva ( '"t.t ~er )~ meaning the  .ndividuat soul appears to be merged, as it were, in its  own Selt, owing 10 the absence of limiting adiuncts.  Strictly speaking there is no emerging Of merging w!th  one's own true nature tor him. But due to disappearance  of the adjuncts tn deep sleep it is described as Has if he has  merged in his true nature-'" So one's own true nature is  the Witness of the ·Me-notion'. This true nature need not  be gained newly by some efforts or through some experi 

ences of states like Samadhi etc, where there is no kind  of dealings~ 

COGN-IS1NG THE WITNESSING PR1NCPLE OF LIFE 31  

This truth is dectared by Sha~ara 'n S. B11-2/1/14  ijn SVAYAM PRASIDDHAM HI ETAT ... NIBANOHANA TVAAT" The gist 01 this Bhashya-quotation is "Being  BraAman is \7ery natuTe for aU if it is Tecognised thTough  11he teachings of Shastra and Gun! that the pTevious wrong  q'lotion that "' am an individuar is a false appearance and at  

the same time aU types of deal~Ags wHt also get cancetled  <or falsified- which are based Oft the phyot of indhriduality.  The Shruti says that after knnwing the Teal n.ature of the  Self there remains nothing regarding any defllings. This is  not restricted to any particuiar state where there aTe no  dealings bec8l!Jse, being Bvahman is one'Fs trl.Je nature and  hence it is Rot restricted to a partic1Jlar state.. So, this true  ;nature of the Witnessing Principle -of life is to be oog'Oised  through discrimination (\fh1eka) a"on~. So t'O cognise the  WitnessiAQ PriAci-ple, the discriminat,on or Viveka is tlhe  only means. Shaā.kafa says thj.~ t~me .and ,again in his  Sutfa Bnashya. For exampdtl ~  

-/Before the dawn of discri'minating kno'Wi-edg'e, the  ijndblidua~ sours nature of consc4ousness remains mixed up  ;as it were, with the body, senses, mind, 1nte4lect, sense- -objects and sorrow, happiness, but the same individual is  said to have its real nature when the discriminating know 4edge dawns from the Upanishads. Therefore the individuaf  saul continuing in the state of its unmanifested nature ...  owing to the absence of discriminating knowledge. is said  to have its real nature manifested when discriminating  knowledge dawns·. (S Bh. --1/3/19)  

Therefore the result of the discriminatory knowCedge ( m~r~ ) is the attainment of its reat nature, its realiza tion of its nature as the absolute Self.. The functton of  Antahkarana which take place at the time of discrimi nation is as follows. According to the teachings of  Vedānta and Acharya when the aspirant turns inwardly,  then  

i) The Antahkarana stops to sea the outer things

v) Las-tty he completely turns his attention towards  Witnessing PFincipie of the ego tf.lrough the discri minatton and concentration.  

At that time the aspirant himself remains as the  Witness. And 1he An1!ah~arana wtaich has followed  this nature, also starts to appear in the form of  the Witnessing Principle as it is completely per 

vaded and directlv illuminated bV the Self iust like  the mirage that is illuminated and pervaded by the  sunshine. Thus the seeker arrives at the final in 

tuition of Atman atter aborishing aU lhe superim positions.  

IV MiSCONCEPTIONS REGARDING THE WITNESS  AS MANY AND ONE ACCORDING TO SUB COMMENTARIES:  

The doctrine of Post-Shaṅkaras, who hold  that perception is of two kinds, to wit, Jeevs Suakshl and Ishvara-Saakhi, is totally opposed  te Shr uti and reason based on inturtion as  well as to the Bhaashyas ..  

Some misconceptions regarding this nature of Witness ing Principle life are still prevalent. For example, the  Witness (Sakshi) of the ego is separate in each individual 

COGNISING THE WITNESSING PRINCIPLE OF LIFE 33  

soul. And hence Jiva-Sakshi ( Gft~ajt ) are many: the  Witness for Ishvara, Le.. Ishvara-Sakshi (  ) is  one, i.e. Brahman. The Brahman is like Mahakasha  ( ~T;:.pr~ ) and the Witness which are many are like Ghat- 

~kashas ('EfeAiT:a), etc.. These types of misconceptions  ar·e there due to,not-knowing the true nature of the Wit ness according to the teachings of Bhashya and also due  to non-cognition of Anubhava and relying only on the  intellectual inference. So it is essential to know or to  cognise that the Witnessing Principle of life is the predo minant thing.  

According to Shaṅkara's teachings, we have to cognise  the nature of the Witness as it is. While explaining the  Pūrṇa Anubhava (Chapter --; 1), it is said that the whole  phenomenon of the universe including all multiplicity of  the souls and the world with -the concept of infinite time,  space, causation etc. is Upadhi (\3qT'f4) for Pratyagatman  ( SJ~RiI'T). The Bhashya-Va.kya has been referred ear lier which is said in Mandākya Mantra-3 Bhashya, thus,  '~q{lq SJ~q ~T 3l~qTT =i:fw:r ­ f~T~ I ~ :q ~m ~q~q$(,;r arājft: II'  

Here Shaṅkara says that the Witnessing Principle of life Is  the substratum of the universe_ and hence it is not an indi vidual one. For example, when we realize that the Witness  is ~eyond the ego' then it is evident that it is lranscenden 

tal reality of this multiplicity, because the multiplicity of  the universe appear$ only when there is the appearance of  the ego. So, in this process of discrimination we have to  take macrocosm with microcosm. If thi$ view is missed,  then our. thinking process will lead us to the doctrine of  Kapila Sankhya who has accepted the multiplicity of the  Selves. This thing has also been explained by Shaṅkara  in the Bha~hya portion quoted above. So it is wrong to  assume that there a~e many Witnesses.  

Holding the view that ther-e~ are many Witnesses is  itself an illogical statement.. The many entities to whom 

34 GUIDE·lINES TO SHANKARA-VEDANTA  

this multiplicity has appeared-that subject is the only  entity fit to be called as Witness, and those which have  appeared to this Witness become the witnessed because  they are objects. The Vedānta is a subjective science and  not an objective one. To accept the many entities inevitably  we have to accept the existence of the time-space factors.  These factors are only in the realm of the ego. When we  say that Witnessing Principle of life is beyond ego and it  is the Witness of the ego, then naturally it is beyond the  I  

concepts of time-space etc. It being so, how can there be  many Witnesses? For this reason the doctrine of one and  the same Witnessing Atman as the universal Self of all  beings has been proclaimed in the Shruti :  

-"One and the same shining one (Deva), is hidden in  all beings, the omnipresent, the inmost Self of all  beings, the overlord of all acts, presiding over all  beings, the Witnessing conciousness, one, and without  attributes.' ,  

We have explained this thing while explaining the  Sārvatrika Anubhava, the universal acceptance of the  of the Vedantic teaching. Hence the belief that there are  many Witnesses-one for each individual-is a wrong  notion and contrary to the Shruti and the reasons which are  based on intuitional experiences and to the Bhashya. The  multiplicity appears either in waking or in the dream and in  deep sleep there is no multiplicity. This presence and  absence of multiplicity is k'lown or objectified through  one's own Being which is the Witnessing Principle of Life.  It being so, how is it possible to say that 'that Principle  is many' 1 

COGNf--SING THE WITNESSING PRINCPLE OF LIFE 35  

Like this, holding the view that there is Ishvara Sakshi (~-~TajT) is also equally absurd. In Man dākva Mantra-6, the Self who remains in deep sleep and  in whom both the states merge and emerge from him, that  Self is described as Ishvara (qq ri~) and so also in  Brhadaranyaka-4/4/22, the same Atman who is the Wit nessing Principle of life is described as "({IS{ :, t{q  ~crq~: .... " etc. By this we can easily understand that the  Self itself is called as Ishvara. In Sutra Bhashya-2/3/41,  Shaṅkara identifies this Witness with Ishvara. He writes  thus:  

"atfel~rerT~t ~T~efi~UJ~'EJlQTFi~M;r: ~mlf atfeJ- fu~Trt1~lf ~cr: q~āTt=t atR;r;(: ~Teq~TfL ~arN- c-....  

~I:a I~ ~TfaJor: ~ffi'~: ~Tfl~ ~t!G'6{t{T ~+it?ft@f- ~8!0"E~ ~ffT~lf mm:: II"  

-In this sentence Shaṅkara has described that the  Supreme Self who presides over all activities ane resides  in all beings and who is the Witness of all is the- Supreme  Lord. So the Witness himself is the Ishvara. and here  all the description of the Sh\(etashvatara Mantra (6/11) is  taken. By this Shaṅkara emphatically says that the Wit 

nessing Principle itself is Ishvara which· means that the  Sakshi and Ishvara are synonymous terms.  

From the standpoint of reason also saying that there is  Sakshi for Ishvara is incongruous. Because, if there is a  Sakshi for Ishvara then this Is·hvara comes into the cate gory of the witnessed ( ~Ta:~). That which is the Sakshi  alone is fit to be called I shvara and not thel\Nitnessed ones,  because witnessed ones also are merely objects to the wit ness. Shaṅkara has explained this in Mandākya Mantra-6 :  

"~ ~ ~e(~q: : ~M~ ~ :  ~6T ; ;(ffi:1{lft \ifT~qrQ~4fffi~'Uf4er I" - c-...  

The significance of this sentence is that the true nature  of the Self of everyone is himself lshvara, but Ishvara is 

36 GUIDE LINES TO SHANKARA-VEOANTA  

not other than the Self as the logicians hold the view.  According to the logician Ishvara is separate from the indi vidual Selves.  

When we look from the standpoint of comprehensive  vision of life there can be only two parts-one is the Self  which is one's being and everything else will come into the  category of non-selves and this includes the "'Ego-sense"  or "'Me-notion".  

The not-self is of an adventitious and ephemeral nature  and hence it is a false appearance due to ignorance and  the Self is the only reality. If we hold the view that the  Ishvara is different from the Self, then he comes into the  category of not-self.. Then there will be no IShvaratva  ( ~!(CI(~er ) for him.  

Hence the Witnessing Principle of life itself is called  as Ishvara from the standpoint of ~ppearance and disappear ance of the universe, as the Self is the substratum of  the universe. For this reason Shaṅkara calls the Self as  TAT-( ~) pada in S. Bh-4/1/2- 

"~q  eei~t:rR~;n) ~q+lchl"-IIThis obiect  called Brahm3n, which is denoted by the word ·Thaf'  which is free from all mundane attributes and which is  by nature Consciousness, is well intuited (known) to  the people who are adepts in the Upanishads".  

In this description that which is of the nature of  consciousness, whose nature is called as I6Anubhava"  (See Upadeshasahasri-12/81 ) is called as "TAT" pada  

1 f4ij6{rag ~51TaT ~ (=~:;s~a- ~: I

COGNISING THE WITNESSIG PRINCIPLE OF LIFE 37  

meaning Ishvara. Hence the W_itnessing Principle itself  i,s Ishvara from the standpoint of the appearance and dis appearance of the universe which is conjured up by  Avidya. Hence it is wrong to hold the view that there is  (shvara Sakshi ( ~{-t=rraft ) which c,ontradicts the Shruti ..  reason and Bhashya.  

The nature of the Witnessing Principte-is non-duat one,  meaning ever devoid of all types that exist in dualistic  world. Hence it is described as PrapanchOpashama  ( Sfq+r ) in Shruti (Man-7). But for the purpose of  teaching, the witnesshood is attributed on the nonoodual  Self from the standpoint of liMe-notion"'. Strictly speak ing, there are no two entities such as Sākṣhi, the  Witness and Ahampratyaya, the Pramatr. Through the  

adjuncts like Antahkarana, body etc. which are conjured  up by ignorance, the same Witnessing Principle appears  as if he has taken the garb of °Pramatr or Ahampratyayau•  

When these adjuncts are falsified through discrimination, 

~  

the non-duat nature of the Self alone remains. At this  stage of Self-realization of the Pramatr or Ahampratyaya  himsetf remains as the Witness. This is said in the 2nd  S(6ka of '''Bhrahmavid Gatha" (=traditional saying) quoted  by ShaIikara at the end of S. Bh-1/1 /4 :  

"!fT f4~str;rTfl srFfi_!1ifT<l~+r I c+r;:r: I

-6JBefore the realization of Atman to be sought out,  the Atman is a Pramatr (= knowing agent). When the  search has been finished ... the Pramatr himself would  become the one Supreme Witnessing Self free from  all evils of good and bad and the like."  

·SOp the witnesshood is attributed for the purpose of  teaching the non-dual Self from tne standpoint of ego  just like the Ishvarahood is attributed on the same Witness  from the standpoint of the universe. 

38 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA-VEOANTA  

v. WITNESS tS SELF-ESTABLSHED REALITY::  

According to Nyaya-Shastra, the nature of the Self  sho·uld be determind through Pramanas, but in Vedānta  the Pramatr (= Ego sense) who is the user of p'ramanas  like mind, intellect, sense organs etc, is himself a Self 

established entity i.n all dealing~. So Pramatr is not  proved through Pramanas where as the existence of  Pramanas and correctness is to be proved by the Pramatr ..  To know the Prameyas (.~) or the obiects, Pramanas  are required, but not for determining the nature of the Self"  even as a Pramatr. Shri Shaṅkara says in S. Bh-2J3/7 .  

";; fYT~;rr arr~+r;:r: !1mOT+rq~q- m:atRr I ~ ~ ~­ ;{t~ Sl~ I onf~ atsrf~{Sl~ ~ f*i,«~ \3tiTrfF;r...a- ll"  

-""Atman Himself is not established with the aid  of any right means ; for His sake the perceptive means  etc. are utilised in order to ascertain the obiects  which are not koown. H  

In Gita Bhashya-2/18 :  

C,ft:r~ ffl: armr~ !l+lTcrft ~t+r~): ~fJ(T;:4qoll ~ I  ~ ~ ~+[ ~fl:rffi arr~;f!lm~  Sl~qft~l~  sp..f~' ~ -m: at I ("if I ;n;r fu"ID ~f6 I t~'  

~IOn'y when the Self stands predetermined as the  knower, there is a search for a means of knowledge  by the knower. Indeed,. it is not that one first deter ...  mines oneself as ~I am such" or 'I am not such"  through the instruments of knowledge and then takes  

up the task of determining an object of knowledge.  For what is catted as 'Self" does not ~remain unknown  to any one. u  

tn this connection one thing that should be remem bered is that in most of the editions the reading is  "3lRiJr;:f atSf+{f(:{". which is wrong-one. The correct readingCOGNISING THE WITNESSING PRINCIPLE OF ltFE 39  

is "arr~r.i sr~". TM meaning flere is IIno one wants tp r  

determine one-s~lf t whether 'I am' or "not' etcr throug~  Pramanas before goi ng to know the outer objects._ So it  is ATMANAN PRAMAY A (this is the correct reading).  

1n the empirical view when the Pramatr himself is  Self-established there is no necessity to say that the nature  of the Self, who is the Witness of the Pramatr should  ba known by Pramanas. For this reason Shanka~a has  said here in chronotogicat order the words SIDDHE HI  ATMANI ( fu":i ~ aTmrf..r -this denotes the true nature  of the Self who is the Witness) PRAMATARI (smTaR  -this denotes that the same true nature appears as if he  has taken the garb of Pramatr or Ego through the adjuncts  I'ike mind, i nteltect, sense organs etc .. ).. By this it is proved  that the true nature of the Self being a Witness comes  first and then the same Self appears as Pramatr (as per  chronology). So the Witness is the Self-established one  who is of the nature of pure consciousness ( ~RI¥fi )  as already said as per S.Bh-4/1/2 and no Pramanas (in 

truments of knowledge) are necessary to prove It. Hence  there is no necessory to take view points of Nyaya Shastra  and Tarka Shastra which rely on Pramanas to prove any-- I  thing, in Vedānta. The Self is Aprameya (atSriflJ ).  

(i) Brha-414/20: "ttdr.tsr~ ~ q+f" II .... ~ ....  

(ā) Gita-2/18: "ar.=rl fiu;<tl at II"  

It is true that in Vedānta also it is accepted that  the Shastra is the Pramana to know the Self and the  Upapatti ( \gqq-Rf), i.e. Tarka is necessary to perform  Manana. Though this is the thing, Shastra is Pramana  here only to negate the not-self and to rescue the aspirant  from the wrong identification with not-selves. But Shastra  never tells that Brahman is an obiectifiable one.. On  the other hand, it declares that the Brahman is not obiecti fiable by any means, i.e. It can neither be perceived. by  

means of the senses nor can It be conceived by means of 

40 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA~VEDANTA  

the mind or intellect. It is your Self and remains'as the  Eternal Witness. Hence from standpoint of removing the  wrong notion regarding Brahman onJy 'he Shastra is called  as Pramana. Further it may be noted that after foltowing  teaching of Shastra the deatings like Pranlana, Prameya,.  Pamatr ~tc .. cease to exist.  

Thus the view-point of Vedānta th~t the Shastra is  the means to know the Selt is only to negate the not-self  alone, but not to objectify the Self. The reader is referred  ,to the following Bhashya quotations regarding this:  

-OBut the Scripture is the final authority (Pramana)  by way of merely negating superimposition of quaJi ties that ~o not b(~long to the Self, it attains  authorita~ive(less with regard to the Selfl but not by  

virtue of making some unknown thing known .. ""  (Gi-Bh-2/18)  

(ā) "Opponent: If Brahman be not an obiect of know ledge, It cannot logically be presented by the  scriptures as stated in B~ 5-1 /1/3.  

Vedantin: Not so, for the scriptures aim at the remo val of the differences fancied through ignorance. Not  that the scriptures seek to establish Brahman as  an entity referable objectively by the word Ithis"'  (Le. Bra~man is not presentable positively b-y  saying, ItThis is so"~.)  

What do they do then ?  

By presenting Brahman as not an obiect on account  of It's being the inmost Self of the knower, they  remove the differences of the 'known' I the 'knower' p  and the Jknowledge' that are fancied through ignor 

ance ( arfeJ{(l€6M6 ~fl""~t;~+lq,,,,~f6)·  (S. Bh-1/1/4)  

So, here Shastra is pramana from the point of superim position, which is quite unlike the other pramanas. So

also lakshana ( (!3a:J01 ) of the Self or Brahman is described  in "~r+rnt~ ~:" (B.5-1 /112) and "~l( ~1;:( "SF{~ ffm"  (Taittiriya-2j1) etc, are also called as Lakshanas from this  standpoint alone, because the nature of the Self is Alak 

shanam ( at~ -Man-7. "611l~TSf~ ~ :q"-Katha 2/3/8 etc.) The dialectic systam which is used in Manana  ( +r.=r;:r ) is the Shrauta Tarka ( ~Tcr~) itself, which is  relying on the intuitional- experiences but not the- gym 

nastics of the intellect. So this dialectic system also has  taken its shelter in Anubhava, i.e. intuitional experience,  Shri Shaṅkara has clearly stated the nature of such  Shrauta Tarka in S. Bh-2/1/6.  

VI. SOME IMPORTANT SENTENCES REGARDING.  THE NATURE OF WITNESSING CONCIOUSNESS :  

The following sentences are very useful to take a  stand in one's own true nature of the Witnessing Principle  of life through Viveka. This process is called Anusandhana  ( atR+fTf!e-~T;:r). A few sentences are shown here as  examples.  

'i) a) "ij'~ 3{ferqft.T······~2-~T ~fu II"  

(Brha-Bh-1/4/1 )  

---The seer has two kinds of vision, one "eternal and  the oth9r transitory. Through that unfailing eternal  vision, the Self always sees the ()ther transitory vision  in the dream and waking states, as idea and perception  respectively and becomes the seer of sight.  

b) "~s:r~ \jfT~ftEl'r;:cf ~T ~;:rT~q!{£tf€r I  

+r~T~ fi{~· atT«fT;{ +ReIT mit if ~:qfu II"  

(Ka-2/1/4)  

-"The wise one having ascertained that great and  all pervading Atman through whom one sees the con tents of both dream and waking, does not grieve." 

42 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA-VEDANTA  

In these two sentences one's own nature which is the  Witnessing Principle of life which illur:nines the appea rance and disappearance of the waking and dream states,  is shown.  

ā) "~efsr~:ol···· ··lT ~;:r: II" ...... (Kena-2/4)  I'The Self, that encompasses a1l ideas (acquired  through the intell'et'lt) as Its objects, is .. kno\(Vn in  reJation to all these ideas. Being the Witness of all  cognitions and by nature nothing but the power of  consciousness, the Self is indicated by the cognitions  themselves in the midst of cognition, as non-different  frOin them. There is no other door ·to Its awareness,  Therefore when Brahman is known as the innermost  

Self (i.e. Wit'f19SS) of cognitions, then It is known, that  is to say, then there is It's complete realisation."  

H ~re there are three points are to be observed. The  nature of Self is the Witness for all Vrttis including the  HMe-n:>tion". (b) Vrttis are many but the illumining Self is only one (c) The Vrttis including the  UMe-notion" are pervaded by the nature of consciousness  of life. So these Vrttis are like the waves in the ocean  of consciousness. Ooserving this, when the pervasiveness.  of the consciouness is discerned in the Vrttis, then that  nature of conciousness is Pratyaya Pratyagatma (s:Rlfl{- s:rRm). The same thing is shown in the following  Gita-B hashya a Iso.  

āi) "r€fi4~Nfflf.:r~T· .... ·ater~rcr ater~T~er II"  (Gi. Bh-9/1 0)  

_II All the activities of the world in the form, II eat  this; I see; I hear this; I experience this hapf)iness  I suffer this sorrow; I shall do this for that purpose;  I shall do this for this purpose; I shall know this  etc.' indeed arise owing to their being the obiects of  consciousness, They verily exist in consciousness  and culminate in consciousness .... 

COGNISING THE WITNESSING PRINCIPLE OF LIFE 43  

The significance of this sentence is that the word  Avagat i (31'e{1Tf€r) denotes the true nature of the  Self and. all types of Vrttis or-notions or ideas appear in  this nature of pure Consciousness and merge in the Cons 

ciousness alone, just like waves in an ocean.  

iv) "q:ef )R~flt at:aT~sr:qn:~rf8JfUI srcll~ll~ilM . ..... (' . ('~  ~ ij" ;q sr(=~qR:Jir;r eq«Tf~ ij'~lfay ~:- ~UTrfF{~ !Jfu It" (Adhyasa Bbashya.)  

-"'In the same way, one first superimposes the idea  of ego, i.e. "Me-notion", on the Self, the W~tness of  all the manifestations of that ego; theR by an  opposite process, one superimposes on the internal  organ (Antahkarana etc.) that Self which is opposed to  the not-self and which is witness of everything.' I  

Here Shaṅkara has used the direct word Sakshi  ( ~aft ), the Witness and has shown that it is different  from Aham .. Pratyaya (art!:Rlflf ). This sentence resembles  

"~ ~ q('&fRr~ Q~T Get+t: t=n=r:,  ~:, f.:r(=~: ~lS(: fe{~qrrug ~'E1+1~ err f4lTa:  rilc+'l1 II" (5. Bh.-1/1/4)  

which has been described as the bed-rock of Shaṅkara's  Bhashlas because this is the basic principle on which  the whole of Shaṅkara's teaching is based.- This has al 

ready been stated and interpreted at the beginning of this·  chapter.  

v) Gi Bh-13/22  

"~)=ffir 1 ...... +iT=arr armrr  II" "~;rrc+rr  it~£{T;:rt······ fef an ciOr Fe' «rr"  

The significances of these two sentences are as follows:  (a) The nature of the- Witness is the nature of pure cons ciousness. The Pratyayas or the notio,ns such as  pleasure, pain, delusion etc. which pertain to Antahkarana,  are illumined by this Sakshi and pe,rvaded by that Sakshi. 

CHAPTER-3  

THE UNtClUE'METHODOLOGY OF VEDANTA:  ADHYAROPA & APAVADA  

1.. Why t\lis methodology of Adhy~ropa and Apa vada alone is employed exclusively in Vedānta:,  

The traditional teaching of Vedānta has got  the above said only methodology to teach Brahman, the  the ultimate Reality.. The Brahman is the very Self (i e.  Swarāpa) of the aspirant. So it is not an understand 

able, or objectifiable or realisable thing to be gained  newly by efforts. In this strict sense knowing the  Brahman, realising the Brahman etc. are impossible be cause it is not a separate thing from the very Self of the  seeker. Hence, here no effort is required to know the  Brahman, but the effort is required only to cease or to  remove the false identifications with the not-seJves ..  This is clearly said by Shaṅkara in Gita Bhashya 18/50, thus:  

-"Therefore, we have only to eliminate what is falsely  ascribed to Brahman by Avidya ; we have to make no  more effort to acquire a knowledge of Brahman as He is  quite Self-evident. . ... Hence, effort is not needed for  knowledge .. but only for the removal of the thinking  what is not the Self as the Self."  

In these two sentence Shaṅkara clearly says that there  is no need to stress for knowing the Atman or Brahman  because the Atman himself appears in the form of the  universe due to ignorance. So, one should negate or dis 

card the appearance of the universe, that is to say, one has  to cease to have the wrong identification with the not selves-from ego to body and the corresponding world  that are superimposed on Atman through ignorance. 

AOHVAROPA AND APAVADA 41  

To illustrate by an example:  

When the elephant, king, chariot and so on made of  Sugar are shown to the children, they see the various  forms and they insist on having a particular form. But  here the truth is that only sugar appears in all these  forms. To the buyer and the seller there are really no  forms, i.e. no interest in the form but only in the s~gar  

because they discard the appearance of the f-orms and  cognise that the sugar is the reality. To teach this reality  of sugar to the child the only way is to discard the appear ance of the form and no necessity of tetling or command ing the child that he has to understand that this is sugar ..  If he negates the forms naturally the sugar alone remains  

there. Similarly, in the case of teaching the nature of  Brahman also it is taught only to negate or rescind the  false appearances superimposed on It due to ignorance ..  for Brahman is devoid of all specific features .and as such.,  can never be described in positive- terms. The scripture  

and the teacher only tell the student what Atman is not.  They follow the methodology of Superimposition and  Rescission for pointi'1g out the Reality.  

_So, the method used here is deliberate Superimposition ( 31i~rocr ) and subsequent Rescissidh ( aTqe{T~ )a  II. NATURE OF METHODOLOGY:  

Reference to the method by some ancient Vedantins in  Shatikara Bhāshyas.  

Before negating the false appearance the Snastra and  the Guru accept the existence of the superimposed things  tentatively as if, they are really related to the truth though  they are, in fact, false appearances. After teaching gra 

dually, the truth is pointed out and the aspirant himself  remains as the final truth of Brahman Itself and automati cally he realises the falsehood of the attributed things  which was taught previously. This is said clearly by  Shatikara in Gi-Bh-13113 and introduction, to 13/14 : 

48 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA-VEOANTA  

Here B hagavad Gita states that, II-A tman is neither  called "being' nor #non .. being' ( ;m ;:r ~ ~ ~ amCl t5~:q~ )  This statement makes the seeker think tJ).at Atman, either  is non ... existenoe (~1.:f) or is insentient (G{~). In order to  dispel this misconception, Atman is !jaid to pervade all  living beings and function through their hands, feet etc, by  asSumiflg these as qualities of the knowable Atman, just  to convince the seeker of Its existence. Because of the  superimposition of the organs like hands, feet etc which  are adiuncts, lest there be the misconception that the  Atman has sensory and other organs and that It reallv  has such activity as moving etc. the Gita at the very next  stage resoinds this misconception by saVing that Atman is  devoid of all limiting adjuncts" and It is Nirguna (f;:r~(:OJ)  (in Gi ta-13/14). Here Shaṅkara declares that, IIthis is  the traditional method of vedanta-those who have known  

the tradition say that the Self who is ever devoid of all  kinds of attributes or mundane qualit-ies is taught through  the method of superimposition and rescission:·! An  itlustration is given below:  

The teacher teaching geography. at first tells the pu·pils  that the sun rises in the east in the morning, comes up  above our head at noon and sets in the west in the  evening, and so the sun has got rising and setting capabi 

lities. And from December to June the sun goes from  south to north and from June to December, the sun goes  southwards, and sometimes the eclipses take place on the  sun etc. The pupils nod and understand as such. After  that the teacher says the truth that (in higher classes of  course) the sun has really no such transition. Due to the  movement of the earth" all these dealings are attributed 00  the SUn. And when the moon comes between the earth  and the sunl thfin we say that there is solar eclipse, but  strictly speaking the sun has no such eclipsing effect.  

Here, in this iUustration, accepting the attributes su'Ch  3. Q~ ff{ @!;[~lIN~T· e{4;J;='+i 'are~lqTqqT~T+~· f;{~q~ • .....  !1q~.Rt 1" Gi Bh .. ,3/13 

ADHYAROPA AND APAVADA 49  

as sun rises and sun sets etc, is called Adhyāropa, superim position, deliber3te supe!impositions. To show the real  nature of the su n the teacher should negate all types of  dealings which had been attributed on the sun previously  for the purpose of teaching. When the children understand  the negation of the dealings by taking the standpoint of  the position of the sun instead of taking the standpoint  of the position of earth, automatically they will give up  the wrong notions regarding the sun even when the  dealings such as rising, setting etc, appear to be there in  daily life. Mr. Gaelileo who discovered that the earth  is moving, he himself was talking in terms of morning and  evening even though there cannot be such dealings with  regard to the sun. The same is the case with the Brahman.  

In his Brhadaranyaka Bhashya (-4/4/25) also Shaṅkara  has set forth the nature of this method, thus:  

°It is to bring home this purport (viz, He who  knows It, the Self as such as the fearless Brahman.  certainly becomes the fearless Brahman) that the  ideas of projection, maintenance, dissolution etc, as  well as those of actions and its factors and results are  superimposed on the Self, Again, by their negation  -by the elimination of the superimposed attributes  through a process of ""N at this, not this' the truth has  been known."  

(for further references to this method in Shaṅkara's  work see section vā of this chapter).  

With a view to turning the attention of the enquirer  towards the Brahman, the ultimate Reality, the  Scriptural texts use the m3thod of superimposition. Due  to misconception regarding the Reality, one by  nature, attributes certain features on the Reality which, in  fact, are non-existent To re:n:lve this innate misconcep 

tion the scriptural texts deliberately attributes certain  other superior features which are in due course rescinded.  At this stage, the Transcendental Reality alone subsists and 

50 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA-VEDANTA  

this is called as th9 cognition of the Reality in Vedānta.  at that tim3 the seeker himself takes a stand in his own  intuitional exp~rience of his true nature. This is the  nature of this methodology.  

G 3udapada, the grand-preceptor of ShaIikara, also has  resorted to this device of superimposition (T'{Tq ) from  th3 empirical standpoint as a means and its final nega tion (atllf.:{) when tha intuition of the Absolute unborn,  non -duality is achieved :  

_" As th3 Shruti passage, IThis is the final instruction.  It is not this, not this', on account of the incomprehen sibility of Atm3n, n3gates all dualistic ideas superimposed  upon Atman (as the means for the attainment of Atman),  Therefore the birthless, non-dual Atman alone exists and  not the duality/' (G. K-3/26)  

III The Meaning of the word Rescission:  

ShaIikara has clearly stated the meaning of the word  Apavada or rescission in S, Bh-3/3/9.  

66APAVADA NAMA .. YATHARTHA BUDHYA NIVARTATE"  

The meaning of this sentence is II Apavada or rescission  occurs when a subsequent true idea of an object, happens  to sublate the earli€lr unreal idea regarding it. Fot instance,  th9 idea of selfhood persisting with regard to the assemb 

lage of the body and the senses is removed by the subse quent idea being born out of the teaching, 6'That thou art".  The word Apavada in Sanskrit commonly has got the mea 

ning allegation. But here it is used in the sense  APAVADA meaning denying or ablation or abrogation or  negation or discarding etc. what is said before. This word  is used here in this sense only.  

When the not-selves have been negated through the  teaching which is based on the firm ground of one's own  intuitional experience the seeker realises the falsehood ofADHYAROPA AND APAVADA 51  

the not-selves and he remains himself as the Self ~ So the  realisation of the Self is not stressed but the realisation of  the falsehood of the not-selves is the main thrust. Hence,  I/deliberate superimposition and subsequent negation" is  "the only method that is possible and adopted in the  Upanishads.  

IV. Kalpita Samvruti alone should be taken in  this methodology, but not the Loka-samvruti :  

In this method only we have to go with the deliberate  attributions made by the Shastra for the purpose of  teaching the Brahman, that i-s to. say that the Kalpita  Sam'/rti. 1 (=deliberate ascription) alone should be taken  here, but not the Loka-Samvrti 2 or Paratantra Samvrti,  i. e. the ordinary human procedure due to Avidya or  Adhyasa, because the former (Cfi~qcrt1·~ftr) is purely a  a conventional device employed by the Shastra or the  preceptor only for enlightening the intellect of the seeker  so that he can realize the Truth. This is said by  Shaṅkara:  

"The empirical knowledge in respect of scriptures,  teacher and taught is illusory and imagined only as a  means to the realization of the ultimate Reality."  (G,K Bh-4j73)  

Except thi~ method there is no other way to teach the  Brahman as it is not an obiect. I t being so the enlightened  people also at first accept the attributions and after  denoting the truth the attributions automatically get  falsified, So the negation of the attributions is the only  way to teach the Brahman.  

1. Kalpita-Samllrti means the procedure adopted by  the Shastra or the preceptor as a device for teaching the  means of knowning the truth (G K. Bh-4j73)  

2. Lāka-Samvrti means I Vyavahāral, the experiences  of the empirical world which are caused by metaphysical  ignorance (G. K. Bh-4/57). 

52 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA-VEDANTA  

But when the Brahman is taught to be meditated with  some names and forms, then the positive attributions are  predominent. But when we have to know the nature of  the Brahman as it is, then the only method used is  superimposition and rescission (negation). It is a general  rule that to get the Jnana or realisation of Brahman and to  meditate (Le. to do the Upasana of Brahman for fruits to be  enioyed in this life or for joys to be experienced in the  other world)-in both cases attributions are to be taken,  but there is a great difference between these two. I n the  process of realisation of Brahman througn Viveka (discri  mination) the aspirant should give up the Upadhis  (attributions) and take his stand in Brahman (Le. the  

attributes are ultimately rejected in the case of knowable  Brahman). While in the case of Upasana or meditations  of the Brahman that are prescribed in the Shastras, the  Upasaka has to keep the Upadhis and with the Upadhis only  (Le. without rejecting the attributes) he has to meditate. 1  

The meditations that are prescribed for realisation is based  on deliberate attribution of names and forms. and at the  same places Brahman is described as the cause of the  universe and this also comes under the category of the  above said methodology, This is clearly shown by the  Swamiji of Holenarsipur in his Kannada book IShaṅkara  Vedānta Sara' and also...in his Sanskrit books, ISuddha  Shaṅkara Prakriya Bhaskara .and IVedānta Prakriya  Pratyabhijna'. The gist of the same is furnished in the next  section.  

V TEACHING OF BRAHMAN BY MEANS SUPERIM POSlilON IS ONLY FOR NEGATING WHAT IT IS  NOT CORRECTLY :  

The general line of this methodology adopted in Vedantic  writing and its significance are clearly shown by .Shri  Satchidanandendra Saraswati Swamiji in his books

ADHYARO?A AND APAVADA 53  

mentioned above, In these books he has set forth some  different varieties of superimposition indicating that some  particular superimpositions are intended to negate some  other part,cular features. For examples~  

1) By superimposing lattainabi/ityv (srrc!Jce:r) on Brah mans "~-fetr.{TmfQ q~ "-The knower of Brahman attains  lhe Highest-Tat -~/1 (~Ithougfl 4t is etefnally' attained  because of Its aU pervading and also because of its being  the very Self of everyone), the Shruti negates that  it is attainable by any means other than knowledge.  

2) By attributlAg knowability (~) on Brahman, the  Shrutt negates the knowability of objects other than the  Brahman For example in the teKt. t! . f.:rclf-wrT~+I- .....  ~ ,., -Shve-1/12 ........  

3) Through the attribution of the -knowership'fl (~TQ.cer)  on the Self, the previous attribution (1. e.. Knowabillty) is  is removed, as in the text; IIQ.:~ ~ ~t;;;2'T,.. ... ·· .. · fSl'TID, ~T,

4) By attributing the 4A"tm:anhoodl (atR+rce:r), the kno'wer ship is removed, For examp1e in the text, "arrC+f ..... ~4i!i)ql(.· .. fjQ"  -The SeCf alone is ~o be meditated upon-Brha-1/4/7.  

5) By attributing the "Witnesshood (~Tf~er) of the  ego, the Selfhood is removed, i.e. the individuality is remo ved, as in the text, ~Taft ~crT ~ f;:r7f~Uf~:q"- The Wit- ...!)

6) By certain other texts the very essential nature of  Atman is pointed out as in the text '~ rtfSl: ~fcr ~fu  arr~T'-He is net; net;, not such not such-Brha -3/9/26,  in order to negate all specific attributes including  

Witnesshood of the ego. The unborn Atman shines forth  of Its own accord.

7) Again, by attributing tnat the Self is Brahman, i. Ie ..  attributing IBrahmanhood' (~e.r) on the individual S' If,.  the finiteness (qfl:~ or awqce{) is removed. For  example in the text, '~+n~+rT ~'fR Ta~'-Brha 2/5/19, Mandākya-2.  

8} By attributing the I> Selfhood" on Brahman. the in directness (W~) of the Self is removed. For exampte  ~n the text '~. F1&tTR~'-Brha-1 /4/10; '~cr", :aT~­ WaJTt\' j:f~ ~ atTc+n" ~('rrCf{:-The Brahman that is imme- .....  

d;ate and direct-the Self that is within an-Brha-3/4J1.  9) By attributing that 'he Brahman is knowable only  through the Vedāntic sentences or teachings (crTCfl[~ce{)~  the Shruti has removed the idea that the Selt can be  known through Pramanas such as pefception (!:{c(;far),  inference (~+fT") etc.. ,For example in the text, "~( ~enq Rf5lr:::· ~. 'lTf+r'''-1 ask you of that Being who is '0 he  known only from the Upanishads-Brha-3J9j26.  

10) The attribution of '+i-=rr~er" L e~ Brahman is  ascErtainable by the mind, &S sometimes taught -to indicate  that it is not known through Sensuous knowledge ..  For example in the text, '+['1t:oi'~erlt!~lSG6lf+t '-Through the ......  

mind alone It is to be reansed-Brha-4J4/19.  

11) Again, by asserting that the na1ure of the Self is  beyond the sphere of speech and thought the very idea  of the Brahman as an obiect (Vishayat\la-fe;r~'ef) is  removed. As for instance in the case of texts like this:  

'(;fm tlT:qt f;:rer a{!;Il~ +i"'~::C1 ~'-Failing to reach that  Brahman, words turn back along with the mind-Tai-2[9.  12) By attr,buting that the Brahman ;s the cause of the  universe (Jagatkāranatva- ~lRf qm:ORe.r) the idea that the ......  Brahman is the product (Kāryatva- epT~,:{ce.r ot any thing is  negated, as in the text: "~T~ 'efT T~T~+r;;: ......  3fTC6r.«: (:(~Q:" -From that Brahman, which is the Self,  was produced space-Tai-2j1 D 

ADHYAROPA AND APAVADA. 55  

13, After that, by asserting that the 'elf'ect, i..e ..  the appearance of the world is only a Vikalpa (tyq'),  t e. conc'octed by ignorance, the causehood of Braman is  also negated by the Shrutis saving '''31~RT \3lT~ ~ffi  ~fcr"-Now therefore the description of Brahman: Not

1 4) By attributing the "gene:ralhood' {Samanyatva- (IT+rr;:lf(e{) on Brahman, the particulars (Visl"'teshaha) are  negated.. For examples in the texts, '''T (';:lf+rT;:r

15) AsserttAg that the Self is of untainted nature  ('Asangatvar-at~(er), the previous genera/hood is remo ved. As for instance in the text like: '!aruwr . 3:"­ The Self is untainted by these two states (waking and  dream)-Brha-4/3115.  

16) By attributing the ~mundanehoocr (~-~TR(ef) on the  Setf, the insentient naturi ((ef) of the Setf is negated ..  For examp1e 1n the texts, "31Tffi~:g ~TilTlf ~. fW.r. ~fcr"  But for one's own sake that it is loved-Brha-2(4q5.  

17) By attributing the nature of the Self as being the  subject of meditation (I' upāsyatva'- ~qml(er) the  previous nature i. e. mundanehood is negated. For example,  

"Q:CfCf ....... e{~ ~lf~n:r q{. ~rq{. ~ ~m lf~r~·~TT~"­ o SatyaKama, this very Brahma:1, that is known as the I  inferior and superior, is but this AU M which is to be  meditated.-(Prashna-5/2). 

56 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKAAA-VEDANTA  

18) By attributing the #Witnesshood of the three states~  (ftlGf-BT~) on the SeU, the Shruti removes the  wrong idea that the Self is circumscribed bV the body,"  

1:. &. Parichinnatva-Bhrānti ( qft;:;r~-m~) is resc;- nded. As for ;nstance in the text like this:  

"~s:rr;:cr· QT;:ij". :qmr ~T~}w.:rm f  

+re:.T~cf "M~T~+rr~( iR"':rr qt~r ;:r:ffi~ 11"  

nThe wise one having ascertained that Great and an p~r vadiog Atman through whom one sees the contents of both  dream and waking, does not grieve.'" [Ka-2/1 J41  

19) By attributing that the SeU is the fourth, i. e.  Tuāyatva' (g~T~), the Witnesshood of the three states  is also negated. For example ,n the text:  

" ·,f;;rl· • ;:rT;:a-:  Wi e.r 'Q..'5S1~ •• rWi !1 "·+J!4('q4\l41~  :qg~" +rra- (=f arr~+rr l"-Turiya is not that which tS cons cious of the internal subjective world {here it is ind,cated  that it is not Tai}asa , not that which is conscious oi the  external objective world (here H is den&ed that Turiya is  Vaishvanara), not of coosc,?nsness amassed throughout  (here it is denied that it ;s a condhion of deep sleep)~  having the noti.on of the Selt only as a means of knowing  Him. This is what is known as the Fourth rruriya).'" Ma-1  

20) By attribut,ng the ~aspj,an'thood' ((=[1~e:() on lhe  Self the Shastra negates the wrong notion that the Atman  is Nilyasamsārl (Z:(~T~T) meaning Atman is ever  suffering from the mundane qualities. For example in the  

text, "ij(=i'I l~e(W~I~ f{r...c£ ~Q~: «+rT~cfr ~erl  3lT('",,;:i(.:.tRm;;· fcr, ~+rr~;rr;t. ~fu I"-"Therefore he  who Knows it as such becomes calm, self-controlledI'  withdrawn into himself,. enduring and concentrated and  sees the self in his own Se't (body); he sees all as the  Self" Brha-4/4j23  

21) By asserting that the~ nature of the Self is ever  devoid 0; all types of mundane qualities (fti'e.r  ariqT~lq), the Shastra negates the S5dhakahood 

ADHYAROPA AND APAVADA 67  

āttributed previously. As for instance in text like  "ij'q~14:a+j ~lli1=(f· ftre.rae+r" (Ma-7)-"By descri- ......  bin"g Turiya as "negation of all phenomena\ the attributes  which characterise the three states, viz. waking etc, are  negated. Hence it is ever Peaceful, alt Bliss and it is non du-al, i. e. devoid of illusory ideas of distinction of Sadhya,  Sadhaka and Sadhana.  

In short, the very' soul of this methodology consists' in  superimposing some particular attribute or character, as  pertaining to Brahman with a view to negate or discard  another gross misconception concerning Brahman -and tf1en  ~brogating the previous superimposed character by yet  another superior superimposition, ultimately leading to the  realization of the true nature of the Self by abolishing all  attributions.  

VI. Different ways of the usage of the Attributions:  

Shri Satchidanandendra Saraswati Swamiji has shown  another type of usage of the attribution in his Kannada  book, ""Shaṅkara Vedānta Sara" as well as in his  Sanskrit book '''Suddha Sankara Prakriya Bhaskara."  

In the above portion it is shown that to r~emove a parti cular misunderstanding the Shastra has used a particular  attribution on the Self, but here it is shown that we i may  use a particular attribution 1:0 remove various misunder standings. Vedantins have used in this way the attribution  already_ To illustrate by an example:  

""The Atman is the only reality to be known"-this  attribution of 'knowabilityl on Atman commonly denotes  that other than the Atman nothing else deserves to be  called as- knowable. Besides this we can determine  the following points on this single attribution of knowa 

bility on Brahman.  

i) The cause for the false appearance of the not-selft  (i. e. duality) is the ignorance alone regarding the real  nature of the Self. 

GUIDE LINES TO SHANKARA-VEOANTA  

ā) If one knows the real nature of the Self it automati cally follows that he has known all the not-selves .(i. e. one  becomes omniscient by the knowledge of Brahman),. This  is clearly stated in Mundaka-1/1/3,-'IWhich having been  known all this becomes known.H  

āi) If one cognises the real nature of the Self, for him  the ignorance gets destroyed or falsified completely.  iv) If one cognises the nature of the Self, after that  there would not remain the distinctions such as the  knower, the means of knowledge and the knowable etc.  So, here by one attribution we have shown the five  points (including the first) of negations of misunder standings.  

Similarly it is taught that Brahman is beyond both mind  and speech not only to negate the Vishayatva (fe.rq;q('€{)  of It, but also to reveal that Atman is known exclusively  through intuition distinct from both mind and speech as  may be seen from the texts like,  

i) ";:mifT;:r ij~ft~crT:"-Those who have quite  correctly ascertained the truth by means of intuition  arising from Vedānta. (Mundaka-3/2/6)  

ā) l'a{~. ~mfcr o~r.:rTfl ;r fe.ritfu" ;:r"-One who  has intuited that Bliss of Brahman, is not afraid of  anything. (Tai .. 2/9,  

āi) "ffif, & Fr~-That Reality of the Self, he  (Shvetaketu) intuited from Uddalaka. (Ch-6/16/3)  iv) "« feIT~lfudQq:'-One should know Him  (Atman) through one's own Intuition (Ch-817j1)  

v) "SiT~TSe:r g~I""Tq ~'¥;"-Ka-1/2/9-lt is easily  intuited my dearest boy,w hen taught by a traditional  Vedantin.  

Again, attainability" is imputed to Brahman not  merely to negate that it is attainable by some means other  than knowledge, but also it implies that Brahman should  not be regarded as something to be reached after travelling 

ADHYAROPA AND APAVADA 59  

towards it as is the case with regard to Lower Brahman  (Hiranyagarbha) whose attainability is taught in Shrutis  like "He attains Swarajyam'" (Tai-1/6.)  

Similarly Brahman alone is taken as a cause of the world,  not only to negate its Karyatva (~er). but also to dis card the idea that Paramanu (1:I1:+rr!?}), Pradhana (srqr;r)  or Jeeva (mer) or Mayaskakti (;rrlfPriRtl) or MayaviShishta  Brahman or Maya-pratibimba Brahman etc. is the cause of  the world.  

Hence it is proved that the methods which are used in  Vedānta to teach the true nature of Brahman such as (i)  Avasthatraya Viveka ā) Karya-Karana Prakriya,  āi) Samanya-Vishesha (the .universal & the particular)  Prakriya, iv) Pancha-Kosha Viveka, v) Anvay-Vyatireka  Prakriya, vi) Drg-Drshya Viveka etc, are only parts of  'Adhyaropa Apavada' which is the only methodology of  Vedānta. 1  

If this secret is known, then one will get rid up of the  idea that there is anything else apart from the Self. Be cause, due to natural ignorance one has misunderstood  the non-dual Self as not-self, i.e, as the world, individuahty  etc. Striotly speaking there is no world or individuality.  And the ordainershi'p (Ishvaratva) of Brahman which is  attributed from standpoint of these two is also a kind of  Adhyaropa. If one does not get to know the secret of  this methodology he will mistake that 'as there is the  Self, so also the not-self is also there". To remove this  wrong idea the methodology of teaching the Brahman  can be only through "Not thjs not this." This is the  only method used for the purpose of teaching Brahman.  

1 i) In Avasthatraya-viveka, the existence of the three  states are temporarily accepted belonging to the Self  (this is Adhyāropa of :31erlJe.t~et).  

ā) In Karya .. Kārana Prakriyā, Brahman is taken to be  the cause of the world (this is Adhyaropa of ijf"If!.9i"ROfijef). 

60 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA-VEDANTA  

This Adhyaropa-Apavada Nyaya can also be utilised in  another way as shown by Swamiji in his books, IIEssays  on Vedānta" That is the use of words expressing objects  10 indicate the Absolute by negating opposite ~ignificance.  For instance in the sentences: ~cr ~ 1'-'+I;::r;::Q'· ~'-Tai 

2/1 '~T;n:rr;r.:er· Ff~'-Br-3/9/28/7. Here some empiri cal epithets are applied to the Absolute in the metaphy sical sense. The words 'Reality', 'Consciousness' 'Infinity"  and 'Bliss' sugg-est Brahman here by negating what is  ·unreal', 'unconscious' 'finite' and 'sorrowful' respectively.  Besides this, we can determine the following points on  this attri bution :  

i) Brahman is of the nature of "Infinite Reality,  Consciousness & Bliss."  

ā) As it is the Atman of the Self of each one of us, we  can concrude that our real Self is Brahman of  this nature.  

āi) Our finite individual self, which is sometimes cons ciousness, sometimes unconsciousness, is not meant  here.  

Thus Shastra has denoted indirectly the definition of  Brahman throug;h denying the 'common meanings of these  words Satya, Jnana, etc. and turns one's attention :towards  one's own true nature of the Self, i. e. Brahman whose  nature is beyond the words- and concepts.  

āi) In Sāmanya- Vishesha" Prakriyā, Brahman is regarded  as genus, i. e. the concept of the universal is applied to  Brahman. (this is Adhyaropa of ~T+llrctcet).  

iv) In Panchkosha Viveka" the pervasiveness and the  nature of being the inmost of all is temporarily ascribed  to the Self (this is Adhyaropa of ~e.rt::QlJ I N<:"e.t).  

v) In Anvaya-Vyatireka, the continuity or persistence of  Atman as, a residual factor is assumed (this is Adhyaropa  of ).  

vi) In Drg-Drshya Viveka, Atman is presented as the  knower of all (this is. Adhyaropa of ~c.~ err ~ltl6Sl).ADHYAROPA AND APAVADA 61  

vā) A few ref arences from the Bhashyas about  the importance of t.he Adhyaropa-Apavada  method:  

Shaṅkara gives some illustrations regarding this  methodology in his Br. Bh-4/4/25 I/IIYATHAA EKA  PRABHRITI .............. TATVOPASAMHARAHA KRITAHA,"- U Just as, in order to explain the nature of numbe.rs from  one up to a hundred thousand billions, a man superimposes  them on certain 1ines {digits), calling one of them, one  another ten, another hundred' yet another thousand and  so on and in so doing he unly expounds the the nature of  numbers but he never says that numbers are the Iines1 •  

Or, just as, in order to teach the alphabet, he hCis  recourse to a combination of leaf (serving for paper),  ink, lines etc. and through them explains the nature of  the letters, but he never says that the letters are the leaf,  ink, lines etc. Similarly in this exposition the one entity  

"Brahman, has been incu Icated through various means,  such as the projection (of the universe). Again, to  eliminate the differences created by those hypothetical  

1... This shows that Sharikara definitely knew "decimal  notations.' Here he has explained the method  arithmetically_ But .this can be explained atgebraically  also. Just as in algebra in the equation, x2 + 1 Ox=11,  in order to evaluate the value of x, we have to add the  figure 25 (twenty five) on both sides:  

x2 +10x+25=11 +25  

or, (X+5)2=36=62  

or, x+5=6  

: .x=6 -5=1·  

Similarly in Vedānta-Shastra also in order to realize  th3 real nature of Atman or Brahman, some characteri stics of not-self are deliberately II/added" to (i. e.  superimposed on) It for the purpose of teaching. Had  the algebraical method been prevalent at the time of  Sharikara, then he definitely would have given this  type of example. 

62 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA~VEDANTA  

means, the truth has been summed up as Inot this, not  this. II  

The same illustration is quoted in S. Bh-2/1/14,  "TATHAA AKAARAADI ....... AKSHARAPRATIPATTEHE'~  -i. e. from the false perception of the presence letters  in some lines (drawn on paper) the true letters 'like  'a' etc. are 'grasped  

In Taittlriya Bhashya also he declare#) this methQ~ in  2/8, '·TASMAAT SATYAM JNAANAM ANANTHAM ......... ~  VIKALPA UPAPADYATE"-IIHence it is with ~ view to  realising the Self, which has been defined above in the  text lB.rahman is truth, knowldge, infinity" (Tai 2/1/1).  that becoming many, entering into creatiQn, acqu'isition of  bliss, fearlessness, attainment etc. have been attributed  to Brahman, conceived of as the basis of all empirical  daalin;;Js, but with regard to the really transcendental  Brahman, beyond all conditions, there. can be no such  ascription."  

Shaṅkara says that this (Adhyaropa-Apavada Nyaya)  is th9 only method of Vedānta and no other method to  remind the true nature of the seeker as Brahman which is  devoid of all types of adjuncts For th,is the reader is  referred to Brha Bhashya : 2/3/6 "'ATO NA NIRDESHTUHU  ...... ITI N !RDESHAHA.", meaning "Brahman cannot be  described as 'It is such and such' as we can describe a  cow by saying, 'there moves a white cow with horns:  Brahman is described by means of name, form and action  SUpt rimposed on It in such positive terms as I knowledge,'  'Bliss,' -Pure conscionsness,' 'Brahman,' 'Atman' etc. W!1en,  however, we wish to describe Its true natu~e, free from  

all differences due. to limiting adjuncts, then it is an -\.ltter  impossibility. T.heD there is only one way left" viz. to  describ~ I~ as 'not this, not this.' by eliminatilJ.g- all possible  specifications of It that have been known."  

Hence the usual procedure of Shruti in teaching the  subtle Atman, is to point out something grosser as the  Atman and then negating it to lead the seeker to th~ real 

ADHYAROPA AND APAVADA 63  

Atrnan. This can be illustrated thus (see S. Bh-1/1{8):  A man going to point out the tiny Arun dh uti star first  shows a big star very near to it indirectly as Arundhuti  itself for the time being. And then he negates (discards)  it and shows subsequentty the real primary Arundhuti.  The other stars are called by the name Arundhuti just to lead  the seeker's eye towards the actual Arundhuti. Similarly  the same m9thod of deliberate imputation of a characteristic  and its subsequent negation has been referred to in  Vedānta: saying ~This is not the Self, this is not the Self:  

VIII) Misunderstandings regarding the methodology  & conclusive remarks regarding the 3rd  fundamental:  

Unble to comprehend this methodology of Vedānta  (-The. 3rd fundamental of Shaṅkara Vedānta) the modern  Vedantins like Ramanuia. Madhva etc. have missed the  track of the teachings of Vedānta. And mainly they have  no idea regarding the comprehensive vision of life and  i ndispassionate thinking.  

In Advaita Vedānta also, after Sureshvaracharya,  when the sub-commentators twisted the sentences of  Bhashya according to their own respective ideas, they have  also missed the track of tradition. Because in traditional  way the word AdhyariJpa denotes that thiRg which is a false  appearance concocted by naturall Naisargika) ignorance, i. e.  Adhyasa, When these people have started argueing that  there is a material cause (called Mālavidya) for this  Adhyasa, then this material cause is naturally not a  concocted one by Avidya (-metaphysical ignorance) and  then it will be impossible to be removed by the knowledge.  

But according to Shaṅkara the nature of knowledge  is the capacity to remove Avidya (=misconception  regarding the real nature of the Self) and showing the  falsehood of the attributed thing. By this, it illumines the  truth as it is and it has no capacity to destroy something  which is existing one and to produce newly something.  Shaṅkara has said this clearly in his Brha Bh-1/4/10: 

64 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA-VEDANTA  

IINA HI KASHCHIT VASTU .. ~  

IIA free translation of this portion would be as follows:  I~This knowledge has never been observed whether  directly to remove some characteristic of a thing or to  create one, But everywhere it is seen to remove ignorance  Similarly here also let the idea of not being Brahman and  not being all that is due to ignorance, be removed by the  knowledge of Brahman, but it can neither create nor put a  stop to a rea I entity.'1  

Thus it is clear that these people have missed the  true track of Vedānta-Sampradaya. If we know the secret  of this third fundam3ntal of Vedānta (=Adhyaropa-Apavapa  

Nyaya), then we will never be out of track with the  teachings of the Upanishad.  

Hence this third secret of Shaṅkara Vedānta is to be  known by the earnest students of Vedānta. One can  easily recognize his own true nature of the Witnessing  pinciple of life by following the process of discrimination  which starts on the firm ground of universal acceptance and  compr~hensive vision of life. To take a firm stand there this  methodology of superimposition and rescission is the only  way.  

The superimpositions put forth from the empirical  standpoint of view, which are prescribed by the Shastra,  are called as Kalpita Samvrti. Samvrti means Vyavahara.  Shastra intends to push the seeker into the core of his life  unto the Witnessing principle of life which is the ultimate  truth. When the seeker remains as true Witnessing principle  of life then he transcends all the empirical bandages  which are in the realm of metaphysical ignorance. Though  the Shastra is in the realm of empirical dealings, as  it is in the form of words, it takes the seeker unto end of  the empirical dealings just as a boat takes the passengers  to the other bank of the river. After crossing the river  when he puts his leg on the bank then there is nO problem  of water. Similarly when the seeker remains as the  Witnessing principle of life then he transcends all the

empiric8t dealings. This is the effect of the above said  method. So, now we have to know the difference between  the two standpoints, viz. the empirical viewpoint and the  transcendental view point-the Vyavahara Drshti and the  Paramartha Drshti, which we shall deal with in the next  chapter.  

CHAPTER-4  

THE .FOURTH FUNDAMENTAL:  

Two Different Standpoints-Vyavahara Drishti (the  Empirical standpoint) & Paramartha Drishti (the Trans cendental standpoint. )  

1. Basis for Dividing the two standpoints:  

Some people raise the objection that Shaṅkara has  made two different standpoints in his Bhashya and what  he wants to accept he says that it is from the trans cendental standpoint and that is reatly real. And what ever he does not want to accept, he dismisses with the  observation- that it is said with the empirical viewpoint.  (These are called as Parmtirtha Drshti and Vyavahāra  Drshti in Sanskrit). And it is very difficult to understand  as to what exactly Acharya says regarding the final truth.  

This objection is raised due to non-apprehension  regarding the comprehensive vision of life which is the  very first fundamental principle. If we know the secret  of the very first fundamental, then we can very easily  grasp the teaching of the two standpoints,  

( i )  

According to the comprehensive vision of life, our  life is divided into two parts-one is the dualistic  appearance and the other, non-dual Absolute Being. ~ This 

66 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA-VEDANTA  

is an universally accepted thing. The dualistic dealing  which is divided into two parts such as subject  and object appears whenever waking or dream occurs,  -where ther'e is this type of appearance there are dealings  such as thinking, speaking and doing. These three-thought,  speech and deed are called as Vyavahara. Whenever we  say Vyavahara Drshti all types of thoughts, words and  deeds come under the category of Vyavahara Drshti, i, e.  empirical viewpoint of dealings. He who has synchronized  one's thought, word and deed, meaning he who speaks as  he thinks and acts as he speaks, is called a bonafide  man and this virtuq is called as straight-fo~wardness. And  the opposite' manner is called as crooked one. 50 the  word VY3vahlra com:>riS9S all types of thought, speech  and deed. All our present life is based on this empirical  

viewpoint. The worldly dealin:;Js, religious dealings etc,  all coma under this category The Vedānta 5hastra deals  with this type of dealing as from the empirical viewpoint  or Vyavahara Drshti.  

All these there (viz, thoughts, speech and deeds),  according to Vedānta, are in the realm of ignorance or  nescience only and hence do not pertain to the. transcen dental reality, which is beyond the ken of these three.  So then Vyavaharika view is same as the view of  of ignorance ( Avidyā-D'(shti) the paramarthika view is  same is the view of knowledge (Vidya-Orhsti) ..  According to Vedānta shastra, our own being is there  beyond this range of empirical dealings-where there are  no thoughts, no speech, no deeds but our own being is  there and it is on its own m3rit, self-established and  beyond all the concepts and words.  

( ā )  

In common life whenever the word denotes so mething, the mind follows the word and gets the concept  of that things, as for example, if we sayan elephant, by  hearing this word, immediately our mind gets the concept  of an elephant, Sometimes the -things which have not been 

EMPIRICAL VIEW & TRANSCENDENTAL V1EW 67  

seen in this world, these types of things also can be  imagined by the mind according to the direction of the  vvords, as for example, when we say that Airāllata (God  

I ndra·s elephant) is there in the heaven, then one asks  vvhat is that Airāvata? When this is explained that it is a  kind of elephant whose colour is white and which has  got seven trunks even though no one has seen such an  an animal in this worid, our mind can imagine this_ 'Airavata'  and if a man is an artist he can depict the same in a pictorial  form. So the mind follows the words. In a tractor, there  are two front wheels which are of small size and two big  wheels at the back. The front wheels have the steering  and they show the path and the big wheels follow.  Similarly words show the path and the mind then  follows it ..  

All the empirical d9alings are fully covered by these two  instruments-that is, the words and concepts. Hence our  mind is a simply a bundle of concepts which have been  created through the words. All this range of words and  concepts are called as empirical dealings-Vyavahara  Drshti.  

But accroding to Vedānta our own being, which is  bqyond words and concepts, is there. Whenever the  Shruti wants to denote this transcendental reality it says:  uYATO VACHO NIVARTANTE APRAPYA MANASA  SAHA" ( -Tai-2J9 ), i. e. failing to reach which (.Atman),  words turn back along with the mind. Hence our own  being" which transcends all types of dealings, i. e, thought,  speech and deed, that very being i~ called as "Transcen dental reality"- Paramār" ha Satya by comparing with the  present empirical aspect of life.  

( āi )  

If we observe. according to universal acceptance, the  deep sleep where there is no appearance of either waking  or dream, our own being remains there which is beyond  the concepts and words and that it is to be intuited by the 

68 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA-VEDANTA  

seeker with the help of the teachings of the Shastra and  the Guru. This Being which transcends all types of words  and concepts is not to be confused as essenceless, void  Qr nothingness meaning it is not Shunya as declar~d by  Nihilists. It is one's own true Being which is beyond the  word and idea of Being. As this Being is the substratum  for the appearance and disappearance of the empirical  dealings, so this transcendental Being is a really real one  and the empirical dealings are apparently real. For example,  either in waking or in dream all types of dealings are seen  

as real until ether state exists. When these two states  dis3ppear and mutually cancel the appearance of the other,  then th9 Being. which is the transcendental reality, remains  

unaffected. So this Being is really real and these two  states are apparently real in their realm of appearance.  Taking these two aspects of life Shaṅkara has divided  these two standpoints. Those who have no idea regarding  these basic principles and who have relied only on the  empirical view point, (only these people) raise such  objections mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.  

( iv )  

The distinction of the empirical and transcendental  viewpoints are not an imagination of Shatikara but they  are there as facts of life. We give here-in some examples:  

a) In our daily lifE' also there are two view points-one  is transcendental and the other empirical. While playing  the chess-game, they put the pawns and call them as king,  minister, elephant, horse, camel, soldiers etc. There are cer tain rules and regulations regarding moving of these pawns  

Both the parties must follow the ru,I.es whi1e playing.  After the game is over, when all the pawns are put into a  box, then the transcendental view point of all these  being wood or plastic automatically follows. And from  this view point there is nothing like king, minister etc,  but while playing the chess one should not rely on the  standpoint that they are wood. One can move the pawns 

EMPIRICAL VIEW & TRANSCENDENTAL VIEW 69  

as one likes. because when he is in the plane of the game  l1e should follow the rules of the game, So the playing is  -with the empirical view and there are differentiations lik~  king etc. Understanding that atl these are mere pieces of  ""ood ( or plastic) is the transcendental viewpoint.  

b) In Brhadaranyaka Upanishad-2f4/7, 8 & 9, the  Sāmānya- Vishesha Prakriyā ('the methodology of general  and particular) is shown. According to this, the general  principle is the transcendental reality and the partiCulars  ~hich are imagined on the reality, only belong to the  empirical reality. For example, West Bengal, Bihar, Andhra  Pradesh. Karnataka etc. the States are th~re from the  empirical viewpoint alone. but India (which includes all  t:hese States) is from the transcendenta viewpoint.  

c) In th9 previous chapter, whi1e discussing the  m9thodology of Vadanta we have cited the illustration. :  "The sun ris9s in the east in the morning, is overhead at  noon and sets in the west in the evening, by taking the  standpoint of the position of the earth. w This is Ilempirical  view." However the truth of the matter is that the sun  has rea Ily no such transc;tction i. e .. it neilher rises nor sets  from the stand point of the position of the sun. This 1S  the IItranscendental view."  

Hence in our daily life a'iso we rely on these two  standpoints in every aspect of life. Therefore these are  the facts of life and not the imaginations,  

( v )  

Thus, it is only a matter of looking at the same thing  from two different points of view-one from the common sense view or the Vyavahara Drshti and the other, from  the vedāntic view or the Paramartha Drshti. Shaṅkara  has clearly stated that the Shastra accepts Vyavahara  Drshti for teaching the truth. Fer examp.le, lIthe different  modifications of the sea such as the waves. the bubbles,  the foam, titeripples etc. are accepted as diffrent according 

70 GUIDE-LINES TO SH~NKARA-VEDANTA  

to empirical view as they do not rose their individuality in  in relation to one another, but they are non-ciffrent from  sea-water, is the tra-nscendental view. Just as the waves  and bubbles etc. are not different from water, the world  and the mind are not different from the Self Although this  distinction can well exist as observed in c,ommon  experience, but in reality, this difference does not exi~t,  since a non-difference between the Brahman and the  universe including the uMe-notion" ,s recognized'"  ( S. Bh-2/1/13 ).  

The Shastra and t.he teacher employ both these  standpoints when they attempt to enlighten the seekers  of Truth.  

aa SHANKARA RECOGNIZES THE TWO VIEWPOINTS OF  ·REALITY :  

( Some quotations from Bhashyas)  

We have said that Pure Being is transcendental reality  meaning really real and the dualistic world is empirically  real, an apparent reality, just as the cinema and the arc  tamp-the 'former apparentty real and the latter, reatly real.  Shaṅkara never mixes these two standpoints and he  differentiates these two standpoints and gives proper place  for aU the empirical dealings. The readers are referred to  following sentences 0'1 the Bhashya :  

( i )  

Ily ADA TU PARAMARTHA DRISHTYA . TENA NA  KASHCH'T V RODHAHA:' (Brha-Bh-3/5J1)  

IIBut when name and form are tested from the stand point-of the highest truth in the light of the above Shruti  texts, as to whether they are different from the supreme  Self or not, they cease to be separte entities, like the foam  of water or like the modifications (of clay), such as a jar.  It ;s then that such passages as, lone only without a  secona'-and It here is no difference whatsoever in It,' haveEMPIR'CAL VIEW & TRANSCENDENTAL VIEW "21  

SCOpe from the standpoint of the Supreme Self as refetring  to the highest realisation. But when, on account of our  m3taphysicat IJnorance, the reality of Brahman, although  remaining as it is, naturally untouched by any thing-like  "the reality of the rope, the mother of pearl and the sky-is  not discriminated from such limiting adjuncts as the body  and organs, which are created by name and form and our  natural vision of-those adiuncts remains, then this pheno 

menal existence consisting of the things different from  Brahman has fult play. This unreat, phenomenal existence ~  

created by Oifferentiation is indeed a fact for those who  do n()t believe in the things as different from Brahman as  'Well as for those Wh3 do believe. But the betie'vers~ of the  highest truth, while discussing, in accordance with the  Shrutis, the actu 31 existence or non -existence of things  apart from Brahman, conclude that Brahman alone is the one  with:Ju t a sgcond .. beyond all finite relations. So there is  no contradiction between the two VyavahāJa & Parmārtha  Views.'"  

( i i )  

1n Gita-Bhashya- 16/17, Acharya says in the same  way in reply to a question.  

IINANU HATVAPI. .. UBHAYAM UPAPADYATE EVA:"  

IIObjection : "Is it not contradictory to say-even by  killing he does not kill 1" You may say that this is eulogy  of Jnana. Eyen then it is quite contradictory.  

Reply: This is not aU a defect, for this becomes logical  from the standpoint of empirical view and transceniJental  view. (Explanation;) By adopting the empirical stand point which consists in thinking "I am the body and t am  a killer' by identifying the body with the Self (Le. relying  on this Laukika Vyavahāra Drshti) it is said here HATV API  (-even by killing). And by taking the transcendental  viewpoint of the true nature of the Self (i.e. relying on  Para martha Drshti) it is said here NA HANTI NANI BODHYATE (-that he does not kill any body nor he will  be bound by that action). So both the statements are 

72 GUIDE-ltNES TO SHANKRA .. VEDANTA  

congruous from the standpoint of different views~'~  ( āi,)  

Empirical view, Vyavahara Drshti, laukika Drshti,  Avidya Drshti i.e. natural viewpoint-all these are syno nymous terms in Shankra-Vedānta. Vaidika Vyavahara  Drshti also comes under the category of empirical view  point. Similarly, transcendental view, Paramartha Drshti  Acharya OrshtL Vidya Drshti i.e. Vedantic viewpoint all these synonymous terms. For this we can study the  following sentences of the Bhashyas :  

EVAM AVIDYAKR'TA NAMA RUPA UPADHI -...  SARVAJNATVAOI VYAVAHARAHA UPAPADYATEu  S.Bh.-211/14  

Thus (Brahman) conditioned by the limiting adjuncts name and form-created by nescience, becomes ishvara~  just 8S space I imited as it were, by jars, pots etc. And  within the domain of the empirical existence (Le. in the  spere of common sense view). He rules it over the selves  which identify themselves with the individual intellects and  are called Jivas and which though identical with Himself,  conform like the spaces in pots etc, to the aggregates  of the bodies and senses created by name and form that  are projected by nescience. Thus God's rulership, omnis cience and omnipotence are contingent on the limiting  adjuncts conjured up by nescience, but from the stand point of really real, however, there is no distinction of  ~the ruler, and ~the ruled' or IOmniscienct' and llimited  knowledge~ at all with regard to the Self shining its own  nature, after the removal of all limiting adiuncts through  illumination.  

( iv )  

The same is said in Brahma Sutra Bhāshya-2/1/22,  "API CHA YAOA .. NA TU PARAMARTHATO ASTI ITI  ASAKRIT AVOHAMA.'·  

IIMoreover, when the idea of non-difference is 

EMPIRICAL VIEW &TRANSCENOENTAl VIEW 73  

generated by such declaration of joentityas IThat thou art' ;  then the transmigratory nature of the individual Jeeva is  'removed as taJso the creatorship- of Brahman; for all  dualistic dealings brought about by ignorance, get sublated  by right knowledge. Then in that state where can creation  come from and from where the defects like non-accom 

plishment of beneficial result? We have stated more than  once that the mundane existence characterised by the  non-accomplishment of beneficial results etc, is an error  arising from the non-recognition of the difference (from  the soul) of the limiting adjunct constituted by the assem 

blage of body and senses which are a creation of name and  form conjured up by ignorance.  

JII Usage of this distinction of two standpoints:  

Veda or Shastra prescribes two types of Sadhanas,  (i' rituals and meditations (Karma and Upasana), and  (ā) cognising the real nature of the Self as nondual,  absolute and falsification of the phenomenon of the  universe, This is called as Jnana. When Shastra sf)eaks  regarding the first type of Sadhanas, it relies on the  empirical standpoint and while teaching the second  type, it takes the transcendental view-point.. Even  though when the Shastra teaches the second type of  Sadhanas, then also it deliberately attributes some quali ties or forms (i. e Upādhis) on Brahm~n for the pur 

pose of teaching. This type of attribution also comes  under the category of empirical dealings, but it is called  as Kalpira Samvrli. When the Shastra wants to denote  the true nature of the Self, then there is no other way  than the negation of the attributes. So the string of  negations such as NANTAH PRAJNAM.. (Ma-7),  NETt NET. (Brha) etc. are the only way to teach the  Brahman. The reader may refer the text regarding the  secret of this technique in I/Mandākya Rahasya Vivrtihf'  (Commentary on 3/26 Karika).  

For eminent students who are eligible to cognise  the true nature of the Self and are able to take a  stand tf--t ~re, the Shastra teaches from the transcendental 

74 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA-VEDANTA'  

s~and-,point. Beiore that, the Shastra uses some attri butes as a means to teach the transcendental reality.  But -for those cwho are unable to cognise the real  nature of the Self the Shastra relies on pure empirical  stand-point and initiates the $adhanas like Karma Yoga,  UpaS3n~s, Jijnasa Bhak~i, oomplete surrendering to the  i.:ord, ( PFapatti.) etc,. The Aacharyas like· Ramanuja,  Madhya, Shri- Krshna Chaitanya etc. hold that the whole  

range of the Shastra is in emp,i!rical state only. That is to  say doing somethirng according to Shastra and achie·  ving something after sometime (,Kalant~ra) or in other  worlds (L6kantara). Shaṅkara also accepts these ideas  denoted by the Shastra such as goin@ to ar~hma-Loka  

and so on in his Bhashyas. He does not condemn the  Shastra which teaches rituals, meditations and their  results etc. But he says that all these are in the  realm of ignorance, i. e. Vaidika Vyavahara DrsHti. So  strictty s,peaking Shaṅkara won't OPPOs€ or condemn  the principles like surrendering to the Ldrd, practising  meditations, performing rituals etc which have been  accepted by other Ach'aryas also. But other Acharyas  do not have vision of Shaṅkara which has specially  Shown-the transcendental Reality on the firm ground  of universal acceptance and comprehensive vision of  

life.  

Some people think that Shaṅkara has recognized  two types of Vedānta, from these two different stand:- points. But one should not misunderstand that, there  are really two types of Vedānta- one for Vyavahāra and  the other for. Paramartha. Because Vyavahara is natural  for all. Finding out, the truth according to Vedānta, is  quite separate from this Vyavahara. Take the illustrations  of diamond, graphite, coal (or coke). No one wants  to sell or buy these things at the same rate. Accor ding to Vyavahara" the value of diamond is too much  comparing to coal and graphite. Again these substances  cannot be used in our daily life for the same purposes.  Fdr example, diamond is used as gem and for cutting 

EMPIRICAL VIEW & TRANSCENDENTAL VIEW 75  

glases, graphite is used as an -electrode ( as it is a good  conductor of electric current) and coal or coke is used  as fuel. But finding out the reality ~of these subs tances is quite different from ordinaty dealings of  business. If we find the truth of these three experi mentally, carbon is only real. Diamond, graphite, coal  ( or coke), charcoal-all these are allotropic modifica tions (Rupa-Bheda) of the same element carbon. So  also in Vedānta, from the stand-point of emp'irical  view, the Laukika Vyavahara and Vaidika Vyavahara  

and ethics, moral values etc. are all there in our daily  life This is Vyavahāra. We should take it as it, when  vve want to deal with the wprld. But we should not  appJy the oneness of Brahman in these spheres ( i. e.  in these Vyavaharas). Since, according to Vedānta, all  these Vyavaharas are in the realm of ignorance or nes 

cience only and hence do not pertain to the Trans cendental reality which is beyond thoughts, speech and  deeds.  

Another important point is to be remembered. The  student of Shaṅkara Vedānta should not try to deliver lec tures on Shaṅkara Vedānta by quoting some Upanishadic  doctrines and Shaṅkara Bhashyas and using mere logic etc.,  to prove Advaita doctrine. Instead of this, the seeker  himself has to testify the utterances with his own intuiti onal experience if it is the teaching of the transcendental  reality and if it is an empirical subject, then he has to use  

.-proper pramānas, i.e. means of right knowledge (S.Bh 2/2/28). So o'ne must know both the standpoint of the  Jlempirical view point and the transcendental view poinl"  and he has to use the intuitional experience for the latter,  while the means of right knowledge to the former,  

Sbankara-Vedānta proves the superiority of the  Advaita knowledge over other views as it does not  contradict the scriptural statements regarding creation  and ritualistic Karmas and Upasanas. In fact, Sharikara"s 

76 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA .. VEOANTA  

Vedānta comprehends all other" visions, assimilates, Qives  support and transcends So, an aspirant must and should  ~know these two standpoints if he -wants to know the  secrets of 5hallkara-Vedānta. Then there will be no  confusion regarding the teaching of the Shastra.  

The Sadhanas which have been prescribed from  the empirical stand-point come under the category  of Kartr Tantra and the teachings from the transcendental  view point come under the category of Vastu Tantrao  This will be dealt with as th~ fifth principle of Sharikara  Vedānta in the next chapter. 

CHAPTER-V  

FIFTH FUNDAMENTAL  

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KA ~TUTANTRA AND  

VASTUTANTRA SADHANAS  

1 NATUREOFKARTRUTANTRA & VASTU TANTRA  JNANA  

It is an i -no:Jrtant fundamental teaching of Shaṅkara  Vedānta that Shrl Shaṅkara di ~ides Sfidhanas prescribed  in Vedas into two groups for two different types of aspi rants. The first is Karlrtantr.l Prakriya and the secoRd one,  Vdstut:1n ra Prakriya.  

The term "I<artr·· means the doer or an agent, and the  term "Tantra U m~ans that an ar,tion which depends on the  will or wish of the th-e doer, So Kartrtantra means actions  (or deeds,) feelings which are to be performed either  physically or mentally and which depends on the will and  effort of the doer or the agent. It is usually seen in our  life in all types of actions. There are three alternatives  before an ag~nt of action viz, he may: do, may not do or  may perform th'} action in a different way altogelher.  Shaṅkara gives illus:rdtion for this kind of Sadhanas either  in the empirical or under religious duties, which depend  on th9 will or wish of the doer. For example,  

-IiBesides, an act to be performed depends entirely on  _the will of the person doing it worldly or Vedic activjties  mayor may not be undertaken, or they mJY be dealt with  otherwise; as for instance, a man can walk, ride, proceed  otherwise, or neeq not move at all. Sim 'ar1y (there are  passages): ~In the sacrifice (with S6ma juice) called  Atiratra, the vessel containing the Soma iuice called  Sh6dashi is taken up~ and ~In the Atiratra sacrifjce the  Sh6dashi is not taken up". (Tai S. VI-VI-2.4). (In the  Agnih6 tra sacrifice) Ithe oblation is off-e,ed after sunrise  and Ithe oblation is offered before sunr,j,se .. ' These injunc tions and prohibitions are meaningful here (in a context  of rites) as also are the alternatives, general rules and  exceptions:~ [S.Bh-1/1/2] 

18 GUrOE-LINES TO SHANKARA-VEDANTA  

S6 it fS evident that Dharma Jijnasa is Kartr Tantr8,..  'n the case of re-ligiollS duty, direct statement of 'the te)G.t  and the like would 'be the only meall'S of knowledge,. be cause flO experience is needed tn SlIpport,  

And in the~ contiouatpon of the above portton ot  S.Bh-;1/1 f2~. Shaṅkara" explains the nature of Vastu Tantr(lt  jnana. Here ~IVastU" means, an ontol ogi ea" ta,ct of  e~istel'1Ce and uVa&tu Tantra" means the knowledge which.  

arises according to the fact and wh'eh does not depend  . .upon 'he will or wish of the k.nower~ Atways the know tedge .$ generated as per fact, as ~t depends so'ely on the  nature of the object to be known and not on the w;1I or  wish of the knower. Hence it (the knowledge so  generated) is called as Vastu Tantra, Hence the Vastu  T~ntra knowledge has no alternatives, i .. e. knowledge is nOl  someth.ng to be done, not done or done otherwise.. For  the realisation of Brahman no effort is needed o,her than  1he removal of ignorance. And this removal of ignorance  is not an act, a Karma, but an ontolog.ical truth impHed in  the highest experience ..  

The purport of the Vedantrc teaching viz., the unity of  Atman 'is such a Vastutantra knowledge. When the  Upanishads say that onlv by knowing Him one transcends  the mortality, there is no other way H-5hve 3/8. etc., it is  evident that through Jnana only one gets salvation and  there is no other means to get it. In our life and  experience, Jnana, knowledge is only Vastutantra. So  'this knowledge of the Self also must and should be 6f the  same category.  

Sharikara saysl °Karma and Upasanas (rituals and  meditations) and the res,ults or fr.uits of them are inevita bly gained after a period. of time either ~n this world or in  the higher worlds. But the nature of enquiry into the  Supreme Self is quite different, for it is dependent on  intuitive experience {Anubhava) and the result accrues  immediately at the end of the enquiry." (5". Bh-1/1./4) So  jt is evide'nt that Brahmajijnasa is Vastu Tantra Prakiva ... 

KARTRtlTANTRA & VASTUTANTRA SADHANAS 79  

11 AN OBJECTION:  

Samuch~chaya of Jnana & Karma ts necessary for  a result, knowled-ge alone ca-nnot yield a result ~  Since Dharrnajijnasa is Kartr Tantra and Brahmajānasa  is Va stu Tantra, so Sharikara wonYt accept the  Samuchchaya of Jnana-Karma or J-na11'a-Upasana 'etc'r  Because he relied on the fact of Hfe. Not knowing th'is  secret all are -OQjecting, ll1-a1: this view of Shali.~ara i..:e, only  Jnana. is enough, iswrong« Thev hold the "'UtaW that in  our. empirical deali'ngs or in relig;ous duties (rites} no  

Knowledge of a thing alone is fruitftlt Wh~n the knowledg'9  issues forth into the acHon then only the fruit will be  ach'ieved. So the knowledge must be subordinate to the  action, either physical or mental There is no exp'erience  :as such 'that by m~re kno·wtedge something is ach,ieved,.  For example one has passed a medical examin,ation such as  M.B.B.S. By m9rely getting the graduation and having the  knowledg~ of medicine and the natur~' of disease he  cannot cure a disease and henc,e he does not get the  money. He has to tr,eat the patients professionally, i.e he  has to properly appty the medicine to the patients after  correct di-agnosis and has to show good results and only  then he. will be able to cure the disease and get the money"  So also in the case of a lawyer, etc. In material scienc'e  there are two categor,ies+-one is theory and the other.,  practical. ~hose who have got the practical knowle'dge in  addition to the theoritical knowledge, are only fit persons.  If there is no practioal knowledge, but is only theoriticat.,  

that type of knowledge is futile. I n the dealings such as  rites; meditations etc~ according to the Veda, or practising  Yoga Sadhanas also have got these two types of theoriti cal and practical knowledges. When the practical is  important thing, then the knowledge must be subordinate  to the action.  

Relying on this view point, all other Acharyas like,  Ramanuja, Madhva etc,: have taken the stand that the  Jnāna must be subordinate to the action, either physical or 

so GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA .. VEDANTA  

mental, Then only the result may 'be achieved at some  other time or in other worlds according to the utterance of  the Vedas. Hence they recommend a combination of  Knowledge and Action (Jnāna-Karma Samuchchaya) for  liberation.  

III Reply: Mere knowledge of a thi n9 can produce  a result:  

The above objection seems very strong on the face of it.  But Shaṅkara replies for this giving an illut tration in  his Sātra Bhashya-1 /1 /4, showing that even mere  knowledge of a thing can produce a result- 

"Although, it was argued that a refere.ce to any object  as such, without its being connected with an injunctfon  about the work« will be useless like the statements-It he  earth has seven 'islands: etc, that argument is demolished  on the evidence of the usefulness of such statements of  facts as, 'This is a rop~ and not a snake."  

So, in our daily life also there is the utility nt mere  knowledge.  

We can take here another experience to show that only  knowledge can rescue from bondage. Suppose a man  dreams. During th~ dream time he assumes that the .dream state is the real world. If he is attacked by a tiger or  caught by robbers etc., he fears assuming that, that thing "  is actually taking place. When he awakens, he gelS 1 the  co~rect knowledge that he was sleeping safely in 'his room.  By the dawn of this knowledge alone he wilt be free from  the fear that occurred during the dream. There is nothing  to be done to dgstroy the cause of the fear except the right  knowledge of the real position, i. e. only the awareness that  he ge~s on waking up is sufficient to falsify that dream  experience. So here also the knowledge of the realitv alone  has· given the result of salvation or liberation. So, it is  wrong to hold the view that the mere knowledge alone  cannot yield the result. For this reason Shaitkara says in  S. Bh-1 /1 /4: ·-"The mere reminder of onevs being the  nOQ-miQratory Self by saying that you are 'lot this.  Samsari-Jiva, That thou art etc. would be fruitful byKARTRUTANTRA & VASTUTANTRA SADHANAS 81  

wIping off the delusory notion that one is an individual  Self suffering from the ills of mundane life.  

IV. Difference between the knowledge regarding  the outer things and the knowledge of the true  nature of the self.  

Commonly when we say that the khowledge, either  regarding the outer things or regarding the real nature of  the Self-both are same in one aspect-that both are  Vastu Tantra and generate in the Antahkarana and in both  cases the Antahkarana Vrttis are pervaded by the pure  conciousness, But there is a vast difference between the  knowledge regardi'ng the outer things of empirical life and  that of rituals, meditations etc. according to the Shastra  and the knowledge of the true nature of the Self. Because,  referring to the knowable objects, the Vrttitva remains ,  their and the aspirant takes his stand in his HMe..,notion U  

(Ego-sense), but in the case of Self-knowledge the Vrttitya  will be falsified and the aspirant takes his stand in his  true nature of the Self at the time of listeni ng the meaning  of the Vedānta texts and there remains nothing else to be  done in deference to the injunction about seeing Atman.  

Without knowing this great difference between the  two types of knowledge, all others are raising objections  to the Shaṅkara-s view point. But Shaṅkara himself hcs  clarified this difference in his Bhashya to Mundaka Upanis 

had in-1/1/5, i e, in his introduction to Mantra 1/116 thus:  

'In connection with the subject matter of injunctions  are to be found certain acts which are like the Agnih6tra  ( sacrifice) to be performed subsequent to the understand ing of the text. through ,a combination of numerous  accessories, for example, the agent etc. Unlike this,  nothing remains to be performed here within the domain  of the higher knowledge, but all actions cease simulta neously with the comprehension of the meaning of the  sentences in as much as nothing remains to be done  apart from continuance in the mere knowledge revealed  by the words:' 

82 GUIDE-LfN"ES TO SHANKARA-VEDANTA  

Here Shaṅkara declares that at the time of listening  to the meaning of Vedantic sentences, he takes his stand  in his true nature.  

According to these statements when the Self ... Know ledge dawns simultaneously all types of dualistic  appearence including Antahkarana will get falsified and  the non-dual Self alone remains and nothing else apart  from the Self. For this purpose we have told once before  that the realization of the Self means realization of  the falsification of the not-selves alone and not objectify ing the Self, Not knowing this great difference all obiec tions are raised on the Shaṅkara's statements. Falsifying  all the dualistic appearance and remaining as the non-dual  Brahman alone is called as M6ksha. This is said by  Shaṅkara in B. S. Bh- 1/1/4, "BRAHMABHAVASHCHA  MOKSHA" I  

v. Some misconceptions due to not knowing this  differance between Kartru Tantra & Vastu  Tantra Prakriyas.  

The knowledge of Brahman is Vastu Tantra and not  Kartr Tantra. For it is the Self-luminous and Self-esta blished Witness ( Sakshi ), the very Self of us all. J nana  as Sharikara conceived it is not knowledge which has to  be acquired by human effort, but an ontological fact of  existence. From this standpoint this discrimination, i. e.  Viveka which in taught at the time of Shravana and  Manana or Nididhyasana-all thesa types of direct means  of Self-knowledge come under the category of Vastu Tantra  Prakriya ; while all types Ritualistic Karmas and Upasanas,  Karmayoga, Upasana with Jijnasa Bhakti or practising the  adjuvant means like Amanitva etc. ( Gi-31/7-11 ), Buddhi  Shuddhatva etc. ( Gi-18/51-54 ) are all concern'ed with the  category of Kartr Tantra Prakriya. These two types of  Sftdhanas are dealt with in Shaṅkara's Bhashyas. Persons  unable to realize the discrimination of Vastu Tantra and 

KARTRUTANTRA & VASTUTANTRA SADHANAS 83  

Kartr Tantra forms of knowledge imagine that the Vedantic  text only yields indirect knowledge and hence all miscon ceptions.like :  

(i) repetition of Atma Jnana or Mahavakyas  ( Prasankhyana),  

(ā) combination of Jnana-and Upasana, or Jnana- Karma, i.e. Rituals (Jnāna-Karma Samuch chaya) for getting liberation,  

(ā i)

(iv) destruction of Vasanas ( Vāsanakshaya) even  after the dawn of knowledge by repeated  meditation.  

(v) dissolving the universe into Brahman by medita tion ( Prapancha Pravilaya Vada ).  

(vi) suppression of the modifications of mind by the  practice of Patanjala Yoga ( Chittanirodha or  Manonāsa ), etc ..  

have arisen in their minds and they have propounded  some of these theories in the garb of explanation to  Shaṅkara Bhashyas. They think that ~the practices of these  functions are necessary to gain the confirmation of know 

ledge, because these people have understood that after  knowing all these theories we have to practise some  exercises to achieve concrete oar tangible results in time.  Thay naturally distinguish between the theory and the  practice as is evident in our daily life. But we have  reiterated previously that, that which is done and achieved  afresh is non-eternal and is invariably time-bound. This  is forgotten by these people and this i-n itself becomes a  disqualification for them. That which is restricted by time,  space and that which is not-self can be achieved by  practice after having known it theoritically. But in the case  of the Self, who is the very core of one's Being and  

whose-nature is immediate and direct there is no possi-

81. GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKAR A-VEDANTA  

bility whatsoever of distinctions like theory and practice.  In his Prasthanatraya B hashyas Shaṅkara has referred all  these types of arguments time and again. Brahman is Self evident inmost Self and no description, d~finition or proof  

of its existence is needed, Here the only effort is needed  is to cease one's natural tendency of identifying himself ......  

with not-selves from the ego to the body and nothing  more for making it known. In this regard, Shaṅkara states  in the Gita Bhashya-18/50 which is mentioned earJier by  us.  

VI. A Crucial An~lysation:  

Whether Jnāna is mental activity like Ut:tiSāna or not: Some  people assume that getting knowledge also is a type of men tal action because it requires some efforts So why should  

we not say that just as meditations and U pasnas are men tal activities so also the Jnana is kind of mental activity?  Shaṅkara has taken up this issue in Brahma Sātra Bhashya  -1 /1/4, and analyses the subtlety of the difference between  Ilaction° and Ilknowledgeu •  

( Objection:) Is not knowledge a kind of mental  action? ( Reply; ) Not so, because th9re is a difference.  An action is in evidence where the injunction about it  it occurs independently of the nature of the thing concern 

ed and where it is subjected to the activities of the human  mind, as for instance in such sentences as Iwhen tha priest  ( called H5ta, ) is about to utter the Mantra 'Vaushat' he  shall mediate mentally on the duty for whom the ablation  is taken up by the Adhvaryu -Ai Br-2/8/1 ; lone shou Id  m3ntally m9ditate on the duty identified with evening'  (ibid). Though meditation, i.e. thinking, is a mental action,  yet it can be done, not done, or done otherwise by a man,  for it is a voluntary action depending on the will and effort  of a man. But knowledge arises from its valid means (e.g,  perception, inference etc) ; and the valid means apprehend  the thing just as they are. Hence knowledge is not some  thing to be done, not done or done otherwise, for it is 

KARTRUTANTAA €t VASrUTANTRA SAD'HANA'S 85  

~nti,relv determi ned by the nature of. the thtings and neither  by iniunctions of Shastras nor by the will of a man. Hence  though knowledge 's also a meAtal modlf~oati'On, ( it 'has -a  odifference.) For instance, the thinking 'Of a man or a  woman as fire in, '0, Gautama, a man is surely a fire Ch- /  

5/7/1 ), 10, Gautama, a woman is surely a fire,' (Ch-5/-8/1)  's certainly an act, since it arises from initJllctio'fl -a~one and  ijt is dependent on man. But tn-e idea of fire w~th regard  ~o familiar fire is neither dependent on injunction nOT on  man. Wh3t is it then? Ans: S;nce it;s determined by a  ~hing coming within the range of perception, it 4:5 sUTely  i<n')wledge and no ar;tion. Thus also it is to be understood  ir-l the case of all objgcts coming ,within the range of valid  means of knowledge. That being so the rea1ization of the  unity of Brahm3n and the Seif (that can n'ever be sublated)  QS also a kind of knowledge and it ~s flat determined by  mnjunction.'V -So Bh-1/1/4  

In th3 above paragraph Shaṅkara has shown that the  knowledge is not a mentaf action, just as meditati'on. So  it won"t require any injunction. Awareness of an object  or a fact C3nnot be ordered or changed by our will. This is  the sum and substance of the above portion. Shaṅkara  elsewhere clearly shows this thing in S. B11-3/2121  "lAs for eX,:>res3ions like ITha Self is to be ssen (Br-2/4 5,)  which are met with the context of the supreme knowtedge  they are m9ant mainly for attracting one"s mind towards,  the Reality, but do not aim mainly at enjoining any injunc 

tion about the knowledge of the Reality'"  

In the same Sutra Bhashya itself later he declares  -flKnC)wledge arises, however, from its valid means (like  perception etc.) and it conforms to its object, just as it is_  It can neither be produced by a hundred injunctions nor  debarred by a hundred prohibitions. For it is not a matter  of personal ol3tion, it being dependent on the object itself.~·  

In all these sentences Sharikara has shown that the  knowledge of the Self comes under the category of 

86 GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA-VEDANTA  

Vastulanfra and not Kartrtantra- or Purushatantra. And -als-o  that it does not come under the category of Upasanas",  This is told in Brahma Sutra Bhashya-1/1/4.  

tn this context Shaṅkara says that there are four types of  meditations or feelings prescribed by Shastra:  i) Sampad Upasana ā) Adhy~a Upasana āi) Vishishta  Kriya yoga (also calted as Sambarga Upasana iv)  Samskara Upasana.  

These four categories belong to ritualistic Karmas and  meditations & hence they are Kartr Tantra Upasanas.  But the knowledge of the Self which culminates in one"s  own intuitional experience and generates firm conviction  regarding the true nature of the Self is Vastutantra.. It  means that. as the real nature of the Self is there, the  knowledge regarding that real nature generates as it is,  that is, according to the fact. Hence Shaṅkara has said  in the last sentence of the above quoted paragraph that  #"Hence the knowledge of Brahman is not dependent on  human action. Question: On what does it depend?  Answer; It is dependent on the thing Itself, as in the case  of the knowtedge of a thtng got through such valid means  as direct perception."  

Hence the direct perception of Brahman is an ontologica.  fact (Vastutantra) which is independent of human effort  (Purusha Tantra). Self-awareness or awareness of Brahman  dawns in our mind spontaneously and effortlessty at the  very moment of our attentively listentng to the teachings  of the Shastras and the Acharya ..  

Vlt Benefit of I<nowing this difference  

When the Sadhanas such as Karma yoga,. Upasanas or  observing the virtues like humility, modesty, non-violence  etc. (Amānitwadigunas, Bhagavad Gita, 13th Chapter verses  7 to 11) and Purification of mind etc.. (Buddhivishu 

ddhatwādi Gunas, Bhagavad Gita 18th Chapter, Verses 52 to 54) etc .. are taught, these are- to be done with effort  and are to be observed in daily life. So these are called  Accessory means (~Pi~T ;a-T~) and Adiuvant means 

KARTRUTANTRA & VASTUTANTRA SADHANAS 87  

(~&'lirft ~TCl.,)· But when the direct means of the Self Knowfedge such as Shravana, Manana and Nididhyāsana  are taught, at that time the Sadhaka has to observe inwardly  as to whether the facts toid by the Shastra and the Guru  are according to his experience or not and he himself has  to cognize according to the facts of life using intuitional  experience. At this time gradually he loses his identifi  cation with the body, the senses, the mind or the intellect  and automatically he ceases to be an LIEgo-sense" and  remains himself as the Witnessing principle of life. After  this, he will not have any kind of duties to be performed  because the very doership which is the Lego· itself is falsi fied. So the Sadhana of Viveka or Vichara is not a Kartr Tantra Sadhana but it is Vastu Tantra alone. To reach this  standpoint Le. the witnessing principle of life, all types of  

Kartr Tantra Sadhanas are helofu I from outside.  While performing these Kartr Tantra Sadhanas one  should take identification with his ego (Antahkarana).  While when he starts to discriminate according to Vastu  Tantra Sadhana, inevitably he loses the identification with  Antahkarana. So one should know this secret of the  fifth fundamental of Shaṅkara Vedānta to rer(love at! types  of misunderstandings regarding the nature and place of  Sadhanas according to Shaṅkara.

CONCLUSION  

Now, here in this book ILGuidelines to Shaṅkara Vedānta U  the five fundamentals of Sharikara Vedānta are shown in  brief. According to Shri Shri Satchidanandendra Saraswati  Swamiji these are very important to the secret of the  teachings of Prasthana Traya Bhashya just as the Pancha pranas or five vital forces are to the life. So an aspirant  should know these five-i) Universal acceptance and  comprehensive vision of life, ā) Cognising the witnessing  principle of life, āi) The methodology of Vedānta, i. e, super imp\)sition and rescission, iv) Difference between transcen-

GUIDE-LINES TO SHANKARA-VEDANTA  

d-enia11 standpoirrt and Empirical standpoInt and (v) The  difference between the Kartr Tantra and title VaSlu Tantra  Sadhanas. Without k-nowing these basic principles most  of the followers at Sbankatra Inav'e confused the teachings  of. S ha,nkara.  

Basicallv the s'eekers should remember that there is vas'  difference and contFadj.ctiofl between the Bitlashva and the commentators who came after Sureshvaracharya.. These  sub,-commentators also tJse the words H-ke Adhyaropa &  Apavada, Vyavahara Drshti & Paramartha Drshti etc, but  ~hey h'ave twisted the Bhashya a'ccordiflg to 1ihe~r own ideas  wh'ich' bas-ilcall, contradict the ideas whi.ch are expounded  fn the Soonkara Bhashvas... For this reason these five  fundamentals have been shown here according to the tea cfltings of Bhashyas that have referred to the universa!  accepta'nce and comprehensive vision of life. Remembering  tnese principles if one studies the Prasthanatraya B hashVBS  with the help oi a competent teacher, where ever it is  possibte, then the aspirant can clearly understand  the genu,ne teachings of Shaṅkara and he will get the  b-enifit of gettiog re~eased from the bondage of Samsara_  

May Shri Shaṅkara who is the Self of aM, i. e. Brahman  bl~ss the seekers of Truth to go .n lhe right path and  achieve the goal..
