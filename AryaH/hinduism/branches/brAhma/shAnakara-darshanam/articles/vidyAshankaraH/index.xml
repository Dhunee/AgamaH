      <description>The Jyotirmaṭha Śaṅkarācārya Lineage in the 20th Century
Vidyāśaṅkar Sundareśan
This page was first born in response to the INDOLOGY listserv discussion (January 19, 1998) about the [Śaṅkarācārya of the North], and has been updated a few times since then. Barring fresh developments in future, this version (July 2000) will be final.
There is currently a succession dispute at the Jyotirmaṭha Śaṅkarācārya seat, the origin of which dates back to the year 1953.</description>
