Śiva Caturmukha

The myth of Tilottamā

In chapter 203 of the ādiparvan of the Mahābhārata we are told that, in order

to kill the Asuras Sunda and Upasunda, who could only be killed by each other, Viśvakarman, ordered by Brahmā, creates a woman of unparallelled

beauty. The Grandfather tells her to go to the two demons and to seduce them in order that they may kill one and other in their rivalry over her̥ This beauty, named Tilottamā, promises to do so and takes her leave of the gods by making a circumambulatioṇ Among those gods is Bhagavat Maheśvara, who sits to the south \(scil. of Brahmā\) with his face turned east, whereas the gods sit to

the north \(of him\) and the r̥ṣis  all around \(see below Textual Sources No. 2

\(TS 2\) v. 21\). Only Indra and Bhagavat Sthāṇu \(i.e. Maheśvara\) are able to

preserve their composure, but the latter’s excessive desire to watch her \( draṣṭu-kāmasya cātyarthaṁ\) leads to the coming forth of three more faces \( mukha\), one directed towards the south, which is possessed of curling lashes \( añcita-

pakṣmāntam\), one to the west and one to the north, the latter two not further qualified \(TS 2 vv. 22–24\). In this way Sthāṇu Mahādeva became four-faced

\( caturmukhaḥ \). Indra, on the other hand, issues forth eyes on all sides up to a thousand \(TS 2 vv. 25–26\). 

The curling eyelashes apart, the myth in this form does not yet refer to different aspects of Śiva that are represented by these faces, but his qualification of ‘Post’ \( sthāṇu\) may hint at his ithyphallic nature. That the appellation

‘Sthāṇu’ may have a phallic connotation emerges from the ambiguous and rather obscure nirukti  in MBh 7.173.92 \(TS 5 v. 92\): ‘Because he burns \(/destroys\) when standing erect, and, because his standing \(erect\) is the arising of the vital breath, and, because his phallus is always standing, therefore is he known as “Post”.’ 1

The myth of Tilottamā is taken up in the Anuśāsanaparvan, where signif-

icant iconographic features are added. An allusion to his ithyphallic nature

is absent here. Instead it is explained how Śiva assumed a quadruple form \( caturmūrtitva\), which may not be exactly equivalent to ‘a form with four heads’ \(TS 7 vv. 3–6\). 

Wherever she with beautiful teeth \(i.e. Tilottamā\) came into my vicinity, there, 

O Goddess, emerged a lovely head of mine. Wishing to watch her, I assumed a quadruple form with the help of yoga. Having become four-faced, while showing my own yoga, I exercise sovereignty \( indratva\) with my eastern face, with my northern one I sport \( ramāmi\) with you, O blameless one \(Umā\); my western face

is gentle \( saumya\) and conveys happiness to all living beings; my southern face, which has a terrifying appearance and is fierce \( raudra\), destroys the creatures. 

Translating this description into iconography, we may tentatively infer that the main head, which faces east, has the stern countenance of the yogin, that the southern face expresses the ferocious \( ugra\) aspect, that the northern face ex-

√

presses delight\(

ram\), whereas the western benevolent \( saumya\) face, which bestows happiness to the world, may have, by virtue of this function, a regal appearance, which may be symbolized by the turban \( uṣṇīṣa\), although the text does not explicitly specify this headgear̥ The Mahābhārata text seems

to assign these four aspects—asceticism \( yogin\), ferociousness \( ugra/ raudra\), benevolence \( saumya\) towards the world \(i.e. uṣṇīṣin\), and delight—to an anthropomorphic form of Śiva Maheśvara, who describes himself further as possessed of matted hair \( jaṭila\), celibate \( brahmacārin\), with the Pināka bow in his hand, and with a lustrous throat, śrīkan

. ṭha \(TS 7 vv. 7–8\). It is this quartet

of aspects that seems to underly, admittedly with some variations, the early sculptural representations of Śiva, no matter whether we are concerned with a caturmukhaliṅga \(aniconic\) or with an anthropomorphic image. This may be illustrated by some early examples. 

Images of śiva in his quadruple form

In the statue found in Bhita, datable around the beginning of the Common Era, 2 Śiva’s main characteristic, viz. his ascetic, i.e. yogin  nature, is represented by the central anthropomorphic figure, who is provided with matted locks \( jaṭila\) and penis erectus \(Plate 109\). Unlike his description in the Mahābhārata quoted above this central figure does not carry the bow Pināka, 

but rather seems to conform to devotional demands in that he carries the vessel \( kalaśa\) of amr̥ta  in his left hand, while the right hand seems to be raised in abhayamudrā. 3

This main deity is further characterized by four distinctive aspects symbolized by a ‘girdle’ of four heads around his waist, only partly in conformity with the Mahābhārata descriptioṇ 

One of the heads clearly represents

his ferocious aspect \( ugra\) and may therefore be directed towards the south, which would entail that the main central figure is facing southwesṭ 4

The head to the left of the ugra  face—

i.e. the one directed towards the east, if

the main image faces southwest—is de-

scribed by Kreisel in Die Śiva-Bildwerke der

Mathurā-Kunst as follows. 

Als einziger der Häupter ist er ohne Ohr-

und Halsschmuck dargestellṭ 

Der Haar-

ansatz ist nur als leichte Aufwölbung erkenn-

bar, das offenbar kurzgeschorene Haar liegt

ohne Zeichnung glatt am Schädel—sofern

nicht ein Kahlkopf \( muṇd

. a\) gemeint isṭ Die

schmucklose Darstellung läßt auf den aske-

tischen Charakter dieses Kopfes schließen, 

allerdings in einem anderen Sinne als beim

ekstatischen Yogiṇ 5

The ‘ecstatic yogin’ differs from the ‘as-

cetic’ one, 

according to Kreisel; 

with

the latter ‘scheint der gelehrte brahmani-

sche Asket, wahrscheinlich der—nicht not-

wendig jugendliche—keusche Brahmacārin

oder Saṁnyāsin gemeint zu sein’ \( ibiḍ\). 

Kreisel and others consequently arrive at a

fivefold scheme, which is supposed to un-

derly the Bhita sculpture. 

Plate 109

However, the differentiation of the yogin

Image found in Bhita

into two forms within the context of a spa-

tial ramification fails in the Mahābhārata description and in any other early

text and it may hence be doubtful whether a fivefold scheme really informed the early sculptures. The image seems rather to express the idea of one central deity not counted as an aspect, a deity who is possessed of or shaped by four aspects, the ones specified in the Mahābhārata, of which the yogin  aspect in

the present image is symbolized by the head of the saṁnyāsin/ muṇd

. in, which

is facing east in case of a southwestern orientation of the main deity. 6

4 If the main figure faces east, the ugra  head would face northeast, which is not plausible See below, p. 507. 

5 Kreisel 1986, 58. 

6 This orientation of the Bhita sculpture is based on the assumption that the ugra  head faces south. Kreisel op. ciṭ  60 f. takes as the most likely direction of the main figure the south, which entails that the four heads are facing the intermediate quarters. Kreisel explains this unusual orientation by the hypothesis, earlier proposed by J.ṇ Banerjea 1935, 36 ff., that the Bhita sculpture represents an ancestor monument \(Kreisel 1986, 55, 60\). This assumption would not be contradicted, but rather reinforced, by an orientation 

![Image 20546](images/015388.png)

Hans Bakker

The aspects represented by the remaining two heads of the Bhita sculpture, described by Kreisel as saumya  and uṣṇīṣin, agree with the two other aspects assigned to Maheśvara in the quoted Mahābhārata passage, if we are allowed

to equate the face qualified as saumya  by Kreisel with the one that in the Mahābhārata is said to sport with Umā \( ramāmi\). The relation to the quar-

ters remains problematic however; evidently the orientation of the uṣṇīṣin  and saumya  faces were not yet fixed. On the basis of the text one would expect that the head with which he sports with Umā \(said to face north\), is placed opposite

of the ugra  face \(said to face south\), which position in the Bhita sculpture, however, is occupied by the turbaned head, which, according to our interpretation of the Mahābhārata text, should face wesṭ An uṣṇīṣin  head in the western quarter is indeed found in an early caturmukhaliṅga  to which we turn now. 

The probably oldest Caturmukhaliṅga that

has been found is the Mathurā liṅga  pre-

served in the National Museum Delhi \(NM

65.172\), which according to Kreisel is dat-

able to about ad 100 \(Plate 110\).7 Its faces

in eastern, southern and western directions

conform to the Mahābhārata description in

that they express Śiva’s yogin, ugra  and uṣṇīṣin  aspects. The northern head deviates from the text as well as from the Bhita

sculpture in that it shows a shaven head

and as such may be denoted as muṇd

. iṇ 

This head replaces ‘the one that sports with

Umā’ of the epic, but again we are basically

concerned with a differentiation of four as-

pects. 

Attempts to explain these earliest Śaiva

images according to a fivefold scheme should

be considered as anachronistic \(Bakker

1999\). The liṅga  or central figure itself was, Plate 110

when Śaiva theology developed, interpreted

Mathurā: Caturmukhali ˙

nga

as the ‘fifth’ \(invisible\) aspect in order to

bring the fourfold spatial arrangement into line with the non-iconographic  fivefold division known from the Taittirīya āraṇyaka \(TS 1\), which associates five

mantras, i.e. five cosmic dimensions or functions with Sadāśiva; the first word

of each mantra is explained by the commentator Sāyaṇa as the name of a face

\( vaktra\) of God \(Parameśvara\), viz. Sadyojāta, Vāmadeva, Aghora, Tatpuruṣa, 

of the main figure to the southwest \( nairr̥ ti\). According to the Gobhilagr̥hyasūtra 4.7.41

a bali  offering to the pitr̥ s  should be made to the southwesṭ Cf. Gonda 1980, 55 f. on

‘the region of Nirr̥ti \(southwest\), the awful goddess of decay’.

and Īśāna. 8 This synthesis of a spatial and a cosmological order postdates our earliest Śaiva sculptures; it is, to the best of my knowledge, for the first time presented in the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa 3.48.1–7 \(TS 16\). Consequently, there is in our view nothing remarkable \(‘auffallend’\) about the absence of the fivefold form of Śiva in the Mahābhārata as observed by Kreisel, since this form

is equally absent in the early sculptures. 9

Plate 111

Mathurā: Architrave with scene of li ˙

nga worship

What, on the other hand, is very remarkable is the comparatively little attention paid to the liṅga  as a Śaiva cult object in our early Sanskrit texts. There is ample evidence which demonstrates that aniconic Śiva worship was widespread throughout the Indian continent at the beginning of the Common Era. Not only do we have, for instance, the testimony of the unequivocally phallic representation of Śiva from Gudimallam, 10 which possibly dates from before the Common Era, but we also have an architrave from Mathurā, datable to the late

Kṣatrapa period \(middle of first century ad\), which shows a liṅga  sanctuary \(Plate 111\). 11 To this may be added the late-Kṣatrapa Caturmukhaliṅga that we have just discussed and numerous liṅgas  pertaining to the Kuṣāṇa period

&c. 12

Epigraphic sources attesting the worship of śiva

Due to this rich archaeological evidence of liṅga  worship, some other data of the early period have also been interpreted as referring to Śiva’s liṅga, such as the 8 These five aspects, known in the scriptures of the Śaiva Siddhānta as ‘the five Brahmans’, 

are conceived of as being comprised in or as being the embodiment of Sadāśiva, an idea

also reaching back to the Taittirīya āraṇyaka, which concludes the fifth formula of ¯

Iśāna

with the words sadāśivom, glossed by Sāyaṇa as sa eva sadāśiva om.

two cult objects mentioned in the Mathurā Pil-

aster Inscription of Candragupta II, Year 61 \(ad

380/81\), 13 named Upamiteśvara and Kapileśvara, 

which were installed in a sanctuary dedicated

to the Pāśupata masters in the guruparaṁparā

of Kuśika \(Plate 112\). 

The latter may have

been thought to be the pupil of Śiva’s Kārohaṇa

avatāra, known as Lāguḍi or Lakulīśa from the

fifth century onwards \(above, p. 287\). Probably

on account of the ending ‘ īśvara’, which later in-

deed mostly refers to a liṅga, these two objects are unanimously assumed to have been liṅgas, be it, according to ḍr̥ Bhandarkar \(followed by ḍC. 

Sircar\), liṅgas  of a very peculiar type, viz. those that contain the ‘portraits of the teachers’. 14 The

text on the pillar reads \(TS 12\):

\[. . . \]

svapuṇyāpyāyananimittam

. 

gurūn

. āṁca kīrtyartham upamiteśvarakapileśvarau

gurvāyatane guru . . . pratiṣṭhāpito \[ |\*\] 15

The illegible portion indicated by . . . provides

Plate 112

room for four, possibly five syllables of which the

Mathurā: Pilaster

second seems to have been a ligature; Bhandarkar

conjectured to read five: ◦ pratimāyutau, evidently conceived as an attributive

adjunct of upamiteśvarakapileśvarau. To me this conjecture does not appear

very plausible, for reasons of Sanskrit construction—one would expect the conjectured adjunct before and not after gurvāyatane. On the other hand, the po-

sition of guru . . .  directly before pratiṣṭhāpitau  suggests an adverbial adjunct, saying that the installation was for the benefit/to the memory of the gurus  or something like thaṭ Moreover, to my knowledge, we do not possess archaeological evidence of liṅgas  that are adorned with portraits of human teachers. 

Nor is Sircar’s speculation to the effect that, ‘the representations showed as if Upamita and Kapila were standing each with a Liṅga on the head’, more plausible, in want of any archaeological basis. 16 Apart from the names ending in

īśvara, there is no evidence that the two objects installed were actually liṅgas. 

That iconic images of Śiva were installed as main objects of worship in temples of this period may not only follow from the great number of early iconic images of Śiva \(Maheśa\) from Mathurā as described by Gerd Kreisel \(Abb. 65–

126\), it may be illustrated also by an image commissioned by a Māheśvara for

a Śaiva temple in the first half of the fifth century, viz. the image installed by 13 Kreisel 1986, Abb. 126a–b. For the figure carrying a stick \(Daṇd

Plate 113

Mansar: Caturbhuja śiva

Candragupta’s grandson, the Vākāṭaka king Pravarasena II \(Plate 113\). This

king refers to the deity in inscriptions as ‘Pravareśvara’. 17 As I have argued elsewhere, there are reasons to assume that this beautiful, four-armed Śiva image discovered on a hillock called the Hiḍimbā ṭekḍī, 5 km due west of Ramtek Hill, in 1972, which to date embellishes the entrance hall of the National Museum in Delhi, represents this deity Pravareśvara. It may have been the main object 17 CII V, 19 l. 13: pravareśvara-ṣadviṁśakavāṭaka, and op. ciṭ  65 l. 1: pravareśvaradevakulasthāna.

of worship in the Vākāṭaka state sanctuary \( vaijayikadharmasthāna\) named after the king ‘Pravareśvaradevakulasthāna’ \(TS 13\), which was situated on

this hillock, near the present-day village of Mansar̥ 18

Though in recent years a wealth of Śaiva sculptures have come to light pertaining to the eastern Vākāṭaka kingdom, no liṅga  has been found among them. 19 The Vākāṭaka kings were brahmins and the majority of them Māheśvaras, but their apparent reserve to patronize liṅga  temples tallies with the Sanskrit texts of this period, in which liṅga  worship is only reluctantly acknowledged. 

Early Sanskrit sources of li ˙

nga worship

The Pāśupatasūtra and its commentary

First of all, the authoritative text of the Pāśupata sect itself, the Sūtras and

their commentary, do not mention liṅga  worship with a single word. On the contrary, the commentator Kauṇḍinya describes a manifestation of Śiva \( m¯urti\) in iconic terms; his form \( rūpa\) is said to be characterized by the bull-banner etc.:

‘Image’ \( mūrti\): Either this \( yad etad\) form \( rūpa\) that is perceived by him who is

standing at the right side of God, his face turned north, in \(His\) proximity, a form that is characterised by the bull-banner, the lance in hand, Nandin, Mahākāla, 

erect phallus etc., or to which \( yad vā\) the laymen resorṭ 

The sanctuary is ‘of the Great God’ \( mahādevasya\). This is the answer \( iti\). There is the object to be worshipped. 20

The Mahābhārata

Though Rudra’s phallic aspect is recognized in MBh 10.17.21, 12.160.46, and 13.17.74, there are only a few passages in the Mahābhārata where liṅga  worship

as such is acknowledged, the oldest of which may be the verses in Droṇaparvan

172 and 173 \(TS 3, 4 and 5\), although these too are a matter of dispute. 

Discussing these passages Jacques Scheuer remarked, 

Hopkins considère que la fin du Droṇaparvan est une addition tardive à ce livre. 

D’ailleurs, tout ce qui se réfère au li ˙

18 Bakker 1997, 4 f., 87 f. 

19 Excavations in Mansar after the writing of the present article have shown me wrong. 

Although I still think that the Mansar Śiva image in the National Museum has been the main image of the temple complex unearthed at the Hid

contained at least six minor li ˙

nga  shrines. In the immediate surroundings of this complex also at least two other li ˙

20 Below, Textual Sources 10. This difficult passage deals with the concept of the Dakṣiṇā-

mūrti. It is the vision of the initiated Pāśupata at the right side of the object of worship. 

This does not preclude that the latter itself is an aniconic representation of Śiva. This will be the subject of further discussion below, pp. 516 f.

couches les plus anciennes de l’épopée. Dans une “critical note” de l’édition critique, ṣK. De rejette la “conjecture” de Hopkins: le passage n’est pas si récent qu’il ne soit attesté par les principales familles de manuscrits. Cela est indéniable. 

A notre point de vue, cependant, il est plus intéressant de remarquer que le culte du liṅga ne semble jamais intervenir dans des passages se rattachant immédiate-ment au mythe central. Qu’il suffise ici de noter ce clivage. Il serait sans doute prématuré d’en proposer une explicatioṇ La mention du culte du liṅga est relativement claire. Les relations de Kr̥ṣṇa et de Rudra le sont moins. 21

The Mahābhārata passages at issue run \(TS 3 and 4\):

Birth, karman, tapas, and yoga  of these two \(i.e. Nara and Nārāyaṇa\) and of you

\(i.e. Aśvatthāman\) are eminent; God has been adored by these two in the phallus \( li ˙

nga\), by you in an image, during the various world-periods. He who adores the Lord in the li ˙

For the gods and Siddhas and great seers, by worshipping in this way, strife to attain the highest in the world and the everlasting statioṇ And this very Keśava \(Kr̥ṣṇa\) is a votary of Rudra, being born from Rudra; this Kr̥ṣṇa who is eternal is also to be worshipped with sacrifices. He who adores the Lord in the phallus, knowing Him to exist in all creatures, in him the One whose emblem is the bull \(i.e. Śiva\) takes an extraordinary delighṭ 

Because his phallus stands erect in perpetual celibacy and the people worship greatly \( mahayanti\), \(therefore\) is he known as the Great Lord \(Maheśvara\). Seers, gods, Gandharvas and Apsarases also have adored his phallus, and that one also stood erecṭ Therefore that Great Lord \(Maheśvara\) rejoices when his \(phallus\) is worshipped; Śaṁkara becomes happy and gratified and he is delighted. 

The latter text is with some minor variants found again in Anuśāsanaparvan

146.15-18 \(TS 8\), which may indicate that the Droṇaparvan passage belongs

to an older stratum of the epic. An explicatory śloka, which is also found

in the Droṇaparvan but in another context \(MBh 7.173.94; TS 5\), and which seems to echo MBh 7.172.87 and 90 \(TS 3\), has been inserted \(MBh 13.146.16\), somewhat disturbing the syntax, since the relative pronoun yo  in 16a lacks a clear antecedenṭ 22 This verse unequivocally refers to the liṅga  as a particular cult object distinct from an iconic image \( vigraha\). It says \(TS 8 v. 16\), 23

One who worships the body \(i.e. image\) of the magnanimous one \(i.e. Śiva\), or otherwise his phallus \( li ˙

nga\)—the constant worshipper of the phallus shall obtain great prosperity. 

The fourth, or, if we count the Droṇaparvan passage and its reprise in the

Anuśāsanaparvan as one, third passage advocating liṅga  worship is also found 21 Scheuer 1982, 277. 

22 This also holds true for MBh 7.173.94. 

23 Cf. the Gr̥hyapariśiṣṭasūtras of Baudhāyana \(3rd–4th centuries ad?\), which say that if

Śiva is worshipped in an image there is an eye-opening rite, when in a li ˙

in book thirteeṇ On the question of Śakra why he does not wish prasāda  from

anybody but Śiva, Upamanyu answers \(TS 6 vv. 100–102\), What other reasons do you need, the Lord is the primary cause. It has not been revealed to us that the gods adore the phallus \( li ˙

than Maheśvara is the phallus worshipped by all gods, or has ever been worshipped? 

Tell me if it has been revealed to you. Whose phallus Brahmā, Viṣṇu and you too

with the gods should always adore, that one is the chiefest for that reasoṇ 

The Rāmāyaṇa

The Rāmāyaṇa confirms the impression obtained from the Mahābhārata:

though a later tradition ascribes to Rāma the foundation of the Rāmeśvara

liṅga, this is not found in the critical edition of the ādikāvya itself. 24 Liṅga

worship is only ascribed to the Rākṣasas led by Rāvaṇa \(TS 9\), who worships

with incense and fragrant flowers a golden liṅga, which he had installed on an altar of sand on the bank of the Narmadā River̥ ‘And after the worship he

sung and danced, waving and spreading his hands’ \(TS 9 v. 40\). It may be significant that in the Mahābhārata passages great emphasis is laid on the fact

that gods and other divine beings also worship Śiva’s liṅga, 25 which sounds like a sort of justification, whereas the Rāmāyaṇa confines liṅga  worship to

Rākṣasas in a tone of scarcely concealed dismay. 

Concluding observations

The overall impression that we may gather from the material surveyed is that, during the first centuries of the Common Era, the brahmanical elite, whether priest, king or renouncer, preferred to venerate Maheśvara in iconic form and frowned upon liṅga  worship. 26 Its gradual acceptance in the 5th and 6th centuries by those circles that earlier rejected it may be illustrated again by the myth of Tilottamā. 

The evidence of the Skandapurāṇa

This myth recurs in what we think is the original Skandapurāṇa, which we

date in the sixth or seventh century, and which may have been composed in Pāśupata circles. 27 Here explicit reference is made to Śiva in his liṅga  form \(TS 14\): ‘There arose amidst these celestials a liṅga, solid, massive, a bundle of tejas  as it were.’ From this liṅga  four faces emerged when Tilottamā made her

circumambulation, the eastern one lustrous, with lips gracious as the bimba 24 Eck 1991, 62 f.

fruit \( prasannabimbauṣṭha\) and with three eyes \( tryakṣa\) \(TS 15 vv. 16–17\); the southern one ‘possessed of the colour of a languid cloud laden with water, having a ferocious voice, with dreadful teeth shining \(in an open mouth\), and the corners of the eyes bloodshot and glittering’ \(v. 19\); the western face was perfect \( anuttama\) having three eyes, and the northern one was very full \( susaṁpūrṇa\) and very gracious \( suprasanna\) \(vv. 21–24\). Thus runs the oldest description of the Caturmukhaliṅga in the Sanskrit literature known to me, at least half a millennium after the Indian sculptors had begun to materialize the idea in stone \(see also below, p. 521\). 

Conclusions

The various sources surveyed above lead to the following conclusions. 

1 The historic reality of ancient Śiva worship, which is taken here as a specimen of a wider issue, cannot be reconstructed by relying on one type of source only. If we would base ourselves on texts alone, we would hardly be aware that liṅga  worship was practised on a large scale throughout the Subcontinent during the first centuries of the Common Era. If, on the other hand, we would not have texts, we would be at a loss how to interprete the phallic stones provided with four heads of different countenances. 

2 When the visual material is interpreted with the help of written sources it is of paramount importance that both sources date from about the same time. More often than not art-historians describe their visual material on the basis of textual material that dates from half a millennium later, such as when early sculptures are explained by having recourse to the iconographic treatise of the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa or still later texts, while, as we have seen, contemporaneous descriptions are sometimes to be found in, for instance, the Mahābhārata. 

3 The incongruity that is frequently found between the archaeological material and textual descriptions may have its root in the different sections of the society to which these sources pertaiṇ This makes us realize how tentative our assessments are and how little we actually know about the early history of the religions of India. 

4 If these three conclusions are accepted it follows finally that, in view of the scarcity of sources at our disposal, we simply cannot afford to disregard any of them. When, however, we evaluate them and try to construe an integral picture of the past, we should never lose sight of their innate differences and we must proceed with the utmost caution, in the knowledge that the complexity of the historic reality of ancient India is far greater than we can ever hope to recover̥

## At the Right Side of the Teacher

Imagination, Imagery, and Image in Vedic and Śaiva Initiation Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, 

Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom

prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 

Matthew 25: 34 \(cf. Ecclesiastes 10: 2\)

Introduction

The transformation of the Vedic religion into new systems of belief and practice, early Hinduism for short, is a process of cultural change that, despite two centuries of research, has only partly been understood. The replacement of the sacrificial fire by images of wood and stone is among the most obvious innovations. As has been convincingly argued by Phyllis Granoff \(2006\), this innovation was only reluctantly accepted in some circles of brahmanic orthodoxy. 

On the other hand, there can be little doubt that Vedic imagination informed the concept of God and His image \( mūrti\) in the newly emerging religions. It

found expression in the Sanskrit texts of early Hinduism. The confrontation of this textual evidence with the material images of the archaeologist is often perplexing, however̥ 

An example of such a conundrum is the so-called Dakṣiṇām¯urti, mentioned in the Pāśupata texts, the Mahābhārata, and the later Śaiva literature of the

Mantramārga. In this essay, we will examine the Vedic origins of the imagery of the Dakṣiṇām¯urti. This m¯urti  appears first and foremost to be an ideal image embedded in the ritual of initiatioṇ The Vedic upanayana  ceremony laid the structural foundations for the initiation rites of the later religious orders. The Dakṣiṇām¯urti appears to be a token of the theistic transformation of the Vedic imaginatioṇ It illustrates how literate Śaiva brahmins took the Hinduistic turṇ At first material images played, if at all, only a secondary role in this transformatioṇ However, in a religious world that was increasingly pervaded by material images of the divine, it was bound to happen that the visionary

image became an archetype of visual representation, the Dakṣiṇām¯urti as an iconographic category. In this process, an essential characteristic of the vision of God as revealer was reinterpreted: His right side became interpreted as His southern face. The incongruity of this representation with the age-old religious idea of the south as being terrifying, inauspicious, 1 was to make a conundrum. 

The sitting position of teacher and pupil in the Vedic Upanayana ritual

The śatapathabrāhmaṇa

The Śatapathabrāhmaṇa 11.5.4 is our earliest source for the ancient upanayana ritual; a brief summery may highlight its major features. 

1 The pupil approaches a teacher and expresses the wish for apprenticeship by saying: I have come for brahmacarya \( brahmacaryam āgām\). He commits

himself to be a brahmacāriṇ 

2 The teacher \( ācārya\) asks his name. The question implies the answer: ‘who’

\( ka\) conceived as another name of Prajāpati. 

3 The teacher takes the pupil by the hand, implying that he accepts him as a student, saying indrasya brahmacāry asy, agnir ācāryas tavāham ācāryas

tavāsāv iti. Thus the ācārya  and Agni are seen as homologous. 

4 He consigns the student to Prajāpati and Savitr̥ and to all beings in heaven

and earth. 

5 He consigns him to brahman, that is, he makes him a brahmacārin  by saying

brahmacāry asi, while he lets him sip water, which embodies the elixir of life \( amr̥ta\). Thus the pupil is initiated into the life eternal, and becomes a

‘wanderer in brahman’. 

6 After this initiation—with or without delay \(see below ṇ 11 on p. 508\)—the

ācārya  teaches the Veda by making him repeat its quintessence, the Sāvitrī. 

The importance attached to the position of pupil and teacher during the Veda instruction is apparent from the fact that it is singled out for specification in the Brāhmaṇa; there appear to be two different traditions. According to one tradition the student sits or stands at the right side \( dakṣiṇatas\) of the teacher, who, as is understood, is facing easṭ The position of the pupil is characterised by the term bulva/bulba. This word, apparently a hapax legomenon, is given by Mayrhofer ewa ṣv. as ‘etwa “seitwärts”’ \(with the remark: ‘nicht klar’\). 

Because of this sideway position, this tradition is rejected in the Brāhmaṇa, 

which opts for the alternative: the student should sit opposite the teacher looking at him from east to wesṭ 2

1 Cf. Bodewitz 2000, 22 f. 

2 ŚBr 11.5.4.14:



26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 507

Which direction, we may ask, faces the pupil in the situation that is rejected? 

The commentary of Sāyaṇācārya does not resolve the questioṇ3 There can be little doubt that the teacher, homologous to Agni, is facing east; 4 the student, on the other hand, may be thought to be looking at his teacher in profile, i.e. 

he may be facing north, for that is the region of the gods, 5 the region of living men as opposed to that of the deceased. 6 Or, he may face the northeast, since standing towards that direction Prajāpati created the creatures, there the gate

of heaven is believed to stand. 7 The northeast may be particularly appropriate in the present case, because it not only is the direction into which Prajāpati

issued the beings—Prajāpati to whom the student has just been consigned—

but also is the point of the compass where the Sun \(Savitr̥\) rises at the summer solstice to begin a new year, the Sun to whom the student has just as well been consigned and into whose mantra \(Sāvitrī\) he is actually being initiated, 

that is, whose mantra he is reciting. If directed to the northeast, the student is seated obliquely, not transversely, with respect to the teacher̥ It is difficult to determine whether bulva  means ‘oblique’ or ‘transverse’. 

Consequently, the first of the two alternatives discussed in the Śatapathabrāhmaṇa, the one that is rejected by the Brāhmaṇa itself, namely that the

student is sitting at the right side \( dakṣiṇatas\) of the teacher, allows for two interpretations: \(1a\) teacher is facing east and student is facing north, or \(1b\)

Now some recite \(to the pupil\) while the latter is standing or sitting at the right side \(of the teacher\). One should not do so. One would be able to say to him in that case:

‘Yes indeed, he \(the teacher\) has begotten him \(the student\) sideways, and sideways \(i.e. wayward\) he \(the student\) will be’; and so, indeed, it will come to pass. Therefore he should recite to \(the pupil\) sitting in front of him, while the former is westwards looking.

nmukho bhaviṣyatīti er I take prāṅmukham, like bulvaṁtiraścīnaṁ, as an adverb qualifying ajījanat: ‘ bulva, i.e. transversely, while facing forward/eastwards \( prā ˙

nmukham\), he has begotten \(the pupil\)’; this adverb, referring to the position of the teacher, serves to pronounce the contrast with the pupil, who will turn away \( parā ˙

nmukha\), will be adverse. Bulva  thus means transverse \( tiraścīna\), 

adverse \( parā ˙

nmukha\), which, again, suggests that teacher and pupil sit at right angles.

teacher is facing east and student is facing northeasṭ \(1b\) is clearly a variant of \(1a\) and a combination of both is perfectly feasible: the pupil faces north, but, if appropriate, may look towards the northeasṭ 8

That the Brāhmaṇa prefers alternative \(2\)—teacher and pupil sitting opposite to one another, directed to the east and west respectively—-may above all have practical reasons, since the teacher bestows more than only learning upon the neophyte at this occasion; a change of position may have been thought to be cumbersome. 9 The first alternative \(1a–b\), on the other hand, because it makes sense in terms of the mystique of the quarters, may have preserved original traits. Moreover, the right side of the teacher has symbolic meaning. 

‘There is ample evidence that the right hand or the right side of the body was decidedly preferred to the lefṭ’ 10 We will return to this below. 

The Śatapathabrāhmaṇa does itself refer to earlier modalities of the ritual recitation of the Sāvitrī, when it reads: ‘In former days, however, they recited that same verse \(the Sāvitrī\) at the end of the year \( saṁvatsare\), thinking

“being as old as a year, indeed, children are born; as soon as born, we impart speech to him”.’ 11 The appropriate direction in this ritual is, or so it seems, the northeast, in which direction Prajāpati gave birth, Prajāpati who is equated

with the year \(Gonda 1984\). 

The Gr̥hyas¯utras

The two traditions indicated briefly in the Śatapathabrāhmaṇa can be followed

in the Gr̥hyas¯utra literature. As one would expect, the only Gr̥hyas¯utra that 8 Gonda 1980, 54 gives a confusing rendering of this position: On the other hand, the brahman \(priest\) is placed or sits south. . . . The same  position is prescribed to the boy who is to be initiated before a girdle is tied round his waist, which is to protect him against evil influences. 

The boy is not said to sit in or face the south, but to sit at the right side of the teacher̥ 

That this coincides with the south is secondary and as such does not play a symbolic role, as I will argue in this article \(cf. Bodewitz 2000, 26\). 

9 According to the Gr̥hyasūtras the pupil receives, among other things, a girdle and a staff, to which the sacred thread may be added. All three items are missing in the ŚBr accounṭ 

It seems that bestowing the yajñopavīta  upon the novice at this occasion is a relatively late addition \(see Gopal 1959, 296\). There is obviously a loss of symbolic significance in this second position of the pupil compared to the first alternative. Surveying the meaning of the western direction in Vedic ritual Gonda 1980, 55 observes: ‘It follows that facing eastwards whilst standing in the west \[as does the ācārya, H.ṭB.\] results

belongs, like the Śatapathabrāhmaṇa, to the White Yajurveda, the Pāraskara-

gr̥hyas¯utra, follows the accepted tradition of the Brāhmaṇa, though it mentions the alternative. The place where the teaching takes place is specified: north of the sacrificial fire. 

After \(the pupil\) has made a pradakṣiṇa  around the fire he takes his seaṭ The teacher, touched \(by the pupil\), pours oblations of ghee into the fire; when the remains have been eaten, he instructs him: ‘You are a brahmacārin, drink water, 

do your service, may you not sleep in the daytime, restrain your speech, put fuel on the fire, drink water̥’ Then he recites to him the Sāvitrī, north of the sacrificial

fire, while \(the pupil\) is sitting near him with his face turned west, looking \(at him\) and being looked aṭ Some: ‘to him while standing or sitting to his right side’. 12

The Gr̥hyas¯utras of the r̥gveda, the āśvalāyana- and Śāṅkhāyanagr̥hyas¯utras, 

although different in details and sequence, seem basically to follow the accepted tradition of the White Yajurveda with regard to the place of teaching, to the north of the fire, and the vis-à-vis position of teacher and pupil. 13 The same goes for the Gobhilagr̥hyas¯utra of the Sāmaveda.14

The other tradition, rejected in the Śatapathabrāhmaṇa, we find in some

Gr̥hyas¯utras affiliated with the Black Yajurveda, though not in all.15 For an assessment of the upanayana  ritual according to this tradition, we turn to the elaborate description in the Bhāradvājagr̥hyas¯utra. Its procedure may be epit-

omized \(with cross-references to the Hiraṇyakeśigr̥hyas¯utra\). 

The teacher prepares for the homa  sacrifice by consecrating the implements etc. \(BhGS 1.3\). He prepares west of the sacrificial fire a seat of grass \( kūrca\), 

of which the grassblades are turned to the north. There the teacher takes his seat, his face turned to the east; the pupil \( kumāra\), who has put on the

yajñopavīta  and sipped water, takes his seat at the right side \(of his teacher\) \( dakṣiṇatas\).16

The teacher performs the homa  sacrifice \(BhGS 1.4\). Then he gives the pupil a new cloth, a girdle of muñja grass \( mauñjī mekhalā\), and a skin of the black

antelope \( ajina\) \(BhGS 1.5–6\). Next \(BhGS 1.7\) \(the teacher\) strews to the west of the sacrificial fire darbha grasses, on which the two \(teacher and pupil\) take their stand, one facing east, the other wesṭ The one facing east takes the hand of the one facing west and vice versa. A servant fills the añjalis  of both

with water̥ By his añjali \(the teacher\) transfers the water into the añjali \(of

the pupil\). 17

A formal interview takes place in which the teacher asks for the name of the pupil and subsequently leads him \( upanayāmi\) to Prajāpati \(Ka\) \(BhGS 1.7\). 

15 Not, for instance, in the āpGS 4.11.7–8:

Although the site of the teaching is said to be to the west side of the sacrificial fire, the pupil is said to sit opposite \(i.e. east\) of the teacher while facing west, that is he sits with his back towards the fire blocking the teacher’s access to iṭ This evidently hybrid version of the ritual appears to be a conflation of the tradition of the White Yajurveda \(and r̥ g- and Sāmaveda, as we saw above\) and the alternative tradition \(see below\). The Gautamadharmasūtra adds to the confusion when it declares that the student should sit at the right side of the teacher, but may face either east or north; in the former case he sits parallel to the teacher: prā ˙

26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 511

The teacher consigns the pupil to several other deities. The teacher asks him to step on a stone \( aśman\) and to put fuel on the fire \(BhGS 1.8\). 

Then the pupil makes a pradakṣiṇa  around the fire, takes his seat at the right side \( dakṣiṇatas\), scil. of the teacher, while he turns to the north, touches \(the feet of the teacher\), and asks: ‘O lord, recite the Sāvitrī’. 18 The place where

the teacher is seated is not again specified, but presumably he is still seated west of the fire facing east, that is the place where he performed the homa sacrifice, took the interview accompanied by the añjalis, and consigned the

pupil to Prajāpati etc. This is corroborated by the Hiraṇyakeśigr̥hyas¯utra.19

The sitting position of the preceptor and his audience Veda study is of course not restricted to the brahmacāriṇ Outside the village, 

retreated into the wilderness \( araṇya\), brahmins devoted themselves to study

and, if they became known for their learnedness, attracted students. In this way we conceive of the origin of the different Upaniṣad teaching traditions and of other early Indian schools of philosophy \(above, p. 230\). The subject of study and teaching may have changed accordingly, but the setting is traditional and had a long life. We find such an idyllic setting, for instance, in the Śāṅkhāyana-

gr̥hyas¯utra, where it describes ‘the rules for the forest-dweller regarding his \(Veda\) study’. 20

For this study \( svādhyāya\) the forest-dwellers should go to a pure spot in the northeast that is open at the eastern side. The site is circular or marked by a circle with an entrance to the east or the north. After some preliminary rites, they may take up their studies. 21

teacher\), according to rank; if this is impossible \(i.e., if there is not enough space\) they may face all directions. They should wait for the rising of the suṇ And when they have seen it \(rise\) in all its splendour, they say: ‘Sir, recite’, while touching with their right and left hands the hallowed feet of the teacher—his right \(foot\) with their right, his left \(foot\) with their left hands. 22

The Śāṅkhāyanagr̥hyas¯utra, which, as we have seen, agreed with the tradition of the White Yajurveda in opting for the face-to-face position of teacher and pupil north of the sacrificial fire in the upanayana  ritual \(see above ṇ 13 on p. 509\), reserved the alternative position, in which the student sits at the right side of the teacher facing north, for the traditional school of the hermitage. 

It is to be expected that this time-honoured traditional setting of religious education may be met again in the Mahābhārata. The practice to stand with

one’s face turned to the east when making a solemn pronouncement or to reveal a secret is attested in the great epic, as the following example may show. 

But then, when Kr̥ṣṇa, haven of brahmins, heard the cause of Pārtha’s \(i.e. Arjuna’s\) sorrow, he touched water and stood still, his face turned to the east; and the mighty lotus-eyed one spoke this word for the benefit of Pāṇḍu’s son, intent upon

killing the army of Jayadratha: ‘O Pārtha, there is a supreme unfailing weapon

called “Pāśupata”, by which god Maheśvara killed all the Daityas in battle.’ 23

However, I have not found in the Mahābhārata an exact parallel of the situation

described in the Śāṅkhāyanagr̥hyas¯utra, in which the position of the audience is specified. 

The sitting position of guru and novice in early Śaiva initiation ritual

We may next investigate whether the tradition of Vedic initiation and instruction informed similar rites in the emerging religious communities. In his Change 22 Cf. āpastambadharmasūtra 1.\(2\).6.24: ekādhyāyī dakṣiṇaṁbāhuṁpratyupasīdet  k 24 k

26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 513

and Continuity in Indian Religion Jan Gonda elaborates the theme of the book with regard to the Vedic upanayana  and the initiation \( dīkṣā\) in the monastic orders. 

Instead of upanayana and the renewable dīkṣā we find in the monastic orders an ordination proper—sometimes called dīkṣā—which is to be preceded by a noviciate beginning with a ceremony which is a parallel of the upanayana, and in various Hindu sects and communities an admission to full membership, to priesthood or guruship, which is also known as dīkṣā. \(Gonda 1965, 317\) And describing the initiation ritual of ascetics, he makes the following remark. 

. . . dīkṣā.  This term is translated by ‘consecration’ and ‘renouncement of the world’. On this occasion one is inter alia  given a new name. During important acts, such as study, confession, one has to turn east- or northward; as is well known these directions are of special importance in brahmanic rites, the ‘door of heaven being in the northeast’. \(Gonda 1965, p. 385\)

We shall confine ourselves here to the Śaiva orders and investigate whether these traditional directions of teacher and student can actually be found in their early texts. 

Initiation in the Pāśupata tradition

The earliest text of a Śaiva order that we have is the Pāśupatasūtra with the

commentary of Kauṇḍinya. The initiation in the order is briefly described by Kauṇḍinya when he explains the future tense used in the first S¯utra \( vyākhyāsyāmaḥ , ‘we shall expound’\). 

‘Shall’ \( syā\) refers to the time required, namely the time that is required \(before the exposition can begin\) by the ācārya, to consecrate a brahmin at

Mahādeva’s ‘southern mūrti’ with ashes that are consecrated with the \(five\) mantras, ‘Sadyojāta’ etc., and to initiate him in the mantra, after he has made him relinquish the signs of his origin—a brahmin whose \(antecedents\) have earlier been screened, as follows from the word ‘therefore’ \( ataḥ \) in the Sūtra, who comes

\(to him\) from amongst the householders etc., and who has \(already\) engaged himself in fasting and observances. 24

The other Pāśupata text that has survived is the Gaṇakārikā. The Ratnaṭīkā, 

commenting on Gaṇakārikā 5, in which the elements of the initiation are

I consider the interpretation that takes the locative mūrtau  as depending on ◦ saṁskr̥ tena,

Hans Bakker

summed up—the \(right\) materials, the \(right\) time, the ritual \(of consecration\), the image \( mūrti\), and the preceptor \( guru\) 25 —explains what in the context of the consecration ritual \( saṁskāra\) is meant by mūrti. It reads:

The word image \( mūrti\) in the Kārikā aims at \( abhipretaḥ \) the spot \( bhūpradeśaḥ \)

a little to the right \( dakṣiṇa\) of that, which \[by Kauṇḍinya\], in \[his commentary on\] the ‘Sūtra on offering’ \[i.e. PS 1.8–9\], is described \( vyākhyātaṁ\) as the locus

\( sthāna\) of worship of Mahādeva that is characterized by the erect phallus etc.—a spot not separated from it by a wall \( kud

. ya\) or the like. 26

‘ Mūrti’ is here to be interpreted as a location, ‘at the mūrti’, referring to the site

of consecration, said to be by the right side of \(◦ dakṣiṇa◦\), close to ◦ samīpa◦ and not separated ◦ avyavahito  from that which in Pāśupatasūtra 1.8–9 is qualified

as Mahādeva’s manifestation \( rūpa\). If we assume that the commentator of the Gaṇakārikā and Kauṇḍinya both describe the same initiation tradition, we may deduce from the T

. īkā that the words of Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 1.1, mahādevasya dakṣiṇasyāṁmūrtau, are to be understood as saying that the novice is seated on the right side of Mahādeva. 27

Though the esoteric intention of both authors clearly hampers our understanding, I would hazard the conjecture that the guru, who initiates the student into the Pāśupata observance \( vrata\) by communicating to him the doctrine as revealed by Śiva himself in the Pāśupatasūtra, embodies Śiva. The novice is

seated next to him on his right-hand side, that is, he is situated ‘at the mūrti’; 

and this designation is understandable as it refers to a situation in which the neophyte envisages the image \( mūrti\) of the divine preceptor in his guru, that is, he sits at Mahādeva’s visual manifestation and sees Him, His rūpa, His

benign epiphany, in front of him, in profile. The two natures of the teacher, the learned and pious person of flesh and blood, and the divine archetype are explicitly stated in the T

. īkā on the word ‘ guru’. 

‘Guru’ is the preceptor \( ācārya\); he has two forms, on account of the distinction supreme and not-supreme. With regard to these \(two forms\) not-supreme is he as 25 Gaṇakārikā 5cd: dravyaṁkālaḥ kriyā mūrtir guruś caiveha pañcamaḥ .

I cannot subscribe to the translation of Oberhammer \(1984, viii\), which makes mūrti-

śabdena  the logical subject of vyākhyātaṁ\(‘Mit dem Wort mūrtiḥ , das im Verehrungs-

that has the actual iconographic characteristics of ūrdhvali ˙

ngādi. 

27 To interpret the word mūrtau  here \(above, ṇ 24 on p. 513\) in conformity with the commentary on the Gaṇakārikā was first suggested to me by Dr Gérard Colas.

being circumscribed by the knowledge of the five categories. The supreme guru is the lord Maheśvara, who empowers the former̥ 28

If we turn to the Svacchandatantra, describing the samayadīkṣā, we find the above interpretation confirmed. 

After he has performed the \(preliminary\) rites, he \[i.e. the guru\], rejoiced at heart, makes the pupil, whose eyes are full of joy, stand up and, taking him by his hand, leads him towards the ‘southern mūrti’: Having made a circle there into a seat

\(consisting\) of the syllable om  with the help of a flower, he places the pupil upon it, his body erect, his face turned to the north. After the guru has installed himself whilst facing east, he performs the sprinkling and subsequent rites. 29

The Dakṣiṇāmūrti

From the place of initiation where Śiva manifests himself to the novice for the first time in that He assumes the form of guru, we now proceed to the public domain of the temple. In that context the word mūrti  is used to refer to the

physical object of veneratioṇ This connotation underlies the T

. īkā’s description

of the daily worship of the initiated Pāśupata, who, after his bath in ashes, 

enters slowly the sanctum. Then he falls to his knees on a spot to the right of the image \( mūrtidakṣiṇe bh¯upradeśe\), makes an añjali  before his heart, and looks at

Śiva in the image as if He were there in His very person, and which means that, 

he, fully concentrated and with his head turned towards the north, practises japa with the aim of that \( viśeṣa\) detachment from the sensual world, after which japa he sinks into meditation on Śiva; only then \( eva\) he should burst into repeated boisterous laughter̥ 30

Analogous with the situation of initiation, the Pāśupata envisages Śiva in front

of him, this time, however, in the physical object of worship. It is towards this manifestation of God that the Pāśupata turns and in whom he is sunk, 

an idea we also find in the following passage of the Southern Recension of the Mahābhārata  where broad-minded Vāsudeva teaches. 

The holy man who has reached Me \(i.e. Vāsudeva\) fixes himself upon My

body \( mūrti\), or on Rudra’s Dakṣiṇ\(ā\)m¯urti, especially on the fourteenth \( tithi\). He, the great ascetic, while he is venerated by Siddhas, Brahmarṣis and celestial folk, and while his praises are sung by Gandharvas and choirs of Bhūtas, he of great splendour enters either Me or Śaṁkara. 31

We thus observe that the term mūrti  in the Pāśupata context on the one hand

refers to the ‘image’ \(meaning bodily manifestation\) and, on the other hand, when used in the locative \(or when the locative is meant\), refers to ‘a particular spot near the image’, that is not to the image itself. Both meanings are, as we will argue, comprehended by the technical term dakṣiṇām¯urti, literally ‘south-ward/rightward image/body/figure’. 

This term is explained by Kauṇḍinya

when he comments on Pāśupatasūtra 1.9: mahādevasya dakṣiṇām¯urteh. |

‘Of the God’ \(◦ devasya\) is a genitive. This is a syntactic feature that expresses the relationship of owner and property; it signifies possession/ grace \( parigraha\) only. 

‘Southern’ \( dakṣiṇā◦\) in the S¯utra is in the sense of a specific point of the compass. 

The sun divides the quarters and the quarters divide the mūrti. 

‘Image’ \( mūrti\): Either this \( yad etad\) form \( rūpa\) that is perceived by him who is

standing at the right side of God, his face turned north, in \(His\) proximity, a form that is characterised by the bull-banner, the lance in hand, Nandin, Mahākāla, 

erect phallus etc., or to which \( yad vā\) the laymen resorṭ 

The sanctuary is ‘of the Great God’ \( mahādevasya\). This is the answer \( iti\). 

There is the object to be worshipped. 32

hāsaṁpunaḥ punaḥ kuryāt |

The commentator rejects the view of some \( ity eke\) who say that he may burst into boisterous laughter as soon has he got to the temple, if his detachment has not ceased \( yady anivr̥ ttapratyāhāras tadā gatamātra eva hasitaṁkuryād ity eke\).

26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 517

For the initiated Pāśupata like Kauṇḍinya the term dakṣiṇām¯urti  thus seems rather to refer to a situation or state than to a particular ‘image’, namely the state in which God appears to him who sits or stands at His right side and sees Him in front of him \(for instance in the temple image\). It is the situation in which Śiva reveals himself ‘towards him who is at His right side’ \( dakṣiṇā\),33

namely, by turning His auspicious, gracious side towards him who is facing north—the sitting position of the novice since Vedic times. 

The strength of this tradition obviously rests on the religious idea of the right side. To turn one’s right side upon someone is an auspicious act; in the case of God it is an act of grace in which He reveals Himself and His doctrine

‘unto them on his right hand’. It happens to the blessed ones in His proximity, that is in heaven on the Himavat, and as such to the initiated Pāśupata in his

yoga  with God, who may be represented either by the image or by the guru. In sum, the Pāśupata Dakṣiṇām¯urti is a state in which God reveals one quarter of Himself, the form to which He grants access, i.e. yoga; it is Śiva’s figure of grace. 34

In spite of the use of the word mukha, used here in figurative sense, I think the Śvetāsvatara Upaniṣad 4.21 expresses this very idea:

‘Unborn is He’, so saying, Let a man in fear approach Him: O Rudra \[show\] thy right \[auspicious\] cheek, Protect me with it ever\! 35

In the direct vision that is granted to the Pāśupata the ideal image of Mahādeva

is visualized as being accompanied by his acolytes Nandin and Mahākāla, the

33 The adverbial daks

. ā, which

is the oia instrumental in ā  preserved in some adverbs. Wackernagel 1930, III § 41b ṣv. 

dákṣiṇa: ‘ dakṣiṇā́  zur rechten Seite.’ The phrase dakṣiṇāmūrtigrahan

tary ad  PS 1.9 shows that Kauṇd

. inya takes dakṣin

. āmūrteḥ  as a compound, altough he

does not explain iṭ However, his speaking of ‘eastern’, ‘northern’, and ‘western’ mūrtis

\(below, ṇ 34 on p. 517\) implies that he takes the compound as a Karmadhāraya. In the

gloss \(above, ṇ 32 on p. 516 f.\) he makes clear that ‘southern’ is to be understood as ‘at the right side of’ \( dakṣiṇe pārśve\). This is his explanation of the adverbial dakṣiṇā \(cf. 

below, ṇ 39 on p. 518\). 

34 In this way the daks

only one fourth of himself. r̥ V 10.90.3–4:

bull-banner etc., in short, a ‘tableau de la troupe’. 

The physical image in

the sacred compound is not defined. If our interpretation is correct, it may be any image, most often a liṅga, considered by the Pāśupata laymen as ‘the

image’ \( mūrti\) of Mahādeva, a designation that for the initiate is true only in metaphorical sense. 36

The definition of God’s figure of grace

The concept of dakṣiṇām¯urti  thus comprises the manifested form \( r¯upa\) of God, the \(physical\) image or body \( mūrti\) in which it may be envisaged, and

the right side \( dakṣiṇe pārśve\), which indicates the Pāśupata’s position with respect to Mahādeva and his embodimenṭ As such the term is applicable to every situation in which the Pāśupata enters into contact with his object of

worship. And this appears to have been the intention of the author of the Pāśupatasūtra when we read PS 1.8–9 coherently \(as also the author of the T

. īkā seems to have done: upahārasūtra, above, p. 514\): ‘He should worship with

offerings of laughter, singing, dancing, bellowing, obeisance, and muttering to the figure of grace \( dakṣiṇām¯urti\) of Mahādeva.’37 The same idea underlies the Ratnaṭīkā, where it says that the Pāśupata should consecrate the ashes with mantras in the temple ‘at Śiva’s Dakṣiṇām¯urti’,38 or the Skandapurāṇa when it advises that one should offer rice pudding with ghee at the ‘southern mūrti’

during one year in order to become like Nandiṇ 39

It seems obvious that the same idea underlies the initiation rite, in which the place of the physical image, i.e. the mūrti, may be taken by the guru who

36 This position conforms best with the view of images maintained in the Nyāya school, 

which is generally believed to have had close links with the Pāśupata. In Colas 2004, 163

this author describes Udayana’s point of view as follows: ‘The rite does not specifically invest the image with a divine presence or power through a mechanical process, but occasions the conscious reflection, by deities, of themselves as being present in the image.’

In other words, Śiva’s presence in the Dakṣiṇāmūrti is an act of grace \( parigraha\).

. ā-

mūrtim, in accordance with the Benares and Calcutta mss of the Sūtras and some

testimonies. See Bisschop 2006a, 5.

When the compound dakṣiṇāmūrti  is dissolved, dakṣiṇa  is taken as an adjective—

sometimes inflected nominally \(above\), sometimes pronominally \(e.g. Kauṇd

. inya ad  PS

1.1, quoted in ṇ 24 on p. 513\)—which shows again that we should read dakṣiṇāmūrti  as

a Karmadhāraya compound. However, when dissolved, the original use of the adverb dakṣiṇā́ \(= dakṣiṇena\) is ignored. 



26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 519

represents Śiva \(as the ācārya  represents Agni in the upanayana\). In fact, it appears most likely that the concept of dakṣiṇām¯urti  originated from this ritual in which Śiva as supreme teacher reveals himself. To this primordial figure—a god who is facing towards the east, but who confers his blessings, that is his ‘right’ side, on his creatures, be they gods, Siddhas, or worshippers in Bhāratavarṣa—the pseudo-Śaṁkara pays homage:

tasmai śrīgurumūrtaye nama idaṁśrīdakṣiṇām¯urtaye  k

This obeisance is to Him who has the form of the illustrious teacher, to the illustrious figure of grace. 40

The Dakṣiṇāmūrti and iconography

Having thus established the original meaning of Dakṣiṇām¯urti, we may proceed to its current iconographic denotatioṇ 

Among the earliest texts that describe the dakṣiṇām¯urti  in iconographic terms may be the two Upajāti verses that are quoted by Gopinatha Rao, which

he ascribed to the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa, but which are not found in the printed text of that name. 

His right \(lower\) hand shows the \( jñāna\) mudrā and in his \(right\) upper \(hand\)

he \(holds\) a white rosary; in his left \(lower hand\) he is holding a book comprising all the āgamas and more, and with his upper \(left hand\) he holds the cup with nectar̥ 

He is seated on a white lotus, his colour is white, powerful, with white cloth and ointment, and crowned by the crescent, teaching knowledge to the sages: that is what they call his Dakṣiṇām¯urti. 41

On this and other, predominantly late South-Indian texts Rao based his description, which was repeated without any significant change by almost all later indological writing on this subjecṭ It may be significant to note, though, that in the above passage the southern orientation of the image is not mentioned. 

To substantiate his view, however, Rao wrote:

One account gives an explanation regarding the etymology of this name; it states that because Śiva was seated **facing **south when he taught the r̥ishis y¯oga  and jñāna  he came to be known as Dakshiṇām¯urti. This aspect of Śiva is always invoked by students of science and arts. 42

hymn is doubtful, see Potter 1981, 317.

Hans Bakker

Unfortunately, however, we are not informed about this ‘account’, 43 but Rao, without any doubt, was following an Indian iconographic convention, which prescribes ‘that in all Hindu temples, both Śaiva and Vaishṇava, the niche on the south wall of the central shrine should have the figure of Dakshiṇām¯urti enshrined in it’. 44 Bruce Long, who devoted an article to the subject, relied heavily on Rao, but he put his finger on the problem, when he professed that he was puzzled, 

As to why the southern direction, which is believed almost everywhere in India to be sinister and inauspicious, should in this instance be evaluated as auspicious and benigṇ 

It is not beyond reason that we explain this curiously positive evaluation of the southern direction on the basis of the same religious principle by which the Furies in Greece came to be called the ‘Eumenides’, and Rudra, the ferocious Howler, came to be addressed as Śiva, the Auspicious. Perhaps the worshippers of Śiva hoped that by having the Divine Preceptor face the southern direction, that area would, thereby, lose its sinister qualities and become benigṇ 45

Although I shall not deny that considerations such as the above may have played some role, at least in coming to terms with the apparent incongruity once established, it is important to recognize that, if they played a role, they did so in retrospecṭ The cause of the alleged incongruity, I would like to argue, is a reorientation of the traditioṇ A cult concept was transposed to iconography. 

Part of the original meaning was retained—Śiva as the source of knowledge—

part of it was reinterpreted, namely, the direction God faces when expounding His wisdom: His ‘right side’ became his ‘southern face’. The southern temple walls were consequently thought most suitable for showing images of Śiva in his role of teacher̥ 46 Thus the dakṣiṇām¯urti  entered the textbooks of Indian architecture, for instance the Mayamata, which divided Kauṇḍinya’s vision into two. 

A chacun des paliers des temples il faut disposer aux points cardinaux des \(images des\) dieux. Au rez-de-chaussée on place à l’Est les deux guardiens de la porte, Nandi et Kāla; au Sud c’est la Dakṣiṇām¯urti, à l’Ouest Acyuta ou Liṅgasambh¯uta et au Nord Pitāmaha. 47

43 I could not find this ‘account’ in the texts at issue presented in Rao’s Appendix B \(II.2, pp. 137–146\). 

44 Rao 1914 II.1, p. 273. 

45 Long 1971, 69; ibid.  ṇ 1. 

46 Harle 1986, 301:

All the principal images of the Brahmanical pantheon are represented in South India during the Col.a period. There is a particular predilection for Bhikṣāṭana, Śiva as the naked young ascetic, and for Śiva as Dakṣiṇāmūrti, the expounder of yoga, music and

the śāstras, who is always, where possible, facing south \( dakṣiṇa  means ‘south’, and although there is no very convincing explanation of the name, it may account in part for the popularity of this image in South India\).

26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 521

The development of a cult concept into an iconic image Finally the question must be briefly addressed when and where this cult concept turned into an iconographic one. This development may actually have had two moments. 

1 An anthropomorphic \(iconic\) representation of Śiva who through attributes, a book for instance, a mudrā \( vitarka-, vyākhyāna-mudrā\), or some other

gesture, or because he sits alongside a pupil, is identifiable as the supreme teacher̥ This image, or at least Śiva as its main character, faces the easṭ 

2 An anthropomorphic representation of Śiva, two- or four-armed, with one or more of the attributes of \(1\), but whose main characteristic is that he is directed towards the south without showing the terrifying aspecṭ 

The transition of 1 to 2 calls forth the ‘incongruity’. 

This incongruity may be considered to have been solved when the image of the Dakṣiṇām¯urti began to evolve an autonomy of its own, next to and independent of that of Aghora/Bhairava. Given the fact that the central image in the garbhagr̥ha  is orientated towards the east, the image at the southern wall may be seen as an original ‘visualisation’ of the right side, expressing one aspect of the god enshrined, from whom it became spatially detached. Buddhist influences \(e.g. the deer at Śiva’s feet, the tree above his head\) are discernible in this process of iconographic compositioṇ 48

The genesis of the iconic representation of the teaching Śiva thus ended with his ‘banishment’ outside the cultic sphere. The idea of the guru as the locus \( sthāna\) or support of the divinity was transferred onto the central cult object in the sanctum, the liṅga. Therewith the Dakṣiṇām¯urti on the southern outer temple wall lost its original ritual setting. It became part of the iconographic programme of the Śiva temple. 

The process of transformation from cult concept into an iconic image seems to have been completed \(in South India at least\) by the tenth century \(i.e. 

the early Col.a period\), but may have started much earlier̥ An early textual testimony of this process is found in the Skandapurāṇa. 

It tells the myth

of Tilottamā that we discussed above, pp. 498 f. When the nymph bows to Śiva’s southern appearance \( dakṣiṇāṁmūrtiṁ\), the face of the guru of the

gods \( mukhaṁsuraguros\) emerged, ‘possessed of the colour of a languid cloud laden with water, having a ferocious voice, with dreadful teeth shining \(in an open mouth\), and the corners of the eyes bloodshot and glittering’ \(SP 62.18–

19\). The ‘incongruity’ is obviously not yet solved, since the description of this face suits the figure of Aghora/Bhairava, not that of the teacher or guru.

To assess the above-sketched develop-

ment properly requires an art-historical

scrutiny of the available archaeological

material examined for the above fea-

tures; this cannot be done here. Mate-

rial representing moment 2 is not hard to

find. A relatively early example dating

from the late Pallava period \(ad 875–

900\) is illustrated in Plate 114. It shows

a four armed Śiva as teacher on the outer

southern wall of the garbhagr̥ha  of the

Vīraṭṭāneśvara Temple in Tiruttaṇi. His

hands show the vitarkamudrā  combined

with rosary, abhayamudrā, book, and

lotus-stalk. 49

The question when and where exactly

this type of ‘southern image’ is found

for the first time is more difficult to es-

tablish, partly for the same reasons as

why the material representing moment

1 proves so hard to identify. It is often

difficult to establish which direction the

Plate 114

Tiruttan

teaching Śiva is facing, if the image or̥ i: Dakṣin

. āmūrti

relief is no longer part of a spatial con-

struction or has been reemployed. It may even be doubted, whether our moment 1 is an historic reality at all; possibly, the teaching Śiva, the Dakṣiṇām¯urti as an iconographic category, was from the beginning conceived of as facing the south. 

A Dakṣiṇām¯urti on a crossbar found in Nagarī

To conclude I wish to present an image that may alleviate our doubts somewhaṭ 

It concerns a crossbar found in Nagarī \(Rajasthan\) illustrated in Williams 1982, Pl. 216. On p. 140 f. this scholar gives the following descriptioṇ 

The most impressive carvings at Nagarī are the remains of a gigantic gateway or toraṇa  that must belong to the early sixth century on the basis of its relationship to works from Mandasor̥ 

The lintel has sculptures on both sides. The reliefs on what appears to be the reverse \(mistakenly said in op. ciṭ  141 to be illustrated in Pl. 216\) are identified by Williams as scenes from ‘the story of the encounter between Arjuna and the kirāta  or hunter’. After his fight with Śiva incognito, Arjuna receives the 49 Dumarçay & l’Hernault 1975, photo 54. Cf. Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture I, plate 77. For the few images classified as Dakṣiṇāmūrti found in Uttar Pradesh

see Singh 1976.

Pāśupata weapon, a scene that is unfortunately missing, but may have been depicted in a relief that belonged to the part of the crossbar that has broken off and is missing. 50

Plate 115

Nagarī: Crossbar of toraṇa

About the obverse side of the lintel \(Plate 115; see also below, Plates 141–142\) Williams observes:

The subjects of the \[obverse\] of this same crossbar remain to be identified. The third panel from the right \(not the center of the lintel\) \[below, Plate 154\] shows a seated figure with twisted locks in meditation, surrounded by four worshippers; despite the lack of the club, this might represent Lakulīśa. If so, the remaining scenes are presumably Śaiva. 51

50 The end of the story may be supplied as it is told in the Mahābhārata \(see also below, 

pp. 592 ff.\). Mahādeva reveals himself and Arjuna falls to his knees MBh 3.40.55–56: tato devaṁmahādevaṁgiriśaṁśūlapāṇinam |

dadarśa phalgunas tatra saha devyā mahādyutim  k 55 k

prasādayāmāsa haraṁpārthaḥ parapuraṁjayaḥ  k 56 k

Arjuna asks for forgiveness and receives a booṇ Arjuna asks for the terrible Pāśupata weapon

also called ‘Brahmaśiras’ \(MBh 3.41\):

kāmaye divyam astraṁtad ghoraṁpāśupataṁprabho  k 7 k

This is granted. Then Arjuna, purified, embraces the feet of the Lord and the latter says

‘learn’:

tac chrutvā tvaritaḥ pārthaḥ śucir bhūtvā samāhitaḥ |

upasaṁgr̥ hya viśveśam adhīṣveti ca so ’bravīt  k 17 k

Though the text omits it, we have to assume, after the above and in view of the other side of the lintel, that Arjuna takes his seat at the right side of the Lord. Then Śiva explains the secrets of the weapon:

In a letter \(e-mail ḍd. 10-3-2001\) Joanna Williams informed me that she ‘wonders whether the scene at the left end of this face \(below, Plates 145–146\) might not represent the destruction of Dakṣa’s sacrifice’. This proposition is further pursued in the present article, but an elaborate study of the crossbar by Bakker

& Bisschop 2016 intends to show that it is untenable after all. 52

Dakṣa’s sacrifice and his instruction in the Pāśupata observance The story of Śiva’s destruction of Dakṣa’s sacrifice is told in Mahābhārata 12

App. I No. 28 \(= Northern Recension\); it may be briefly recapitulated here. 

Vīrabhadra and Bhadrakālī etc. destroy Dakṣa’s sacrifice in Gaṅgādvāra. 

Dakṣa takes refuge with Maheśvara \(ll. 123 ff.\). Devadeveśa himself appears \(ll. 140 ff.\). Dakṣa begs him that not all his sacrificial toil may have been in vain \(l. 151\). This is granted by Hara. Then the text reads \(ll. 154 f.\): jānubhyām avanīṁgatvā dakṣo labdhvā bhavād varam |

nāmnām aṣṭasahasreṇa stutavān vr̥ṣabhadhvajam  k Dakṣa fell to his knees, having received \(this\) boon from Bhava. 

Then he praised Vr̥ṣabhadhvaja by his Thousand-and-eight Names. 

The stotra of Śiva’s thousand-and-eight names follows \(ll. 160–389\). Śiva expresses his satisfaction and promises Dakṣa that he will gain the benefit of thousand Aśvamedha and hundred Vājapeya sacrifices, thanks to his grace

\(ll. 390–94.\). Then Mahādeva bestows upon him another boon \(ll. 395–409\):

26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher

525

Long ago, O Dakṣa, the Pāśupata yoga  was created by me: that \( tat, scil. yoga\) is the eminent reward of properly practising that \( tasya, scil. vrata\), and that \( yoga\) shall be yours, O blessed one. Throw off the fever of \(your\) soul\! 

In other words: Mahādeva instructs/initiates Dakṣa in the Pāśupata observance; this is the boon that will lead him eventually to the end of suffering \( duḥ khānta\), the Pāśupata yoga  or union with God. 

In view of the material discussed in the present article, it is obvious to see in the first panel from the right on the lintel \(Plate 116; cf. Plate 156\) an example of a Dakṣiṇām¯urti. If we assume that the toraṇa  was facing east and that this is the obverse side of the lintel, Maheśvara, accompanied by his wife, 55 sits facing east, leaning towards the right, where his suppliant sits on his knees, facing north. 

This interpretation is corroborated by our later study of the crossbar̥ However, although the two panels to the left \(above, p. 524\) initially suggested that the suppliant in question might be King Dakṣa \(Bakker 2004c, 133\), there are good reasons to reconsider this interpretation and to see in the person who receives instruction, not Dakṣa, but Arjuna.56

Nagarī: a Dakṣiṇām¯urti

\(cf. MBh 13.17.18\). Yoga in the Pāśupata system is defined by Kauṇd

. inya ad  PS 1.1

as ‘union with god’: ucyate yogam | atra ātmeśvarasaṁyogo yogaḥ |

My interpretation

differs from that of Mertens 1998, 76 f., who assumes a conflation of concepts: ‘Im selben Satz wird das pāśupatavrata  als yoga  bezeichnet \(407\); die beiden Begriffe tapas  und yoga werden hier also synonym verwendeṭ Für bestimmte Schichten des Mahābhārata ist die

Vermischung beider Begriffe üblich.’ However, no examples from the MBh are adduced to corroborate this contentioṇ

It thus appears that the central theme of both sides of the crossbar is the acquisition of a Pāśupata good: the instruction in the Pāśupata observance

and the procurement of the Pāśupata weapoṇ The toraṇa  may have stood at

the entrance of a Pāśupata temple. The depiction of the instruction scene, the Dakṣiṇām¯urti or Śiva’s figure of grace, would therefore be appropriate, if our analysis is correcṭ 



## Thanesar, the Pāśupata Order and the Skandapurāṇa

Studies in the Skandapurāṇa IX

The tradition of the four pupils of Lāgud

. i

By the middle of the sixth century the city of Kanauj seems to have emerged as the capital of the rising dynasty of the Maukharis under its king Īśānavarmaṇ 1

This town, in the Sanskrit tradition named Kānyakubja/ Kanyakubja, is known

from the Skandapurāṇa, and from this text only, as the seat of one of the Pāśupata lineages. 

The Skandapurāṇa \(SPS 167.123–29\) informs us that the fourth pupil of Lāguḍi was a brahmacārin  who came from a distinguished family in the \(Land of the\) Kurus. 2 He received initiation in Kanyakubja and, as implied by SPS

167.130, established the fourth lineage of Pāśupata teachers there. 

Lāguḍi

bestowed on him \(and the other three pupils\) ‘**H**is own doctrine’ \(and\) yoga. 3

∗ The first version of this article was published in Journal of Indological Studies 19 \(2007\), 1–16. 

1 As far as I am aware, there exists no direct evidence for this statemenṭ 

There is

circumstantial evidence, though, which has led the majority of historians to accept it as the most plausible hypothesis. Tripathi 1964, 32–36; Majumdar in HCI III, 69 f.; Goyal 1967, 363; Thaplyal 1985, 19 f. Among this evidence is the clay seal-matrix, probably to be ascribed to Avantivarman, that was found in Kanauj \(Thaplyal 1985, 153\). The major argument for Kanauj being the Maukhari capital, at least at the time of Grahavarman, is based on the evidence of Bāṇa’s Harṣacarita \(see Tripathi 1964, 32–36\). 

2 We deduce from this evidence that the name of the fourth pupil was unknown to the composer of the SP, but that there was a living tradition that connected him with the Kurus or Kurukṣetra. In order to supply a name for the founder of this lineage, this tradition later invented the name Kauruṣya \(LiP 1.7.51, 1.24.131, ŚiP Śatarudrasaṁhitā

5.49\) or Kauruṣa \(see above, ṇ 16 on p. 287\).

Hans Bakker

The route along which the Pāśupata movement had reached the Land of the

Kurus may also be deduced from the Skandapurāṇa: 1\) Kārohaṇa \(where Śiva’s

incarnation took place\), 2\) Ujjayanī \(initiation of Kauśika\), 3\) Jambumārga

between Ujjayanī and Puṣkara \(initiation of Gārgya\), 4\) Mathurā \(initiation of Mitra\), 5\) Land of the Kurus, 6\) Kanyakubja \(initiation of the Kuru\). 4

The major city in the ‘Land of the Kurus’ in the 5th and 6th centuries was Thanesar̥ In his Harṣacarita Bāṇa depicts Thanesar \(Sthāṇvīśvara\) under \(the legendary\) King Puṣyabh¯uti as a country completely devoted to Maheśvara.5

It is therefore not impossible, at least it is suggested by the Skandapurāṇa, that

the Pāśupata movement had reached Kanauj from Gujarat via Kurukṣetra and had thus passed through Thanesar̥

that these four pupils have the right to initiate, i.e. that they are established as the founders of four lineages.

Some information about this ‘Kuru lineage’ seems to have survived the ages. The \(Jaina\) tradition—preserved in Guṇaratna’s \(fourteenth century\) commentary on the S

. ad

. darśanasamuccaya of Haribhadra \(ninth century\) and

Rājaśekharasūri’s S

. ad

. darśanasamuccaya \(fourteenth century\)—records the

first four names of the teachers in each of the four lineages that are said to derive from Lakulīśa. The fourth teacher, here named Kauruṣa, was succeeded by Manuṣyaka, Puṣpaka and Rāśīkara.6

Lāgud

. i

The idea of a guru with four pupils named Lāguḍi/Lākulin or Lakulīśa seems to

be an example of ‘invention of tradition’. Kauṇḍinya does not know a teacher \(incarnation\) by the name of Lakulīśa, but speaks only about the Lord \( bhagavat\) descending in Kāyāvataraṇa \(= Kārohaṇa\), who initiated only one pupil, Kuśika, in the city of Ujjayanī. 7 Nor does the name Lakulīśa, or any of its variants, occur in the Mathurā Pilaster Inscription of Candragupta II, Year 61. 8 It may have been coined in the fifth century to refer to the \(divine\) teacher who carried a club \( lagud

. a\), portrayed in several fifth-century images, and as such came to be attested in the Skandapurāṇa. 9

The apparently oldest image of an ithyphallic Śaiva teacher with a lakula resting against his left shoulder is accompanied by only two pupils and may date from the 5th century \(Plate 118\). 10

Plate 118

Mathurā: Lakulīśa with two pupils

In the first half of the 6th century images of Lakulīśa surrounded by four pupils began to appear, such as the one in the Yogeśvarī Cave near Bombay \(below, Plate 128\). 11

In short, at some stage in the process by which the Pāśupata movement

was gathering momentum, the avatāra  of Śiva/Paśupati received the name

Lāguḍi/Lākulin/Lakulīśa. It became an article of faith common to various traditions, on the one hand serving to account for the spread of several guru lineages that claimed to go back to Śiva’s incarnation and, on the other hand, uniting these into one coherent religious movemenṭ 

The Kuru lineage

Puṣpaka in the Kuru \(Kauruṣa\) lineage evokes the name of the \(alleged\) founder of the Paśupatinātha Temple in Nepal, Supuṣpa.12 It may also remind one of 11 Shah 1984, 98, Pl. 88. 

12 The foundation of this temple is credited to a \(legendary\) king of the Licchavi dynasty, named Supuṣpadeva in the \(corrupt\) Gopālarājavaṁśāvalī \(ff. 19v–20r\):

rājā śrīsupuṣpadeva varṣa 76  k tena hi nepālabhūmiś cāturvarṇakr̥ tā  k śrīpaśupati-

This Supuṣpa is also known from the genealogy of King Jayadeva, the same who recorded the name of his maternal grandfather, the Maukhari prince Bhogavarman \(see below, p. 538\): tasmāl licchavitaḥ pareṇa nr̥ patīn hitvā parān dvādaśa śrīmān puṣpaśarākr̥tih. 

kṣitipatir jātah. supuṣpas tatah. | \(Verma & Singh 1994, 238\). According to Slusser 1982, 227 this king is ‘alternately known as Paśuprekha \(he who has seen Paśupati\)’. A later \(equally legendary\) Licchavi king, Supuṣpavarman, is said in the Gopālarājavaṁśāvalī

to have renovated the temple of Paśupati:



27 / Thanesar, the Pāśupata Order and the Skandapurāṇa

531

Puṣyabh¯uti, a name spelled in some mss as Puṣpabh¯uti, the legendary founder of the dynasty of Thanesar to which King Harṣavardhana belongeḍ13

Puṣyabh¯uti is depicted in the Harṣacarita 3 \(pp. 49–55\) as being deeply involved in a Śaiva ritual of black magic \(Vetālasādhana\) in the cremation

ground \(Mahāśmaśāna\), under the guidance of a Mahāśaiva preceptor \( bhu-

vanaguru\) hailing from the South \( dākṣiṇātya\), Bhairavācārya.14 In this ritual the deity \( vāstunāga\) of the land \( janapada\) Śrīkaṇṭha, in which Sthāṇvīśvara \(Puṣyabh¯uti’s capital\) is situated,15 the Nāga Śrīkaṇṭha is conjured up by the

ācārya; 16 he is forced into submission by the king, who is about to kill him with the magic sword Aṭṭahāsa, a gift of Bhairavācārya. Then, when the king is prepared to let him go because of his brahminhood, a goddess dressed in white, evidently Lakṣmī \(Rājyaśrī\),17 emerges from the sword, annoints the king and grants Puṣyabh¯uti to become the founder of a mighty dynasty. This dynasty is therefore believed to have acquired its legitimicy and authority over the land of Kurukṣetra thanks to the magic of the Śaiva preceptor̥18

connect the branch of Pāśupata teachers with names ending in ◦ rāśi  to this

Rāśīkara, and it might perhaps be not too far-fetched to imagine that, by the time that the SP was composed, Kanauj/Kanyakubja possessed a Pāśupata

Maṭha of the Rāśi branch, which derived its authority from a paramparā  that was conceived of as going straight back to Lakulīśa through the guru who came from Kurukṣetra.20

Rāśi ascetics and ‘His own doctrine’

Rāśi ascetics are known from inscriptions to have been living in various places. 

The first epigraphical attestation \(c. ad 600\) is that of an ascetic called Udbhavarāśi, said to be a Rudra, in an inscription from the Gandharveśvara Temple in Sirpur \(Śrīpura\) of the time of King Mahāśivagupta Bālārjuna, who

ruled from c. ad 590 to 650.21 This Udbhavarāśi Rudra, called ‘an ocean for the streams of his own doctrine’, might have reached Dakṣiṇa Kosala in the train of Bālārjuna’s mother Vāsaṭā, who was a Maukhari princess, daughter of

Sūryavarman, and who had come from Kanyakubja to Śrīpura as the wife of the Pāṇḍuvaṁśi prince Harṣagupta in the last quarter of the sixth century.22

rāśīkarāntāṁś ca tīrthakarān anukrameṇa yathāvad bhaktyā namaskuryāt tad anu pra-

dakṣiṇam ekam iti |

20 The Skandapurāṇa \(SPBh 162.45\) refers to Śiva as rāśividāṁvaraḥ , ‘Best of the As-

trologers’, or a reference to the Rāśi ascetics? In this connection attention should be

drawn to a passage in the Skandapurāṇa, SP 32.103–110. It tells us that the gods out

of fear for Kālakarn

.ī, a personification of death, dive into a heap \( rāśi\) of ashes \( bha-

sman\), due to which they become Pāśupatas and enjoy the protection of Śiva. Could

this myth reflect the initiation rite in which the novice takes his first bath in a heap of ashes \( bhasmarāśi\) and receives a sectarian name ending in rāśi? \(this was suggested

to me by Peter Bisschop\).

There \(i.e. in Śrīpura\) arose Udbhavarāśi, a Rudra, the one who is an ocean for the

streams of his own doctrine, whose pure splendour/ash was illuminated by the light of his asceticism, and who satisfies the people with the nectar of his speech. 

I take ‘Rudra’ as a title, which, on the one hand, may be connected to the doctrine, attested in the Malhar \(Junvānī\) Plates of Mahāśivagupta, Year 57 \(l. 15; above, p. 290\), 

which acknowledges a lineage of sixty-six Rudras \(embodiments on earth of Gahaneśa, the Rudra who, in Śaiva cosmology, reigns the ‘net of bonds’ \( pāśajāla\)\), on the other

hand, with a development within the Pāśupata fold of a Bhairava tradition, to which

the ‘Rudra’ teachers in particular belong \(see above, p. 292, and below, ṇ 22 on p. 532\). 

22 Bakker 1994b, 14 ff. \(above, p. 252 f.\). 

Another early attestation of a Rāśi ascetic is

found in the Indragarh Stone Inscription of VS 767 \(ad 710/11\) found in the Mandasor District, which records the erection of a Śiva temple, Guheśvara, by a Pāśupata named

Dānarāśi. He is said to be a disciple of the Pāśupata ācārya  Vinītarāśi, the foremost

of the Rudra Śr̥ṅkhalikas \( rudraśr̥ṅkhalikāgraṇīh. \) \(JBRS XLI \(1955\), 260 vv. 5–7\). To mention one more instance of Rāśi ascetics in the kingdom of Kanauj, we may refer

to the stone inscription found in Sirsa \(Haryana\) of the time of the Pratīhāra king of

Kanauj, Bhojadeva \(middle of the ninth century\), which features the name of Ratnarāśi:

ratnarāśis tapomayapāśupatāgran

533

Although, admittedly, ‘his own doctrine’ \( svasiddhānta\) would normally be

taken to mean ‘the doctrine of/adhered to by Udbhavarāśi’, it may be signif-

icant to note that SPS 167.129–30 refers to the Pañcārtha doctrine imparted

by Lāguḍi to his disciples as ‘His own doctrine’: svasiddhānta \(above, ṇ 3 on p. 527\). Possibly the phrase ‘his own doctrine’ within this lineage was a shib-boleth, a denomination signifying ‘**H**is own doctrine’, thereby claiming that the doctrine was the only true one, revealed directly by Lord Lāguḍi himself. 

The phrase ‘an ocean for the streams of his own doctrine’ makes sense, if the

‘ocean’, i.e. the ascetic, is conceived a receptacle of the streams that make up the Pāśupata/Pañcārtha traditioṇ We will come across another Pāśupata

ascetic who was devoted to ‘his own doctrine’ below, \(p. 539\).

It is obvious that the Skandapurāṇa is an important source for reconstructing

the history of the Pāśupata movement, a text composed during the second

half of the 6th and first half of the 7th century. 23 The holy town of Vārāṇasī

plays an important role in this text and its Vārāṇasīmāhātmya shows detailed

knowledge of the local situatioṇ It is the only holy place that is eulogized in much detail and at great length. 24 The Māhātmya describes a kṣetra  that seems

to correlate with the historic situation in the late Gupta and early medieval period. The sanctuary of Avimukteśvara takes centre stage. Around it are said to be twelve liṅgas  of lesser importance \(above, p. 471; Figure 12\), none of which is known from seals. 

The Skandapurāṇa testifies to the establishment of a Pāśupata community of

ascetics and ācāryas  in Vārāṇasī, who may well have been in charge of most of

the sanctuaries described in the texṭ Being united in the kingdom of Kanauj by the time the SP was composed, 25 the Vārāṇasī Pāśupatas entertained probably

manifold relations with their brethren in Kanyakubja. This sectarian affiliation may partly explain why, with the exception of Avimukteśvara, the tīrthas mentioned in the SP do not feature in other sources, before their inclusion in the Tīrthavivecanakāṇd

. a of Lakṣmīdhara who, by quoting the Skandapurāṇa,

24 See Introduction to SP II A. 

25 Being so near to their homeland in Baghelkhand, Vārāṇasī may have been part of the

Maukhari territories from the moment that these kings began to assert themselves in the Ga ˙

ngā Valley, that is during the course of the first half of the 6th century. The three inscriptions of the Maukhari kings were found within a circle of 220 km around Vārāṇasī: in Shankarpur, 200 km SW \(Harivarman\), Jaunpur, 52 km NW \(ascribed to

Iśvaravarman, but probably of ¯

Iśānavarman or one of his successors\), Haraha, 220 km

canonized them, so to speak. 26 The spread of the Pāśupata order itself towards

the east, to Vārāṇasī and Magadhā, may have taken off from Kanyakubja earlier, during the period when North India was united in the Gupta kingdom. 

In view of the learned tradition of the town, duly observed, for instance, by Xuanzang, it has a certain probability per se that the Skandapurāṇa was

composed either in Vārāṇasī, or in a \(Pāśupata\) centre that had close contacts with this city. If the above dating is correct, the text was composed under the rule of either the Maukharis or Harṣavardhana of Kanauj \(see below, pp. 601 ff.\). 

The Māhātmya of Sthāneśvara

The historic relations between the Pāśupatas of Vārāṇasī and those in Kanauj

and Thanesar at the time of its composition also seem to emerge from the Skandapurāṇa itself. It might be significant in this respect that—after a brief inter-mezzo \(SP 31.15–47\) in which Śiva makes Mount Mandara his House \(named Vr̥ṣan\) and the question arises why, after having first made Yaj˜na in the form of a cloud his vehicle, he has exchanged him for Vr̥ṣa, the bull \(which again is a prelude to the myth of the destruction of Dakṣa’s sacrifice told in SP 32\)—

the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya is followed by a section \(SP 31.48–115\) that tells the mythology related to and the Māhātmya of Sthāneśvara. 27

This mythology relates that the Śaiva sage Dadhīca \(son of Cyavana, grandson of Bhr̥gu\), whose āśrama  is on the Sarasvatī River, defeats his Vaiṣṇava rival Kṣupa with Śiva’s help.28 To commemorate this victory the site \( sthāna\) named ‘Sthāneśvara’ is established, one krośa  in circumference, full of flowers

\( puṣpa\) and creeperṣ29 It is evident that the foundation myth of Sthāneśvara, i.e. Thanesar, is told. 

26 TVK pp. 130–135. An exception is Svarlīna, which had passed into the hands of ācāryas

of the Śaivasiddhānta, at least by the 12th century. One of its incumbents left us an inscription \(the National Museum Kathamandhu Stone Inscription of NS 264 \(ad 1144\), edited in Acharya 1997\), in which an ācārya Rudraśiva reports, among other things, 

that he initiated several princes in Nepal. See SP II A, 72 ff., SP 29.28. The modern Svarlīneśvara Mandir is situated at Prahlāda Ghāṭ in the north of Benares \(A 11/29\). 

27 This Māhātmya is intricately positioned between the prelude to the Dakṣa myth \(SP

31.15–47\) and this myth itself \(SP 32\); see SP II B, 27. It provides the cause \( kāraṇa, 

SP 31.49\) of Śiva’s victory over all the gods in the Dakṣa myth. This cause is the boon asked by Dadhīca after his victory over the Vaiṣṇava Kṣupa: bhagavan yadi tuṣṭo ’si yadi deyo varaś ca me | icchāmi viṣṇunā sārdhaṁsarvān devāṁs tvayā jitān  k 31.101 k

28 The fight \( vaira\) between Dadhīca and Kṣupa, who argue about the superiority of either the brahman  or the kṣatra  principle, resembles in many respects that between Vasiṣṭha and Viś

vāmitra, whose āśramas  are also said to be in Sthāṇutīrtha \(MBh 9.41.4\). MBh

3.81.163–64 locates Dadhīca’s āśrama  in Kurukṣetra, where also the Sthāṇuvaṭa is said to be \(MBh 3.81.54\).

Dadhīca’s own āśrama  is here called

‘Sthāṇutīrtha’, where the famous

Sthāṇuvaṭa is said to stand,30 both

already known from the Mahābhā-

rata. 

Sthāṇutīrtha is said to have

been established by Lord Sthāṇu

\(MBh 9.41.6\) and is the place cred-

ited in the Mahābhārata with the

birth of Skanda and his consecration

\( abhiṣeka\) as senāpati.31

In MBh

9.43.51 this place is defined as sit-

uated on the Sarasvatī in Samanta-

pañcaka \(= Kurukṣetra\). 

As has

been noted in the Prolegomena of

SP I \(p. 26\), one of the few direct

borrowings from the Mahābhārata by

the Skandapurāṇa is this description

of Skanda’s consecration in Samanta-

Thanesar: the Sthāṇuvaṭa

Bāṇa’s relationship with Dadhīca, the founder of Sthāneśvara

The Māhātmya in the Skandapurāṇa thus reformulates the significance of

Sthāṇutīrtha and adds to its glory the newly established site Sthāneśvara. In his Harṣacarita Bāṇa ingeniously adapted this mythological complex by linking his own descent to Dadhīca, when he made the latter’s son \(by his divine wife Sarasvatī\), viz. Sārasvata, the foster brother of another scion of the Bhārgava

lineage, namely Vatsa; Vatsa again is the ancestor of the Vātsyāyanas to whom

the author of the Harṣacarita belongs on his own account \(see Figure 13\). When he embroidered on the story of Dadhīca’s mother Sukanyā, told in Mahābhārata

3.121–25, Bāṇa and his audience may have been aware of the mythology that attributed the foundation of Harṣa’s native city Thanesar to Dadhīca as told in the Skandapurāṇa. 33 It may actually have been the very reason why he gave 30 SP 31.109–10:

34 The pedigree constructed by Bāṇa not only links the Vātsyāyanas to the collateral

Bhārgava branch of Dadhīca, it seems also to have a geo-political dimension in that it connects two regions: the one along the Sarasvatī and the one along the Śoṇa River̥ The

Puṣyabhūtis belonged to the former area, the Maukharis to the latter̥ Bāṇa’s hero Harṣa

united both regions within his kingdom. Cf. HC\* 4 \(p. 244\), where the wise brahmin Gambhīra says to Harṣa’s brother-in-law Grahavarman, when the latter is about to enter the house of his bride Rājyaśrī:

The Skandapurāṇa reaches Nepal

It has been argued by Yokochi in the Introduction to SP III, taken up in Bakker 2014, 137 f., that a major new redaction of our text, the ancestor of the RA recension, came into being in the ninth century. 35

It is likely that before this major new redaction took place the Skandapurāṇa had reached Nepal, where it became our S recensioṇ This so-called S or ‘Nepalese recension’ has a few particularities of its owṇ 

The end of

chapter 167 in this recension features two remarkable passages in what is in all probability an accretion to the original text \(SPS 167.163–187\), two passages that may betray the background against which this recension S came into being: in one it is said that there are eight places in the country of Magadhā

where Laguḍīśvara \(Lakulīśa\) roamed about together with his pupils \(cf. below, p. 564\), and in the other, at the end of this interpolation, Paśupati in Nepāla

is mentioned together with another sanctuary called Naikatuṅgādhipeśvara, 

which calls forth associations with the king of Nepal, the lord supreme of many mountain peaks/thrones. 36 Could it be that there is a nexus that links both additions to the original text? 

It has been argued by Yokochi that this interpolation in what would eventually develop into our ‘Nepalese recension’ was made ‘in an early text of the S

recension in northeastern India before it bifurcated and came to be transmitted to Nepal’. 37 Since the earliest transmission to Nepal relates to an ancestor of our ms S , this transmission must, according to Yokochi’s theory, have taken 1

place before ad 700.38

We know of a formal exchange between North India and Nepal in the decades before ad 700, namely when the grand-daughter \( dauhitrī\) of the Later–Gupta 35 As noted in Bakker 2014, 138 ṇ 425 this is ‘a slight modification of the date proposed for this redaction in the Introduction to SP II A, p. 54, where we had argued that it may have taken place in the eighth, possibly first half of the ninth century’. The earlier date featured also in the original version of the present article, published in 2007.

king ādityasena of Magadhā \(3rd quarter 7th cenṭ\), Vatsadevī, married the

Licchavi king of Nepal, Śivadeva II, father of Jayadeva. This Jayadeva and his Indian mother recorded this fact in their Paśupati Temple Inscription, 

\[Aṁśuvarman\] Saṁvat 157 \(ad 732\). 39

Vatsadevī was the daughter of a Maukhari prince, called Bhogavarman \(see Figure 14\). 40 The inscription, ipso facto, proves that the family of the Maukharis outlived the reign of Harṣa, in one way or the other̥ If our conjecture above is right and the composition of the SP was begun under the Maukharis of Kanauj, it is conceivable that the princess, or someone in her entourage, took this text to Nepal as part of the Maukhari heirloom. And her Magadhā

background was also not forgotten, as the interpolation shows.

539

The Later Guptas of Magadhā, from whose family the princess stemmed, were

well familiar with the Pāśupata traditioṇ 41

This follows from an inscrip-

tion of the time of another grandchild of ādityasena \(Vatsadevī’s cousin\), the

Later–Gupta king Viṣṇugupta. In this inscription we are told that the pilgrim Avimuktajja \(Skṭ Avimuktārya\), 42 who had visited numerous Śaiva holy places

inhabited by Siddhas \( anekaśivasiddhāyatana◦\), was devoted to ‘his own doc-

trine’ \( svasiddhāntābhirata\). 43 It is therefore possible, even likely, that one or more Pāśupata teachers from Magadhā had traveled to Nepal, some of whom

may have reached it in the company of the Later–Gupta princess. 44

When the Skandapurāṇa text was thus brought to Nepal, it had undergone

the two additions quoted above, \(ṇ 36 on p. 537 f.\) as part of a wider interpolation, in order to make good for what were, in the eyes of its conveyers and receivers, two neglected issues: the authenticity of the Pāśupata tradition

within Magadhā, now said to have been founded by Lakulīśa himself, and the prominence of the holy state sanctuary of Nepal, Paśupatinātha. 

Matrimonial alliances and the spread of culture

Historians are used to judge royal matrimonial alliances by their political implications. If our reconstruction holds any water, the cultural implications may also have been significant and may have had a more lasting effect than the political ones. Next to their husbands, princesses on their way to the residences of their grooms were accompanied by a cortège of ladies-in-waiting and dignitaries of all sorts. Among these there may have been religious virtuosi and literati, who, in the train of the two newlywed queens, Vāsaṭā and Vatsadevī, brought

the Pāśupata order to Dakṣiṇa Kosala and the Skandapurāṇa to Nepal. 

41 A post-Gupta Lakulīśa image was found in Benisagar, southeastern Bihar \(Panigrahi 1956, 3\). Other Lakulīśa images in Bihar are reported in Mitra 1984, 116, ṇ 16.

handed over to the Pāśupata ācāryas  the village of Vaidya as an agrahāra  settlement for

the maintenance of the temple \( devakula\) of Śivadeveśvara Bhaṭṭāraka, which the king had built himself.

## The Gospel of Kauṇḍinya

The Descent of God in Gujarat and the Practice of Imitating God Kauṇd

. inya’s Pañcārthabhāṣya

Kuśika and the divine revelation

When we speak of the gospel of Kauṇḍinya, we call forth an association with texts which describe the birth, life, and deeds of a saviour, texts which are meant to bring good news, an evangelium, into the world. This evocation is deliberate. As a tribute to Jan Bremmer’s life-long engagement, scholarly and otherwise, with gospels and kindred texts that have just failed to reach that status, I would like to show, that a text called ‘The Five Topics’, Pañcārtha, 

which has the form of a commentary \( bhāṣya\) on the S¯utras of the Pāśupata

school \(the Pāśupatasūtras \(PS\)\), resembles a gospel in many respects. Not

only by the dramatic facts which it professes to report, but also by its apodictic style, and its pretence to communicate a divine revelation, presenting a unique path \( sādhana\), which alone is able to promise and deliver hope and salvation to the faithful. Its author, Kauṇḍinya, who may have lived in the 4th century ad, puts himself in the lineage of preceptors that descends directly from the divine teacher’s first disciple, Kuśika. 1

It is generally accepted that this Kuśika has been a historic person, who may have lived in the 2nd century ad. He is mentioned by name as the fountainhead of a lineage of ten teachers in the Mathurā Pilaster Inscription of Candragupta

II, Year 61 \(i.e. ad 380/81, or ad 388, according to Falk 2004, 173\).2 Kauṇḍinya describes how and why this Kuśika came to be elected to receive and spread the divine word. He begins by defining the nature of God. 

And accordingly, since His nature is play \( krīd

. ā\) . . . \(it is certain that\) the activity

of God is springing from play. And \(His\) activity, insomuch as this consists in proclaiming the doctrine, is for the sake of bestowing favour \( anugraha\). \(Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 1.1\)

Hans Bakker

The emphasis Kauṇḍinya lays upon the true nature of God as play is to safeguard His sovereignty, His omnipotence \( prabhutva\). This nature of God, here defined for the first time, will remain an integral feature of nearly all Hindu conceptions of god, and we will meet it again below in this essay. Bestowing favour is God’s free choice, not induced by anything outside Him. His absolute freedom is without beginning and end, but, in order to fulfil His wish, He takes birth. 

So, on account of His ability to do whatever He wishes, and His being unborn, God, having taken upon Him a body of a brahmin, has descended in Kāyāvataraṇa in

human form. And He has reached Ujjayanī by fooṭ How do we know that? \(We know that\) on account of the authoritativeness of learned persons \( śiṣṭa\), and

because we \(still\) see and hear the proofs thereof. \(Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 1.1; above, ṇ 7 on p. 529\)

This event is of a completely different nature as the mythic avatāra  stories that

we know from the Vaiṣṇava religioṇ Its measure is human and it has a ring of historicity. Imagine Viṣṇu’s descent as the Boar or the Tortoise, going on foot from one historical site to another, a distance of 290 km as the divine aerial chariot \( vimāna\) flies\! 

Kauṇḍinya continues by telling that this divine brahmin smeared himselves with ashes and selected a sanctuary in Ujjain as his place of residence. Unfortunately the name of the sanctuary is not mentioned and the later tradition of the Skandapurāṇa locates this residence in the cremation ground \( śmaśāna\) of

Ujjaiṇ 

Thereupon Lord Kuśika arrived, impelled by God; he saw the signs of perfection, such as complete contentment, in the preceptor and the opposites thereof in himself; falling at his feet he informed him properly about his caste, gotra, Vedic affiliation, and his being free of debts; then, at an appropiate moment, \(this\) pupil, who was like a patient, consulted the preceptor, who had bided his time, and who was the doctor as it were: ‘Lord, is there a remedy that is effective and final for all those pains which fate, the world and we ourself afflict upon us, or not?’

\(Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 1.1\)

On this pertinent question, the holy brahmin, the incarnation of God, said: atha, ‘well’. Kauṇḍinya explains:

Here the word ‘well’ relates to what earlier had happened. In what way \[a student may ask\] ? He has said ‘well’ in relation to the earlier question put by the pupil. 

Thus this word atha \(‘well’\) signifies the answer to what has been asked: that end to suffering \( duḥ khānta\) does exisṭ \(Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 1.1\)

‘Well’ is the opening word of the gospel, being the first word of the first Sūtra. 

It is followed by the word ataḥ , for which see above, p. 513. Then follows the word paśupateḥ , ‘of Paśupati’, i.e. ‘of God’. This expression Kauṇḍinya takes as the answer to a further question: ‘due to what is this “being without suffering” 

reached?’ It is reached, Kauṇḍinya preaches, due to the grace \( prasāda\) of God, which initiates union \( yoga\) with Him.

That \(union\), \(according to some\), comes about by the act of one only—as in the case of a post and the falcon—because it is \(said to be\) effected by meditation, study etc. of a human being \( puruṣa\). \[However, we believe that\] it comes about by the act of both—as in the case of \(two fighting\) rams. \(Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 1.1\) This mystical union, therefore, lies not entirely in the hands of the aspiranṭ 

The difference, Kauṇḍinya observes, between his and other salvation doctrines is precisely this: only Śiva’s grace saves. In order that man may receive it, God has descended in an act of mercy and taught the doctrine as worded in the Pāśupatasūtras. In biblical terms: ‘And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth’ \(John 1:14\). These Sūtras are therefore

seen as divine revelation and Kauṇḍinya’s task it is to proclaim and explain them, that is, like Kuśika before him, to bring the good news. 

When its

contents is fully understood and put into praxis \( viddhi\), the believer becomes qualified \( adhikārakr̥tatva\) to receive that grace, which is concomittant with the removal of his separation \( viyoga\) from God. United with God he shares in His omniscience and omnipotence, and all his suffering comes to an end. He experiences, in Byzantine terms, theˆ

osis \(

\). 

The power of the word

Intrinsically connected with the soteriological claim of the Pāśupata faith is the

tradition that the holy word is passed down a lineage of accomplished teachers, who all, at the moment that they divulge the truth in the appropriate ritual setting, impersonate the divine incarnation, a doctrine not altogether different from Jesus’ message to his apostles: ‘For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you’ \(Matthew 10:20\). 

However, in my view the Indian type of religion, to which the Pāśupata

faith belongs, pushes this idea further than Catholicism, notwithstanding the Fourth Lateran Council and that of Trent on the Eucharist, and this has to do with its concept of primordial sound \( śabda\). Despite some similarity, but

essentially unlike the evangelist John’s logos, the revealed word, or rather its sound, is conceived of as an embodiment of divine power that has, we could say, the magic potency to actualize or reify the divine and to deify those by whose mouths it is pronounced. This feature of the Indian religions, the idea of śabdabrahman, is the legacy of the Vedic brahmins. It has given rise to much hocus-pocus, on the one hand, and to sublime monuments of spirituality on the other̥ 3

At the same time, this magic potency accounts for the fact that the revelation is not thought to be meant for everybody’s ears. After pronouncing the word 3 As an instance of the former I see the doctrine of the school of the Śaiva Siddhānta, 

which assumes that final release may be obtained through the ritual of initiation, in which the bodily and mental flaws are articulated and magically \(i.e. through mantras\) collected on a rope in order to be burnt in the sacrificial fire. As an example of the latter may pass Kashmir Saivism, which culminates in the work of the intellectual giant Abhinavagupta.

‘well’ and promising to reveal the divine doctrine, the teacher performs the initiation ceremony of the pupil, who has to take off all his worldly insignia \(above, p. 513\). From now on he should go naked or with a loincloth only, smeared with ashes, and without any personal belongings. Only then the teacher will impart the revelatioṇ This divides the community of Śiva worshippers \(Māheśvaras\)

into two, just as in Buddhism—which seems to have been a major source of inspiration to the Pāśupatas anyway: the laymen \( laukikas\), whose task it is to gather merit by supporting the order of initiates and by worshipping God in the temple, and the elite group of consecrated ascetics. Only these ascetics are entitled to practise in order to obtain union \( yogavidhi\), which is the main subject of the subsequent Sūtras. 

The Pāśupata praxis

The imitatio dei

When we have thus seen the lofty religious ideals promulgated by Kauṇḍinya’s gospel, we may be in for a surprise, when we learn more about the specific practices by which these were believed to be realised. On the whole, these practices can be described as an ever steeper staircase to complete effacement of the phenomenal self. In this respect Kauṇḍinya shares many of the ascetic aims and practices that are known from other Indian religions. In all ascetic movements, whether in India or abroad, self-mortification serves to destroy the ego in the expectation that it makes one more susceptible to the divine. In the brahmanical tradition this is generally seen as the unveiling of a true Self, which is itself thought to be godlike. The Pāśupata doctrine is no exception to

this. 

The first of five ‘steps of ascension into God’ \( gradus ascensionis in Deum\), to paraphrase Bonaventura, 4 requires that the initiated ascetic identifies himself with the deity of his devotion by imitating him, an imitatio dei  that is enacted in the liturgy within the temple. This concerns some aspects of Śiva that are known from the corpus of mythological Sanskrit texts, and this mythology clearly informs the conduct of the ascetic. In this corpus of mythology Śiva often appears as a trickster god, whose loud laughter \( aṭṭahāsa\) puts his subjects, including his wife, in their proper place. 

But there is another side of Śiva, more ancient, going directly back to the Vedic form of him as Rudra, namely his association with cattle and the bull in particular̥ Paśupati, though in Kauṇḍinya’s gospel used as a metaphor for 4 Bonaventura, Itinerarium mentis in Deum, 1.5–6. The five steps in the career of the Pāśupata ascetic are: 1\) living within the precincts of a sanctuary and worshipping Śiva, 2\) moving about and seeking dishonour, 3\) retreating within a lonely place for meditation, 4\) living in the cremation ground until death, 5\) the end of suffering through God’s grace.

‘Lord \( pati\) of the bound human soul’ \( paśu\), literally means ‘Lord of Cattle

\( paśu\)’. This is a god of nature and fertility, powerful and terrifying, who joined in with the indigenous phallus cult, which sophisticated brahminical thinking transformed eventually into the abstract liṅga. In this aspect, Śiva is associated with the bull, nay, he is the bull. This aspect of his character explains the, at first sight, puzzling injunction in the Pāśupatasūtras where

it says, that the initiate should offer, along with laughter, the sound hud

. um

. 

\(PS 1.8\). Kauṇḍinya explains: ‘The word huḍuṁ: the auspicious noise which

resembles that of a bull and which originates from holding the tip of the tongue against the palate, that is what \(is meant\).’ 5

Just as serious is Śiva’s role as fons et origo  of the fine arts, in particular of music and dance. 6 One of the Hindu gods best known to Western audiences is probably Śiva, king of the dance \( naṭarāja\). A God who himself dances and sings, then we have really left the world of the Abrahamic religions\! The imitatio dei practice of the aspirant consists in laughing loudly, bellowing, and singing and dancing in trance at the right side of the cult image in the sanctum in worship of God. 7 How could one worship Him better than by mimesis? 

The temple worship of the initiated ascetic ends with complete absorption in God by the constant muttering of a prayer \( japya\), which, seen as a mantra, is, as we have observed above, to be conceived of as His quintessence actualized in the form of sound. This prayer runs:

I resort to the Eternal, Primordial One, Who is Unborn \( sadyojāta\), glory, glory

to the Eternal, Primordial One, Who is Unborn\! 

In existence after existence, not in too many existences, You should be merciful to me, You from Whom existence springs. 8

The seeking of dishonour

Although the initiate ‘looses himself’, so to speak, in his mimetic worship, this is a temporary state. For the second stage of the ascetic’s career Kauṇḍinya prescribes a behaviour that deepens the effacement of the person by a process of self-mortification that goes further than most of the rivalling practices.

This verse \(Anuṣṭubh\) corresponds to Taittirīya āraṇyaka 10.43. It has some variants

\(see Bisschop 2006a, 7 f.\), the most important of which is the reading bhavasva  instead of bhajasva. The Mahā-Nārāyaṇa Upaniṣad 17.1 \(Varenne 1960, 277–78\) reads bhavasva. 

This verse is translated by Varenne 1960, 71, with a little too much Cartesian flavour, as: ‘Je cherge refuge auprès du nouveau-né; hommage au nouveau-né\! Hommage\! Je suis\! Je suis\! Je n’excelle pas\! Sois pour moi\! Hommage à celui qui est l’origine de l’existence\!’

refer to the notorious doctrine of seeking dishonour \( avamāna\). To initiate

its discussion in his commentary on PS 3.3, reading ‘despised’ \( avamataḥ \), 

Kauṇḍinya quotes two verses which are in slightly modified form known from older sources, the Mahābhārata \(12.222.20–21\) and the Manusmr̥ti \(2.162–

163\). 

The wise brahmin should seek dishonour as if it were ambrosia and he should always beware of honour as if it were poisoṇ For, while being despised, he rests in happiness, excluded from all society; a sage should not think of the faults of the other, \(but\) always of his own evil. \(Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 3.3\) Kauṇḍinya’s quotation of older sources in this context and the fact that this stage of the path to salvation dealing with dishonour disappears soon from the repertoire of Śaiva soteriologial texts seem to indicate that we are here concerned with an archaic practice accommodated to the early Pāśupata move-

menṭ 9 The practice involves that the aspirant seeks dishonour when, in public and without making himself known as a Pāśupata ascetic, 

He should go about as a mad man, who snores, trembles, limps, leches, and acts and speaks improperly, so that he may come to be ill-treated. For a wise man, being ill-treated, accomplishes thereby all asceticism. \(PS 3.11–19\) 10

It is to the credit of Daniel Ingalls to have put this weird doctrine into a wider perspective by pointing out its similarity with the practice of dishonour \(

\)

of the Greek Cynics, in an article that appeared in the Harvard Theological Review in 1962, but which remained largely unknown outside a select group of indologists. As Ingalls points out, 

Diogenes’ \[‘the Dog’ \(

\)\] favourite method of attracting attention and oppro-

brium, if we are to believe the anecdotes, was by performing in public those acts of nature which should remain hidden: spitting, defecation, and the act of sex. 

By means of public censure the Cynics sought to attain hardness, apathy and freedom. 11

And we could go further along the path pointed out by Ingalls. I trust that the reader allows me to take him on a little excursus into the Realm of the Holy Fools, a realm explored most recently in a thesis by Jan Hofstra \(2008\). 

Fools through the Ages

A letter of Paul to the Corinthiers is often seen as a point of departure of this phenomenon in Christianity:

9 Oberlies 2000 points out that this practice, as part of the wider context of the brahmodya, is already attested in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 2.3.9.9 and that an influence of Cynicism

as argued by Ingalls \(see below, p. 554\) is very unlikely. Cf. Acharya 2013. In Bakker 2011 \(below, p. 553 ff.\) I argue that the Pāśupata doctrine, practice and iconography

\(Lakulīśa\) are to be conceived as orthogenetic.

We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised. \(1 Corintheans 4:9–10\) To what extremes this could evolve, we read, for instance, in the Life of Symeon the Holy Fool by Leontios, bishop of Neapolis, Cyprus \(first half of 7th century ad\):

His entry into the city of Emesa was as follows. Outside the city the illustrious one found a dead dog on a dunghill. He unleashed his cord, tied it to a leg of the dog, and tugged the animal behind him, while he was running through the city gate near the school. 12 . . . By everything he did he suggested to be mad or unbecoming. . . . 

He made it his habit, sometimes to limp, sometimes to spring around, or to shuffle on his bottom, or to trip someone up. Sometimes he watched the sky at new moon, upon which he dropped to the ground and began kicking around; sometimes he acted as if he were raving mad. . . . He had become completely incorporeal and innocent with respect to what is appropriate among meṇ When he wanted to answer a call of nature, it often happened that he was ashamed of nobody and defecated at the market square in full view. . . . The blessed one had reached such a degree of purity and sacrosanctity that he often danced and sprung around, having a harlot on each hand. Etcetera. 13

We could continue to the yurodivyj \(rodivy˘

i\) of the Russian Orthodox

Church, but it might be wise to return to the Pāśupata and to explain what is

common to its tradition of seeking dishonour \( avamāna\) and apparently similar

practices in the Greek and Christian traditions, and what is differenṭ Common to all traditions, it would seem to me, is the feeling of ecstatic power, when freedom from all forms of \(social\) bondage is experienced, when the social ego is destroyed. It is the

and

of which the Cynics speak, and

which, for modern man, has been worded brilliantly by Thomas Mann in his Magic Mountain \(Der Zauberberg\):

Da seine Betrachtungen dumpf und verworren waren, so ist es schwer, sie zu prä-zisiereṇ Haubtsächlich schien ihm, daß die Ehre bedeutende Vorteile für sich habe, aber die Schande nicht minder, ja daß die Vorteile der letzteren geradezu grenzenlo-ser Art seieṇ Und indem er sich probeweise in Herrn Albins Zustand versetzte und sich vergegenwärtigte, wie es sein müsse, wenn man endgültig des Druckes der Ehre ledig war und auf immer die bodenlosen Vorteile der Schande genoß, erschreckte den jungen Mann ein Gefühl von wüster Süßigkeit, das sein Herz vorübergehend zu noch hastigerem Gange erregte. 14

Kauṇḍinya describes at length the supernatural powers that the aspirant attains in the course of his ascetic training. However, the Sūtras that form the

introduction to his treatment of dishonour run: ‘He gives his bad karma  to them and from them he takes their good karma.’ \(PS 3.8–9\). The provocations that apparently heap shame upon the practioner induce a transfer of merit: the provoked bourgeois, who is tricked into mistaking the ascetic for a madman, looses good karma  due to his mistake, which karma  is booked at the karma credit side of the Pāśupata: a sort of credit swap avant la lettre. This highly individualistic motive, or should we say immoral, selfish ideology, although still well recognizable in its present-day forms, makes the gospel of Kauṇḍinya stand out amongst its sorṭ 

The question arises whether this second stage of the Pāśupata praxis is also

to be seen in the perspective of the imitatio dei, which so clearly informed the first one. I think this is possible, although the antinomian praxis evidently had a long history outside the Pāśupata movemenṭ But antinomian behaviour suited

certain aspects of Śiva very well. From Vedic times Rudra-Śiva has been seen as an outsider, a dangerous god that should be kept at a distance. To propitiate him he was given the name ‘the auspicious one’ \(i.e. śiva\). His provocative

and nonconformist conduct is well expressed in one of the paradigmatic Śaiva myths: ‘Śiva in the Pine Forest’ \(Devadāruvana\). This myth differs significantly

in various sources, but I present here the epitome given by O’Flaherty: 15

Śiva then wandered into the Pine Forest, and the wives of the sages there fell in love with him and followed him everywhere. Śiva was naked, ithyphallic, dancing, and begging with a skull in his hand. The sages became furious and cursed his li ˙

nga

to fall to the ground. The li ˙

nga  fell but began to cause a terrible conflagration; Brahmā and Viṣṇu tried in vain to find the top and bottom of it, and peace was only restored when the sages agreed to worship the li ˙

nga, together with their wives. 

Antinomian conduct has remained a feature of Śaiva ascetics until the present day. 

Kauṇd

. inya’s eschatology

Like the aspirant, we should leave this provocative, foolish phase in the discipline behind us and move on towards the final goal. The next step in the career of the practitioner is to retreat into solitude, which ends in his move to the cremation ground. By chosing this, for ordinary Hindus most pollutive and horrifying place, as his last residence on earth \(while still alive\), the accomplished Pāśupata saint proves his complete detachment from all earthly things. 

Like God Himself, he has transcended the relative world of opposites, of pure and impure, of good and evil, and as a monad, steeped in meditation, he awaits the moment that God’s grace will fall upon him and his suffering comes to an end. This signals in the completion of the practice of imitatioṇ With this, at the moment of death, the saint becomes god. 

The Pāśupatasūtras finish when the divine speaker, that is Śiva the author of the Sūtras, instructs the practitioner in the penultimate stage to meditate on Him by repeating the following prayer:

The Lord of all knowledge/ spells, the Master of all beings/ spirits; the Overlord of brahman, God \(Brahmā\), \(who is\) the Overlord of the demiurge

\(Brahmā\), Eternal Śiva \(Sadāśiva\), He must be \(for ever\) auspicious \( śiva\) toward

me\! 16

This is followed in the Calcutta manuscript by the syllable oṁ, 17 which should

be seen in this context as a declaration of affirmation, amen, from the side of God. Kauṇḍinya too, although he apparently omits this syllable om., seems to take this prayer in an eschatological way. The fact that God Himself instructs the devotee to entreat Him to be gracious holds a great promise: the end of suffering is at hand; it will be realized at the moment of death \(the last stage\) and will be for ever̥ Typical for Kauṇḍinya’s style, this vision of hope is prompted by a question:

16 Tai ā 10.47 \(= Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad 17.5 \(Varenne 1960, 285–86\)\). This mantra/ brahman  is found in PS 5.42–47 with some variatioṇ I follow the Calcutta ms \(C\) that conforms to the Tai ā text \(Bisschop 2006a, 18\):

īśānaḥ sarvavidyānām īśvaraḥ sarvabhūtānām

. 

brahmādhipatir brahmaṇo ’dhipatir brahmā śivo me astu sadāśivom |

17 See Bisschop 2006a, 18. oṁalso in the Tai ā text, see note above.

Hans Bakker

‘Is it so that here \(in this gospel\), that is in this prayer, only the majesty of the Creator 18 with respect to the created world \( kārya\) is considered, but not the as-

pirant’s longing for or obtaining of \(Śivahood\)?’ The answer is ‘No’. Just because He sees that those who are not yet in His ultimate grace, due to their office of being aspirant, lack Śivahood/blessedness \( aśivatva\), while those who have reached \(the

ultimate\) state of being without suffering possess Śivahood/ blessedness, He proclaims this last Sūtra. The words in this Sūtra ‘\(He\) must be’ express a wish: he

wishes, he is longing, he pursues. . . . And because it is the Eternal Śiva \(Sadāśiva\)

who gives the instruction, the state of being without suffering \( duḥ khānta\) is eter-

nal. \(Here\) ends His office of Creator̥ Therefore it is certain: this end of suffering is for good. \(Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 5.45–47\)

This doctrine, scholastic, technical, and elitist as it may be, of a personal gracious God, who has descended to earth in order to save all those from suffering who have the courage and stamina to give up their own person for the sake of attaining Him, was something of a religious revolution in the first centuries ad in northern India. 

In one important aspect the imitatio dei  of the Pāśupata differs from other

practices of this sort in later Hinduism as well as in Christianity. The imitation of the ascetic is meant to efface all human individuality, to destroy the ego and all worldly sensual experiences. Along this path, accessible only to ascetic virtuosi, the imitatio  ends in an aequatio. The human soul, the paśu, as such

ceases to exist; it has ‘transubstantiated’ into god. As so many products of the Indian mind, this ideal has never vanished, but remained part and parcel of the Indian cultural heritage. However, it has become relatively marginalized and eclipsed by modern forms of mass devotion, in particular by Vaiṣṇava bhakti. 

Modern forms of Hindu devotion

I would like to finish with a few words on these modern forms of Hindu worship. 

We may say that the idea of the imitation of god as a path to reach him has retained a normative value in Saivism, Vaisnavism and Hinduism in general, ever since its earliest formulation in the Pāśupata religioṇ We have limited

ourselves here to an early Śaiva movement, but instances of the imitatio dei practice within modern Vaisnavism are not hard to come by. 

One could even maintain that the modern devotional schools of Viṣṇu worship are nothing but imitations of the divine play \( līlā/ krīd

. ā\), be it the sports

of Rāma and Sītā in Ayodhyā, or those of Kr̥ṣṇa and Rādhā in Braj. In order

to enact the eternal līlā, devotees make pilgrimages to the places where the mythology is believed to be topographically embedded. It is a strategy practised by hundreds of millions to remove the painful separation \( viraha\) of the human soul and God. In contrast to what the Christian pilgrim may experience 18 I read kāraṇa  instead of karaṇa. 



28 / The Gospel of Kauṇd

. inya

551

on the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem, the imitation of Kr̥ṣṇa in Braj and Vrindavan usually results in great exuberance. Modern Hinduism, in particular Vaiṣṇava bhakti, is a religion celebrating the joys of life rather than its sufferings \(cf. 

above, p. 17\). It is this character, unexpected as it may be to some readers, especially after reading this essay—it is this life-affirming attitude, which seeks to imitate the sports of a happy  god, that sat in the way of a warm reception by Christian missionaries. It made Hinduism in the eyes of many of them a shallow, silly, and naive religion, a too childish way of life to compare in earnest with the grave and deadly serious, revealed religion whose ceremonialism emphasized the doleful side of life and banished, like the Pāśupata faith, the end

of suffering to a realm beyond death. 

Epilogue

Comparison is central to the systematic study of religioṇ The comparative method, however, carries a great risk. 

As the scope widens, the collected

insights tend to become more shallow and this not infrequently results in an arid display of learnedness. A balance should be struck between collecting comparable phenomena in different religions and bringing to light the great divisions that do exist, despite superficial resemblances. It will not lead us to the essence of religion, but it will enhance our understanding and debunk absolute claims, since it is due to explode naive ethnocentricity and academic parochialism. Thus is the task of the historian of religion, and this task has been accomplished in an exemplary way by Jan Bremmer in his distinguished career as professor of religious studies. 

Many scholars in the humanities today will agree that god as an entity is unwarranted. God is not an ontological category in the sense of an ens realissimum, but a human ideal, that is a mental, social and cultural figuration that gives meaning to life and guides the conduct of the community of believers. As such, the idea of god, which a community creates and sustains, is quintessen-tial to the culture of that community. For this reason the study of religion is such a rewarding enterprise: it allows us access to key notions of a culture. A comparative perspective may help to bring these notions into prominence. 

I wrote, the conception of god guides the conduct of the believer, and nowhere is this more obvious than in the practice of imitating god. 

Look

at the ritualized behaviour of the believers and you will find their idea of god. 

Look at the idea of god and you will understand the behaviour̥ Imitation of god is at the heart of every traditional, religious society, of Christianity as much as of Hinduism. To emulate a happy god brings greater happiness among the faithful; to emulate a suffering god may offer more consolation in our dark-est hours, or, in the words of the Goncourt brothers \(1 December 1860\): ‘La religion chrétienne sert quand on pleure.’ 19

## Origin and Spread of the Pāśupata Movement

About Heracles, Lakulīśa and Symbols of Masculinity

The study of the origins of organized Saivism received a completely new perspective with the publication of the Pāśupatasūtras \(PS\) and Kauṇḍinya’s com-

mentary thereon, the Pañcārthabhāṣya, by r̥ Ananthakrishna Sastri in 1940. 

Research by Minoru Hara, Daniel Ingalls, Alexis Sanderson, Thomas Oberlies, Peter Bisschop, and Diwakar Acharya, to mention just the major players in this field, built on this new evidence and has paved the way for our present investigation, which draws heavily on their work. 1

For the last fifteen years we have also been fortunate to possess another source that comes from the same Pāśupata tradition and is chronologically not

too far removed from Kauṇḍinya. This text reflects the layman’s, laukika, view, rather than that of the initiated ascetic, who is the primary person treated by Kauṇḍinya. This text is the Skandapurāṇa \(SP\), whose composition we date between ad 550 and 650, which means that the text is probably about 200 years later than Kauṇḍinya’s commentary. Much had happened in India in those 200 years: it saw the rise and fall of the great Gupta Empire, the intrusion of Hunnic peoples, and the gradual recovery of centralized power in the new capital Kanauj \(Kanyakubja\) under the Maukharis and the great Harṣavardhana of Thanesar̥ 

The first thing that strikes us, when we compare the Skandapurāṇa’s account

of the well-known descent of Śiva in Kāyāvataraṇa \(called Kārohaṇa in SP and

known today as Karvan in Gujarat\) with that given by Kauṇḍinya, is that the uniqueness of this mystical event is no longer maintained. Reflecting the general Hindu and Buddhist conception of the time, viz. that a Buddha or a god incarnates on earth again and again in various forms and persons, the Skandapurāṇa makes Śiva’s descent in Gujarat a cyclic event: each world period

Another development that apparently took place or gained prominence in the 5th to 6th centuries is that the avatāra  story in Kārohaṇa itself was revised. 

God is said in the Skandapurāṇa to have been born into the house of a certain

Somaśarman, who is said to belong to the lineage of the r̥ṣi  Atri, father of Soma, the Mooṇ 3 This new tradition may have been invented to account for a lineage of Pāśupata teachers who traced their pedigree back to Somaśarman, a topic that I have discussed in my paper Somaśarman, Somavaṁśa and So-

masiddhānta \(above, p. 283 ff.\). The Skandapurāṇa is, in all likelihood, the

first extant text that attests the name Lāguḍi \(variant: Lākulin\), meaning

‘club bearer’ \( lagud

. a/lakuṭa: ‘club’; see above, p. 529\). However, this relatively late first attestation of the name ‘club bearer’ does not preclude the possibility that the association of this incarnation with the attribute of the club is much older̥ For this we have some indications. 

Early images of a club bearing ascetic or teacher

To begin with, there is an image found in Mathurā, 4 usually dated to the third

century ad on stylistic grounds, of a rather glum-faced, club-bearing ascetic. 

This figure might represent, either an ascetic associated with the Pāśupata

sect, or—less likely, because characteristic iconographic signs are absent—the incarnation of Śiva himself \(Plate 121\). 5

Secondly, the American scholar Daniel Ingalls, who compared the Pāśupata

sect with the school of the Greek Cynics, broke new ground in his paper Cynics and Pāśupata: the Seeking of Dishonor, when he conjectured that the name Lakulīśa, the Lāguḍi of the Skandapurāṇa, may have been derived from the Greek name Heracles, 

, ‘if it lost its first syllable in order to help out

a folk etymology’. 6 If this were correct, it might point to an \(iconographic\) influence of the Hellenistic school of the Cynics, whose patron saint was the club-bearing Heracles, on the movement of the Pāśupata. 

Ingalls’ wider suggestion, namely that the Pāśupata practice of seeking dis-

honour may have originated under the influence of the Cynics, has been met with scepticism by contemporary scholarship. Thomas Oberlies \(2000\) argued in his Kriegslisten und ungeziemendes Benehmen: Die Askesepraktiken der Pāśupatas that antinomian praxis, as part of the context of the brahmodya, is already attested in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa \(2.3.9.9\); the influence of Cynicism

in this particular respect, something that was conjectured by Ingalls, is therefore not required to explain the phenomenoṇ Though it may indeed be the case that the Pāśupata antinomian praxis in the second stage of the ascetic’s 2 Skandapurāṇa S recension \(SPS 167.112–117\) in Bisschop 2006.

career is an orthogenetic Indian development, the eponymous attribute of the saint, the lagud

. a  or club, remains as yet unexplained. Let us reconsider the earliest iconographic evidence. 

The lagud

. a or club

The first unquestionable visual representation of the divine Śaiva teacher with the attribute of the club is a fifth-century image from Mathurā. This sculpture

is understood to be an image of Lāguḍi or Lakulīśa \(Plate 122\).7 For rea-

son of comparison, and in order to explore further Ingalls’ supposedly Greek connection, I would like to draw attention to an image of Heracles found in A¨ı Khanum on the Darya-i Pandj River̥ This little bronze statuette \(height: 18.2 cm\) from the National Museum of Afghanistan \(G 04.42.8\) has been on display in the Musée Guimet \(Paris\) in 2007 and has since been touring in Europe and the USA \(Plate 123\). 8

The natural gnarls, which usually characterize Heracles’ cudgel and which in stylized form are visible on the club of the A¨ı-Khanum Heracles, resemble the phallic line pattern on the club of the Mathurā image \(Plate 125\): a Greek

symbol of masculinity encounters an Indian symbol of virility.

A¨ı Khanum, whose excavation by a French mission began in 1965, represents an important Hellenistic city founded in the wake of Alexander’s conquests in Central Asia \(329–27 bc\).9 This city, possibly Ptolemy’s ‘Alexandria on the Oxus’, 10 was once the centre of a hybrid culture in which East met Wesṭ

Elements of the syncretistic culture of Bactria reached western India with the entrance into the Subcontinent of Śaka tribes, who built a kingdom from Mathurā to southern Gujarat in the last decades before the Common Era. 

That Heracles remained a popular figure there till Kuṣāṇa rule is attested, for instance, by the so-called Hercules-type of coins of the Śaka ruler Rajuvula \(1st quarter 1st cenṭ ad\), some of which were found in Mathurā, 12 and a second-century ad image of Heracles and the Nemeian Lion, which was also found in Mathurā \(Plate 124\). 13

The origin of the Pāśupata movement

The Pāśupata movement originated under Śaka hegemony in that part of India where the figure of Heracles was known at the time. If the iconography of Heracles had exerted some influence on, or had moulded the figure of the club-bearing divine teacher, we would have expected this to become apparent in the sources that date to the period in which both, the figure of Heracles and the Pāśupata teacher, existed side by side, viz. the first centuries of the Common Era. However, neither our oldest source, the Pāśupatasūtras, nor Kauṇḍinya’s

commentary knows, either the club as an attribute, or the name Lāguḍi.14

Ingalls’ hypothesis, therefore, which assumes that the Greek Heracles launched the Indian Lakulīśa, is just as unlikely as his assumption that the Hellenistic school of the Cynics influenced the development of the Pāśupata practice. 

An orthogenetic root of the club-bearing deity seems therefore to be more obvious. The Amarakośa \(3.3.42\) mentions lagud

. a  as a synonym of daṇd

. a. It

is but natural to conceive of the club as a variant of the traditional stick or staff \( daṇd

. a\) of the brahmin ascetic. The earliest Pāśupata monument known

to us, the Mathurā Pilaster of Candragupta II of the Gupta Year 61, i.e. ad 380 \(above, Plate 112\), 15 depicts a naked three-eyed figure with a daṇd

. a  in his

right, and what is possibly a kamaṇd

. alu  in his left hand \(Plate 126\). 16

Plate 126

Daṇd

. apāṇi on Mathurā pilaster,  ge 61

14 The Mahābhārata knows the Pāśupata sect, its vow \( vrata\), doctrine \( jñāna\), and prac-

tice \( yoga\); it also knows the Pāśupata weapon \( astra\), which Śiva gave to Arjuna; for this weapon see below, p. 567. Lāgud

. i/Lakulīśa is unknown to the MBh and so is his

club. 

15 CII III \(1981\), 240. 

16 The identity of this figure is disputed. That we are concerned with a divine figure follows from the third eye. Acharya 2005, 209 proposes to read the name of this deity as Caṇd

. a. 

My designation ‘Daṇd

. apāṇi’ is descriptive, it is not the proper name of the deity. 



29 / Origin and Spread of the Pāśupata Movement

559

Admittedly, the origin of the word lagud

. a/ lakuṭa—attested, for instance, in Manusmr̥ti \(8.315\) and Mahābhārata \(7.29.16\) in the sense of ‘cudgel’ or

‘club’—remains as yet unclear̥ 17 But even if we do not accept Przyluski’s etymology that links the word to the Austro–Asiatic lāṅgula, meaning ‘stick’

or ‘penis’, 18 we may assume that phallic symbolism easily suggested itself to the Indian mind and came to be associated with this particular attribute. The phallic shape of the club in the earliest representations of the divine teacher, evident from the line pattern and its upright position \(Plate 125\), may have been prompted by the ithyphallic nature of this teacher and his prototype, Śiva. Thus, the club may have replaced the ascetic daṇd

. a, by virtue of its more

outspoken phallic, i.e. Śaiva connotatioṇ 19 The name Lāguḍi, ‘club-bearer’, 

in Skandapurāṇa \(SPS 167.129\), Laguḍīśvara in SPS 167.169 \(interpolation\), Lākuli in Niśvāsamukha 3.19 \(Kafle 2015, 149\) and Lakulīśa, i.e. ‘Lord of the club-bearers’, in slightly later sources, e.g. the Guhyasūtra \(12.18\) of the

Niśvāsatattvasaṁhitā, derive all from this eponymous attribute. 20

The four disciples

Another major development \(in addition to the invention of the figure of Lāguḍi\) that took place in the 4th to 6th centuries is also attested by the Skandapurāṇa: Kuśika is no longer the only disciple. The number of disciples that is said to have been initiated by Lāguḍi himself has increased to four̥ 

These four are considered to have a semi-divine status; our text declares them to have sprung from the four faces of God \(Parameśāna\), out of His desire to

bestow grace \( anugraha\) upon the world:

17 See Manfred Mayrhofer, EWA ṣv. ‘ lakuṭa’: ‘Nicht erklärt’. 

18 Turner, CDIAL ṣv. ‘ lakuṭa’: ‘Ac. to J. Przyluski Pre-Aryan in sense “penis” is of same origin as lā ˙

ngula &c ← Austro-aṣ; but prob. same word as “stick”.’ Cf. Mayrhofer, KEWA ṣv. 

19 The Atharvavedapariśiṣṭa 40, dealing with the Pāśupatavrata, contains the following interesting passage, specifying what should be given to the initiated brahmin: tato ’sya mauñjiṁprayacchati  k

texts discovered and published by Diwakar Acharya; for instance the Saṁskāravidhi

\(Acharya 2007\). The name ‘Nakulin/Lakulin’ is known from the list of 28 incarnations of Śiva as given in the Vāyupurāṇa 1.23 and Li ˙

ngapurāṇa 1.24. However, as Bisschop

2006, 43 ff. has argued convincingly ‘this list of twenty-eight avatāras  did not yet form

part of that text \[i.e. the Vāyupurāṇa\] at the time of composition of the Skandapurāṇa’.

You four should descend to earth to become twice-born ascetics. 

And after having led the brahmins to the supreme station, you, O masters of yoga, should return to Me. \(SPS 167.120\) The first disciple, Kuśika/Kauśika, is born in Ujjain and initiated there by Śiva’s incarnation himself, just as is in Kauṇḍinya’s version of the story \(above, ṇ 7 on p. 529 and p. 542\). But the venue has changed. The initiation according to the Skandapurāṇa takes place in the cremation ground instead of a temple. 

The Lord, smeared with ashes, is said to hold a firebrand \( ulmuka\) in his left hand \(SPS 167.127 f.\). This seems appropriate for a cremation ground and may suggest that the initiation included branding. Although it is tempting to hypothesize that the ascetic’s club has been mistakenly interpreted for what was originally a firebrand, this hypothesis has to be discarded, not only because of what has been said above, but also, more importantly, because images of Lakulīśa with a firebrand have never come to light and the ulmuka  is elsewhere never mentioned as one of his potential attributes. On the other hand, the firebrand as an attribute is found in some later images of Śiva as a teacher, in his so-called ‘Dakṣiṇām¯urti’.21

The ancient cremation ground in Ujjain has been identified. Locally known as Kumhār T

. ekḍī, this site was the subject of preliminary explorations by M.B. 

Garde in the season of 1938–39. Discovered there were skeletons in sitting posture, reflecting the normal way of interning yogins. Kuśika may have been one of them. 22 The specification of these four disciples in the Skandapurāṇa

allows us to catch a glimpse of the spread and ramification of the movement; it will be our subject in the final part of this essay.

29 / Origin and Spread of the Pāśupata Movement

561

Spread and ramification of the Pāśupata movement

From the Mathurā Pilaster of ad 380 we deduce that the Pāśupata movement had spread from South Gujarat to Mathurā before the end of the fourth cen-

tury. This is true for at least one tradition of gurus, the so-called ‘Vaimalas’, who traced their pedigree also directly back to Kuśika. In an image found in Mathurā that might be slightly later than the pilaster, the ithyphallic divine teacher—who, to judge by his attribute, is to be identified as Lāguḍi—is shown

with two disciples \(above, Plate 118\). 23 Evidently the Kuśika lineage \( paramparā\) as attested in Kauṇḍinya’s commentary needed to compete with one or more rival traditions that also claimed direct descent from Śiva’s incarnatioṇ 24

The Skandapurāṇa’s account of the four disciples of Lāguḍi, which would

become the standard, reflects this bifurcation, which may have started already in the 4th century, if not earlier̥ The earliest known image that shows four disciples seated around a divine teacher, however, comes only in the 6th century \(Plate 128\); it is found ‘above the doorway in the east vestibule to the great cave at Yogeśvarī near Bombay’, which is dated by Walter Spink to c. ad 525.25

25 Spink 1983, 243. Shah 1984, 88. The divine figure in the Yogeśvarī Cave seems to be four-armed: the left upper hand holds the rosary, the left lower hand the club, the right lower hand seems to make a vyākhānamudrā, whereas the right upper arm is missing \(cf. 

Shah 1984, 98\). This early Śaiva monument, just as the monuments at Mandapesvar and Elephanta, shows the flourishing of the Pāśupata movement in the middle of the

6th century, when the movement’s home country came under the control of the early Kalacuris, who extended their rule to the northern Konkan, where these monuments are preserved \(Spink 1983; cf. Mirashi in CII IV.1, xlvi f., cxlvii f.\). The Kalacuri king Kr̥ṣṇarāja in an inscription of his son \(Śaṁkaragaṇa\) datable to ad 597, is said to have

been devoted to Paśupati from the day of his birth \( janmana eva paśupatisamāśraya-

paraḥ , CII IV.1, 41\). 



562

Hans Bakker

The account in the Skandapurāṇa tells us that the third disciple, who was

initiated in Mathurā, was named Mitra. No doubt there were many Mitras in Mathurā, but the mentioning of this name in this context may betray some historical awareness of the fact that the city of Mathurā, before the coming

of the Śakas, had been governed by a Mitra dynasty. 26 Making a \(legendary\) Mitra the fountainhead of a lineage of Pāśupata gurus in Mathurā would only

add to the authenticity of this traditioṇ 

The Skandapurāṇa suggests that before the Pāśupata teachers had settled

in Mathurā, the movement had reached the city of Jambumārga, to be located

between Ujjayanī and Mathurā. 27 In this city, the divine incarnation is said to

have initiated his second disciple Gārgya. The exact location of Jambumārga is

unknown, but it must have been an important Śaiva centre. Professor Tsuchida \(Tokyo\) has suggested to me that it may be the town called Mo-hi-shi-fa-lo-pu-lo, Maheśvarapura, visited by Xuanzang in the first quarter of the seventh century. The chinese pilgrim describes the place as follows. 

The produce of the soil and the manners of the people are like those of the kingdom of Ujjayanˆı. They greatly esteem the heretics and do not reverence the law of the Buddha. There are several tens of Dêva temples, and the sectaries principally belong to the Pâsupatas. The king is of the Brâhman caste; he places but little faith in the doctrine of Buddha. 28

The itinerary of the Chinese pilgrim suggests that Maheśvarapura lay on the route from Ujjain to the north through Chitor, that is on the axis Ujjain, Mandasor, Chitor, Puṣkara, Mathurā.29 The research of Elizabeth Cecil \(2016, 150 ff.\) has shown that the salt lake region north of Puṣkara, around Sikar–

Sambhar, traditionally known as Sapādalakṣa, in particular the excavation site

at Naliasar, 6 km from Sāmbhar \(Śākambharī\), may be another good candidate

for Jambumārga. 

In between Puṣkara and Ujjain is the village presently known as Nagarī, corresponding to the ancient town of Mādhyamika, which is located near Chitor

\(Xuanzang’s Chi-ki-to\) in Rajasthaṇ Just as in Maheśvarapura, Xuanzang reports a strong Śaiva presence in Chi-ki-to: ‘There are about ten Dêva temples, which some thousand followers frequent’ \(Beal II, 271\). The archaeological remains in Nagarī \(Mādhyamika\) testify to its importance as a Śaiva centre in the 5th and 6th centuries, predating Chitor̥ 30 We discuss the Nagarī remains in more detail elsewhere. 31

27 Cf. Bisschop 2006, 209.

29 See also Deloche 1980 I, 60 & Fig. 8. This appears to be the same route that is described in the Tīrthayātrāparvan \(MBh 3.80.59–71\). Another candidate for Maheśvarapura has been proposed by Michael Willis \(1997, 17\), who identifies this place with the village of Shivpur \(Shivpuri/Sipri\), c. 100 km west of Jhansi \(MP\), c. 240 km south of Mathurā.

The route along which the Pāśupata religion moved north

Combining the evidence and the above conjectures, tentative as much of it may be, we could try to reconstruct the route along which the Pāśupata reli-

gion moved north in the fourth century. Coming from Karvan in Gujarat, and after having established itself in Ujjain in Western Malwa \(Madhya Pradesh\), it moved northwards along the ancient caravan route that connected the port of Bharukaccha \(Bharuch\) at the mouth of the Narmadā River, through Uj-

jain, with Puṣkara in Rajasthan and the town of Mathurā further-on in Uttar Pradesh. 

On this route Jambumārga, Maheśvarapura, became a Pāśupata

stronghold like Ujjain and Mathurā \(Figure 15\). 

The movement did not end in Mathurā. The Skandapurāṇa speaks of the

fourth disciple of Lāguḍi as a man born in the Kuru country, i.e. Kurukṣetra, but it stops short of mentioning him by name \(see above, p. 527\). This puruṣa issued from the fourth face of Śiva is said to have been initiated by Lāguḍi in

Kanyakubja, the city of Kanauj in Uttar Pradesh \(SPS 167, 129\). We take this as an indication that Kanauj had become another important centre of the Pāśupata sect in the 5th or 6th century. The explicit mentioning of the birth of the fourth disciple in the Land of the Kurus strongly suggests that this region too, with its capital Thanesar \(Sthāneśvara\), had become a mainstay of the

new faith. The rise of the city of Kanauj as the political \(and cultural\) capital of Northern India in the 6th century, made that it became the base from where the movement spread over North India and beyond, into Magadhā, Nepal and

Southeast Asia \(Cambodia\). 

The origin of a pan-Indian religion

The Skandapurāṇa describes the four disciples, after they had been initiated \( anugr̥hya\), as apostles of the Pa˜ncārtha doctrine. 

Lāguḍi \(the divine incarnation\) bestowed on them ‘**H**is own doctrine’ \(Svasiddhānta\) and yoga, and spoke:

This is the final mystical teaching known as Pañcārtha. It has been proclaimed

to you in order that you liberate the brahmins from the fetters of death. You should make the brahmins reach the highest station by initiating them \(in this teaching\). Your dwelling places shall be on sacred river banks, in holy sanctuaries, as well as in deserted houses and forests, excluded from society. 

Having heard this word of Lord Paśupati Himself, all these four disciples, being enlightened by God, did as they were told. 32

To pursue the further course of the Pāśupata religion will remain a future task. 

I would like to conclude by briefly illustrating how a possibly historic, and 32 SPS 167.129cd–132. Above, p. 527 and ṇ 3 on p. 528.

in many respects unique, mystical event, the religious enlightenment of the brahmin saint Kuśika in Ujjain, developed into a pan-Indian cult of Lakulīśa. 

The author Kauṇḍinya gives the impression of still being in direct touch with the origins of the movemenṭ He relates how the divine incarnation reached Ujjain by foot, a touching detail, and suggests that the authenticity of this event can be confirmed by the still visible traces that have been left behind. 33 In the two hundred years between Kauṇḍinya and the composition of the Skandapurā-ṇa great developments had taken place. There had risen a number of gurus, no doubt rivals with one another, who claimed that their respective lineages \( paramparā\) hailed back to a disciple of the divine incarnatioṇ To unite them, the idea of multiple disciples—first two, and then four—was invented. 

In an orthogenetic process—or, less likely, a heterogenetic one through the influence of the Hellenistic figure of Heracles—the divine incarnation who was believed to have initiated these four disciples somehow came to be called Lāguḍi

or Lakulīśa. Once the idea was accepted that this Lāguḍi had operated not

only in Kārohaṇa and Ujjain, but had initiated in Śaiva centres such as Jambumārga, Mathurā and another as far off as Kanyakubja, there was no longer a reason not to claim that he had operated in other places as well. The last vestige of historicity vanished. It was replaced by the belief that there had been incarnations of Śiva in all world periods: Lakulīśa was just one of them. 

And why should God limit his range to western India? This new view is evident in a passage in the Skandapurāṇa that has been shown by Peter Bisschop to be

an interpolation in the earliest extant recension of the text, the one preserved in Nepal \(SPS\). 34 This passage runs as follows:

Tradition has it that there are eight holy places of Śiva \(Śaśimaulin\) in the land of Magadhā, through which Laguḍīśvara wandered, surrounded by his pupils. When one has visited those, a man will be at once redeemed from sins. 35

Thus developed an elitist faith of ascetic virtuosi into a catholic religioṇ The anonymous saviour of Kauṇḍinya turned into just another manifestation of the divine, his worship into just another form of Śiva devotioṇ

## The Quest for the Pāśupata Weapon

The Gateway of the Mahādeva Temple at

Madhyamikā \(Nagarī\)

Hans Bakker & Peter Bisschop

Introduction

The village of Nagarī is situated in the Chittorgarh District \(Rajasthan\), 11 km north of the famous forṭ The present archaeological site lies to the south of the village on the right bank of the River Berach. The original citadel along the river extended further northwards and included the space presently occupied by the village \(Plate 129\).

The remains of the Mahādeva Temple are found in the southern part of the

archaeological site \(Plate 130\).

These remains consist of a reconstructed brick platform surrounded by some stray pieces of architecture: parts of a dhvajastambha \(pillar\), pillar capitals having bull and lion, a pedestal, an architrave of a toraṇa, a beam with gavākṣas

and makara, and a toraṇa  post \(Plate 131\).

Before we discuss the iconography of the toraṇa, we will give a brief sketch of

the historical setting of the site. 

The history of the Nagarī site

Inscriptions and coins

Many coins are reported to have come from Nagarī. Bhandarkar found in his excavations sixteen legible punch-marked coins pertaining to the Śibi-janapada. 

The legend of these coins reads: majhimikāya śibijanapadasa. 2 Bhandarkar

\( op. ciṭ  123 f.\), following an earlier suggestion by Kielhorn, identified this Majhimikā ‘with the Madhyamikā mentioned by Patañjali as having been invested

in his time by a Yavana king’, 3 and takes it to be the old name of Nagarī. He 1 For another, well-preserved example of such a gateway from the same period and area, compare the tall post found at Khilchipura, now at Mandasor Fort \(below, p. 573\). 

Joanna Williams \(1982, 142\) draws attention to the striking similarity; she considers the Khilchipura piece to be slightly later̥

Hans T. Bakker & Peter C. Bisschop

translates the legend as ‘Coin of the Śibi janapada  of the Madhyamikā country’. 

This distinguishes the Śibis of Nagarī from those of the Punjab. Bhandarkar \(and historians after him\) had little doubt that Madhyamikā ‘was the old name

of Nagarī and also the district around it’. 4

Five inscriptions have been reportedly found in Nagarī and surroundings, one of them is the famous Ghoṣ¯uṇḍī Well Stone Inscription,5 recording the establishment of a stone enclosure around the Nārāyaṇa Vāṭikā, which was dedicated

to the two gods Saṁkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva. The site of this Vāṭikā has been

identified by Bhandarkar \(1920, 128 ff.\) with the so-called Elephant Pen of Akbar \(Hāthī-bāḍā\), ‘half a mile east of the village \[Nagarī\]’. Bhandarkar found here, among other things, a stone with grafitto reading: śrīviṣṇupādābhyāṁin

seventh-century characters. 6

For our present purpose, the inscription reportedly found ‘not far from the shrine of Mahādeva’ is of greater relevance. It is dated 481 in the Kr̥ta \(=

Vikrama\) Era, corresponding to ad 424. It records ‘the erection of a temple to Vishnu by the three Baniā brothers’, Satyaśūra, Srugandha \(Śrīgandha ?\)

and Dāsa, and thus testifies to a Viṣṇu temple, established at or near the site of the Mahādeva temple during the reign of Emperor Kumāragupta. 7 At this

time Western Mālava was under control of the feudatory Early Aulikara prince \( nr̥pati\) Viśvavarman, who was ruling from Daśapura \(Mandasor\), c. 100 km to the south of Nagarī. 8

Some fragments belonging to the Gupta period were discovered by Bhandarkar in the area: two capitals of pillars with addorsed lions and bulls \(in the Kaṅkālī Mātā shrine in Nagarī village\). Other pillars and images were found c. 4 km southeast of Nagarī at the shrine of Sāḍ¯u Mātā.9

One more inscribed stone relevant to our present discussion was found in Chittorgarh in 1959, ‘while clearing debris in the fort area’. This stone, containing two brief fragmentary, but related inscriptions, was published by Sircar 4 Bhandarkar 1920, 123 f. 

5 The Ghoṣūṇd

.ī village lies c. 6 km NE of Nagarī, but the inscribed stone came originally from the so-called Hāthī-bād

. ā at Nagarī. There exist apparently three copies of this inscription, one still in situ. EI 16, 25–27; EI 22, 198–205; Sircar in SI I, 90 f.: ‘2nd half of the 1st cenṭ BC’. 

6 Bhandarkar 1920, 129; Agrawala 1987. 

7 Bhandarkar 1920, 121. The text of this inscription has not been published, although it is referred to in several publications. We only know about the basic contents of this inscription from Bhandarkar’s original descriptioṇ 

According to Bhandarkar it was

‘deposited in the Rajputana Museum, Ajmer’. Although the line of the inscription that mentions the Kr̥ta Era has been extensively discussed in CII III \(1981\), 192 ff., and the inscription clearly falls within the category of ‘Inscriptions of the Early Gupta Kings’, the editors of the revised edition of Volume III of the CII \(B. Chhabra & G.s. Gai\) refrain from including and editing this inscription in their volume, nor do they give any more information about the inscription itself and its whereabouts. It shows again the limited value of this ‘revised edition’.

and Gai in Epigraphia Indica 34 \(1961–62\). The second inscription attests to the building of a temple, which was, in all likelihood, dedicated to Śiva, since the maṅgala  verse speaks of ‘the one who hides the moon in the pile of his curling, tawny matted locks’. 10 Its construction seems to have been commissioned by a rājasthānīya  or viceroy who was ruling in Daśapura and Madhyamā. 

The \(Śiva\) temple is said to be located to the north of the \(Viṣṇu\) temple of Manorathasvāmiṇ 11

Madhyamā has been identified with Madhyamikā, and the rājasthānīya, son

of Viṣṇudatta and grandson of Varāha\(dāsa\), belonged to the powerful mer-chant \(Naigama\) family that kept the office of chief minister or viceroy under the Later Aulikara kings of Daśapura, in particular Prakāśadharman and

Yaśodharman \(between ad 510 and 533\).12 The two Chittorgarh inscriptions belong to this period and record the importance of the Madhyamā/Madhya-

mikā province within the kingdom of Daśapura in the first four decades of the sixth century. They also testify to shifting religious affiliations amongst regional rulers: the Early Aulikaras, like their Gupta overlords, were Vaiṣṇavas; the Later Aulikaras, who came to power after the turbulent period that saw the fall of the Gupta Empire, were devotees of Śiva. It would seem that the archaeological remains in Nagarī reflect this revolutioṇ 

The fort of Chittorgarh dates from the post-Aulikara period, when Daśapura and Madhyamikā had lost their prominence. It is conceivable that the inscribed stone slab came from nearby Nagarī along with other materials, when the newly built fort provided safety to a successor state, possibly that of the Mori Rajputs \(Mauryas\) in the seventh century. 13

Archaeology

Excavations at Nagarī were conducted by ḍr̥ Bhandarkar in the ‘second decade of the \[20th\] century’, and after him by K.V. Soundara Rajan in 1962–

63. 14 The archaeological situation is summed up by r̥P. Sharma in A. Ghosh’s Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology, volume II ṣv. ‘Nagari’. 

\[. . . \] Three periods were distinguished, the first two being anterior to the stone fortification and seemingly without baked-brick structures, though limestone structures were knowṇ They had both red and grey wares; the occurrence of the NBPW

was negligible, though associated red ware was available. The settlement seems to have originated in c. 400 B.C. \[. . . \] Period III was marked by the presence of the Red Polished Ware. The other finds of the site include terracotta human and animal figures in Śuṅga and Gupta styles \[. . . \] The fortification probably originated in Gupta times.

The structure exposed in the excavations consists of a square brick platform \(Plate 135\). 

Plate 135

Excavated brick platform in Nagarī

573

It will be seen from the plan that the east side was unlike the other sides of the platform and shows that it and its superstructure faced that directioṇ The maximum height preserved of its moulded walls is 4’ \[122 cm\] and is found in the west wall. This seems to be nearly half of the original height of the platform. Though the upper half of its walls has fallen down, it appears from the terracottas picked up from the débris, to have been covered with decorative tiles of at least three types, some of them probably arranged in string courses. One type is represented by what may be styled bird terracottas. \[. . . \]

The centre of the platform was originally occupied by a superstructure, very little of which has now survived. It is 43’ 6” \[13.30 m\] square at the base. Immediately below each side of this square is a foundation wall, 6’ \[1.80 m\] thick. \[. . . \] Of the superstructure only the lowermost moulding has been preserved, which is nearly two feet high. \(Bhandarkar 1920, 135 f.\)

The original temple of the Gupta period may have been of brick, but, as observed by Bhandarkar \( op. ciṭ  138\), ‘to the second period of additions characterised by the introduction of stone work, or possibly to a period slightly later, belong the remains of a stone toraṇa  exhumed in front of the mound’. It is this toraṇa  which is the subject of this article. 

The toraṇa of the Mahādeva Temple

In describing this gateway Joanna Williams \(1982, 140 f.\) observed that, The most impressive carvings at Nagarī are the remains of a gigantic gateway or toraṇa  that must belong to the early sixth century on the basis of its relationship to works from Mandasor̥ The decorative side face of the post bears fluted bands and medallions \[Plate 136\], which elaborate upon forms found at Mukundara. 

Passing through the temple gateway is entering a new world. The toraṇa  as

such epitomizes the rite of passage and the symbolism of this rite informs the iconography of the gateway \(below, p. 599\). It begins with the gatekeeper and his trident at the bottom of the gate post, eastern side, at the entry of the temple compound, which is oriented toward the east \(Plate 137\). 15

15 That this is the eastern, that is entry side, follows from the fact that it has the figure of a Dvārapāla, and because it fits only the eastern face of the architrave. The latter face is the eastern one, because it contains a Dakṣiṇāmūrti, which would be without meaning

if it faced west \(Bakker 2004c\), and an image of Śiva in meditation \(Yogeśvara\), which should likewise face easṭ It also seems to follow from the iconographic programme of the architrave itself, which begins, as we will see, in the panels at the entrance, that is the eastern side, and continues with the panels at the exit, that is the western side.

Just as Bhandarkar, Williams assumes that the fragment with candraśālā

arches lying near the architrave is part of a second tier of the toraṇa \(Plate

138\). She observed that ‘the top half of the double- candraśālā  arches have di-

agonal projections from their lower corners, a detail mentioned as characteristic of pieces found in Deogarh’. 16

Hans T. Bakker & Peter C. Bisschop

The full length of the architrave must have measured about 4 metres, but the southern-most panel has broken off at one-third and the concluding sculpture of a garland bearer is missing at that end \(Plates 141–142; cf. Plate 115\). The whole architrave consisted, in our reconstruction, of two garland bearers on either end and six panels in betweeṇ The middle of the architrave must have been between the third and the fourth panel, which we deduce from the turn of the torsion in between the third and fourth panels in the garland at the bottom of the crossbar̥ The height of the architrave is 65 cm, its width 38 cm. The architrave is broken at two places: in the first panel at the northern end and in the middle, between the third and fourth panels. 19

The iconography of the eastern face of the architrave, seen by visitors when they entered the temple complex, has been discussed in Bakker 2004c, 131–

34, in particular its panel at the northern end, which, it was argued \(above, p. 525\), contained a Dakṣiṇām¯urti. The latter interpretation still stands, but the person who is instructed in this mūrti  has to be reconsidered. 

At the time Bakker worked from a photograph kindly sent to him by Joanna Williams, which he re-published. 20 Williams \(1982, 141\) had observed that:

‘The subjects of the reverse \[i.e. eastern face\] of this same crossbar remain to be identifieḍ’ In a letter to Bakker she added to this that she wondered ‘whether the scene at the left end of this face might not represent the destruction of Dakṣa’s sacrifice’.21 Bakker \(2004, 132 ff.\) accepted this suggestion and interpreted the Dakṣiṇām¯urti scene as representing the initiation of King Dakṣa in the Pāśupatavrata. 

The present revision of this interpretation has been prompted by a visit to the excavation site at Nagarī by Bakker and Bisschop and a study of the architrave in the field \(15 January 2016\). For it turned out that the panel at the southern end \(E 1\), although incomplete since it has broken off at one-third, 19 Bhandarkar 1920, 139 thinks that ‘enough has been recovered to show that each broader side was originally divided into nine panels \[including garland bearers\]’. Bhandarkar’s reconstruction in Plate XXIII shows that he conjectures that one complete panel plus garland bearer is missing at the southern end. In view of the turn of the torsion between the third and fourth panels \(E 3–4, W 3–4\), we think this is less likely. An argument against our assumption, as voiced by Véronique Degroot, is that the architrave panels show alternating indentation and protrusion: panels E 2/W 5, E 4/W 3 and \(northern-most\) E 6/W 1 are protruding and so, assuming symmetry, one might expect a southern-most panel to be protruding as well. Another argument, however, against a missing 7th panel, in addition to the change in torsion, seems to be that the breaking point in the southern-most panel \(E 1/W 6\) corresponds with the crack in the northern-most panel \(E 6/W 1\), the positions where the architrave supposedly rested on its two posts. The collapse of the toraṇa  thus seems to have taken place by a break in the middle and at the two junctures. Six panels on each side makes sense according to the iconographical analysis offered in this article. If a 7th, lost panel was originally part of the architrave, the iconography of panels E 1 and W 6 that we conjecture may have been divided, broadly speaking, over two panels.

actually contains significant information that had been invisible in the above-mentioned photograph. This evidence was spotted by Bisschop and debated in the field. It resulted in the acknowledgement that the earlier interpretation of the panels of the eastern face as depicting the Dakṣa myth needed to be reconsidered. 

The incomplete panel at the southern end \(E 1\) deserves a full discussion \(Plate 143\). 

Two features of this sculpture catch the eye and suggest a new identificatioṇ 

The pronounced ithyphallic character and the brush with peacock feathers, which is held in the ascetic’s left hand. It invites comparison to an image found at the bottom of the seventh-century doorpost built into the Deur Temple in Malhar, Chhattisgarh \(Plate 144\). 22

Hans T. Bakker & Peter C. Bisschop

Plate 144

Lower-most panel in Malhar doorpost

As emerges from this and other panels of the same doorjamb, the Malhar panel depicts Śiva’s entry as a naked ascetic into the Devadāruvana. The earliest

account of this myth is found in the Skandapurāṇa. The description of his

appearance there matches the present panel:

The Trident-bearer once entered that forest for the sake of alms. The sages saw the Lord of Gods there with his phallus erecṭ 23

Like in the Nagarī panel, Śiva carries the ascetic attribute of a brush and is ithyphallic, while his left hand holds a begging bowl ready to receive alms. 24

These features do not figure in the Dakṣa myth. 

In the Nagarī panel E 1 the protagonist carries something in his raised right hand. The elevated position suggests the object is significant, auspicious it would seem. It is held in such a way as if it is being shown to an audience 23 SPS 167.74: bhikṣāhetor vanaṁtat tu prāviśat kila śūladhr̥ k | sa dr̥ ṣṭas tatra deveśo

Bisschop 2006, 195 f. Cf. above, p. 548. 

24 Although the ascetic brush \( sthalapavitra; picchikā  in Jaina texts\) is usually associated

with Jainism, it was a mark of mendicants in general and of Pāśupatas as well. Cf.

that populated the missing two-thirds of the panel. This interpretation of the gesture is reinforced by the two following Nagarī panels \(E 2 & 3\), in which apparently the same object is raised, but in the left hand this time, in order to hold it away from the attackers, whereas the right hand now holds the ascetic brush. Moreover, the object seems to contain something in the first panel whereas it appears empty in the second and third, a difference that might have significance and which we will discuss below. A deer in the incomplete first panel \(E 1\) and a clearly visible tree in the third one \(E 3\) suggest a forest setting \(Plates 143, 146\). 

Plate 145

Plate 146

Second panel from the left \(E 2\)

Third panel from the left \(E 3\)

That this forest in the Nagarī panel is also the Devadāruvana, follows from

another significant difference between the first panel on the one hand and the second and third panels on the other: the protagonist in the latter two is no longer ithyphallic, or phallic at all. This is not due to damage, but seems to be an intrinsic part of the sculpture. This feature proves, in our view, that the myth depicted on the eastern face of the Nagarī architrave is, like its Malhar counterpart, that of Śiva in the Pine Forest:

Out of envy the bewildered sages felled the great li ˙

nga  of the god, O Vyāsa, in

the Pine Forest hermitage. 25

A problem remains: what is the object that Śiva holds first in his raised right and then in his left hand? Erosion of the object in all three panels hampers its identificatioṇ The earlier view that saw in these panels the depiction of the Dakṣa myth naturally interpreted this object as the sacrificial cake \( puroḍāś\), seized from the sacrifice, but this could apply to the second and third panels only \(E 2 & 3\), not to the first one \(E 1\), in which the object is shown by Śiva. 26

The hand gesture in this panel recalls images of goddesses of life and natural fertility holding a vase or pot with amr̥ta, the elixir of life, such as, for instance, the maiden on the stūpa railing found in Bhūteśvara, or the terracotta image of

Gaṅgā found in Ahicchatra \(Plates 147, 148\). This pūrṇakalaśa  carried in the

raised palm of the hand symbolizes vitality and natural growth. And although the Devadāruvana myth is all about life, growth and natural reproduction, depictions of this myth in which Śiva carries a vase are not known to us. 28

Another terracotta piece found in Ahicchatra may be considered in this connectioṇ It has been described by Agrawala and Banerjea as a panel depicting a Śiva Dakṣiṇām¯urti \(Plate 149\),29 an identification that is, however, untenable in our understanding of a Dakṣiṇām¯urti \(Bakker 2004c\).

a four-armed deity represented as an ascetic \(matted hair, rosary\), holding a pūrṇakalaśa  with foliage in his back left hand. Apart from the general characteristics of the ascetic, none of Śiva’s usual iconographic markers is apparently present and the question is justified whether we are really concerned with an image of this god. 30

Plate 149

Terracotta panel, Ahicchatra

There are two figures on the left of the god, one male and the other female with hands in the namaskāra mudrā. 

30 A new interpretation of this panel has recently been proposed by Laxshmi Greaves \(2015, 308–13, 450–55\). After a comparison of this plaque with the depiction of the sages Nara and Nārāyaṇa on the east face of the Gupta temple at Deogarh and a terracotta plaque from Bhitargaon, Greaves proposes to identify the four-armed figure in the Ahicchatra panel with Nārāyaṇa. The nymph standing to his left, Greaves argues, is the Apsaras Urvaśī, and the panel depicts the myth told in the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa 1.129.1–

19, 3.35.1–18\), which describes how the sage Nārāyaṇa created Urvaśī by drawing her

outline in mango juice on his thigh: ‘It is apposite then that Sage Nārāyaṇa has been

depicted with his left hand on his thigh, perhaps illustrating that the creation of Urvaśī has just taken place’ \(Greaves op. ciṭ  454\). We consider this interpretation interesting, but conclude that for the moment the Ahicchatra panel, whether Nārāyaṇa or Śiva, 

cannot help us to decode the iconographic programme of the Nagarī architrave. One of our doubts concerns the upanayana  cord. Could this be a snake, whose head appears at the deity’s left ear? If so, this would point to Śiva, rather than Nārāyaṇa. In the present

state of conservation it is impossible to see if the deity is ithyphallic. However, his vexed look and the way the vessel in the left upper hand is kept off suggest a certain similarity with the Nagarī panels E 2 and E 3 \(Plates 145–46\); they may point to a Devadāruvana

scene, in which the male in the background is the seer in a pose of resignation, while his wife in front of him is full of admiration for the intruder̥

We will return to the unidentified object in Śiva’s raised right/left hand later, but first we should have a look at the remaining panels of the architrave. 

The second and third panels of the eastern face of the cross-beam correspond closely to the second and third panels from below in the Malhar doorpost and thus reinforce the Devadāruvana interpretation \(Plates 150–153\).

realized that the terrible calamity was all caused by Śaṁkara. After praising him

with various hymns, they propitiated Śaṁkara. 31

In the fourth and fifth panels the Nagarī and Malhar stories go separate ways. 

The Malhar panels refer to the Devadāruvana myth as told in the

Saromāhātmya, in which Śiva in the form of an elephant plays a central role in re-installing the liṅga. 32 We will focus on the Nagarī story. 

When we pass from the third \(E 3\) to the fourth panel \(E 4\) we cross the middle of the architrave and therewith, it seems, we leave behind the Devadāruvana

myth proper̥ The right half of the architrave is rather concerned with the consequences of the events told in the myth: Śiva is recognized as supreme god, who alone is capable of bestowing power \( siddhi\), grace \( prasāda\) and

deliverance from all suffering \( duḥ khānta\). This is what the begging sages in

the third panel \(E 3\) realize; the fourth panel \(E 4\) shows this new insighṭ God is depicted sitting under a tree, deep in concentration, as the master of yoga, Yogeśvara \(Plate 154\). 33

Plate 154

Fourth panel from the left \(E 4\), Nagarī

The reason that his Yogeśvara form and not the liṅga  is chosen to represent him may have its origin in the fact that the designer of the architrave wanted to 32 VmP Saromāhātmya 23.29–35. Cf. Donaldson 1986, pp. 53–54. 

33 The iconography of Śiva steeped in meditation underneath a tree is obviously derived from Buddhist examples.

tell another story. Realization of one’s aim in this world and the acquisition of \(yogic\) power is achieved by following the path \( sādhana\) that he contemplates

and is ready to communicate to the world of meṇ The four acolytes around Yogeśvara may intimate the spread of this sādhana  over the earth, since they

evoke the image of the four disciples:

And in the present age as well, when the Supreme Lord had seen the suffering in the world, He emitted four men \( puruṣa\) from His four faces and spoke to them, since it was His wish to bestow grace upon mankind:

‘You four should go to earth and become twice-born ascetics; O Masters of Yoga, return to me after you have led the brahmins to the highest statioṇ 34

These puruṣas, the Skandapurāṇa \(SP\) continues, will become the four disciples \( śiṣya\) of Śiva, whose own incarnation on earth is known as Lāguḍi in the SP

or Lakulīśa in later literature. This incarnation, characterised by his attribute the club \( lakula\), is not depicted on the architrave, but any guru  pertaining to the four paraṁparās  inaugurated by him, may be imagined to be implicitly involved in the last panel of the eastern face, since these ācāryas  are believed

to impersonate Śiva when they initiate and instruct their pupils. 35 The four acolytes around Yogeśvara perform different acts of veneration and they do not seem all to be of the same standing. The one at the viewer’s lower right may be a householder, indicating that not only ascetics, but the whole world had come to recognize Śiva as supreme god. 

The following, penultimate panel \(E 5, Plate 155\) shows someone set on the path towards instruction in the doctrine, which is the subject of the last panel \(E 6, Plate 156, cf. Plate 116\). 

The interpretation that conceived of these east-facing panels as depicting the myth of the destruction of Dakṣa’s sacrifice obviously saw in the central figure King Dakṣa \(Bakker 2004c\). In our present understanding of the iconographic programme, however, this is no longer evidenṭ 

Of the three figures in a row, the one at the viewer’s right seems to stand within a architectural structure of which roof and pillars are still partly visible.

Fifth panel from the left \(E 5\), Nagarī

The figure at the viewer’s left seems to be of a different standing than the two persons to the righṭ He is naked and of plump build. His headdress seems plain and his right hand makes the ‘do-not-fear’ gesture. His left hand is something of a puzzle. It would seem that this hand is raised and holds an object at head height, if this is not the raised right arm of the central figure. 

The tallest figure in the middle is clearly a senior persoṇ His left hand holds the knot of his dhotī. His right arm, if it is not raised, appears to lean on the left arm of his companion to the right, while his hand seems to hold something; a stick? It is clear that he wears a high crown with an ornamenṭ 

As a working hypothesis we conjecture that the figure carrying the quiver and who reappears in the next panel is Arjuna, who is being dispatched by his elder brother Yudhiṣṭhira, the figure in the middle, on the advise of Vyāsa, who stands on the \(viewer’s\) left side. 

Mahābhārata 3.37–38 tells the story. 36 Vyāsa instructs Yudhiṣṭhira to pass

on to Arjuna a spell, a vidyā  named Pratismr̥ti, also referred to as yogavidyā  or brahman, which will enable him to acquire the necessary weapons from Indra, Rudra, Varuṇa, Kubera and Dharma.37 Yudhiṣṭhira explains to Arjuna that their enemies possess mastery in the use of all sorts of weapons and therefore, for the Pāṇḍavas to win the war, it is necessary to obtain superior weapons. 

He will initiate him into this secret knowledge \(Upaniṣad\) received from Vyāsa, 36 Cf. Kirātārjunīya \(KA\) 3.10–29.

After these words the lord King Dharma \(i.e. Yudhiṣṭhira\) taught him \(i.e. Arjuna\) that magic, when he was ritually consecrated and controlled in word, body, and thought; then the elder brother told his heroic brother to deparṭ 39

In the Mahābhārata Indra is the first person that Arjuna visits on his quest, but the Śaiva world view, which conceived this temple and architrave, shifted the Vyāsa–Yudhiṣṭhira line of initiation onto Śiva, as we will see in the next panel. 

It is Śiva’s help that is sought first, since only instruction in the Pāśupata path

will enable Arjuna to reach his goal. This is the lesson that the seers on earth had learned in the Devadāruvana, illustrated in the first three panels. We move on to the last one \(E 6, Plate 156\).

Arjuna is on his knees now, facing north, receiving instructioṇ The scene is set on a mountain, in a foresṭ A powerful gaṇa-type

of figure stands behind him, bending the hero’s arms behind his back by his front hands, or so it seems; his right back hand sticks up holding something above his head, whereas the contour of his raised left back arm is only vaguely visible. We will discuss below who this four-armed helper of Śiva could be. 

As we have argued earlier, this panel \(E 6\) shows a Dakṣiṇām¯urti in the original meaning of the term \(Bakker 2004c, 132 f.; above, p. 525\). The neophyte who is instructed or initiated in the Pāśupata doctrine is not Dakṣa, according

to our present understanding, but the princely figure depicted in the penultimate panel E 5, who is there about to be dispatched by his elder brother and a saintly advisor̥ 

The Devadāruvana myth that is told in the first three panels \(E 1–3\) does not immediately suggest a figure that would be the recipient of Śiva’s instruction, let alone the figure of Arjuna. Our tentative interpretation of this panel E 6, which sees in it Arjuna’s instruction in the Śaiva sādhana, needs further

underpinning. This will be furnished by the iconographic programme of the western face of the architrave, which will make clear that we should read both sides of the architrave as one continuous story.

myth. This interpretation has been accepted by Bakker 2004c and still stands.

It accords well with the fact that the poet Bhāravi probably wrote his fa-

mous Kirātārjunīya at the court of the Later Aulikara king Yaśodharman, also known as Viṣṇuvardhana.40 Either he or, more likely, his father, King Prakāśadharman, was responsible for the building of this temple and its gateway. 

The first or northern-most panel \(W 1, Plate 159\) shows, according to Williams, 

‘Nara and Nārāyaṇa seated in the wilderness’. She compares it with the great Deogarh relief \(Plate 160\). 

The scene interpreted in this way may represent the dialogue between both seers as given in the Mahābhārata. 41 The function of this piece of Vaiṣṇava

philosophy, however, within the story told in the Nagarī architrave remains entirely obscure. In the Deogarh relief, the scene is overseen by Brahmā, who

had sent both seers to earth to fight demons.

armed. The scene is set in the mountains, where the rest of the Kirātārjunīya

myth takes place. A lion is visible in a mountain cave at the fooṭ 

Despite the striking similarities between the Deogarh and Nagarī panels, we are not convinced that the figure to the left of Arjuna is indeed Nārāyaṇa. 

Instead we think it more likely that the person Arjuna is speaking to is ‘the ascetic \( tapasvin\), blazing with the lustre of brahman, tawny, with matted hair and lean’, 42 who is no other than Indra in disguise. This brahmin asks Arjuna why he has come in full armour and requests him to leave behind his bow \(MBh 3.38.32–34\). The bow may indeed be visible in the present panel to Arjuna’s right side. 

After this brahmin failed to have Arjuna give up his resolve, he reveals his true identity and offers a booṇ Arjuna replies:

I do not want wishes of worlds, or divinity, still less happiness, nor the sovereignty over all the gods, overlord of the Thirty\! If I leave my brothers in the wilderness without avenging the feud, I shall find infamy in all the worlds for time without end. 43

These are the proud words of the Kṣatriya, the quintessence of the Kirātārjunīya. Confronted with so much self-confidence, Indra can think of nothing better than to refer Arjuna to ‘the three-eyed, trident-bearing Lord of Beings, Śiva’. 44

The similarity of the Nagarī panel with the one in Deogarh and other Nara–

Nārāyaṇa representations is, however, not coincidence, but serves as a reminder to the onlooker that Arjuna is Nara. In Bhāravi’s Kirātārjunīya \(12.33\) Śiva

explains to the seers that Arjuna is in fact an incarnation of Nara, a part of the Primaeval Man \( ādipuruṣa\). And, he says, there is Acyuta. Nara and Acyuta have been asked by Brahmā to go among men to protect creation by killing

demons, 45 but ‘Nārāyaṇa’ as such does not figure in Bhāravi’s work. 

Nara is said to have been created by Deva Nīlalohita in Skandapurāṇa 6. 

He had issued from the mirror image of Viṣṇu, who was reflected in the blood that the latter had himself donated to Nīlalohita’s begging bowl. This begging bowl is said in SP 6.1 to be Brahmā’s Head \( brahmaṇaḥ śiraḥ \), that is, his fifth

one, which had been chopped off in SP 5 and was then used by Śiva/Nīlalohita on his rounds for alms. 46

After Deva \(i.e. Nīlalohita\) has seen \(Viṣṇu’s\) reflection in the liquid \( rasa\) within the skull \( kapāla\), he issues forth \(a\) man \( puruṣa\) resembling Viṣṇu in strength.

He says to him: You \(shall\) be immortal, exempt from old age and decay and invincible on the battle field; Viṣṇu will be your best friend, and you \(shall\) live with him performing divine tasks. 

Because you are born from the ‘waters’ \( nārā\) that rose from Viṣṇu’s body, you

shall be called Nara \(i.e. ‘man’\) and be dear to him. 47

Evidently these two sixth-century Śaiva, i.e. Pāśupata, texts play down Viṣṇu’s

role; the story told in the Nagarī architrave might do just the same. 

With Arjuna we move from Mount Indrakīla, where the meeting with Indra had taken place \(MBh 3.38.30\), to Mount Himavat \(MBh 3.39.11\), where the extreme tapas  will take place, illustrated in the second panel \(W 2, Plate 161\). 

Plate 161

If we follow the Mahābhārata story, the seers, afraid of Arjuna’s ascetic

powers, go to Mahādeva, who acknowledges Arjuna’s mortifications and gives his approval:

The Great Lord said: ‘Swiftly return in joyous spirit and unwearied whence you have come. I do know the intention that is lodged in his mind. He does not desire heaven, nor sovereignty, nor long life; this very day I shall accomplish what he desireṣ’ 49

We tentatively propose that it is this important moment of Śiva’s consent \(and his resolve to put him to the test first\) that has been depicted in this panel. It is also conceivable that the figure of Śiva here is a representation of Arjuna’s thoughṭ 

The figure seems to be four-armed, though only three are visible; his left back hand, if that is what it is, is raised and carries an object not unlike the mysterious object in the first three panels of the eastern face of the architrave \(E 1–3\). We postpone the discussion of this object and move on to the third panel \(W 3\), in which the test starts off. 

The scene in this third panel from the left is without problems \(Plate 162\).

received them with a tranquil mind. \(MBh 3.40.25–26; tr̥ van Buitenen\). 

Then, in the following panel \(Plate 164\):

My arrows are gone. Who is this man who devours all my arrows? I shall attack him with the nock of my bow, as one attacks an elephant with the point of a spear, and send him to the domain of staff-bearing Yama\! \(MBh 3.40.37–38; tr̥ 

van Buiteneṇ\)

We arrive at the dénouement in the sixth panel \(W 6, Plate 165\), at the southern end of the western face of the architrave. 

The Kirāta had been a form adopted by Śiva to test his devotee Arjuna. 

The latter is allowed a vision of the Great God. In the Mahābhārata version

of the story Mahādeva reveals himself as the god carrying the trident, dwelling in the mountains together with Devī; in the Kirātārjunīya he assumes ‘his own

form’, smeared with ashes and ornamented with the crescenṭ 51 Neither of these are visible to us, since, like its counterpart E 1, the panel is broken off at one-third. But we do see Arjuna, no longer as an ascetic, though, but as a princely figure, wearing his ornamental crown from which his locks fall down, very similar to his representation in the two panels at the end of the eastern face of the architrave \(E 5 & 6\). This is one of the elements that convinces us 50 Cf. Bakker 2014, 36 f., in which Bhāravi’s Kirātārjunīya 14.14 is quoted to illustrate the

scene. 

51 MBh 3.40.55–56, see above, ṇ 50 on p. 523. Bhāravi gives the following description: atha

that the eastern and western faces of the architrave tell a continuous story, the story of Arjuna and his quest for the Pāśupata Weapoṇ The other element is

this weapon itself. 

Just as in the first panel of the obverse

\(E 1\), we cannot but speculate on what

has been depicted in the missing two-

thirds of the reverse side \(W 6\). 

The

motive and theme of the Kirātārjunīya

story is Arjuna’s quest for the Pāśupata

astra, the weapon which alone is powerful

enough to counteract all other weapons

and which leads its owner to victory over

his foes. Arjuna asks Śiva for it:

If

it

pleases

to

my

wish, Bull-bannered God, then I wish

that divine weapon \( astra\), the dreadful

Pāśupata Weapon, my lord, which is called

Brahmā’s Head \( brahmaśiras\), gruesome

\( raudra\), of terrible power, which at the

horrible end of the Eon will destroy the

entire world. With it I may burn down

in battle the Dānavas and the Rākṣasas, 

the evil spirits and Piśācas, Gandharvas, 

and Snakes. From its mouth \( yataḥ \), when

properly spelt \( anumantritāḥ \), issues forth

thousand of tridents, awful-looking, clubs

and missiles like venomous snakes. With it

sūta \(Karṇa\). This is my wish, my lord, 

Arjuna receives the Pāśupata Weapon

may go forth competent\! 52

Śiva gives this powerful weapon to Arjuna, 53 but warns him to use it cautiously, since launched against a person of insufficient strength it may have apocalyptic consequences. If the panels of the architrave are to make any sense, this gift of the Pāśupata Weapon must have been represented somehow. Aside from final release \( duḥ khānta\), it is the ultimate boon for the Māheśvaras. 

52 Tr̥ van Buiteneṇ MBh 3.41.7–12 \(above, ṇ 50 on p. 523\). 

53 In the Kirātārjunīya 18.44 Śiva gives Arjuna the Raudra Weapon, encompassed by flaming fire \( jvaladanalaparītaṁraudram astram\). 



594

Hans T. Bakker & Peter C. Bisschop

The Pāśupata Weapon

If we work on the assumption that this boon must have been represented in the narrative of the architrave, we should answer the question how it has been depicted in its iconographic programme. The weapon \( astra\) is called ‘belonging to Rudra’ or ‘fierce’ \( raudra\), but more significantly: ‘Head of Brahmā’. This

may refer, as we have seen above \(p. 589\), to one of the Pāśupata key myths, 

namely the cutting off of the fifth head of Brahmā by Śiva/Nīlalohita. This

myth was known in the last phase of the Mahābhārata composition, where Śiva

is called Brahmaśiropaharta \(sic\). 54

The full story is first told in the Skandapurāṇa. 

Then, ordered by Parameśvara, this lord Nīlalohita, his \(matted\) hair coiled into a top-knot \( kapardin\), took the Head of Brahmā. 

After he had taken that shining head, he assumed a disguise, entered a playful state of yoga and started going around begging. 55

This ‘Head of Brahmā’ is Śiva’s begging bowl and, according to the

Mahābhārata, the Pāśupata Weapon seems to be just that, the Holy Grail of Saivism. 56 We should therefore look for a \(begging\) bowl, and this leads us to the mysterious object that we encountered in the first three panels of the eastern face \(E 1–3\) and in the second one of the western \(W 2\). 

We return to E 1, the first, incomplete panel of the eastern face. What we see in Śiva’s right, raised hand could agree to the shape of a begging bowl or skull. The function of the bowl/skull shown here is not so much the collecting of alms, rather than exposing it to an audience. This makes sense only if the begging bowl is more than just thaṭ We consider it a rebus, representing the word brahmaśiras  in visual \(iconographic\) form. 

54 MBh 13 App. I, No. 6 l. 45. 

Yuko Yokochi \(personal communication\) has questioned

van Buitenen’s translation of brahmaśiras  with ‘Brahmā’s Head’ in MBh 3.41.8a \(above, 

ṇ 50 on p. 523\). Admittedly, there is no reference to the myth of the decapitation of Brahmā here. The Brahmaśiras, like all divine weapons, is a mantra  weapon and should be ‘properly spelt’ \( anumantrita\) to yield the desired result, that means that this skull of Brahmā \( kapāla\)/begging bowl has the potency to issue forth the most powerful weapoṇ 

As such the word may signify ‘the foremost \( śiras\) of the Vedic mantras \( brahman\)’. We consider it plausible that the ambiguity was deliberate and was made use of by the designer of the architrave.

According to

MBh 3 App. 27, l. 1 the Pāśupata weapon is an arrow \( śara\); the brahmaśiras  may be

thought to be the mantra  that makes this weapon so effective. SPBh 98.7–8ab seems to distinguish between the Pāśupata Weapon and the Brahmaśiras when it lists the four weapons that form the four tusks of Varāha:

30 / The Quest for the Pāśupata Weapon

595

If our analysis is correct, it represents the ne plus ultra, the power that devotees who pursue the Pāśupata sādhana  aspire to obtain in this world: the Pāśupata

Weapon or ‘Head of Brahmā’, the Śaiva equivalent of the pūrṇakalaśa, the

source of life \( nara\) and death \( antaka\). 57 This equivalence is further expressed by the fact that in the first panel the bowl seemed to have been filled, whereas the bowl appears empty in the following two panels, when it is withdrawṇ 

The token that was held out at the beginning in the first relief \(E 1\) was thus finally obtained by Arjuna in the addorsed panel at the end of the architrave’s narrative \(W 6\). It is the kṣatra  or fighting spirit of Arjuna and his unswerving devotion to Śiva that won him this award at long last, the Pāśupata Weapon, 

and therewith the power to defeat all enemies. The Mahābhārata  again de-

scribes the scene. 

Hearing this, the Pārtha \(Arjuna\) hurriedly and attentively purified himself; and when he embraced the feet of the lord of the universe, the God said to him, ‘Now learn\!’ Then he taught the best of the Pāṇḍavas about the missile \( astra\), along

with the secrets of its return, this missile that is Death incarnate \( mūrtimantam

ivāntakam\). \[. . . \]

When the moment came, there was an outcry of conches, drums, and kettledrums by the thousands, and a huge quake occurred. The Gods and the Dānavas wit-

nessed how that fiercely burning dreadful missile stood bodily deployed \( mūrtimat\)

at the side of the boundlessly lustrous Pāṇḍava. 58

And we believe the visitors to the Mahādeva Temple in Nagarī witnessed it

too. Arjuna’s pose in the final panel \(W 6\) is one of vacillatioṇ The ends of his cloth flutter̥ His knee is bent, as if he is taken aback. In front of him, we speculate, the Pāśupata Weapon may have stood in bodily form, next to Śiva in all his glory. What the weapon may have looked like, we know from another sculpture telling the same story. 

Joanna Williams discusses ‘a pair of pillars found at Rajaona, 60 km east \(and slightly north\) of Rajgir’, Bihar \(Plate 166\). Its subject matter, according to her, ‘resembles that of the Nagarī lintel’. ‘The remaining face shows Śiva seated with Pārvatī on his mountain, whilst in front Arjuna kneels before the chubby four-armed personification of the Pāśupatāstra, the weapon that has

been his goal throughout the story.’ 59

Arjuna, however, is not on  his knees in Nagarī; in that pose he had been depicted when he was brought to Śiva for instruction by a four-armed figure in the last panel of the eastern face \(E 6\). 

57 Above, p. 589, and below.

Plate 166

Rajaona, column: the presentation of the Pāśupata Weapon

We now conjecture that the four-armed figure in that panel E 6 \(Plate 156\) may be the Pāśupata Weapon personified, not waiting on the Pāṇḍava hero, 

but conducing him to deference. The vigorous way in which this seems to be done could point to the forceful nature of the allegorical figure. The object that he seems to hold above his head may have been the skull, although the sculpture is too much worn to be certain about iṭ But if so, it would make this four-armed ‘chubby figure’ in the Dakṣiṇām¯urti panel a true āyudhapuruṣa. 

A similar allegorical figure must, if our theory is correct, have been depicted in the missing part of the final panel \(W 6\), this time, however, ‘waiting on the great hero’ \( upatasthe mahātmānaṁ\). 60

The Pāśupata Weapon thus seems to be the true subject of the Nagarī architrave. It is represented as a begging bowl made of Brahmā’s fifth head

\(Brahmaśiras\), and in personified form as āyudhapuruṣa. In either form it

appears throughout the iconographic programme: in the eastern-face panels E 1–3, and E 6 \(embodied\), and in the western-face panels W 2 and W 6 \(embodiment conjectured\). A close comparison may illustrate this point \(Plate 167\).

597

The showing of the begging bowl or skull in the second panel of the western face \(W 2\) makes sense. It is not offered to Arjuna yet—as it had been to the ascetics in the first panel of the eastern face \(E 1\), who, however, rejected it in their ignorance—but raising it in the back left hand means that it is displayed as a boon that will be awarded, if Arjuna stands the tesṭ 

Having reached this point in our analysis, we venture the suggestion that within the first panel of the western face \(W 1\) the figure of which only a head and a left forearm are visible \(to the viewer’s right, above the ascetic who is Indra in disguise\), may be the Pāśupata Weapon, presenting itself in iconic, 

that is bodily, and in aniconic form, as the begging bowl in his left hand \(Plate 168\). 61

Concluding observations

Like the composers of epic and puranic lore, the architect of the Mahādeva

Temple and the designer of the iconographic programme of the toraṇa  shared

in the universe of myths. Like textual composers, the designer made his selection from this universe to compose his narrative. And like written texts, his visual narrative is inevitably an incomplete rendering of the stock of myths that circulated in his days. Like a textual author he extracted from this stock, adapted it to his needs and in this way contributed to its evolutioṇ A textual source that tells exactly the same narrative as the architrave and that would 61 An alternative sees in this figure the Yakṣa \( rājarājānucara, KA 3.30\) who leads Arjuna

to Indra in Bhāravi’s Kirātārjunīya.

thus be considered to be its source is not likely ever to turn up. The narrative of the architrave is the text, and as such it shows instances of intertextuality, thanks to which we can try to understand its message. 

Without doubt the designer was well acquainted with the Mahābhārata, 

whose story of the Kirātārjunīya was at the basis of his work. 62 He could not yet know the Skandapurāṇa, since we believe that its composition only began

in the second half of the sixth century, but the universe of Śaiva myths had substantially expanded from the days that the composition of the great epic was coming to a close. The myth of Brahmā’s decapitation by Śiva, for instance, is

only referred to through an epithet of the Great God in an Appendix passage of the epic, but the full story must have been around in Pāśupata circles before

it was put down in the Skandapurāṇa. The same is true of the Devadāruvana

myth. Familiarity with this lore is to be presupposed, not only for the designer, but for the general visitor at the time. 

Arjuna’s quest for the divine Pāśupata Weapon and the Devadāruvana story

are both mythical in nature and as such convey general, timeless truths. As all myths, however, they may serve as templates for human action and their depiction in art may function as historical allegory. 

It is appealing therefore to read the architrave as a metaphor and to speculate on its connection with the rājasthānīya, the Aulikara viceroy who ruled in

Madhyamā/Madhyamikā under Prakāśadharman and Yaśodharman \(between

ad 510 and 533\), and who had, according to the Chittorgarh inscription \(above, p. 570\), commissioned the building of a Mahādeva temple. The educated con-

temporary onlooker may have seen in its iconographic programme evidence of his governor or king embracing the Śaiva religion by being instructed in its observances; other visitors may have seen only the template, the myth, an ambiguity inherent in Indian—and not only Indian—plastic art in general. 

We have discovered the central theme of the Nagarī architrave, the one that connects both faces. It appears to be the recovery of the Pāśupata Weapon, which

alone was believed to secure victory in difficult times. It helped the Pāṇḍavas

to win back their kingdom, and it may have been thought to bring victory to the Later Aulikara kings Prakāśadharman and Yaśodharman of Daśapura

and their allies in Madhyamikā, when they were locked in a deadly conflict

with their archenemies, Toramāṇa and Mihirakula, who were commanding the

dreaded armies of the Huns. 

This theme also links the Devadāruvana myth to the Kirātārjunīya. 

In

addition to Śiva’s stark naked and ithyphallic appearance, misunderstood and causing offence, it is the bowl made out of Brahmā’s head and symbolizing the

Great God’s benevolence, that the seers failed to recognize in the first panel \(E 1\). Standing alone and being despised is, after all, the fundamental attitude 62 We have not found references specific to Bhāravi’s Kirātārjunīya, which was being com-

posed at about the same time or slightly later \(above, p. 588; cf. ṇ 61 on p. 597\). 



30 / The Quest for the Pāśupata Weapon

599

of the Pāśupata ascetic. 63 When the seers attack him in the next panel \(E 2\), he keeps it away from them. 

In the earliest written version of the Devadāruvana myth that we possess, 64

Skandapurāṇa 167.72–80, the ‘audience’ are the Vaikhānasa hermits. It is quite

possible that only these or similar sages were depicted in the missing part of the first panel. The role of the wives of the sages may have come more to the fore in later versions, such as the narrative on the doorpost in Malhar, when the connotations of ‘Brahmaśiras’ either were no longer recognized, as ‘Brahmā’s

Head’ had subsided into just a bowl to collect alms, or had come into bad grace due to its association with the Kāpālikas. 

The exclusive focus in the Pine Forest myth on the liṅga  may therefore have been the result of a development, which gradually replaced the idea that underlies the Nagarī architrave. This would explain that the liṅga  as object of worship does not feature in the architrave. Instead, it was the supreme good that only Śiva can bestow, object of his meditation in E 4, and symbolized in his Brahmaśiras attribute, that took centre stage. 

The irony that will not have been lost on the designer of the architrave and the educated Pāśupata visitor of the temple thus seems to be that, if we follow the Skandapurāṇa, Arjuna at the end of his quest recovers the fons et origo from which he, as Nara \(above, p. 589\), had once emerged, namely the Head of Brahmā. This cycle illustrates the superiority of the high god of the age, Mahādeva. 

When they passed through the temple gateway, the king and his subjects were reminded of the major realities of Śiva’s World—asceticism, His benevolence, His revelation of the doctrine. After worshipping God, they saw, while they were leaving through the gate, the path which would lead to His grace and which held out to them the prospect of the acquisition of the highest good in this world, the Pāśupata Weapon—through steadfastness, self-control and bravery. 

It was this faith, embraced by the Later Aulikara kings and their court, that was imparted to the visitors of the Mahādeva Temple in Madhyamikā, at the

moment that they came to be involved in the powerful World of the Great God. 

63 Pāśupatasūtra 3.3: avamataḥ . 

64 Bisschop 2006, 195 f. In MBh 13 App. I No. 4 ll. 66–67 it is only said that Śiva ‘sports with the daughters and wives of the sages, with bristled hair, with a great penis, naked, with distorted eyes’. No doubt, an idea like this was the source of the Pine Forest myth.

## Composition and Spread of the Skandapurāṇa

An Artist’s Impression

\! 

Friends, if you will permit me, let me be that kavi  today. 1 Allow me to take advantage of this unique occasion to read an essay in the indicative mood. No modal auxiliaries: neither ‘would’ nor ‘should’; neither ‘may’ nor ‘could’. In other words, a thoroughly unscholarly exposition, but a, hopefully light, and delightfully careless artist’s impression, which puts ‘how beautiful it may have been, possibly’ into an apodictic style: ‘so beautiful it was, definitely’. After all, an artist’s impression is, according to the infallible Wikipedia, ‘the representation of a scene created by an artist, when no other accurate representation is available’. 

So it came to pass, 

When Avantivarman ascended the Maukhari throne in Kanyakubja in the last quarter of the sixth century, it may have appeared as if the old days of stability and prosperity had returned to Madhyadeśa. Thanks to the incessant war efforts of his grandfather, Īśānavarman, the cruel intruders called Hūṇas had

been driven back to the foothills of the western Himālayas after a long and

devastating period of war̥ A close friendship had developed between the rulers in Kanyakubja and Sthāneśvara, where the dynasty of the Vardhanas guarded

the western part of the kingdom. The eastern enemies, the Gauḍas and their allies the Guptas, had been forced to take refuge at the borders of the ocean, where they were being kept in check by Kanyakubja’s powerful southern allies in Dakṣiṇa Kosala, who traced their respectable pedigree straight back to Pāṇḍu and his mighty son Arjuna. 

∗ This is the text of my valedictory on the occasion of my retirement as professor of The Interpretation of Hinduism in the Sanskrit Tradition and Indian Philosophy  at the University of Groningeṇ It concluded the VVIK Indologendag 2013 in Leiden, 28

The ancient land of the Buddha and the cradle of empire was firmly under control. Avantivarman proudly bore the title ‘sovereign of Magadhā’. A

Buddhist settlement there was developing into a place of learning of high international repute. The university of Nālandā attracted students and scholars

from all over India and abroad, and the Maukhari king, though not a Buddhist, prided himself on being its chancellor̥ 

The monarch watched over the Bull of the Dharma, which was shepherded by his countrymeṇ The Bull, shown on the royal seal, had in recent years become a forceful emblem, a symbol appropriated by another religion, one to which the Maukharis had confessed ever since they had thrown off the yoke of the Imperial Guptas with their state deity Viṣṇu. Worship of Śiva had opened up new avenues for the imagination and enshrined royal authority in burgeoning forms of early tantric Hinduism. 

Though familiar with all sorts of asceticism, northern India in the sixth century saw a new type of strange sādhus travelling around, who smeared

themselves with ashes and imitated the god of their devotion, Śiva Paśupati. 

A lineage of gurus  pertaining to this movement had settled in Kanyakubja, an establishment founded in the capital by a saint from Kurukṣetra, the ancient battlefield, now firmly under the control of the friendly Vardhanas or Puṣya-bhūtis, who themselves had become staunch followers of this type of religioṇ 

Avantivarman, too, was well disposed towards them and invited some of them to his courṭ 

The Pāśupatas, as these Śiva worshippers were called, made good use of the patronage that fell to their loṭ They set up religious centres \( sthāna\), temples

\( āyatana\) and monasteries \( maṭha\) at the country’s holiest grounds, such as the Kapālasthāna in Kurukṣetra, Bhadreśvara near Gaṅgādvāra, the great Deva temple, āyatana, in Prayāga, and the siddhasthāna, ‘home of the saints’, called

Madhyameśvara, circa  one kilometer north of the renowned cremation grounds of Avimukta or Vārāṇasī. 

A network of itinerant sādhus connected these centres, which became well

integrated with the local religious infrastructure and developed into junctions within a fabric of yogins and religious teachers. The Pāśupatas had had a

good look at their Buddhist counterparts and had copied their formula for success, namely a standing organisation of professional religious specialists—

yogins, ascetics, and ācāryas—supported by a following of ordinary devotees, the Māheśvara community at large, to whose spiritual needs it catered. One of the peculiar facilities offered to the community of laukikas, by at least some of these Pāśupata ascetics, was to extend services in and around the cremation grounds. 

Living in the cremation ground was a highly acclaimed strategy within Pāśupata asceticism. Mahākāla in Ujjain, Mahākapāla in Thanesar, 

Avimukteśvara in Benares, Paśupatinātha in Nepal, to mention just the best

known, were run by Pāśupatas and became key to their success.

on the rebuilding of a dilapidated temple of the ‘Foe of Andhaka’, whose images were beginning to appear around this time. The prince had hired a poet to sing the praises of the god as well as of himself, chiselled into stone, for everyone to read:

May that figure of Andhaka’s Foe, on whose body snakes glimmer, offer you a stable abode—a figure who wears a lion skin that is slightly crimsoned by the light of the jewel in the hood of the serpent \[that is his sacred thread\], and who reddens the white line of skulls that is the chaplet by the radiance from his third eye, and who bears on his crest the slender, darkness dispelling digit of the mooṇ 

He \(the prince\) had youth that was beautiful like the waxing moon and dear to all the world; he was at peace and his mind was devoted to reflection on the branches of learning; he had mastered fully \(all\) the arts; it was as if Lakṣmī \(fortune\), Kīrti \(fame\) and Sarasvatī \(learning\), among others, vied with one another for his patronage: in the world, women in love experience the feeling \(of love\) all the more, if their lover is beloved. 2

Poets were held in high esteem and Avantivarman invited them to his courṭ 

Imagine the glamorous world in which plays like the Mudrārākṣasa were staged, 

attended by the playwright Viśākhadatta in person, or the Kaumudīmaho-

tsava, to mention another play, in which the entrance of the ruler himself is announced:

A son of the House of Magadhā has arrived, thronged by hundreds of eminent

ministers, like the moon enhanced by an aureole of stars, that prince, who is a feast for the eyes of his delighted subjects. 3

This is the world in which Sanskrit flourished, the world in which the kavi Bhatsu, Bāṇa’s respected teacher, was honoured by crowned heads. This court was sustained by the inhabitants of Kanyakubja who, in the words of the famous Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, were ‘honest and sincere, noble and gracious in appearance, clothed in ornamented and bright-shining fabrics’, inhabitants who

‘applied themselves much to learning, and in their travels were very much given to discussion on religious subjects, whereas the fame of their pure language was far spread’. 4 To this court the leading figures of the community of Māheśvaras

were also welcomed. Sanskrit was their language and in Sanskrit they composed their learned treatises and witty mythology. 

For learned treatises and religious expositions the educated classes of northern India looked to Vārāṇasī. This trading town on the River Ganges had emerged under the Guptas in the preceding century as a centre of traditional Hindu learning. The arrival of the Pāśupata movement added to its reputation for

holiness, whereas the collective Sanskrit learning of the town added to the literary achievements of the Māheśvaras.

The composition of the two classic Sanskrit epics was closed by the fourth century. Some of the new religious ideas concerning the god Śiva had still made it into the latest layers of the Mahābhārata. After the Rāmāyaṇa had been

completed, mythology related to the tutelary deity of the Gupta Empire, Viṣṇu, and his popular manifestation of Kr̥ṣṇa in particular, had found expression in an Appendix to the great epic, the Harivaṁśa, as well as in a new type of

Sanskrit text styled ‘Ancient Lore’, i.e. Purāṇa. 

The Purāṇa as a literary genre in its first stages of development dealt with the creation of the universe, the origin of the world and its royal dynasties. 

However, as for instance the Viṣṇupurāṇa had shown, the genre also lent itself perfectly to the circulation of popular, religious and mythological material. 

After the civilized world had recovered from a period of devastating wars and invasions, and now that Viṣṇu had ceded his place of prominence to Śiva, the sixth century embraced a new form of devotioṇ The time had come to collect the mythology of the Great God. In the words of the Skandapurāṇa: ‘Having

heard the story of Bhārata as well as the Ancient Lore, we wish to hear about the birth of Śiva’s son, Kārttikeya.’

A senior brahmin member of the Māheśvara community in Vārāṇasī, well-

versed in Sanskrit literature, an expert on the epic tradition, initiated in the Pāśupata sacred texts, in short, a brahmin with great prestige among his fellow believers, charismatic and dynamic, that man, let us call him the Sūta, took

the initiative to fulfil this wish and to compose a Purāṇa text that would do

justice to the rich mythology of Śiva and his family, that would be accessible to the whole community, and, last but not least, that would validate local claims of the sanctity of holy ground by telling their Māhātmyas. In order to possess

this authority, the text should be in the anonymous, pseudohistoric style of the Purāṇa, reportedly spoken by a sage of yore with intimate knowledge of the Great God’s own thoughts and deeds. 

It happened in the days of Avantivarman’s reign that a group of kindred spirits and literary talents convened in an institution of the community in Benares. They discussed the plan and pledged their commitmenṭ The Sūta, 

the editor-in-chief, began his composition in Śloka verses, while an inventory was being agreed on of the myths, stories, topics and places that had to be treated in the course of the work, a narrative that was designed to lead to the birth, consecration and heroic deeds of Kārttikeya, but could not reach

that point before an extensive cycle of Andhaka myths had been told first—

Andhaka who, like the Mleccha foes of the Maukharis, could not be slain until after an endless series of battles. 5

The materials were arranged in a preliminary order in versified form. This inventory or blueprint, Anukramaṇikā as it was called, has survived and come down to us in the second adhyāya  of the Skandapurāṇa. The editor-in-chief

was assisted by some editors who were assigned specific portions of the com-5 SPBh 130–56.

positioṇ The Pāśupata network was called in to assemble information about places sacred to the Māheśvara community. Sometimes this resulted in new

collaborators entering the group, bringing in local knowledge couched in Māhā-

tmya-style texts, sometimes the editor himself used the information to compose the story. Rarely were ready-made texts taken from existing literature. The Sūta guaranteed the unity of literary style and the quality of the Sanskrit, but this could not prevent minor differences remaining. He also took great care that the arrangement of stories, the complex narrative structure of the text, remained consistent and logical. However, soon it appeared that the original blueprint could not be implemented except in broad outline; the myths and stories composed had too powerful a dynamic of their own to link up with each other perfectly. Here the genius of the Sūta was most needed and he did a

brilliant job. 6

The Pāśupata network was strongest along the east-west axis, Vārāṇasī–

Kanyakubja–Kurukṣetra. It had been decided to begin in the west, since it was one of the underlying aims of the work to cover, or rather to recover the entire landscape of northern India, transforming it into sacred space, a landscape on which the deeds of the Great God and his entourage had bestowed holiness at the beginning of time. The work was well under way—the myths relating to Kurukṣetra and the Sarasvatī, Sthāneśvara, Bhadreśvara and Kanakhala, and Vārāṇasī itself had been composed, and the Vindhyavāsinī Cycle was drafted—

when political reality threatened to disrupt the literary activity. A joint attack from the east and the southwest brought to an end the rule of the Maukharis, just when Grahavarman had succeeded his father Avantivarman, while that of its allies in Thanesar was shaking on its foundations. For a while Benares came under the control of the easterners, the Gauḍas. 

A young prince, a kumāra  from Sthāneśvara, installed as chief of the army

on the banks of the Sarasvatī, as it were the embodiment of Skanda himself, came to the rescue of the kingdom of Kanyakubja. In a war that lasted several years, Harṣavardhana succeeded in pushing the Gauḍas under their king

‘Moon’, Śaśāṅka, back across the rivers Soṇa and Gaṇḍakī. 

In about ad 606, the political situation had stabilized enough to organize a magnificent royal coronation ceremony. Harṣavardhana was enthroned in Kanyakubja. It would take Harṣa six more years, however, to consolidate his sovereignty over the combined hereditary lands of the Vardhanas and Maukharis, including Magadhā, and before finally, to paraphrase the closing metaphor of Harṣa’s Deeds sung by the greatest writer of the time, Bāṇa—‘After a day of bloody contest, at the fall of night, while the sinking sun crimsoned the sky and the waters of the ocean, the Fame of his House, the Glory of his Rule, and the Force of his Destiny united to hand over to him a pale-looking Mooṇ’

6 An illustration of this intricate process is the inclusion of the legend of the seven brahmins into the Vindhyavāsinī Cycle, for which see Yokochi’s Introduction SP III, 15–22.

Vārāṇasī was back in the kingdom of Kanyakubja, but the new political situation had an effect on the perspective and scope of the composition in progress. 

To begin with, the historical consecration of a young prince \( kumāra\) on the

banks of the Sarasvatī to lead an army against the Gauḍa king Moon \( śaśāṅka\), reflected the mythology of Skanda, the main subject of the Purāṇa—Skanda, 

the god of war, who, after his consecration as General \( senāpati\) on the banks

of the same river, led the Devas against the Asuras in order to destroy the demon king Star \( tāraka\). 7 The composers decided to bring their work to the attention of King Harṣavardhana, soliciting his blessing. After all, Harṣa himself confessed to be a paramamāheśvara, and his court offered a venue to

the most promising literary men of the country, among whom was the king himself. 

Secondly, the king’s military successes against Gauḍa called attention to the east, bringing a Śaiva settlement in western Gauḍa within the purview of the composers. The Sūta, or his successor, made the decision to conclude

the sanctification of the sacred landscape of northern India in Koṭivarṣa, an important commercial and religious centre in the province of Puṇḍra, which was situated 80 km northeast of the army camp of King Harṣa on the Lower Ganges, the camp where the king would eventually meet the Chinese pilgrim. 

The concluding chapters of the Purāṇa were reserved for philosophy and an

exposition of Pāśupata yoga, which, along with devotion and pilgrimage, would bring the Māheśvara, yogin and layman alike, to paradise, the City of Śiva at the top of the universe \(SPBh 183\). 

The day arrived when the composition of the Purāṇa was concluded and the

text could be copied into a carefully prepared book, a pustaka, that could be offered to the Great God and donated to the king and the community of the Māheśvaras. As usual when a work of such magnitude was completed, a solemn occasion had to be found when parts of the work could be recited and the book could be consecrated and ritually entrusted to a temple. Such an occasion was King Harṣa’s ‘arena of charitable offerings’, a spectacular event that was staged every five years at the confluence of the Gaṅgā and Yamunā. The great

āyatana  or temple of Deva there would be an excellent repository. 

The permission was obtained. In the middle of Harṣa’s reign, when he was at the pinnacle of power, a great assembly of feudatories, Śramaṇas, and Brahmins, convened in Kanyakubja around the beginning of the New Year, in preparation of the quinquennial evenṭ The procession to Prayāga and the festivities

there were part of the Festival of Spring in the month of Caitra. The king rode on his magnificent elephant Darpaśāta towards Prayāga, scattering pearls and

other riches, while dressed as Indra. His mobile court offered splendid opportunities for staging theatrical productions, first and foremost, of course, those of 7 SPBh 163–65.

his owṇ The Sūtradhāra in the Ratnāvalī and Priyadarśikā introduces Harṣa’s

plays:

Today, on the occasion of the Spring Festival, I have been respectfully called by the assembly of kings, which has convened from all quarters of the world, and which is subservient to the lotus-feet of King Śrī-Harṣadeva. I have been addressed as follows: ‘We have heard by hearsay that a play entitled Ratnāvalī, which is

embellished by an unprecedented arrangement of the material, was composed by our lord Śrī-Harṣa, but we have not yet seen it performeḍ’ 8

The play turned out to be a great success, and would stand the test of time. 

But Harṣavardhana was too great a king to hear only his own voice. A date for the first recitation of the Skandapurāṇa was agreed oṇ The Sūta and his

team were offered their platform. In order to sustain the illusion of its being a work from time immemorial, an essential feature of the genre of Ancient Lore, a professional reader, a pustakavācaka, was asked to recite iṭ The first

presentation of the work went ahead before an audience including the king, courtiers, sādhus, monks, literati of all sorts, pandits and a selection of educated Māheśvaras. It was a great tamāśā, going by the consolidated words of the Sūta

and his fellow kavi, Bāṇa:

The sages, assembling in Prayāga to bathe in the confluence of the Gaṅgā and

Yamunā on the day of full moon, see the Singer of Ancient Lore coming towards them to pay his respects. 

Dressed in white silk made in Puṇḍra, his forehead marked by a tilaka  consisting of lines of orpiment on a white clay coating, his topknot ornamented by a small bunch of flowers, his lips reddened by betel, and his eyes beautified by lines of collyrium, he takes his seat and begins his performance. 

He pauses for a moment before he places, on a desk made of reed stalks that is put in front of him, a pustaka, which, although its wrapping has been removed by that time, is still wrapped, as it were, in the halo of his nails, which shine softly like the fibres of a lotus. 

They ask him about the birth of Kārttikeya, a story that equals the Mahābhārata

and surpasses the Purāṇa, both of which he had recited in the Naimiṣa forest on the occasion of a brahmasattra. 

Then, while he assigns two places behind him to two flautists, Madhukara, ‘the bee’, and Pārāvata, ‘the turtle-dove’, his close associates, he turns over the fron-tispiece, takes a small bundle of folios, and announces the story of the birth of Skanda, of his friendliness towards brahmins, his glory and his heroism, greater than that of the gods. 

By his chanting he enchants the hearts of his audience with sweet intonations, evoking as it were, the tinkling of the anklets of Sarasvatī, as she presents herself in his mouth, while it seems as if, by the sparkling of his teeth, he whitewashes the ink-stained syllables and worships the book with showers of white flowers. 9

The performance received favourable reactions. After having done their ritual duties, attended the great potlatch ceremony at the confluence, and paid obeisance to the Great God in his temple and the king in his court, the Sūta and

his entourage returned to Vārāṇasī. More copies of the book were produced. 

Small emendations were made and the first transcriber’s faults slipped iṇ The different versions of the text were borṇ 

The subsequent transmission and distribution of the Purāṇa over various

centres of the Māheśvaras added more flaws. The copying took place in focal points of Sanskrit learning, to the west and the east of Vārāṇasī. In Maga-

dhā, some Pāśupata ācāryas  were not entirely satisfied with the texṭ They missed in particular an account of the Lakulīśa tradition in their own country, and, in general, they felt that the holy places in the east and in the north, in Magadhā, Orissa and Nepal, had not been done justice. They decided to amend this shortcoming by inserting an additional list of tīrthas  in an adhyāya

that appeared to be the right place for iṭ 10

While these processes were underway, the political situation in India changed dramatically. What a few years earlier had still seemed far away or downright impossible, happened. Harṣa’s empire collapsed. Chaos prevailed all over northern India, whereas the Northeast was confronted by an unprecedented military invasion from Nepal and Tibeṭ 

Magadhā was the first country in which order was restored under the authority of the dynasty of the Later Guptas. The daughter of ādityagupta married

the Maukhari prince Bhogavarman, a wise move, contributing significantly to political stability. And while the kingdoms of Kanyakubja, Puṇḍra and Kāmarūpa were still in disarray, the Gupta House of Magadhā consolidated its power

further by re-establishing good relations with its northern neighbour, the Licchavi kingdom of Nepal. A daughter born of the marriage with the Maukhari prince, Vatsadevī, was married off to the Licchavi king Śivadeva. 

During the last two decades of the seventh century, relations with Nepal became close and cultural exchange between the two countries intensified. Pāśu-

pata yogins and ācāryas  wandered from Magadhā into Nepal to visit the great

shrine of Paśupatinātha, which had developed into a state sanctuary and received substantial financial support from Vatsadevī and her Nepalese husband. 

The priesthood of this temple was firmly in the hands of a local branch of Pāśupatas. They were happy with the growing reputation of their temple. It brought them pilgrims from afar and their coffers filled accordingly. At the same time the intensive traffic kept them up-to-date with new religious developments and informed about the latest literary productions. 

Thus the reputation of the Skandapurāṇa spread to Nepal, and friends in

Magadhā were asked for a copy. They brought one, naturally a manuscript that contained the insertion mentioning Paśupatinātha in Nepāla. The new

acquisition was treasured. In order to preserve the text, the manuscript was 10 SPS 167.163–87.

copied in the century that followed. And so it happened that on the twelfth day of the bright half of the month of Caitra in the year 234 \(= ad 810/11\) a scribe in Nepal could complete his work on the Skandapurāṇa, a labour that he had

undertaken for the sake of the perfection of all beings. It would become our manuscript S . And, if it has not contributed to our perfection, we ourselves 1

are the only ones to blame. 

I began my lecture today with a quote from ānandavardhana’s Dhvanyāloka:

‘In the boundless universe of literature the author alone is god. In it the world revolves as per his liking.’ 11 The scenario presented here is indeed to my liking, but as you have, no doubt, understood, it is just one possible scenario among others. I hope that the reader can appreciate it for what it is and will not lose sight of its speculative nature. Nevertheless, it is the most plausible one that I can come up with after twenty years of study of the text and context of the Skandapurāṇa. It was a work of the longue durée, too long maybe for

modern adepts of bibliometrics, but not so for building a dedicated team of fellow students. A day like this proves that I am right at least in that respecṭ 

Western indologists usually leave the pre-modern history of the Subcontinent to their Indian colleagues. For this there are no good arguments, especially not, if we realize that classical Indian culture and religion cannot be fully comprehended without situating them in their proper historical and geographical contexṭ I am fortunate in having two friends who share this view with me. Michael Willis, the active curator of South Asia at the British Museum, and Ellen Raven, just as active, working in the University of Leideṇ Walking together in the field, or down in the storage rooms of the BM, Michael has always surprised me with cute and innovative insights. They have influenced my view of Gupta India to no small degree. 

Without Ellen and her work I would have been a blind man in another field, one which forms a most important source of early Indian history and iconography, numismatics. Not only has Ellen opened my eyes for the beauty of the Gupta coinage, she has also always found time to answer my many queries and has been willing to help me out with splendid photos from her incredible database of Indian coins. But maybe most importantly, Ellen’s scholarly cautiousness and meticulousness has often kept me from rash conclusions. As a pair, if I may say so, Michael and Ellen are a student-of-Indian-history’s best friends. 

Our study of the Skandapurāṇa has been team work from the early nineties

of the last century. It is entirely to the credit of Harunaga Isaacson and Rob Adriaensen that this project got off the ground. Rob had been my mainstay and support from my college days. His spirit lives on in all we do until this very momenṭ And just as great a privilege it has been to have Haru among my students and soon as a great colleague and team member̥ The critical edition 11

Hans Bakker

of the Skandapurāṇa as it has crystallized over the long years of intensive collaboration is unthinkable without his genius. 

One of the wonders of my career has been that time and again generations of students showed the interest, capacity, and stamina to join our work on the world of the Purāṇa. Yuko Yokochi, Peter Bisschop and Natasja Bosma, you have brought the kalpavr̥kṣa  into blossom. Without your studies hardly a word of what I have said this afternoon could have been spokeṇ To quote an old love of mine, the philosopher Aristotle: ‘In the case of all things which have several parts and in which the whole is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the totality is something besides the parts, there is a cause of unity; \[. . . \].’ 12 This cause of unity, I would like to argue, is the form \(

\) of scholarship that you

embody. I am deeply obliged.
