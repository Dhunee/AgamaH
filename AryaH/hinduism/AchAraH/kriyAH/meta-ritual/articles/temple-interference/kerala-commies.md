> Justice Indu Malhotra is ignorant of public finance of Kerala government,and worse,deeply prejudiced against communists. Not a paise of temple revenues enter budget receipts, while hundreds of crores are spent for facilities for devotees and to support temple administration. - Thomas Isaac

Dear Mr. Isaac, under your term as finance minister the Kerala government didn't even pay the annual rent of 58,500 rupees to Padmanabhaswamy temple for 12,600 acres of Sree Pandaravaka land from 2016 to 2020. In that case can you say that not a single penny entered your coffers?

The market lease rate for 1 acre of paddy field today is atleast 25,000 rupees in Kerala. Going by that logic, your govt owes a minimum of 31.5 crores rupees every year to the temple (even if we exempt the fact that many of these lands are now in urban use). Yet your government still pays only 58,500 rupees (less than 5 rupees per acres in place of 25,000 rupees per acre). Why don't communists who justify this loot by claiming that no penny enters their coffers, accept the salary chart of 1947 or 1971 for their MPs, MLAs & Ministers?

Kerala govt owes more than 300 crs to TDB alone as annual compensation for lands and more than 30 crs to Padmanabhaswamy alone. Another 30+ crs for Guruvayur. CDB, KDB and MDB are also owed several hundred crores. None of these are paid properly.

With no computers, in 1947, TDB head office had less than 50 employees. Now the strength runs into several hundreds and with all latest technology. Salary for these employees are paid from temple income. This is commie jiziyah. Giving party freeloaders salary using temple funds.

At Sabarimala, Kerala govt loots the devotees by charging high amounts for bus fare while keeping the bus route as govt monopoly. For same distance, a fraction of the price is charged. There are bus owners in TN who are ready to provide free transport to Ayyappans. Will u allow it?

Your commie govts took away lands frm temples alone while exempting churches through backdoor (exempted plantations -which were mostly church owned). So much for your secularism. 

You claim right to appoint even temple priests while you won't even audit churches. Prejudiced much? 

For all these years of non payment of proper annual compensation for temple lands, Kerala govt owes the temples a few thousand crores a year when interest is calculated. You spend not even a small fraction of it on temples. Don't lie so shamelessly abt govt supporting temples. 


As for transport facilities and roads, that is the duty of govt anyway - you earn in taxes what you spend. After all when devotees stay and spend, you earn taxes on every spending. And I don't see the govt making similar expenses made on facilities near churches n mosques.

In essence, you are an example for the communist prejudice against temples - which has been pointed out by Justice Indu Malhotra.
