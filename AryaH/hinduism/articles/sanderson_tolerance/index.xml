      <description>Summary of the author&amp;rsquo;s thesis Bulk of the paper is about presenting shaiva view about vaidika-s (and - to a much lesser extant - vice versa), and shakily foisting a thesis of &amp;ldquo;absence of inherent tolerance&amp;rdquo; on to various Hindu traditions.
the juridical view that all religions other than those considered criminal or subversive should be accepted by the state, and the evidence of royal patronage extended to religious traditions other than those to which monarchs claimed to be especially devoted suggest that there was indeed a high degree of official tolerance of religious diversity to be found in the various states of early mediaeval India.</description>

      <description>It is generally believed that already in the early mediaeval period from the fifth century of the Christian era onwards, if not earlier, there existed a single Hindu religion, embracing Vaidika orthopraxy in accordance with primary and secondary Vedic revelation (Śruti and Smr̥ti) together with the sectarian traditions of the worship of Viṣṇu, Śiva, Devī, and the Sun God (Sūrya), to mention only the foremost among the deities that attracted personal devotion, that is to say, those whose worship is attested not only in countless temples surviving from that period in the Indian subcontinent and much of South East Asia but also in numerous donative inscriptions and extensive bodies of prescriptive literature.</description>

      <title>04 Vaidika Exclusivity</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/AgamaH/AryaH/hinduism/articles/sanderson_tolerance/04_Vaidika_Exclusivity/</link>

      <description>Let us now begin by looking at the extremes that reject or contradict this unity. Any claim that tolerance of religious diversity is at the heart of Hinduism must overlook the view of the Vaidikas, whose theoreticians flatly denied the validity of any religious practice that was undertaken on the authority of texts lying outside the Veda (vedabāhyāni), that is to say, outside the Vaidika scriptural corpus of Śruti and such secondary literature (Smr̥ti) as was accepted to derive from it.</description>

      <title>05 The Śaivas’ Inclusivist View of Their Own and the Vaidikas’ Religion</title>

      <description>As for the Śaivas, they likewise seem to undermine the unity of Hinduism by insisting not merely on the validity of their own scriptures but also on their superiority to the Vaidika scriptures and indeed to the scriptures of all non-Śaiva systems. This was already so in the earliest known Śaiva initiatory system, that of the Pāñcārthika Pāśupatas of the Atimārga, whose ascetic initiates were to see themselves as having severed all ties with the Vaidika religion, leaving behind their former obligations to the gods and ancestors to focus their devotion on Śiva/ Rudra alone;33 and it continued to be so in the Mantramārga, even though this later form of the religion, in evidence from about 450–550 onwards, expanded the community of the initiated beyond that of ascetics, important though they continued to be, by opening up initiation to householders, allowing them, indeed requiring them, to remain in this status after they had received initiation.</description>

      <title>06 The Properly Śaiva Attitude of Śaivas Towards Their Vaidika Rites</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/AgamaH/AryaH/hinduism/articles/sanderson_tolerance/06_The_Properly_shaiva_Attitude_of_shaivas_Towards_Their_Vaidika_Rites/</link>

      <description>Now this extension from the purely Śaiva domain of the ascetic in the Atimārga into the Vaidika domain of the Śaiva householder added in the Mantramārga opened the door to a process of Śaiva-Vaidika hybridization, in which rites of both kinds were maintained and co-ordinated without a proper sense of their distinctness. The Śaivas’ theoreticians, aware that this development had the potential to produce a blurring of the boundary between the two domains that would undermine the faith of Śaivas in the independence and supremacy of Śaivism, ruled that while initiated Śaiva householders were thus subject to two bodies of injunction – both the Śaiva and the Vaidika – their attitude towards adherence to the latter was to differ fundamentally from that of the Vaidikas.</description>

      <title>07 The Śākta-Śaiva Attitude Towards Vaidika Observance Among Initiates</title>

      <description>The view seen in the Sarvajñānottara that the Śaiva should conform to Vaid ika injunction only for the sake of others tended not to be emphasised in the later Saiddhāntika exegetical literature, which seems to be more eager to stress conformity with Vaidika injunctions than to justify this from a properly Śaiva standpoint. But the Śākta-Śaiva scholars of such traditions as the Krama and Trika, whose ritual practice was further distanced from Vaidika norms than the Saiddhāntikas’, preserved a strong emphasis on Śaivism’s transcendence,46 even arguing that the true reason for conformity with Vaidika observance was spiritual immaturity.</description>

      <title>08 The Loss of Transcendence</title>

      <description>This double religion, combining the Vaidika religion and Śaivism under royal authority, was from the point of view of all Śaiva theoreticians a two-tiered hierarchy with Śaivism on top and the Vaidika religion below. The theoreticians’ ahistorical and fundamentalist presentation depicts no overlap between the two levels, no encroachment of one upon the other, or rather it uses theory to outlaw any such encroachment.
Nonetheless, when we see that the Vaidika domain has been so comprehen sively accommodated we are bound to look for evidence of a weakening of the orthoprax Vaidikas’ rejection of Śaivism and also of a commensurate adoption by Śaivas themselves of a view of their religion that surrendered the doctrine of its transcendence.</description>

      <description>We do indeed find evidence of both these developments. The earliest appears on the Vaidika side near the end of the ninth century in the Nyāyamañjarī of the Kashmirian philosopher Bhaṭṭa Jayanta, minister of king Śaṇkaravarman (r. c. ad 883–902) and author of the Āgamaḍambara, the humorous play about the religious tensions of the day that I have cited above. He states that he undertook the monumental Nyāya-mañjarī in order to protect the authority of the Vedas; and this commitment is apparent throughout.</description>

      <description>Having established that Jayanta’s view of Saiddhāntika Śaivism as a valid from of religion is unlikely to have been a minority view in the general Vaidika population outside Śaiva circles, we must wonder whether it is likely that this view could have been as general as he says it was in the absence of Śaivas who subscribed to it themselves.
There are indeed indications that an ideologically emasculated Śaivism of the kind outlined by Jayanta did exist and therefore that the great Kashmirian Naiyāyika was indeed expressing the view of an already established segment of the Śaivas themselves.</description>

      <title>11 Aparāditya’s Śaivas by Birth</title>

      <description>A comparable situation is revealed by Aparāditya, the Śilāhāra king of North Konkan, writing in the early twelfth century, through one of the Śaiva arguments for acceptability that he puts up to refute in in his commentary on Yājñavalkya smr̥ti. The Śaiva is made to argue that since the adherents of the Vaidika religion hold that the injunctive force of the Veda is directed only to specific, restricted classes of persons, they can have no reason to deny that the Śaiva scriptures are valid for Śaivas as members of a similar community of birth, which suggests that its members, when asked why they engage in their special Śaiva rituals, would have responded like Georg Bühler’s Śaiva brahmin informants in Kashmir in 1875 that they attached no special importance to them but did them because this was the long-established custom of their community.</description>

      <description>In Jayanta’s play Āgamaḍambara we have seen the uncompromising Vaidika camp attempt and fail to impose its Manu-inspired vision of a society free of all but properly Vaidika religion. When the suppression of an extreme fringe cult leads to panic among the Śaivas, the king, a Śaiva himself, not necessarily an initiate but a publicly declared loyal devotee of Śiva (paramamāheśvaraḥ),93 who had at the beginning of his reign founded temples for the installation of Śivas whose names incorporated those of himself (Śaṇkaragaurīśvara) 94 and his chief queen (Sugandheśvara), intervenes and ensures that the status quo is maintained.</description>

      <description>The emergence of the orthoprax consensus reported by Jayanta and confirmed by other evidence, in which Vaidikas, Vaiṣṇavas, and Śaivas were seen by others and themselves as equipolent aspects of a single loosely defined faith, the juridical view that all religions other than those considered criminal or subversive should be accepted by the state, and the evidence of royal patronage extended to religious traditions other than those to which monarchs claimed to be especially devoted suggest that there was indeed a high degree of official tolerance of religious diversity to be found in the various states of early mediaeval India.</description>
