## Disease-Producing Spirit Possession
The Caraka-Saṃhitā, the oldest of the major āyurvedic texts,1 mentions three kinds of therapy (cikitsā): daivavyapāśraya (spiritual), yuktivyapāśraya (rational), and sattvāvajaya (psychological).2 Regardless of readily available (and well-known) definitions of these terms in canonical āyurvedic texts, practicing physicians most often quote the following Sanskrit verse as a prelude to any discussion of the treatment of mental illness, including those diagnosed as caused or exacerbated by spirit possession:

janmāntarakṛtam pāpaṃ vyādhirūpeṇa jāyate |  
tacchāntair aushadhaiḥ dānaiḥ japahomārcanādibhiḥ ||  
When it takes the form of disease, a moral transgression effected in another birth may be overcome through rituals of pacification [śānta], medicines [auṣadha], gift giving [dāna], repetition of the name of god [japa], fire offerings [homa], temple offerings [arcana], etc.3

This verse is used conventionally to explain daivavyapāśrayacikitsā (treatment based on daiva or fate, “spiritual” treatment employed to alleviate the effects of karma or actions performed in past births).4 Although a detailed discussion of the specifics of daivavyapāśraya- (and yuktivyapāśraya-) cikitsā is given later in this chapter,5 the verse, for us too, is a window into the general subject of mental illness, specifically disease-producing spirit possession.

This chapter is organized around the general theme of bhūtavidyā, the vidyā (science) of bhūtas (existent beings),6 most of which are invisible or assumed to be inhabiting other beings, the most important of which is humans, and are believed to cause various diseases, including certain forms of mental illness. This is a vast subject in India, but the present discussion examines only a few of the many texts within a surprising number of genres in which this is delineated. These include the Atharvaveda (AV) and its ancillary texts, the first millennium C.E. canonical āyurvedic texs, certain Tantras and dharmaśāstra texts, and texts otherwise regarded as philosophical. In Chapter 6, we examined a bhūtavidyā section from the Mahābhārata (MBh, 3.216–219). This is augmented in the present material. After discussions and translations of the key passages in the early āyurvedic texts and a complementary passage in the Sāṃkhyakārikā, we discuss certain modern interpretations of the āyurvedic passages, employing an important early Tibetan medical text as a counterpoint. Then we expand the discussion to include material on bhūtavidyā from the tantric and dharmasastra texts, as well as from a few contemporary ethnographies. The primary purpose of this examination, as of much of the remaining parts of the chapter, is to illustrate that India has a long history of viewing disease-producing spirit possession in moral terms: that behavior, viewed within a framework of moral concern, is a major component in the diagnosis of mental illness, more specifically in the diagnosis of spirit possession.7 Along the way it is necessary to discuss at length terms used for certain important possessors, in particular the graha and the piśāca. The chapter closes with discussions of diagnosis and treatment, drawn from both classical āyurvedic texts and contemporary practice, which do not always coincide. It would be a mistake to assume that the āyurvedic texts and traditions are invariable, unchanging, in agreement, or applied consistently in practice. Indeed, in response to changing cultural and intellectual practices, these traditions increasingly embraced elements of Tantra, dharmasāstra, and unclassified local practices, producing a mosaic around bhūtavidyā that, like so much of Indian praxis, leaves everything different, yet somehow the same.

Because possession was widely regarded as an affliction, whether for good or ill, it was medicalized very early. Āyurvedic texts of all periods locate possession within a category of pathology called unmāda (madness), though it is commonly known in āyurvedic circles more sanguinely as mānasika-roga (mental illness). Within that category, possession is regarded as an affliction that enters a person from outside, a condition with “exogenous” (āgantuka) causes,8 beyond the scope of identifiable medical or social pathology. In this way, it was regarded as suffering of divine origin (adhidaivika duḥkha), “effected by providential causes or acts of the gods, that is, factors that are beyond human control.”9 This view is expressed consistently from the early compendia of Caraka, Susruta, and Vāgbhaṭa, through the later commentaries and independent āyurvedic treatises of the mid- to late second millennium.

Complementary to this viewpoint, a theoretical system of bhūtavidyā developed. This was not a static concept, and, as we shall see, it went through significant changes over time, eventually becoming, more plainly, a demonology in which increasingly feral or bluntly amoral nonhuman beings were identified and classified. This helped foster an environment of spirit healing that was characterized by a great variation in pharmacological, ritual, and social modalities, many of which we discuss here.

## Bhūtavidyā: Vedic and Āyurvedic Demonologies

The history of bhūtavidyā can be extended back to the early vedic period, in which, in the Ṛgveda (ṚV), the gods (deva, sura) were distinguished from their archenemies (asura, dānava), and in which the battle between the gods and demons was eternally fought, often to a standstill, though with a slight, if temporary, advantage to the gods. The ṚV identifies other categories of ethereal beings as well, who opposed humanity rather than the gods. In form they were anthropomorphic but, like the gods, insubstantial or, more accurately, endowed with a different substantiality. Among the most important of these beings were the gandharva, rakṣas, yātu or yātudhāna, and, later, the piśāca.10

The term bhūtavidyā first appears in Chāndogya Upaniṣad (ChU) 7.1.2, a text of the seventh century B.C.E. or perhaps a century or two later, where it is listed along with other vidyās including the Vedas, Purāṇas, divine knowledge (devavidyā), and understanding of brahman (brahmavidya).11 It is probable that at this date the term bhūta indicated any type of being, animate or otherwise, visible or otherwise, as certain texts describing domestic ritual (Gṛhyasūtras) prescribe offerings of water to be made to all beings, including deities, heaven and earth, days and nights, the year and its divisions, lunar asterisms, the spatial midregion, the syllable om, numbers, oceans, rivers, mountains, trees, serpents, and birds. In addition, the following celestial, semi-celestial, and other bhūtas are to receive similar offerings: apsaras, gandharva, nāga, siddha, sādhya, vipra (viz. brahmans), yakṣa, and rakṣas, as well as cows, ancestors, and teachers, both living and long deceased.12 Thus, by the mid-first millennium B.C.E. the word bhūta was applied to all manner of perceived ontological entities, including “spirits.” Bhūta may also have signified beings allied with an “element” (also indicated by the word bhūta), hence used to “personify the elemental fragments of creation, infinite in number.”13

One hymn of the ṚV (10.162) makes it clear that both the female body and fetuses were considered to be at great risk of possession by an exotic being, a rákṣas further identified as an ámīva, a flesh eater (kravydam, 10.162.2) that separates the thighs and enters the womb while the husband and wife are sleeping together, in order to lick the inside of the womb (10.162.4) and, presumably, destroy the fetus.14 This was likely a precedent to the florid demonology in the MBh section on skandagarahas (child-snatchers) examined earlier, and similar pediatric sections of āyurvedic texts we examine more closely here. The ṚV, AV, and Yajurveda (YV) saṃhitās speak not only of spirits but of diseases, demons, and the punishments of Varuṇa and other deities pervading or overpowering the individual. As several scholars have pointed out, deities and spirits do not necessarily work against each other, nor do gods uniformly represent order while spirits represent resistance. As Shail Mayaram notes, spirit possession can “reproduce hegemony and hierarchy, [while] gods and goddesses, on the other hand, can sometimes be countercultural.”15 This is certainly the case in ancient and classical India, where reversals are as much the rule as the exception16 and is nowhere more transparent than in the āyurvedic texts, in which deity possession is medicalized in the same way as spirit possession.

The ṚV (10.161.1) speaks of a grhī: a female spirit that seizes people, causing death, disease, and fainting.

muñcmi tvā havíṣā jvanāya kám ajñātayakṣmd utá rājayakṣmt |  
grhir jagrha yádi vaitád enaṃ tásyā indrāgnī prá mumuktam enam ||  
With this oblation I free you from unknown yákṣma [consumption] and royal yákṣma. Or if the grasper [grhī] has seized [jagrha] him, free him from her, O Indra and Agni.17

This feminine grasper is further mentioned in the Saunaka recension of the AV (AVŚ 16.5.1), where Sleep (svápna) is identified as her son. This is reminiscent of later analyses of possession, for example in tantric texts, where sleep and other forms of extinguished memory or obliterated personality, such as fainting, are described as symptoms of possession. Finally, one passage from the vedic Śrautasūtras recommends that if a person who is possessed (“touched”) by a spirit (bhūtopaspṛṣṭa) speaks during the performance of the pravargya, an important rite preceding the main ritual of the soma sacrifice,18 the adhvaryu or chief officiant should offer a stick lit at both ends into the āhavanīya (eastern fire), reciting mantras first to Agni (Taittirīya Āraṇyaka [TĀ] 4.28), then directing the words of the piśāca-possessed person to follow (and) possess (anvāvisya) the enemies of the sacrificer, urging death upon them (TĀ 4.21).19

The AV, as must be expected of a vedic saṃhitā, does not systematically discuss either bhūtavidyā or possession. Nevertheless, bhūtavidyā became more prominent in the medical sections of the AV, while the text mentions possession and remedial measures only casually. In spite of this, the allied sciences of Āyurveda, developed much later, always regarded the AV as their source text, as the inaugural text on Āyurveda.20 In several instances (AVŚ 1.16, 2.4, 3.9), the text provides mantras designed to empower amulets that are to be used to overcome víṣkandhas (disorders or disturbances caused by invasive and malevolent rákṣases [demonic beings in general] or piśācás [flesh-eating demons]).21 Other hymns (e.g. AVŚ 4.20, 5.29) reveal an awareness of malevolent ethereal beings, including piśācás and yātudhnas (wandering ethereal sorcerers). Another hymn (AVŚ 4.37) discusses gandharvás and their apsarás wives, beings with malevolent intent, though seemingly not equal in negative force to the rákṣas or piśācá.22 The AVŚ (2.25) identifies an embryo-eating (garbhādám) being called a káṇva, extending the notion from the ṚV that pregnancy had to be protected with great care.23 The most common word for such invasive disease-causing spirits in Āyurveda is grhī, a term inherited from the ṚV and AV. An example of a ritual invocation for the removal of such spirits occurs in AVŚ 6.112.1: “O Agni, foreknowing, loosen the fetters of the grhi.”24 Thus, upon diagnosis of disease-causing possession, ritual was a prescribed therapeutic adjunct to medical procedures like herbal treatments or surgery.25 This multifaceted approach to healing has continued undiminished in India. For example, the Tantrarāja Tantra (31.27–29, 67) prescribes that a mannequin (puttalī) of clay mixed with earth from a cremation ground, ashes, salt, ginger, garlic, asafoetida, and so on, representing an enemy, be stabbed with a thorn or nail if, due to injury, one is possessed by a piśāca (piśācāviṣṭa), thus dispatching the enemy to Yama’s world.26 This kind of “folk medicine” may be found today in India, as K. P. Shukla discovered while conducting his study of traditional healers near Varanasi in 1969–71.27 Later we turn to further examples of this from the Īśāṉaśivagurudevapaddhati and some derivative Keralan traditions.

AVŚ (6.111) is a hymn to be recited as a palliative for únmāda. Kenneth Zysk sees:

two types of insanity or madness mentioned in the charm: únmadita which implies the demented state brought on by the patient himself as a result of his infringement of certain divine mores or taboos; and únmatta which suggests an abnormal mental state caused by possession by demons, such as rakṣas-s (verse 3). To the ancient Indian, insanity, like death, was considered to be a state when the mind leaves the body (verse 2). Likewise the patient exhibited the distinctive symptom of uttering nonsense (verse 1).

In order to cure such a condition, the healer had to return the mind to the body (verse 4). He did this primarily by making offerings to the gods in order to appease them, in the case of únmadita-madness (verse 1). He also prepared medicines, perhaps to calm the patient, to drive away the evil forces invading his body, in the case of únmatta-madness (verses 2, 3). There is also the suggestion that a victim was restrained, perhaps in a sort of straitjacket, presumably so that he could not harm anyone (verse 1).28

The hymn reads as follows:


1.O Agni, for me, release this man who, bound [and] well-restrained, utters nonsense [llapīti]. Hence, he shall be making an offering to you when he becomes sane [ánunmaditaḥ].
2.If your mind is agitated, let Agni quieten [it] down for you. [For] I, being skilled prepare the medicine, so that you may become sane.
3.I, being skilled, prepare the medicine so that he, insane [únmaditam] because of a curse of the gods and demented [únmattam] because of the rákṣas-demons, may become sane.
4.Let the Apsarases return you; let Indra [and] Bhaga [return you; in fact,] let all the gods return you so that you may become sane.29

In examining this passage, it is important to note that if Zysk’s interpretation is correct, the division it describes foreshadows the later āyurvedic distinction between unmāda caused by accountable pathological factors and unmāda brought on by unaccountable invasive entities. Although I do not see in verse 2 evidence for the assertion that “insanity, like death, was considered to be a state when the mind leaves the body,” nevertheless the deployment of únmaditam and únmattam in verse 3 is striking, and the use of the stronger, more direct, únmattam for madness caused by possession is more notable still.30 However, in the absence of evidence for systematic usage of these words in the AV it is questionable whether this is more than a fortuitous effect of the poetic form. In any event, it does appear that at this early stage a distinction was seen between pathological madness and madness caused by possession.

It is useful to consider the deployment of gods (and, we can easily speculate, demons) as arbiters of moral action in the AV, and compare this to the much later Tantras, which also describe the openness of individuals whose moral transgressions made them vulnerable to possession by disease-causing spirits, a topic we discuss at length below. Sanderson observes that, according to the Netra Tantra and Jayaratha’s Viveka on Abhinavagupta’s Tantrāloka, “Yoginīs, Śākinīs and other female obsessors suck life from their victims into themselves as an offering to their regent Mahābhairava enthroned in their hearts.”31 Sanderson demonstrates that, according to brahmanical thought, such possession was due to the relaxation of both self-control and conformity to one’s dharma. Thus, “these ever alert and terrible powers of the excluded could enter and possess, distorting his identity and devouring his vital impurities, his physical essences.… Possession, therefore, was doubly irrational: it obliterated the purity of self-control and contradicted the metaphysics of autonomy and responsibility.”32

In his Tantrāloka (15.595–99), Abhinavagupta cites the authority of the Kulagahvaratantra and Niśisaṃcāratantra as predecessors to his own symbolic interpretation of demonic possessors (graha). Sanderson states that these grahas “conceal the true self (autonomous, unitary consciousness) beneath a phantasmagoric pseudo-identity, contaminating and impoverishing it with categories unrelated to its essence.”33 These grahas are “obsession with caste (jātigraha), vedic learning (vidyā), the social standing of one’s family (kula), with orthodox conduct (ācāra), with one’s body (deha), one’s country (desa), and material prosperity (artha),”34 in other words, the demons of personal identity. We might compare this sense of possession as identification with aspects of the ordinary human condition to Kausikasutra 28.12, an early ritual commentary on the AV, in which “infringement of certain divine mores or taboos” is illustrated through the prescription of an Atharvavedic mantra (AVŚ 5.1.7) as an antidote for amatigṛhīta, possession by “cluelessness” (amati), another ordinary human condition. Dārila, the commentator on the KausSū explains this term as “one with no idea about dharma, artha, and kāma” (trivargaśūnyabuddhiḥ).35 This, however, does not go as far as Abhinavagupta in bringing symbolic weight to a possessing entity. Indeed, Abhinavagupta and his predecessors are the only figures in Sanskrit literature to provide an explicitly symbolic reading of possession, except, of course, if one considers the entities in the āyurvedic categories purely symbolic. Although the latter is doubtful, as we now investigate, the line between the symbolic and the ontologically actual in these texts is nearly erased.

## The Āyurvedic Demonologies

Possession in the āyurvedic texts has been addressed before, notably by Mitchell Weiss,36 who analyzes Indian categories of unmāda and exogenous disease-causing spirits with reference to Freudian and other psychoanalytic categories.37 In addition, Jan Meulenbeld has succinctly described views and categories of bhūtavidyā set forth in different āyurvedic texts. These textual differences have been considerable and should be kept in mind in the ensuing discussions. Among the areas of disagreement were the nature of bhūtas, their ontological reality, their number and identity, their cultural origins, and what constitutes the discipline of bhūtavidyā, including knowing not just the names and descriptions of bhūtas but the diagnostics, pharmacology, and ritual treatment for possession by bhūtas.38

Weiss’s results, in my view, are not particularly helpful in understanding the āyurvedic categories and, like many comparative studies, make little attempt to bridge the cultural and philosophical gap between the loci of comparison, in this case India of two thousand years ago and Vienna of the early twentieth century. The psychoanalytic prism has the singular advantage of offering an explanation of possession as represented in these texts to a reader with interests in Freudian psychoanalysis, but it neither sheds much light on what these texts attempt to illustrate nor offers an effective model with which to evaluate notions of selfhood that arise from a consideration of possession as defined in these texts. In addition, by failing to consider the emic gravitas of possession, an interpretation that constantly looks over its shoulder at Freudian psychoanalysis unwittingly abets Western cultural and scientific hegemony and authority. As the foregoing discussion should make clear, the etiology and identification of bhūtas cannot be adequately examined in terms of any single theory.

Meulenbeld’s article is of quite a different nature. It provides insight into the complexity and contentiousness of first-millennium āyurvedic debate over the nature of unmāda, which are absent from Weiss’s study. It appears, in short, that the early compendia of Caraka and Susruta modernized the study of medicine in the first few centuries of the Common Era. One topic with which they were forced to grapple was the notion inherited from the AV and other earlier texts that nearly every disease could be personified or anthropomorphized and attributed to possession by spirits and other divine beings. In their attempt to make medicine more empirical, Caraka and Susruta placed distinct limits and conditions on this notion. They were not always in agreement, and this sense of debate persisted through the next millennium or so of āyurvedic textuality. Their fundamental solution to bhūtavidyā, however, was similar: They relegated it to a subcategory of unmāda and conditionally of apasmāra, both of which they believed to have a number of possible causes, including those that were inherent (nija) or explicable.

Caraka (Cikitsāsthāna [CaCi] 3) treats four categories of fever (jvara) brought about by external factors: (1) abhighātaja (those resulting from injury); (2) abhiṣaṅgaja (those resulting from afflictions by evil spirits, as well as emotional overload, including uncontrollable passion, grief, fear, and anger); (3) abhicāraja (those arising from sorcery, including hostile ritual, mantras and oblations); and (4) abhisāpaja (fever brought on by the curse of a spiritually advanced being). CaCi 3.123, addresses abhiṣaṅgaja fevers: “Abundant tears [are observed] in [fever caused by] grief; when fever is due to fear, terror becomes prominent; extreme agitation [is evident] when [fever] arises out of anger; nonhuman [symptoms are observed] in [fever arising from] possession by spirits [bhūtāveśe].”39

The foundational texts of Āyurveda, Caraka Saṃhitā (6.9.16ff.), Suśruta Saṃhitā (6.60), and Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya Saṃhitā (ch. 6), discuss the “epidemiology of possession,”40 in this case bhūtatantra (doctrine of bhūtas), a category that includes bhūtonmāda (insanity produced by the influence of bhūtas).41 Although these enumerations are regarded as different categories of graha or bhūta, they share fundamental territory with categories of personality. This resonance is borne out in complementary sections of Caraka and Susruta, as well as in the most important texts belonging to the second chronological level of āyurvedic textuality, the Kāsyapa Saṃhitā and the texts of Vāgbhaṭa, which postdate the earlier compendia by four or five centuries.42

These sections describe sattvas—essences, personality types, or mental states43—as part of a discourse on embryology, the human body in its development from conception to birth. Many of these sattvas correspond in both personality and name to the various grahas listed in the bhūtavidyā sections.44 From this, we must assume that grahas or possessing entities may be viewed as substantialized or reified collocations of personality attributes. Nevertheless, it appears that the authors of these foundational texts maintained the distinction between native personality and grahas that independently personified these attributes. This is consistent throughout the canonical āyurvedic literature. Bhūtavidyā consists, formally at least, of two divisions (graha or bhūta), though in much of the literature they are used interchangeably, with the word graha attested more frequently. Nevertheless, when a distinction is required, the category of graha is used to denote bālagrahas, the mostly female possessors of pregnant women and children. But bhūtas are almost entirely male grahas that are known by their specified characteristics. Bhūtas may be regarded as subspecies under which no further taxonomic breakdown is required. Thus, the category bālagraha may include sixteen, eighteen, or more varieties, while grahas as subcategories of bhūta may be gandharvas, yakṣas, pitṛs, niṣādas, and so on, without further subspecies. The latter division consists of bhūtas called grahas, which the brahmanically constituted āyurvedic texts have drawn from vedic and other more “orthodox” sources.

This categorical and taxonomic arrangement is represented fairly consistently from the MBh through the āyurvedic literature and in modern folklore. These two divisions appear to emerge from quite distinct local traditions and probably from different strata of society as well. Their odd integration into the Vanaparvan of the MBh and the pediatrics sections of the āyurvedic texts suggests that bālagrahas existed outside the realm of Sanskritic culture and discourse until they were incorporated into the fold, Sanskritized, gaps filled in, and systematized, one for every year, and so on, as we saw in the MBh and see again later in this chapter. The more brahmanically inclined (if not always more benign or better-behaved) grahas were taken from an assortment of vedic texts, reconceptualized in a way that brought them into a closer, even familial, relationship, and presented in a coherent and systematic discourse. Another difference between them is that pregnant mothers and children possessed by bālagrahas appeared to maintain their “own” personalities, while those possessed by more orthodox bhūtagrahas appear to have been consistently overwhelmed by the personality of the possessing agent.

Subsequently, the project of bhūtavidyā, including taxonomies, diagnostics and treatment, provided the āyurvedic texts with an exegesis on, and to some extent a solution to, the problem of deviant personality management. Indeed, through the very organization of these passages, the texts have called into question the notion of personality. In a chapter titled unmādacikitsā (treatment for madness), Caraka (9.20–21) describes in detail the unmāda produced by possession (abhidharṣayanti; lit. “overpowering”) of eight kinds of divine and semidivine beings, as well as the characteristics of people who might be possessed by each one, a topic we address in detail shortly.45 It must be noted that all the canonical texts kept the bhūtavidyā sections distinct from the sections on bālagrahas. Although I am here including them both within the broader parameters of bhūtavidyā (knowledge of [nonhuman] entities), the texts regarded bālagrahas as a part of pediatric medicine, rather than of mental illness.

In a chapter of similar content, titled amānuṣopasargapratiṣedha (repulsion of contact by the nonhuman), Susruta (6.60.8–18) divides grahabalas into nine classes. First, however, he defines graha. “A graha,” he says, “is well-known as an unstable quarrelsome entity that engages in nonhuman activity and has knowledge of what is hidden or lies in the future. They afflict the unclean, [and] fracture [social] boundaries in whole or in part, even if the purpose of such affliction is [not explicitly malevolent, but] merely frivolous or to satisfy a religious obligation” (6.60.4–5). These are distinguished from bhūtas, a distinction that yields little practical difference, as Susruta himself observes (see Suśruta [Su] 6.60.27). Half a millennium later, in the Aṣṭāṇgahṛdaya Saṃhitā’s equivalent chapter, bhūtavijñānīyabhūtapratiṣedha (entities to be known and repulsed), this number grows to twenty (AH 6.4.9–44).46 This suggests that the canon of bhūtas, so to speak, was open, a fact verified by the introduction of grahas with non-Sanskritic names into the AH, a process that has continued to the present. This transition from folk to classical was discussed in Chapter 4, while commenting on descriptions of the phenomenology of possession as represented in modern ethnographies. Here, too, first-millennium chroniclers of mental illness not only did not standardize the list of grahas, which perhaps might be expected of a developing scientific enterprise, but encouraged an expansion of the list. The dynamics of this early interaction between folk and classical are clarified below, in the discussion of enumerations of grahas outside the primary āyurvedic literature.

Convulsions, or seizures of any kind, constitute another condition believed to be caused by malevolent spirits, as well as by planets, also called grahas, that are malevolent and badly placed in one’s horoscope. The general word in Sanskrit for “convulsion” is apasmāra (literally, “forgetfulness”), which is often wrongly assumed to signify epilepsy alone.47 The early medical texts did not consider that apasmāra could have an organic cause. This was only realized much later in Europe by Jean Martin Charcot (1825–1893), the “Napoleon of Neuroses,” an early founder of neurology and one of Freud’s teachers. Charcot developed the concept of hysteria and distinguished it from epilepsy, the former of which had psychological causes and the latter organic causes. One definition of apasmāra—striking because it is not in a medical text—is found in the Daśarūpa, a treatise on dramatic theory, which regards seizure as a transitory state (vyabhicāribhāva) of giddiness to be replicated in dramatic performance. The Dasarūpa states, “Apasmāra is āveśa induced, properly speaking, by the influence of the planets, by misfortune, etc. Its results are falling on the ground, trembling, heavy sweating, and slobbering, frothing at the mouth, etc.”48 Two synonyms of āvesa, given by Hemacandra, are apasmārarogaḥ (seizures as disease) and ahaṃkāraviśeṣaḥ (a variety of self-identity).49 We have confirmation of the latter in the sections from the Tantras cited by Sanderson above, which are roughly contemporaneous with Hemacandra, as well as from the much earlier KausSū. Apasmāra is also found as the name of a certain bhūta or disembodied spirit in South Indian mythology and appears most notably as the demon on whom Śiva Naṭarāja treads in the great temple in Chidambaram.50

The primary āyurvedic texts enter into significant detail on possessing entities. These passages shed light on the manner in which possession and possessing entities rearrange personality and behavior. They also reveal to some extent the constitution of selfhood as conceived by these texts. This makes it useful to translate several lengthy āyurvedic text passages in full.51 This is equally essential if we understand personality and behavior as paramount and grahas and bhūtas as materializations of these behaviors. Before translating these passages, however, we must first describe the nature of grahas.

### Graha: Grasper and Possessor
As Susruta’s definitions of graha and bhūta clarify, the bhūtavidyā passages employ the word graha to describe certain kinds of bhūta. A bhūta, in its very etymology, is any existent ontological entity, while a graha is an entity further delineated by its ability to “grasp” or “hold” (√gṛh). The archetypal “grasper,” which the authors of these texts perhaps had in mind, is the alligator, which in Sanskrit is indeed called grāha. It is perhaps no accident, then, that a grāha is also an idea or notion, and a grāhaka is a perceiver, one who grasps an idea or notion. Consistent with the passage from ChU 7.1.2 cited earlier, if considerably pared down, later Sanskrit literature limits the term to include only these exotic beings and the planets.

In Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (BĀU) 3.2, Jāratkārava Ārtabhāga asks Yājñavalkya how many graspers there are, and how many overgraspers (katigrahāḥ katy atigrahā iti). There are eight of each, replies Yājñavalkya, and they come in pairs, a grasper that is overcome by its paired overgrasper (atigrāheṇa gṛhītaḥ): the inbreath (prāṇa) which is overcome by the outbreath (apāna), speech (vag) by name (nāman),52 tongue (jihvā) by taste (rasa), eye (cakṣus) by form (rūpa), ear (srotram) by word (sabda), mind (manas) by desire (kāma), the two hands (hastau) by action (karman), and skin (tvac) by touch (sparsa). Taking this as a guide, a graha or personality-laden ethereal grasper would assume the role of the overgrasper during possession, taking control of the sense organs and sensory functions of the individual, who would in a healthy individual be the grasper of these organs and functions as well as their perceiver, a complex person consisting of both grāha and grāhaka.

One of the common meanings of the word graha in Sanskrit is “planet,” of which nine are counted, the seven after which the days of the week are named, plus the two nodes of the moon, Rāhu and Ketu, which are held to be responsible for eclipses.53 According to the astrological literature, planets are called grabas because they grip or hold people in their power. The Bṛhatparāśarahoraśāstra (3.4) says, in what is surely a very old idea, “those which grasp [gṛhṇanti], constantly moving in the sky, are called planets [grahāḥ].”54 Indeed, one of the late books of the AV, possibly dating to 1000 B.C.E., uses the word graha to refer to planets, at least as they are represented in the Indian system. The planet named here is Rāhu, not actually a planet but, rather, the northern node of the lunar path, which W. Caland identifies, at least in this hymn, with Vṛtra, the cosmic serpent, thus a “grasper” par excellence.55 An eclipse is also called grahaṇa (bhāskaragrahaṇam [solar eclipse]) in Varāhamihira’s Bṛhat Saṃhitā.56 The grahas Rāhu and (in later texts) Ketu, the southern node of the lunar path and thus not “planets” at all, seize the sun or moon, a celestial act of general affliction that requires ritual expiation.57 Whether human or cosmic, the result is the same: The sun and moon during an eclipse, as well as individuals who are “afflicted” by grahas, require remedial procedures often resembling those employed in cases of possession as described in medical texts. Thus the influence of planets resembles possession by bālagrahas in Āyurveda as well as in instances of pra√viś, discussed earlier. This influence from the planets is invasive, pervasive, and motivated from without.58 Consequently, the remedial or expiatory procedures recommended in astrological treatises are called grahaśānti (pacification of a planet).59

Two other related words that share many of the semantic attributes of possession are vigraha (an embodied image) and anugraha (grace). Both can attract the attention of a person and overwhelm one’s sense of identity. The primary meaning of vigraha, following its etymology, is “separation, isolation, conflict.” One of its most common occurrences is in Sanskrit grammar, where dissolution of compounds into their constituent parts is called (pada-)vigraha. Supporting this notion of division into individual units is its meaning in the srauta ritual, where vigraha refers to a “portion,” for example of soma or ghee, which has been removed or separated from the main vessel.60 Thus, in its early applications it conveyed a sense of individualizing, approximately the same sense it obtained in the MBh and the Purāṇas, where it indicated the form or image of a deity. In the only study of this word, G. B. Palsule states that vigraha “is something which is taken up or assumed. It is assumed by the jīva; it is something external, something shell-like, which the jīva assumes (vigṛhṇāti) temporarily. An ‘avatāra’ or incarnation is a vigraha, i.e. a form of the God which He has assumed.”61 After examining its occurrences in the epics and certain late Upaniṣads, Palsule concludes that vigraha appears in two contexts: “(1) assumption of a form, false impersonation or disguise; and (2) personification (real or imaginary).”62 Furthermore, because it connotes an assumed form, it never becomes a synonym of deha or śarīra, the usual words for “body.” Philip Lutgendorf records the contemporary North Indian notion among Vaiṣṇavas that “the Lord has four fundamental aspects [vigrah]; name, form, acts, and abode [nam, rūp, līlā, and dhām]—catch hold of any one of these and you’ll be saved!”63 This doubtless reflects a much earlier view, in which an embodied form (rūp) is a “portion” of a deity. This helps explain, linguistically at least, the Vaiṣṇava view that an image of Kṛṣṇa is not a “representation” of the Lord, but the Lord Himself (svarūpa).64 Thus, vigraha, like grāhi and graha, indicates an external presence appropriating or “seizing” form.

Anugraha (lit. “favor, kindness, assistance” in early literature) becomes a synonym of kṛpā (grace) in devotional literature.65 The Taittirīya Saṃhitā (1.7.2.3) says, in a passage that is fairly typical of anu√gṛh in early Indic usage, “[I have invoked] her [Iḍā] who favors with kindness [anugṛhṇti, i.e., extends her grace to] people in distress and nourishes [gṛhṇti, takes] them as they recover.”66 Anugraha does not appear in Upaniṣads until at least the mid- or even late first millennium C.E., in a few Saṃnyāsa Upaniṣads and sectarian Vaiṣṇava Upaniṣads, such as the Nārāyaṇapūrvatāpanīya and Gopicandana.67 A typical usage is found in the Kathāsaritsāgara, “realizing that the grace [anugraham] of Kumāra toward them had blossomed.”68 In all cases the meaning is mild compared to the “seizing” characteristic of other forms of √gṛh. The prefix anu- (following along) softens the sense of the verbal root, rendering the seizer’s engagement with the seized emphatically, if curiously, benevolent. Although anugraha never, to my knowledge, indicates destructiveness, disease, or sheer power, a further distinction is made in Śaiva Siddhānta: “God’s grace in its tender aspect is called anugraha and in its tough or punitive aspect, nigraha. It will be seen that even nigraha [restraint] is really anugraha because punishment is meted out only to correct and reform the erring individual.”69

### Sāṃkhya Entities
The Sāṃkhya school of philosophy was rarely (if ever) followed in India as an independent soteriological path, as were most other schools. However, it had a major, even pervasive, influence on the “higher” schools of yoga and Vedānta, on the Mahābhārata, as well as on many other systems of thought, including Āyurveda. Without Sāṃkhya, Āyurveda would look very different; indeed, it is Sāṃkhya that weaves the disparate threads of Āyurveda into a coherent system. The evolutionary principles (tattva-) that constitute Sāṃkhya’s main doctrine are the building blocks of the āyurvedic body, mind, and cosmos.70 Within a set of fourteen types of sentient (bhautikasarga) that hierarchizes beings “from Brahmā down to a blade of grass,” the Sāṃkhyakārikā (SK, 53–54), which predates Caraka and Susruta, presents a list of divine beings that was almost entirely accepted by the latter two āyurvedic authorities. This is not to assert, however, that the SK was the sole influence on the early āyurvedic texts; such ethereal beings were, we might say, very much in the air at that time.

More specifically, SK 53–54 speaks of divine (daiva) realms, the human realm, and lower realms of animals, plants, and immovables, though it does not list these realms by name. This is left to the commentaries, particularly the Suvarṇasaptati (on kārikā 53), which lists the daiva realms as Brahmā, Prajāpati, Indra, Gandharva, Asura, Yakṣa, Rakṣas, and Piśāca. However, the Sāṃkhyasaptativṛtti on kārikā 53 lists Brahmā, Prajāpati, Indra, Pitṛ, Gandharva, Yakṣa, Rakṣas, and Pisāca; thus it eliminates Asura and places Pitṛ before Gandharva.71 The Sāṃkhykārikābhāṣya of Gauḍapāda on the same kārikā lists the divine realms as Brāhma, Prājāpatya, Saumya, Aindra, Gāndharva, Yākṣa, Rākṣasa, and Paiśāca. These are realms named after the specific divine or semidivine beings believed to characterize or inhabit them. In this list Soma, the lunar realm, is indexed before Indra’s realm, in place of either the Pitṛ or Asura realms. The anonymous commentary on the SK called Jayamaṇgalā presents the following list: Brahmā, Prajāpati, Sūrya, Asura, Gandharva, Yakṣa, Rakṣas, and Piśāca. In this list Sūrya replaces Indra, and Asura occurs once again.72 The Yuktidīpikā, an important early Sāṃkhya text, lists Nāga in the place of Yakṣa. These lokas (realms) assuredly represent domains in which beings that possess humans reside. These beings have cosmological roles and functions other than possessing innocent people; they comprise a balance of living beings that necessarily populate the existent worlds. Therefore, they may be regarded as archetypal ingredients in a cosmic soup that blends and separates in different consistencies according to proximity, locational strength or weakness, and so on, functioning much like elements of a multivalent, multidimensional, and complex personality. This is the Sāṃkhya cosmos and the Sāṃkhya individual, the thousand-headed, thousand-armed being, ever-shifting within itself. It is a classical expression of fluidity, which is so apparent in the modern ethnographies. The list of divine or semidivine beings in the SK may be briefly compared to similar lists in Caraka and Susruta.73


The Bhūtavidyā Sections of Caraka, Suśruta, and Aṣṭāṇgahṙdaya Saṃhitās
A good general statement introducing the textuality of bhūtavidyā is Caraka’s succinct description of unmāda:

The general symptoms of disease caused by unmāda are psychic confusion, agitated consciousness, unsteadiness of vision, impatience, unrestrained speech, and emptiness of heart. Such a person, whose mental processes are confused, does not experience pleasure or misery, cannot behave properly or understand dharma, finds no peace at all, and has dissipated memory, intellect, and power of recognition. In this way, then, his mind wavers. (6.9.6–7)

A few verses later, Caraka gives a more in-depth explanation.

Carakasaṃhitā 6.9.16–21:

16.Externally induced [āgantu] [madness, unmāda] has as its [direct] cause attacks [abhidharṣaṇāni] by gods [deva], seers [ṛṣi], celestial musicians [gandharva], flesh-eating demons [piśāca], semidivine protector demons [yakṣa], dangerous demons [rakṣas], and deceased ancestors [pitṛ]; [indirectly] it is the result of incorrectly performed internal and external vows, etc., and actions from a previous existence.74

17.If, as a result of one’s knowledge, skill, strength, and other qualities, one’s speech, heroism, power, and actions resemble those of an immortal, one should declare about him that his unmāda is brought about by a bhūta, so long as the time of the onset of this unmāda remains unspecific.75

18.By virtue of their own powers and attributes [guṇaprabhāvaiḥ], the gods and the rest enter [visanti] the body of a man quickly and imperceptibly, without defiling it, like a reflection in a mirror or sunshine in a crystal [sūryakānta].

19.The time of the attack by the gods, etc., as well as an account of previously observed symptoms were already stated in the nidāna section [CaSū 2.7.12]. Now understand the various forms of unmāda, as well as the times and the kinds of people upon whom these forms chance to fall.

20.1Let it be known that one who has a soft gaze, is serious and modest, not given to anger, does not crave sleep or food, who has little perspiration, urine, feces, and flatulence, who has a sweet scent and a face like a lotus in bloom is afflicted with unmāda [caused by possession] by the gods.

20.2Let it be known that one whose actions, diet [āhāra], and speech reflect a curse [abhisāpa], malevolent spell [abhicāra], or subtle intention [abhidhyāna] of a preceptor, elder, perfected being, or seer [guruvṛddhasiddharṣīṇām] is afflicted with unmāda [caused by possession] by any of them.

20.3Let it be known that one whose gaze is unfavorable, is uncomprehending, languid, whose speech is blunted, lacks appetite, and is seized by indigestion is afflicted with unmāda [caused by possession] by deceased ancestors.76

20.4Let it be known that one who is passionate, impulsive, sharp-tempered, serious, modest, enjoys wind instruments [mukhavādya], dance, song, food and drink, bathing, garlands, incense, and perfume, is fond of red garments, offering sacrifice [balikarma], and indulgence in humorous stories, and has a sweet scent is afflicted with unmāda [caused by possession] by a gandharva.77

20.5Let it be known that one who sleeps, cries, and laughs frequently, is fond of dance, song, musical instruments, reciting sacred texts, telling stories, food and drink, bathing, garlands, incense, and perfume, has red and tearful eyes, vilifies the twice-born and physicians, and divulges secrets is afflicted with unmāda [caused by possession] by a yakṣa.

20.6Let it be known that one whose sleep is disturbed, who dislikes food and drink, is very strong in spite of not eating, craves weapons, blood, meat, and red garlands, and is threatening is afflicted with unmāda [caused by possession] by a rākṣasa.

20.7Let it be known that one who has a primary interest in laughter and dance, exhibits hatred and defiance of gods, brahmans, and physicians, [yet] recites hymns, the Vedas, mantras, and other canonical texts [śāstra], and self-flagellation with sticks, etc., is afflicted with unmāda [caused by possession] by a brahmarākṣasa.

20.8Let it be known that one whose thoughts are unhealthy, has no place to stay, indulges in dance, song, and laughter, as well as idle chatter that is sometimes unrestrained, who enjoys climbing on assorted heaps of garbage and walking on rags, grass, stones, and sticks that might be on the road, whose voice is broken and harsh, who is naked and runs about, never standing in one place, who broadcasts his miseries to others, and suffers from memory loss is afflicted with unmāda [caused by possession] by a piśāca.

21.1Under those circumstances, the devas attack [abhidharṣayanti] a person of pure behavior, skilled in religious austerities and scriptural study, generally on the first and thirteenth lunar days [tithi] of the waxing lunar fortnight [śuklapakṣa] after noticing a weakness [chidram].

21.2The ṛṣis attack a person who is devoted to bathing, purity, and solitude, and well-versed in the teachings of sacred law and the Vedas [dharmaśāstraśrutivākyakuśalaṃ], generally on the sixth and ninth lunar days.78

21.3The deceased ancestors [pitṛ] attack a person who is devoted to the service of his mother, father, teachers [guru], elders, spiritually perfected ones [siddha], and spiritual teachers [ācārya], generally on the tenth lunar day and on the day of the new moon.

21.4The gandharvas attack a person of pure behavior who is fond of hymns of praise, singing, and musical instruments, who is fond of other men’s wives, perfumes, and garlands, generally on the twelfth and fourteenth lunar days.

21.5The yakṣas attack a person who is endowed with intelligence, strength, beauty, pride, heroism, is fond of garlands, massage oils, and laughter, and is loquacious, generally on the seventh and eleventh lunar days of the waxing lunar fortnight.

21.6The bramarākṣasas attack a person who dislikes scriptural study, religious austerities, internal vows, fasting, celibacy, and honoring deities, mendicants, and teachers, a brahman whose purity has been compromised or a non-brahman who speaks like a brahman, whose comportment is that of a hero, and who is fond of playing games in temple waters, generally on the fifth lunar day of the waxing lunar fortnight as well as on the day of the full moon.

21.7The rakṣases and piśācas attack a person who is devoid of intelligence, who is a backbiter, lusts after women, and is deceitful, generally on the second, third, or eighth lunar days.

8.8Thus, of the innumerable agents of possession [graha], the eight most prominent have been described here.

Suśrutasaṃhitā 6.60.1–28

1–2.Now we shall present the chapter on warding off the onset of non-human beings as it was accordingly explained by the illustrious Dhanvantari.

3.One who suffers an injury must always be protected from “wanderers of the night” [nisācara]. This topic was introduced before and will now be discussed at length.

4.A person in whom one finds knowledge of secrets or things that have not yet occurred, or is unstable or quarrelsome, and whose actions are not like those of a human may be regarded as possessed [saGrahaḥ].

5.They may harm one who is impure, uncontrolled [bhinnamaryādam],79 or injured; or if one is not injured they may harm for no other reason than the fun of harming or else because they are made welcome [satkāra].

6.The categories of “seizers” [graha] are innumerable, but the principal ones, which manifest in various forms, are divided into eight types.

7.These eight categories of deity [devagaṇaḥ] called “seizers” are gods [devāḥ], various categories of their enemies [śatrugaṇāḥ], celestial musicians [gandharva-], semidivine protector demons [yakṣāḥ], deceased ancestors [pitaraḥ], serpent spirits [bhujaṅgāḥ], ordinary demons [rākṣasāṃsi], and the class of flesh-eating demons [piśācajātiḥ].

8.A man who is contented and pure, has the proper scent and garlands, is strong and possessed of truthful and refined speech, is vibrant, steadfast, grants boons, and is devout is inhabited by gods [deva].

9.He who is sweaty, speaks badly of the twice-born, gurus, and gods; whose eyes are shifty, who is completely fearless and vigilantly seeks out evil ways; who is satisfied by neither food nor drink; and whose character is defiled is inhabited by enemies of the gods [devasatru].

10.One whose character is joyous, who frequents sandy river banks and the interiors of forests, who is well-behaved, who is fond of singing, perfumes and garlands, who laughs while dancing, is agreeable but is a person of few words is a man tormented by gandharva grahas.

11.One whose eyes are coppery, who is fond of wearing red clothes, is serious, quick-thinking, reserved, and patient, is vibrant and says, “What shall I give to whom?” is tormented by a yakṣa graha.

12.A person of peaceful nature whose clothes cover the left side, who supplies rice balls and water, properly arrayed, to the deceased, who desires and eats meat and sweets [pāyasa] made from sesame and jaggery [guḍa] is overwhelmed by pitṛ grahas.

13.One who sometimes crawls around on the ground like a serpent and licks the corners of his mouth80 with his tongue, who is drowsy and desires sweets made from jaggery, honey, and milk is known to be inhabited by a serpent spirit [bhujaṅgama].

14.One who desires meat, blood, and various kinds of alcoholic beverages, who is shameless, excessively harsh and powerful, is angry and immensely strong, who wanders about at night and detests ritual purity is seized by a rakṣas.

15.One whose hand is raised,81 is thin and severe, chatters endlessly, is foul-smelling, excessively impure, and staggers around, who eats a lot and enjoys isolated places, the cold, watery places and the night, and who is extremely uneasy and wanders around crying is inhabited by a piśāca.

16.One whose eyes are dull and gait is fast, who licks up saliva and other foamy substances from his own mouth, who is sleepy, falls and trembles a lot, and when falling due to injury from a mountain, an elephant or a tree, etc.,82 does not heal is afflicted by demons who intensify the condition.83

17–18.Deva grahas enter [visanti] on the full moon day, asuras at dawn and dusk, gandharvas generally on the eighth lunar day, yakṣas on the first lunar day, pitṛs and serpents [ uraga] on the fifth day of the waning lunar fortnight, rakṣases at night, and piśācas on the fourteenth lunar day.

19.As a reflection is to a mirror or other similar surface, as cold and heat are to living beings, as a sun’s ray is to one’s gemstone, and as the one sustaining the body is to the body, in the same way grahas enter an embodied one but are not seen.84

20.Severe austerities, generosity, vows, righteousness, observances, and truth, along with the eight attributes, are always present in the possessed person, in part or in full, according to the power of the graha.85

21.Grahas do not cohabit [saṃviśanti] with humans, nor do they possess [āviśanti] people, and those who say they do possess them are to be disregarded because of confusion with respect to knowledge of bhūtas [bhūtavidyā].86

22.There are virtually infinite numbers of night-stalking attendants of these grahas, who devour blood, fat, and flesh, and are very frightening, and it is they who possess [āviśanti] him.87

23.With respect to those night-stalkers whose condition is determined by various classes of deities [devagaṇam], because of their connection with that [deity’s] nature they are to be known as anointed by them.

24.In addition, those who are described as deity grahas [devagrahāḥ] are impure, though honored and invoked as deities.

25.Each of these classes of grahas, beginning with the gods, has the nature, actions, and behavior of their respective masters. One should keep in mind that they are the offspring of the daughters of Chaos [nirṛti].88

26.The behavior of those who have strayed from truthfulness is shaped by the multitudes of these [daughters of Nirṛti] who are generally intent on injury as sport or divine states [devabhāvam].

27.The designation bhūta was given to them by the experts in such terminology; in this way the physician [ bhiṣak] knows bhūtas who are designated graha by this term.

28.This, then, is called the “science of bhūtas” [bhūtavidyā], and with this knowledge the physician [vaidya] is very intent in his desire to pacify them.



Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā 6.4.1–44:

Now we shall narrate a chapter on the understanding of bhūtas as the sages Ātreya and others told it long ago.

1.One should take note of a person’s knowledge, understanding, speech, movement, strength, and humanity. Whenever in a man there is an absence of humanity, one might say there is a bhūta graha.
2.By the tenor of one’s appearance, temperament [prakṛti], speech, gait, etc., which one assumes in conformity with a bhūta, one may conclude that he is possessed [āviṣṭam] by that bhūta.
3.There are eighteen types, according to divisions such as deva, dānava, etc. When a person is in their grip, the cause may be immediate or it may be due to a previous action.89
4.An extreme transgression of one’s better judgment [prajñāparādhaḥ],90 wherein one’s ordained life-style, religious vows, and proper behavior are transgressed, may be due to lust and so on. In such a case, one also offends honorable men.
5.Uncontrolled [bhinnamaryādam] in this way the transgressor becomes self-destructive. The gods and others also attack, and the grahas strike at his weak points.
6–8.These weaknesses include undertaking a transgressive act, the ripening of an undesirable action, residing alone in an empty house, or spending the nights in burning grounds and other similar places;91 public nudity, maligning one’s guru, indulgence in forbidden pleasures, worship of an impure deity, contact with a woman who has just given birth,92 and disorder with respect to tantric or Purāṇic fire offerings [homa], the use of mantras, sacrificial offerings not involving fire [ bali], vedic sacrificial offerings [ijya], and positive actions or rites that counter negative ones [parikarma]; as well as a composite neglect of prescribed conduct in the form of daily routine and so on.
9.The gods [surāḥ] possess [gṛhṇanti] a man on the first or thirteenth day of the waxing lunar fortnight, the dānava seizers on the thirteenth day of the waxing lunar fortnight or the twelfth day of the waning lunar fortnight.
10.However, the gandharvas [possess] on the fourteenth and the serpent demons [uragāḥ] on the twelfth and fifth days, while the Lords of Gifts [dhaneśvarāḥ, i.e., yakṣas] [possess] on the seventh and eleventh days of the waxing fortnight.
11.Brahmarākṣasas [possess] on the fifth and eighth days of the waxing fortnight as well as on the full-moon day, while [ordinary] rakṣases, piśācas, etc., [possess] on the ninth and twelfth days of the waning fortnight as well as on either the new-moon or full-moon days.
12.The deceased ancestors [pitaraḥ] [possess] on the tenth day and the new moon day, while the others, including gurus, elders and others [guruvṛddhādayaḥ] [possess] on the eighth or ninth days. In general, the time at which [possession] should be noted is at dawn and dusk [saṃdhyāsu].
13–15.One whose face is like a lotus in bloom, whose gaze is soft, who is without anger, who speaks little and has little sweat, feces, and urine, who has no craving for food, who is devoted to the gods and the twice-born, who is pure and possessed of refined speech, whose eyes blink infrequently, who has a sweet scent and grants boons, who is fond of white garlands and clothes and enjoys dwelling by rivers or on high peaks, who does not sleep, and who is inviolable is regarded as one who has been brought under the influence of the devas.
16–17.One whose gaze is crooked, who is evil-natured, who is inimical toward his gurus, the gods and the twice-born, who is fearless, conceited, strong, angry, and resolute, who goes around saying, “I am Rudra, Skanda, Visākha; I am Indra,” who savors liquor and meat is regarded as possessed [gṛhītakam] by a daitya graha.
18–19b.One whose behavior is good, who has a sweet scent, who is blissful, who engages in song and dance, who takes delight in bathing and gardens, who wears red clothes and garlands, and adorns himself with red oils, who enjoys erotic play is said to be inhabited [adhyuṣitam] by a gandharva.
19c–21b.One whose eyes are red, who is angry, whose gaze is fixed, whose gait is crooked, and is unstable, whose breathing is incessantly short, whose tongue dangles and shakes, licking the corners of his mouth, who likes milk, jaggery, bathing, and who sleeps face down is regarded as inhabited [adhiṣṭhitam] by serpent demons [uraga], being fearful of sunlight as well.
21c–24b.One whose eyes are red, swimming, and fearful, whose scent is clean and energy is bright, who is fond of dance, storytelling, song, bathing, fine garlands and oils, who enjoys fish and meat, who is blissful, contented, strong, and intrepid, who shakes his finger saying “What shall I give to whom?,” who tells secrets and mocks physicians and the twice-born, who is irritated by small matters and has a swift gait is regarded as possessed [gṛhītakam] by a yakṣa.
24c–26b.One who is fond of laughter and dancing, whose gestures are wild [raudra], who excoriates others’ weaknesses, who is abusive, fast-moving, who is inimical toward the gods and the twice-born, who beats himself with sticks and knives, etc., who [hypocritically] addresses others with the respectful term bhoḥ and recites the sastras and Vedas is regarded as possessed [gṛhītam] by brahmarākṣasas.
26c–29.One whose eyes are filled with anger, whose brows are furrowed, revealing agitation, who assaults others, who runs around with a fearful visage making a racket, who is strong without taking food, whose sleep is disturbed and who wanders about in the night, who is shameless, impure, heroic, and violent, who speaks harshly, who is irritable, who is fond of red garlands, women, blood, wine, and meat, who licks his chops after seeing blood or meat, and who laughs at mealtime is said to be one who is inhabited [adhiṣṭhitam] by a rākṣasa.
30–34b.One whose thoughts are unhealthy, who runs around, not remaining in one place, who is fond of leftovers, dancing, gandharvas, laughter, wine, and meat, who becomes depressed when rebuked, who cries without reason, who scratches himself with his nails, whose body is rough and voice trails off, who trumpets his many miseries, whose speech freely associates what is relevant and irrelevant, who suffers from memory loss, who enjoys nothing, who is fickle and goes around desolate and dirty, wearing clothes meant for the road, adorned with a garland of grass, who climbs on piles of sticks and rocks93 as well as on top of rubbish heaps, and who eats a lot is understood to be inhabited [adhiṣṭhitam] by a piśāca.
34c–35b.One refers to a man whose appearance, actions, and scent are like those of a preta, who is fearful and dislikes food, and who has many minor imperfections94 is regarded as possessed [gṛhītam] by a preta.
35c–36b.One who chatters incessantly, has a dark face, is late wherever he goes, whose scrotum is swollen and dangling is said to be inhabited [adhiṣṭhitam] by a kūṣmāṇḍa.95

39.One who begs for water and food, whose eyes are fearful and red, and whose speech is violent is a man known to be afflicted [arditam] by an aukiraṇa.96
40.One who is fond of fragrant garlands, speaks the truth, shakes, and sleeps a lot is believed to be under the control of a vetāla.97
41–42. One whose visage is detrimental, whose countenance is dispirited, whose palate is dry, whose eyelashes quiver, who is sleepy, whose natural effulgence is dull, who wears his upper garment over the right shoulder and under the left arm, who is fond of sesame, meat, and jaggery, and who stammers is believed to be under the control of a deceased ancestor [pitṛgraha].
43.One whose anxieties are consistent with the curse of a guru, elder [vṛddha], ṛṣi, or siddha may describe his own speech, diet, and movements in terms of that graha.
44.One should abandon a person who is followed by a crowd of children, is naked and whose hair [ mūrdhajam] is disheveled, whose mind is abnormal, and who has been possessed [sagraham] for a long time.

### The Psychodynamics of Bhūtas
I must now evaluate two important critiques of the material on bhūtavidyā presented in the āyurvedic texts: the first by Mitchell Weiss, the second by Terry Clifford. Weiss, as we have seen, deals with the data presented in the texts translated above. Clifford discusses material presented in a Tibetan text called the Gyu-zhi (rGyud-bzhi) (The Four Tantras), “the most famous and fundamental work in Tibetan medical literature.”98

Let us first consider Weiss’s study, which summarizes the symptoms of unmāda according to the type of graha possessing the individual. Occasionally he supplements these with psychoanalytic interpretations. For example, with respect to unmāda caused by devagrahas he states that the devas “cause one to see, possibly indicating a paranoid delusion or hallucination, or perhaps an autoscopic hallucination.”99 Furthermore: “In the deva and guru et al. types hyperpious, obsessive-compulsive, and paranoid symptomatology are characteristic suggesting rigid internalized controls, preoccupation with the cultural values, and a psychodynamically significant role for guilt. There are hallucinations, and paranoid schizophrenia has been suggested.”100 Weiss continues, cogently, that the arrangement of the types of graha, in Caraka at least, “suggests a successively decreasing capacity for organized social functioning and a decreasing influence of internalized control mechanisms.”101 To this statement he adds that the sequentiality of the indigenous categories reveals “the psychodynamic significance of obsessive-compulsive, anal personality traits which yield to oral and then phallic narcissistic psychodynamics.”102 These observations, in my view, fail to consider local context, especially for the deva and guru types, namely, possession as devotional practice. In this context, the “decreasing capacity for organized social functioning and a decreasing influence of internalized control mechanisms” deviate from the norm, as he states, but the incipient context sanctions such emotionally laden behavior as derivative of devotional practice. Thus, to label this particular set of psychodynamics obsessive-compulsive, phallic narcissistic, and so on, is to fix both a taxonomy and a set of values on an experience, in this case the devagraha experience, which misstates, ignores, or downplays its cultural locus and significance as deviant behavior. Similarly, such preemptive classification ignores complementary passages in the āyurvedic texts that describe equivalent personality types not regarded as the product of possession.

Let us turn briefly to some of these passages, which present a de facto argument for bhūtas as substantialized collocations of personality attributes. The primary passage in question is from Caraka’s Śārīrasthāna (CaSā 4.36–40),103 the section that describes embryology. This passage details the generation, construction, and development of the body (śarīra), describes different types of sattvas, essences or intelligences, as the final ingredient in the construction of the body. It is important to note that the canonical āyurvedic compendia are inclusive texts: they contain everything from creation mythology to diagnostics to anatomy (as in the present case) to descriptions of innumerable physical conditions to surgery (in Susruta only) to a broad range of therapies, including ritual, dietary, and pharmaceutical.104

I refer to sattvas (states of being) as “essences,” or, following Meulenbeld, “personality types.”105 CaŚā 4.36 states that “sattvas are of three types: pure [suddham], dynamic [rājasam], and slothful [tāmasam].106 Among these, the pure (personality type) is said to be faultless [adoṣam], bearing a degree of auspiciousness. The dynamic [type] is said to be defective [sadoṣam], because it bears some anger. The slothful [type] is said to be defective, because it possesses a certain degree of delusion.” Caraka continues that these categories reveal dominant modes, within which individuality is manifested by unique mixing or texturing of the three. In some cases the personality follows the body’s tendency toward any one of these three, while in others the reverse is found—the body responds to the dominant tendency of the personality. Caraka then subdivides these categories into seven suddha types, six rājasa types, and three tāmasa types.

The suddha types have a clear affinity for divinity. These include: (1) the brāhma type, with the qualities of brahmā, is given to purity, passionlessness, tolerance, good memory, and so on; (2) the ārṣa, with the qualities of ṛṣis, is given to ritual performance and keeping vows and are hospitable, eloquent, free from anger, and so forth; (3) the aindra, with the traits of Indra, is brave, regular in performing rituals, authoritative in speech, generous, virtuous, and so on; (4) the yāmya, one with the qualities of Yama, are economical in action, self-motivated, is free from attachment and negative qualities; (5) the vāruṇa, one with the qualities of Varuṇa, is brave, patient, pure, religious, generous, fond of water, and proper in exhibition of anger and pleasure; (6) the kaubera, one with the qualities of Kubera, exhibit prestige, wealth, philanthropy, purity, and recreation; (7) the gāndharva personality type, who, like a gandharva, is fond of song and dance, poetry and epic narration, scents, garlands, women, and passion.

The six rājasa and three tāmasa personality types are closer to the accounts of grahas given in the texts. The rājasa types include: (1) the asura, with the qualities of an asura, is brave, powerful, cruel, lordly, and intolerant; (2) the rākṣasa, resembling a rākṣasa, is intolerant, angry, violent, envious, and fond of sleep, indolence, and nonvegetarian food; (3) the paisāca, one with the qualities of a piśāca, is gluttonous, lustful, dirty, cowardly, prone to poor dietary habits; (4) the sārpa, one with the qualities of a sarpa or snake, is brave when wrathful but otherwise cowardly, indolent, but with sharp reactions, and fearful when eating and walking; (5) the praita, with the traits of a preta or spirit of the dead, is always hungry, exhibits extreme suffering, is envious, indiscriminate, and excessively greedy; (6) the sākuna, one with the habits of a sakuni or bird of ill omen, is attached to passion and overeating, and is unsteady and ruthless, yet is nonacquisitive.

The three tāmasa essences or personalities include: (1) the pāsava, whose nature is like that of a beast (pasu), is one whose actions are wasteful, is unintelligent, has disgusting habits and diet, and is excessively interested in sleep and sex; (2) the mātsya, who resembles a fish (matsya), is cowardly, unintelligent, hungry, unsteady, passionate, wrathful, fond of water and constant movement; (3) the vānaspatya, whose personality resembles a vegetable (vanaspati), is indolent, always hungry, devoid of intelligence or any of its attributes.

Thus, the texts describe personality patterns as both products of birth and forms of madness. In both cases the characteristic behavior must be manifested as habitual, spontaneous, and nonritual. The only way to tell one from the other, apparently, is that in the latter madness diagnosed as exogenous, the characteristic behavior appears as a sudden and marked change that then becomes habitual, spontaneous, and nonritual. In addition, what confers on the possessed individual the psychophysiological identity of a graha is not just antisocial behavior in the case of a few of these grahas but an āyurvedic diagnosis of humoral imbalance that distinguishes their current condition from their earlier psychophysiological norm (prakṛti). In this case the unmāda may be diagnosed as exogenous (āgantuka) or inherent (nija), in the latter case attributable to identifiable causes other than possession, rendering it medically treatable.

The descriptions of grahas and sattvas, possessing entities and personality types, are noteworthy because of their close resemblance. They elucidate a differentiation not only in order to expose various abnormalities but also to express a sense of variation within the field of personality. The identification of these sattvas as independently or exogenously materialized grahas, which appears to have inspired in the authors of the āyurvedic texts a greater need to describe them graphically, is a kind of cultural phenomenology that in part harks back to the associative thinking of the vedic Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads. The linking of the infestation of certain grahas with days of the lunar month in the AH and elsewhere, and the systematic stigmatization of certain personality types as possessed who suffer from social aggravations, such as disrespect for brahmans, are also indicative of this. Whether one is possessed or otherwise, whether natural or exogenously acquired personality, one can well imagine engaging in normal social relations with individuals of many of these categories, including the deva, gandharva, rākṣasa, uraga, yakṣa, and several others.

As suggested, it is the intensity of the experience as well as its suddenness, which according to Āyurveda distinguishes an identifiable pathology from possession by a graha. In moderation, then, many of these behaviors reflect psychological conditions (as distinguished from sociological ones) that were not particularly aberrant within norms that were deemed culturally acceptable in classical India, but that nonetheless signaled danger that in extreme forms were regarded as pathological. It is for this reason that I question the impulse to unhesitatingly resort to Western psychoanalytic labeling. It is by no means certain that classical Indian sociocultural contexts would consistently yield to this sort of labeling. Thus, I am uncomfortable with Weiss’s full-scale application of psychoanalytic categories because he does not demonstrate their necessity in the sociocultural milieu of classical India. His method might have been more convincing if he had attempted to demonstrate the viability and applicability of a few carefully selected Freudian categories based on a cultural study of Dharmasāstras and Sanskrit literature.107

Weiss might legitimately counter that the fact of possession is not the point; rather, the point is that the descriptions conform with Freudian psychoanalytic categories. My rebuttal, however, would then be twofold: first, in the Indian context they do not necessarily conform with Freudian psychoanalytic categories; second, and conversely, these categories shed little light on unmāda or possession from an Indian or āyurvedic perspective. Simply put, the success of any methodological or interpretative framework in cross-cultural analysis depends on its addressing discourse modes and epistemological issues on both sides of the divide. One thing that neither Weiss nor any other Freudian interpreter of Indic culture has attempted to understand on its own terms is the Indian notion of the dynamics of the interpenetration of the world of spirit with the world of matter. The usual strategy has been to wave it away with a Freudian wand, which, quite simply, is inadequate.108 Therefore, I would not agree with Weiss’s acceptance of Jane Murphy’s conclusion in which she disputes the argument that cultural relativism as a factor in evaluating deviance is sufficient to undermine the notion that there are typologies of “affliction shared by virtually all mankind.”109

Now, let us turn to Terry Clifford’s inquiry into the “psychiatric” aspect of Tibetan medicine. It is contemporaneous with Weiss’s study, but is not at all in the same vein. Although Clifford’s book appeared in 1984, she conducted her research in 1976–77,110 a fact worth noting because it appears that the application of Freudian psychodynamics to Asian medical systems peaked at about that time.111 Clifford, a psychiatric nurse who took such a great interest in Tibetan medicine that she traveled to Nepal to study with Tibetan doctors, based her extensive study on the Gyu-zhi. This work was originally written in Sanskrit by Candranandana, who lived in the eighth century and also composed a commentary on the AH.112 Indeed, the Gyu-zhi is based to a great extent on the AH, a fact that Clifford notes, though, curiously, she did not utilize the AH in her study, much to the detriment of her work.113 Candranandana’s work was probably translated into Tibetan shortly after its composition. Chapters 77–79 of the third Tantra of this text are devoted to demonology.114 Clifford’s project is designed to elucidate the text in the framework of Tibetan Buddhist psychological principles, but she also occasionally enters into discussions of its resonances with Freudian and other psychoanalytical theories.

Clifford’s discourse is strongly influenced by Mahāyāna assertions of the self-reflexivity of “demons.” For example, demons are said to be linked to “the devil of the aggregates [skandha-]—frailty of body and mind; the devil of the kleshas [klesa-]—the devastating power of the afflictive emotions; the devil of pleasure—the alluring trap of comfort; and the devil of death.”115 “In a psychoanalytic sense,” she adds, “these demons are in the role of the id trying to obstruct the super-ego’s higher promptings.”116 The legitimacy of such lightly contextualized statements may be questioned, as they are voiced in an attempt to expose, with a demonstration of Western moorings, the Mahāyāna declaration of the nonexistence of demons (or of any independent principles). To this end, she states that demons (Tib. gDon) are, externally at least, “forces whose existence is a coagulation as a direct result of bad and particularly poisonous karmic vibrations … that on some levels they are the embodied forms we give to our negative projections …, the imprints of mental habits and thought patterns whose unconscious hold is so strong that they are projected, unawares, onto the world.”117

Nevertheless, as a point of comparison, Clifford seriously considers the views of the early Protestant psychiatrist Johann Christian August Heinroth (1773–1843) that mental disturbances were caused by sin (cf. AH 6.4.4 above, prajnāparādhaḥ), by transgressive behavior, meaning “selfishness, the instinctual and intellectual self-aggrandizing ego.”118 This “sin,” in Clifford’s understanding of Heinroth, results from a sense of guilt and inner moral conflict, from knowingly transgressing cultural codes. These mental or psychological substantialities (which, once again, may be linked to Marriott’s “substance codes”) are “demons” that overtake and possess an individual.

Clifford also considers Freud’s declaration “that the Oedipal complex was at the core of every neurosis and that prototypical anxiety was generated by our earliest separation experiences. He managed to place sexuality and the anxiety surrounding it smack at the center of psychopathology.”119 The Tibetan Buddhist tradition does not disregard this, she says, pointing out that “desire, lust, and craving are the basic mental-emotional feelings that affect the inner humoural winds, and the stability of the mind is directly related to the condition of the winds.”120 Clifford defends the Buddhist stance, arguing that sexual intercourse was occasionally prescribed as therapy and that disciplining the sex drive was part of spiritual practice, rather than “repression in the sense that we know it.”121 The defensibility of such statements is suspect, as is Clifford’s attempt to demonstrate that the Gyu-zhi recognizes something akin to the Oedipal complex in its assertion that the family into which an individual is reborn is dependent on the “attraction to one parent and aversion to the other.” A few randomly selected statements like this in Asian medical texts, while interesting and tantalizing, do not add up to a “complex” in psychoanalytical thinking, in part because they do not share the same analytical discourse or scientific paradigm.

With respect to exorcism (bgegs-bzlog-chog), Clifford maintains the standard Mahāyāna position, that the afflicted individual must understand through Buddhist practice that these demons do not “really” exist, even if exorcism is otherwise mediated through a variety of ritual procedures, supplemented by appropriate pharmacology. Although the trained lama who serves as the ritual officiant “has compassion for ghosts and wishes to liberate them,”122 this is quite different from what Vogt found in Sri Lanka, where the objective was “bringing the demons under the control of Dhamma.”123

With respect to bhūtavidyā, afflicting spirits are often said to be victims of suicide, murder, or other forms of sudden death (akālamṛtyu) and are thus afflicted by extreme clinging and panic. Other kinds of demons or negative entities are the projections created by sorcerers, advanced psychics, or black magicians. Regardless of their point of origin or immediate symptomatology, the afflictions themselves are “the result of obscuration of mind.”124 The sheer number of these geks (bgegs) or obstructing entities is staggering: 84,000 (a standard South Asian large number) of which 1,080 are deemed sentient and malignant spirits (gDon), broken down as 360 said to arise from ignorance, 360 from desire, and 360 from hatred. They are also classified as arising from above, below, and in-between. Others are “rulers of planetary forces” (gza-yi gdon), comparable to the grahas that are the possessing energies of the planets in Indian astrology. These are very difficult to treat medicinally, but require therapy in the form of mantra, meditation, and ritual (daivavyapāśrayacikitsā). In a passage that probably does not have an Indian cognate, Clifford states (without textual attribution): “One Tantric medicine used for these diseases is the fresh blood of a murdered person on the tip of a knife. If it is immediately touched to the lip of the patient, he will recover (dried blood will do if necessary).”125 Clifford writes at length of the entities from above, below, and in-between, of diagnosis by pulse, skin tone and texture, and urinalysis—information distilled from the practice of modern Tibetan doctors as well as the classical texts.

Chapters 77–79 of the Gyu-zhi describe three types of possessing entities. Chapter 77 contains a list of eighteen “elemental spirits” (’byung-po’i gdon) that in name largely resembles the list from the AH and appears to be drawn from it with several carefully considered emendations. The descriptions of these spirits, however, can be quite different. Three examples should suffice. On gandharvas (Tib. dri-za [scent eaters]), the Gyu-zhi says: “They come from the zone of scents. They are attracted to sweet smelling things, but also to dung hills and other foul smelling places.”126 The effect that these beings have on those whom they afflict is that “they are graceful and delight in fragrant smells. They like to sing, dance, and play. They love to wear nice clothes and are attracted towards red ornaments.”127 Compare this to AH 6.4.18–19b: “One whose behavior is good, who has a sweet scent, who is blissful, who engages in song and dance, who takes delight in bathing and gardens, who wears red clothes and garlands, and adorns himself with red oils, who enjoys erotic play, is said to be inhabited by a gandharva.” Nāgas (Tib. glu), the Gyu-zhi says, “have serpent bodies with human heads. They live in water and trees. The deities among them guard great Dharma treasures beneath the ocean. They are extremely powerful and dangerous when angry.”128 Their effect on those whom they afflict is that they “have radiant faces and red bloodshot eyes with straight piercing stares. They desire the whites [curds, milk, and butter] and the reds [presumably blood]. They flick their tongues and sleep face downwards.”129 Compare this to AH 6.4.19c–21b: “One whose eyes are red, who is angry, whose gaze is fixed, whose gait is crooked, and is unstable, whose breathing is incessantly short, whose tongue dangles and shakes, licking the corners of his mouth, who likes milk, jaggery, bathing, and who sleeps face down, is regarded as inhabited by serpent demons [uraga], being fearful of sunlight as well.” The Gyu-zhi describes ro-langs [zombies] as: “A dead body infused with an evil spirit. Some cannot bend from the waist; they have enormous strength.”130 In fact, this is the usual interpretation of vetāla from Sanskrit literature, especially the “dead body infused with an evil spirit,” from the Vetālapañcaviṃśati. Those who are afflicted by them “speak the straight truth, sleep much, like ornaments, and have shaking bodies,”131 This is similar to the AH’s definition of a vetāla (6.4.40): “One who is fond of fragrant garlands, speaks the truth, shakes, and sleeps a lot is believed to be under the control of a vetāla.”

The differences between the bhūtavidyā of the Gyu-zhi and the AH may be seen in the following table, illustrating their taxonomies, with Sanskrit translations where applicable:

AṢṬĀṄGAHṚDAYA	GYU-ZHI

deva	lha (deva)
- daitya	lha-min (jealous gods; Skt. asura)
- gandharva	dri-za (scent eaters; Skt. gandharva)
- uraga	kLu (serpent spirits; Skt. nāga)
- yakṣa	gNod-sbyin (harm-givers; Skt. yakṣa)
- brahmarākṣasa	tshangs-pa (pervasive spirits; Skt. brahma)
- rākṣasa	srin-po (cannibal spirits; Skt. rākṣasa)
- piśāca	sha-za (flesh-eater spirits; Skt. piśāca)
- preta	yi-dag (hungry ghosts; Skt. preta)
- kuṣmāṇḍa	grul-brum (vampire ghouls)
- niṣāda	byad-stems (evil-curse ghosts)
- aukiraṇa	yeng-ched (mental agitators)
- vetāla	ro-langs (zombies; Skt. vetāla)

- guru	bla-ma (lama, guru)
- vṛddha (elder)	drang-srong (sage)
- ṛṣi	rGan-po (respected elder)
- siddha	Grub-pa (magical emanation)

It is important to remember that formally, if perhaps not in practice, the Tibetan text recognizes, through use of the word gDon for these demons, that what possesses an individual is the effect or negative force of each of these, not the entity itself.

Chapters 78–79 of the Gyu-zhi deal with two categories of insanity for which possessing beings are not named. In these chapters, insanity is derived more from organic or identifiable physiological factors, rendering it consistent with Āyurveda.132 Thus, it is not essential to describe these here, though it is important to acknowledge that the Tibetans maintained this distinction.

As an addendum to the translations, Clifford provides “A Few Parallels to Modern Psychiatry.”133 They are just that—parallels, and, to her credit, Clifford does not attempt to draw the entire enterprise into a psychoanalytic model. In fact, like the Indian texts, many of the categories in chapter 77 of the Gyu-zhi resemble personality profiles rather than pathologies. Clifford states that the effect of these “elemental spirits—the sudden onset of behavior of a consistently alien nature with little physical disturbance and no perceptible organic causes—corresponds to what the Western model … classifies as functional psychosis.” This statement is of limited scope, though she continues that the effects “suggest schizophrenia and manic depressive illness.”134 In sum, though Clifford correlates certain categories of the Gyu-zhi with Western, notably Freudian, categories of psychopathology, it is not an all-embracing attempt. And this is one of two elements that confer on it slightly more credibility than Weiss’s study; the other is that she does not predicate her study on the assumption of correspondence.135

Since Murphy, Weiss, and Clifford conducted their research in the 1970s, a number of studies have argued forcefully for the “social construction of emotion,”136 a powerful notion dealt with here in Chapter 8 that must be considered carefully before generalizing psychological affliction across cultures. This is not the place to enter into a full-scale study of such construction or such emotion, except as they bear on the topic of possession. Clearly, both the Indian and Tibetan classical medical texts articulate emotionally thick symptomatologies in their discussions of bhūtavidyā. But these pools of emotional complexity and density are not always regarded as negatively afflictive, even if, taken to extremes, they are sufficiently transformative to become realized as possession. There appear to be trigger points after which a personality configuration emerges as either affliction or possession. These points are not articulated in the texts; they do not codify medically identifiable points at which any of these bhūtas may be conclusively diagnosed in an individual as possession. Yet the assumption is implicit that at certain points this boundary is crossed. Determining these points requires a more complete analysis of the sociocultural aesthetics of classical India (and Tibet) than medically oriented researchers with agendas that depend on comparative taxonomies have hitherto conducted.

One approach to this may be to recognize that one of the key constructive elements of emotion from culture to culture, if indeed we are warranted in such a generalization, is the manner and degree to which emotion is somaticized. By this I mean that different cultural archetypes, worldviews, political formations, and practices of everyday life contribute to the manner in which emotion is embodied, understood, and recognized within a cultural system.137 An emotion that remains hidden to the outside world reflects a certain conditioning that encloses and embodies it uniquely, while the transmutation and activation of an emotion or emotional state into a bhūta of any definition reflects different cultural parameters of conditioning, recognition, and expressiveness. In this sense, anxieties that express acute emotional distress, such as fear (bhaya), apprehension (cintā), envy (īrṣyā), sexual excitement (kāma), anger (krodha), or grief (soka), are somaticized as psychogenic or physical symptoms that express themselves in different ways in different societies. But in India they emerge in a unified sensory manner as possession when they achieve a certain critical mass that is specifically defined yet remains elusive and is impossible to quantify. Thus, it is unsafe and unfair to guess the psychophysical coordinates of the threshold beyond which emotion is somaticized into possession or debilitating affliction.

This is further complicated upon recognizing that the processes of emotional somaticization in India are not referenced in medical literature, except as the texts state that an extreme emotion may result in a debilitated humor. At best one can gain a tentative understanding of these processes through a study of allied or corresponding cultural processes and the normativization of these processes through religious doctrine and practice. Thus, one must be guarded in essentializing such broad and ill-defined processes as the somaticization of emotion. It is perhaps safer to avoid the issue entirely, at least in the present context, and limit our comments to merely recognizing that the cultural configurations of such somaticization serve as the basis for descriptions not only of bhūtas but also of unmāda in the āyurvedic and tantric texts. As we have noted, most Western thinking on the topic of demons and possession has been shaped by a century of Freudian opinion, in which demons and associated phenomena are conceived as repressed traumas and developmental conflicts. This conviction, supported by a wealth of scientific data, is based on a single virtually unquestioned paradigm of scientific understanding. The results are then projected by psychologists, historians, anthropologists, literary critics, and many others onto alien cultures, whether ancient or modern, with little regard for the indigenous dimensions, gestalt, or characteristics of emotional embodiment, or of conflicting scientific paradigms that may be employed in these cultures (e.g., humoral diagnostics in Greek and āyurvedic medicine, circulation of qi, or functional energy associated with breath and movement, in Chinese medicine along a system of meridians not recognized by Western science). In this way, the absence of reference to repressed trauma and developmental conflict in Āyurveda and Tantra is barely considered by Western-style academics. To do so would be to admit the possibility of a different and little understood sphere of psychodynamics, as well as of a different scientific paradigm, in which embodiment is accorded a more active and transmutable status. Nevertheless, both Western and South Asian images of psychodynamic processes reflect rich symbol systems, behaviors pregnant with hidden meanings, and an axiomatic acceptance that self and person are not limited to the reflections of our conscious mind.

Perhaps unexpectedly, the ethnographies of oracular possession, and to some extent of disease-producing possession, support the āyurvedic and tantric viewpoints, as well as the viewpoints of formal aesthetic theory (alaṃkāraśāstra), in a programmatic pursuit of emotional definition. What is revealed is a nakedness of emotional expression, a clarity borne of a quest for emotional purity and conciseness that is somaticized in a relatively uncomplicated manner. This means that the quest for emotional definition is not too deeply enshrouded and caught in repressed trauma and unresolved conflict, but reveals a “natural” momentum that can be identified and defined. This does not mean that emotions generated through possession are unadorned in their nakedness. Indeed, emotions that are envisioned as part of secondary constructions—and possession definitely falls in that category—are identified by theoreticians from Bharata to Abhinavagupta to bhakti philosophers, such as Vallabhācārya and Rūpa Gosvāmī, by their adornments: the gestures, garb, and language that help express it. Alaṃkāraśāstra specifies adornments in poetry, drama, and dance; yet these are not entirely the constructions of Sanskrit paṇḍits. They are based on observation of emotional expression around them, which is to say on local context. In this way, both unmāda and bhūtavidyā must be regarded primarily as social and intellectual constructions that are primarily referential to local contexts. This is why I hesitate to transfer onto either Indian textuality or the sociocultural practices of emotional somaticization on which the texts are based a body of psychodynamic perceptions based on a scientific paradigm alien to Indian local context.138

## Other Indic Demonologies
I have limited the above critique to medical texts because Weiss and Clifford have offered the most important theoretical contributions to the consideration of negative possession in South Asia available to date, and they both do so in the context of classical medical texts. However, bhūtavidyā has a broad panorama in South Asian culture, and much of it lies in areas peripheral to these texts. Therefore, in the interest of providing a more complete portrait of negative possession in South Asia, let us consider a few other demonologies, from both texts and ethnographies.

The large number of demonologies in Indian literature and culture vary greatly in content, by region, and according to genre. And, as is the case with demonologies found in first-millennium texts, the lists cannot be called fixed or stable. It is certain that different informants from the same area, cultural, or textual tradition offer different lists. It is outside the scope of this volume, indeed it would be impossible, to attempt to relate them all systematically.139 However, a brief précis of this ever-shifting terrain is relevant to illustrating “traditions” of bhūtavidyā. This is best managed by presenting several examples out of what are unquestionably dozens of demonologies, or even hundreds if one considers the idiosyncratic views of one or two texts or religious authorities.140 Thus, we briefly examine five demonologies, presented chronologically: (1) the list contained in the Bower manuscript; (2) the list presented in the Isanasivagurudevapaddhati; (3) a list found in the Madanamahārṇava, a text on karmavipāka (karmic ripening); (4) a list presented in an ethnographic account of healers in Varanasi; and (5) an account of a demonology found among the Divehi of the Maldive islands.141

### The Bower Manuscript
The Bower manuscript is so-called because it was sold to a British lieutenant named Hamilton Bower while he was staying at Kuqa, an old Silk Road trading stop on the northern rim of the Taklamakan desert in northwest China, in 1890, while engaged in a desperate search for the murderer of another British soldier. The manuscript consists of seven fragments, including three on āyurvedic medicine, two on divination with dice, and two on incantations to combat snakebite, all dating from the late fourth or early fifth centuries C.E.142 This is later than Caraka and Susruta, and, in one of the incantations against snakebite, it provides a list of twenty-one types of seizure (grahāto) caused by various ethereal beings. The list appears as part of a long mantra called mahāmāyūrī (the great peacock); indeed, the peacock has long been regarded as a consumer of poison. In this Buddhist text, the Blessed One (bhagavaṃ) recites the mahāmāyūrī for the benefit of his disciple Ānanda, who is instructed to use it to cure the mendicant Svāti, who had been bitten by a large black snake (mahatā kṛṣṇasarpena). In addition to serving as an antidote to snakebite, this mantra mentions other uses for it, including against seizures.143 These are “seizure [grahāto] by a deity [deva], a serpent [or chthonic] spirit [naga], a titan [asura], a god or spirit of the wind [maruta], a sky spirit [garuḍa],144 a celestial musician [gandharva], a horse-headed spirit [often under the control of Kubera] [kinnara], the spirit of a great serpent [mahoraga], a semidivine protective spirit [yakṣa], a demon [rākṣasa], a spirit of the dead that has not received full [or any] post-mortem rituals or offerings [preta], a flesh-eating demon [piśāca], a ghost [bhūta], demons with jar-shaped testicles [kuṃbhāṇḍa], a foul smell or foul-smelling spirit [pūtana],145 the spirit of a negligent kṣatriya [kaṭapūtana], a childsnatcher [skanda], madness [unmāda], a shadow spirit perhaps causing nightmares [ chāyā],146 convulsions [apasmāra], and the evil eye [ostāraka].”147

Among these, the maruta, garuḍa, kinnara, kuṃbhāṇḍa, pūtana, kaṭaputana, chāyā, ostāraka, as well as the unmāda and apasmāra, are themselves kinds of grahas and are not found in the earlier lists, though certainly most of these were known from other contexts. Maruta and garuḍa are included because they explicitly suggest airborne grahas;148 kuṃbhāṇḍa is likely a local attempt to make sense of the words kuṣmāṇḍa or khārkhōda; kinnara and pūtana are known in Purāṇic lists, the MBh, and elsewhere; kaṭapūtana is mentioned in Manu (12.71);149 and the latter four, chāyā, ostāraka, as well as unmāda and apasmāra, are clearly reifications of their literal significations. This testifies to the geographic range of Indic demonologies, which were shared by Buddhists and the medical traditions of Central Asia and the Silk Road.

### The Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati (ĪŚP)

The twelfth-century ĪŚP contains four chapters (paṭalas 41–44) on disease-inducing possession, specifically on childsnatchers (bālagrahas), behavior of the possessed (grahaceṣṭā), exorcism (bhūtabādha),150 and seizure disorder (apasmāra), respectively.151 As mentioned earlier, this text was quite popular in certain circles of medical and tantric practitioners in Kerala. The first thirty-six verses of paṭala 42 succinctly identify eighteen specific types of graha. This paṭala also links other grahas with the four varṇa-groupings, provides succinct descriptions of humoral imbalances complicit in possession, and offers a description of apasmāra. Because of its brevity and usefulness as a twelfth-century tantric point of comparison with the language of possession and identity of grahas found in classical āyurvedic texts, it is relevant to translate these verses.

1–3.Eighteen kinds of graha take hold of people: (1) nisteja, (2) deva, (3) asura, (4) nāga, (5) yakṣa, (6) gandharva, (7) rakṣas, (8) pitṛ, (9) heḍhra, (10) bhasma, (11) yonyudbhava, (12) kasmalaka, (13) pralāpa, (14) vighna, (15) kuśa, (16) antya, (17) piśāca, and (18) bhūta. All of these, as well as brahman and other [varṇa-based] rākṣasas that are complicit in madness [unmāda] and convulsions [apasmāra], and that desire sacrifice [balikāmāḥ], sex [ratikāmāḥ], or killing [hantukāmāḥ] grab hold of men.152 They may be divided into two categories: gentle [saumya] and fiery [āgneya].

4–5a.These grahas reside in empty places, lakes, wells, mountains, gardens, rivers, individual trees in cremation grounds, as well as in Buddhist and Hindu temples [caityadevālayādiṣu].

This section from the ĪŚP deserves much more comment than can be accommodated here. Nevertheless, I must offer a few words. First, it provides more detail on the vulnerability of women to spirit possession than is found in the earlier canonical āyurvedic texts. It is not that this supposition of increased vulnerability necessarily intensified over the centuries; it may simply be that the ĪŚP was more prolix in negotiating its various dimensions. In fact, as we have seen in the BĀU, references to women’s possession, hence their vulnerability, may be dated to the mid-first millennium B.C.E. or earlier. The somewhat later discussions of bālagrahas in the MBh and the early medical literature also reveal that women were viewed by the later centuries B.C.E. as highly susceptible to possession. The standard attributed causes of this were their monthly release of blood, regarded as attractive to spirits, and their childbearing capacity, in which protective measures to guard newborns against threats both visible and invisible were extreme. The latter was doubtless due to comparatively high infant and childhood mortality rates. Regardless, the disadvantaged condition of women worsened, or at least hardened, over the course of the first millennium C.E. to the point that they were equated with sūdras in much of the Dharmasāstra literature of the day. Thus, it is nearly irresistible to argue that in a patriarchal society that was increasingly oppressive toward women, their stigmatization was more pronounced in the early second millennium, the date of the ĪŚP, than it was earlier. This would encourage us to project back by at least a millennium the arguments of Lewis and others regarding the correlation of oppression of women and spirit possession, which, as discussed earlier, have a good measure of validity in modern-day India.155

Second, although the presence of varṇa-based grahas is much more evident in the ĪŚP than in the medical texts (note the brahmarākṣasa, kṣatriya-graha, vanig-graha, vṛṣala-graha, antyaja-graha), the influence of the AH and Susruta is nevertheless clear. Third, the variation in clearly defined psychophysical disability is more pronounced. Thus, the heḍhra(ga)-graha, bhasma-graha, and yonija-graha, not mentioned in the earlier medical texts, look less like personality variants than different forms of congenital or neurological disease, or mental retardation.

### The Madanamahāṛṇava
The Madanamahārṇava (MM), written by Viśveśvara Bhaṭṭa in the fourteenth century,156 is one of the two most important works of a little-studied genre that falls between Āyurveda and dharmasāstra known as karmavipāka (the fruition of karma). 157 This literature correlates diseases with actions (karman). Sometimes these are actions said to have been performed in previous births, but by no means is this always the case. The remedies for these conditions consist of ritual expiation (prāyascitta) rather than medicinal preparations, leading, the texts say, to full recovery (niṣkṛti).158 The fortieth and last chapter (taraṇga) of the MM describes symptoms of possession by thirty-one different grahas, all the result of ill-begotten past karma, most—if not all—of it accumulated in the present birth. In addition to describing symptoms, the text speculates on their causes and prescribes ritual remedies.

The names of many of these grahas are unusual. They are unlike the names of grahas in the other texts and ethnographies examined here, which are largely the toponyms of general categories such as rākṣasa or piśāca, ruthless feminine grāhīs such as Vinatā or Mukhamaṇḍikā, or the frightening bhūtas of Varanasi (see below). The names of the possessors here often do not have obvious connections to the disease or affliction described. Rather, they suggest a brahmanical normativizing, as their names, hence identities, appear to have been sanitized, blunting some of the impact of the afflictions described. Furthermore, the classifications betray a pedantry that foregrounds orthodox morality.159 This has the effect of conferring on the ritual treatments a sense of formulaic brahmanical efficacy. Because of this framework, the only one I know of that consciously applies principles of sastra to possession, the possibility of endogenous pathology is never considered as a cause of the affliction being discussed. The unyielding agenda, then, is to suggest that questionable moral judgment, contiguous with the appearance of suspect symptomatology, plays a crucial role in weakening the individual, encouraging the hostile takeover of the individual by an untoward spirit.

As we have seen repeatedly from the vedic period to the present, in India no less than elsewhere, adherence to normative social and moral codes programmatically sustains cultural foundations, providing areas of comfort and control for cultural elites and ruling classes. In India, perhaps more than elsewhere, however, socioreligious law (dharma) has been self-regulating, requiring marginally less external control. Nevertheless, it has not always been a procrustean bed on which people bind themselves, as often depicted by scholars and cultural advocates alike. There have always been mechanisms of escape, and these have either been recognized by socioreligious codes or these codes have turned a blind eye to them, knowing that they are necessary for the maintenance of cultural harmony. Not everyone fits into the system. So, rather than forcibly displacing or suppressing those who are ill-fitting, the system has served up and sanctioned these escape routes. Specifically, transgressiveness in India has found culturally acceptable norms and mechanisms in the forms of wandering mendicancy and forest dwelling through religiously inspired renunciation, transgressive modes of sexuality or ritualizing through tantric practice, or, appositely, locating niches for abnormal or resistant personalities through an edifice of multiple or dissociative personality–inspired bhūtavidyā. Oracular possession, as we have seen, takes advantage of these well-articulated loopholes in a positive religiously acceptable manner. However, negative possession does not and cannot always locate or negotiate these loopholes. It is, therefore, dealt with by texts that address abnormal bahavior. These include not just āyurvedic texts but more programmatic texts on the margins of Āyurveda, including the MM. The usual result in the event of such abnormality is an unwitting victim in need of exorcism and healing. We see this in a range of texts and examples, from the paradigmatic possession of Nala by Kali, a child possessed by a bālagraha because of a lapse by the mother or another relative, or an enemy hiring a tantric to curse an individual with an evil spirit, a belief that Dwyer has shown holds sway over large numbers of victims of possession at Bālājī. In all these cases, even if unintended, there is the construal of dharmic or moral lapse. This, then, backgrounds the “ripening of karma” that requires ritual treatment.

The fortieth taraṇga of the MM consists largely of a prose commentary on material from two earlier karmavipaka works, now lost, the Karmavipākasaṇgraha and the Karmavipākasamuccaya. The taraṇga begins, typically, with general rules (paribhāṣā) for ritual exorcism or expiation, include fasting, chanting (japa) brief mantras and names of deities, reciting simple vedic hymns or verses including the Puruṣa-sūkta (ṚV 10.90) and the gāyatrī mantra (ṚV 3.62.10), though non-vedic mantras are also prescribed. The MMprescribes a general expiatory mantra, unattributed to any other text, in which the name of the graha is replaceable: pragṛhīṣva baliṃ cemaṃ dāharūpa mahājvara | āturasya sukhaṃ siddhiṃ prayaccha tvaṃ mahāgraha || (O, Great Fever [graha] in the Form of Fire, possess this offering [bali]; bestow, O Great Graha, comfort and fulfillment on this afflicted person). The second line remains unchanged throughout, while the names of the different grahas are substituted in the second half of the first line, for example, pragṛhīṣya balim cemaṃ aikāhika mahājvara, pragṛhīṣva baliṃ cemaṃ karṇākhya tvaṃ mahāgraha.

The principle of transfer, found throughout Indian religious texts and analyzed in Chapter 5 as “transfer of essence,” is also seen here. The graha is neither killed nor dissolved nor destroyed, but is transferred into the offering material used in a small localized sacrificial offering called bali.160 This recommended bali consists of offerings of fragrant red flowers, oil, incense, and various other material, placed in a new brass pot (kāṃsyapātra, bell-metal), which is then left in a temple (devalaye) or at a crossroad (catuṣpathe). In addition, homa is often prescribed with offerings of cooked rice (caru), black sesame seeds, and parched grain (laja). On some occasions, well-known homas, such as the kūṣmāṇḍa,161 are recommended, as is the gifting of gold and other valuable objects to brahmans. These rules are set in the context of exorcistic expiatory ritual for the first graha on the list, the prajagraha (offspring seizer). This graha possesses a man who eats leftover food or has sex with his wife while she is having her menstrual period. It is noteworthy that many of the grahas on the list in the MM possess their victim for this offense. The victim then develops a fever, diarrhea (atisara), skin disease (kuṣṭha), and palsied limbs. It is not clear why this graha is called prajagraha.

The fortieth tataṇga, of the MM is too long to present full details of all of the karmavipāka grahas mentioned there. It must suffice to list them, noting their meanings and the offenses that lead to their possession, and to discuss only a few of them in order to better explicate the intellectual processes deployed by the dharmaśāstra establishment to link possession by these grahas with moral lapses and brahmanical ritual exorcism.

30. śiśugraha (infant grasper) possesses (saṇkramate, “steps into”) a person who show disrespect toward gods, brahmans, gurus, nobility, cows, or holy places.
31. meṣagraha (sheep grasper) possesses a man who throws sacred ash on a child possessed by a bālagraha.

Now, we elaborate on a few of these categories. The victim of a pratuṇḍagraha suffers from fever, fainting, exhaustion, and paralysis on one side. He liberates himself from this graha by performing the cāndrāyaṇa kṛcchra,162 a type of purificatory fast, reciting (japet) a certain mantra a thousand times (in addition to the standard verse mantra described above), and giving away (presumably to brahmans) as much gold as he can afford.

The victim of a kālanāyakagraha suffers from sudden dryness in the mouth and his sounds become harsh. To alleviate this condition and exorcise this graha, one should offer a mixture of three sweet substances—sugar, ghee, and honey—along with mango sprouts 1,008 times while chanting the jātavedasa mantra (ṚV 1.99). He should also offer as bali scented red flowers and other normal material, as well as powdered parched grains, oil cake (piṇyāka), black sesame seeds, and as much gold as he can afford, in a brass pot at a crossroad. While offering this bali he should recite the appropriate variant on the usual mantra: pragṛhiṣva baliṃ cemaṃ lokanātha mahāgraha | āturasya sukhaṃ siddhiṃ prayaccha tvaṃ mahāgraha || (O, Lord of the World, Great Graha, possess this offering [bali]; bestow, O Great Graha, comfort and fulfillment on this afflicted person).

The āpastambagraha is explained as a spirit (graha) that possesses an unworthy person who sits in a row of brahmans and, because of excessive pride, takes for himself the best plate and consumes special food. This graha is capable of afflicting the transgressor with heart and stomach problems, as well as with consumption. The afflicted person can turn back this possession by performing the cāndrāyaṇa fast and making an offering (balidāna) at a crossroad with the accompaniment of mantras. This, however, does not explain why the graha is called āpastamba. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only occurrence of the word āpastamba that does not refer to the ritual school of that name belonging to the Taittirīya śākhā of the Kṛṣṇayajurveda.163 It is not out of the question, however, that pejoratively it does refer to that ritual school, so-called because a brahman of that school once behaved in this way in a community of non-Āpastambins. The Āpastamba school is the dominant vedic sub-sākhā in Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnadu, and many areas of Karnataka and Maharashtra. The ritual school of the reputed author of this text, Viśveśvara Bhaṭṭa, is not given in the colophon or commentary, but in all likelihood he was not an Āpastambin, because he was from North India.164 Thus, he was probably a member of a different school and had a negative experience with a ritualist of the Āpastamba school, who might have accepted gifts in a manner Viśveśvara Bhaṭṭa judged arrogant.

The victim of a vṛtragraha, an affliction that apparently harks back to the archetypal serpent demon Vṛtra (cf. ṚV 1.32), suffers from dryness of the buttocks, a possible reference to a sexually transmitted disease.165 As exorcistic expiation, he must perform the prājāpatya fast, offer a homa of black sesame seeds with the gāyatrī mantra, recite the gāyatrī an additional ten thousand times, and give away as much gold as is possible. These are very ordinary expiations, particularly compared to the often-exotic prescriptions in the Āyurveda texts and the rich variety of practices documented by ethnographies.

The victim of a kumbhakagraha (also called jambhakagraha) suffers from fever, incoherent speech, and symptoms of asthma. The exorcism consists of the cāndrāyaṇa fast plus offerings of cooked rice with ghee (carusarṣipī) into a fire while reciting the Puruṣa-sūkta with the vyāhṛti mantras (the syllables bhur bhuvaḥ svaḥ).166 This and similar passages suggest that offerings into the fire, supplemented by fasting, are in fact āyurvedic remedies. Nearly all possession is classified as vāta disorder in āyurvedic texts, and certainly the uncontrollable body movements and mental disconnectedness that partially characterize possession support this diagnosis. Kapha-producing (and therefore grounding) food such as cooked rice with ghee is often prescribed to combat vāta debilitation. It is not unreasonable to suggest that the exorcisms prescribed here constitute a kind of daiva Ayurveda, which is still practiced in a few places in India. More specifically, these practices could easily fall within the category of daivavyapāsrayacikitsā (spiritual therapy). Although I have not seen this stated in the primary texts, the implicit āyurvedic argument is that fasting combats severe vāta debiltation, while the offerings of rice with ghee, consistent with the ideology of the balidāna given in the beginning of the fortieth taraṇga of the MM, is designed to attract and capture the offending spirit.

The karṇagraha has a long history, some of which we have recounted earlier (see Chapter 11). This graha is not depicted as disease-producing by Varāhamihira or the commentator Bhaṭṭotpala. However, in the MM it is made to conform with the disease-producing norm, stripped of its earlier significance as an oracular spirit. Here, on the authority of Kātyāyana, the MM says that a karṇagraha possesses one who consumes temple property, causing sudden deafness, a freezing of the tongue, and great itching on the limb (= penis?). The antidote is the cāndrāyaṇa fast, homa with the vyāhṛti mantras, and recitation of a hymn from the ṚV (6.24) to Indra 1,008 times. This hymn has little obvious relevance to the exorcism of a karṇagraha, but is prescribed in the srauta ritual as a hymn to be recited in for slaying of the demon Vṛtra.167 The balidāna to be offered to the graha consists of ground black sesame, wine (surā), meat, rice, parched grain, yogurt, and (probably) onion (kanda). This should all be placed at a crossroad along with a banner, scented flowers, and incense, over which a tantric ritualist (mantravit) should recite the relevant mantras.168

Another challenging figure is the avatolagraha. The MM quotes the Karmavipākasaṇgraha as its main authority on this. This graha, according to the MM, possesses a person who is disagreeable and a social problem. The texts do not help us with the word avatola, however. This neologism might indicate deceitfulness, more literally “weighing down” or fixing the scales when weighing and selling any substance (perhaps a prohibited one).169 The physical debilities produced by an avatolagraha include coughing, chest problems, aching limbs, and decreased appetite. The three-step exorcism is a mix of the usual prescriptions: recitations of the Viṣṇu- and Puruṣa-sūktas, performance of the kūṣmāṇḍahoma, offering of a thousand pots for bathing an image of a deity (sahasrakalaśasnānam), and recitation (japet) of a mantra (ṚV 4.31.1) 1,008 times. Like most of the expiations, this one assumes that the victim is a person of means, as these rituals require large expenditures.

Another ethereal enemy of moral lassitude is the śiśagraha. This graha afflicts its victim with fever, diarrhea, eczema (āsyaśośī), and shaking of the hands and feet. The name of this graha is striking because in both the ethnographic record and at modern spirit healing centers such as Bālājī the possessors are often identified by the families of the victim and the ritual authorities alike as children who have died young, their souls (jīva) tortured and unappeased, having not undergone the standard rites of passage (saṃskāra). Thus, an echo of popular possession is probably present here, though it is not stated. Once again, then, we are left with a name with no obvious link to the offense at hand. The victim will achieve peace if he offers as bali a pot filled with parched grain, liquid milk sweet (pāyasa), chicken, lamb, and gold. Along with this, he should hire a priest to offer bali of red cloth on a banyan root (vaṭamūle) with the usual mantra. Very few of these grahas take nonvegetarian food, but for some reason this one does. It is possible that this passage reflects a local practice of offering meat to spirits of deceased babies and children. Thus, in spite of a nearly crushing brahmanical palimpsest, the MM appears to reflect a propinquity of Sanskritic and local practices.

### Bhūtas of Varanasi
An important contemporary source of bhūtavidyā is K. M. Shukla’s ethnographic account from the environs of Varanasi of the exorcism of eleven kinds of piśāca responsible for different illnesses.170 Two features of this account are immediately noteworthy. The first is that these bhūtas are extremely malevolent, more evidently gruesome than those in the lists examined above. The second is that Shukla’s study is deeply contextualized; most of the bhūtas are easily located in the prevailing cultural environment—which raises questions about the cultural environment that surrounded the composition of the earlier lists in the Sanskrit medical and tantric literature. These texts, of course, were not multifaceted anthropological tracts, but specialized texts safely within the disciplinary boundaries established at the time. However, it is this feature of broad-based cultural understanding that separates Shukla’s account from earlier lists of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century “orientalist” scholars (particularly those who also happened to be missionaries), which tend to be thoroughly decontextualized or only randomly contextualized.171

The piśācas are the following: (1) a cuṛail, a bloodsucking witch with feet turned backward, found in bamboo groves, bel trees (Skt. bilva [wood-apple, a tree sacred to Śiva]), or banana trees. Sheldon Pollock refers to this demonic creature as “the succubus of the Indian male’s nightmare world, who threatens him with death through sexual depletion and must therefore be suppressed”;172 (2) a savat or spirit of a deceased first wife, hence the rival of a second, who attacks the latter when she is not properly regarded; (3) a daitya, a nocturnal spirit that dwells in a pipal tree; the word daitya is commonly attested, and not, apparently, a relic of its usage in AH 6.4.16–17 cited above; (4) a brahma, or spirit of a brahman who dies an unnatural or untimely death (akālamṛtyu); (5) a haḍikaś brahma, the spirit of an unwanted newborn that is kept in a basket (haḍi) and buried; (6) a budnua,173 the spirit of one who has drowned and attacks an individual who comes to bathe in that pond, tank, and so on; (7) a jin or jinnad, a Muslim spirit who resides in a palm or pipal tree or in a graveyard near a mosque; (8) a sahid, or Muslim martyr; (9) a bhavānī, an unmarried female who dies an unnatural death, then troubles children and other family members if she is not properly worshipped; (10) a marū,174 the spirit of a person killed because of the wrath of the goddess (also bhavānī, but not identical to the spirit of that designation), who dwells in a house and causes trouble in the family; (11) a ḍīh, a minor spirit who fails to receive promised offerings. The offering of choice to a ḍīh is gāñjā (cannabis), promised to it after a cure is enacted.175

### Possession Among the Divehi
The Divehi are an indigenous people of the Maldive islands, far to the southwest of the subcontinent, but well within the Indo-Islamic cultural orbit. Clarence Maloney, who conducted close and lingustically informed field-work there in the 1970s, states: “Within the [Divehi] village, jinnis cause spontaneous abortion, barrenness, sickness, epidemics, fainting, unexplained noises or any other sudden or unexplained phenomenon.”176 Indeed, the general word there for bhūta is jinni. Maloney records forty-two varieties of Divehi jinni, many derived from Tamil or Simhala words, many others seemingly indigenous Divehi words, but eleven probably derived from Sanskrit. These are (1) devi (< Skt. devi), “a generic name for a personified spirit or godling, now applied to male or female spirits which were pre-Muslim deities”; (2) hanḍi (< Skt. caṇḍa, cruel; cf. Caṇḍī), a “generic name for jinni, especially smaller ones; usually but not always female; one may fly through the air or along the ground; it may make a sound like a tongue click, and has a ‘strong spirit’”; (3) furēta (< Skt. preta), “any large or fearful spirit; male or female; esp. an apparition of light over the ocean at night; bad people might become one; it may walk with a shroud”; (4) ferēta (< Skt. preta), “lights on the sea; like a ship full of lights; it may have an eye on the top of its head, so it has to bend forward to see; may catch people; as lights on the sea, often frightens fishermen”; (5) hāmunḍi (< Skt. Cāmuṇḍa, Cāmuṇḍī), which “may take any form, lives in village; disturbs domestic fowl; may be seen as a hen with chicks about it”; (6) buddevi (< Skt. bhudevi),177 “a devi of a budu (idol)”; (7) dēyō, diyō (< Skt. devī), a “spiritual queen, a devi”; (8) kandā hanḍi (< Skt. Skanda), “a female; troubles men; makes sexual dreams and shows intercourse; it may have children by men, and makes men unconscious”; (9) avaṭeri (< Skt. avatāra),178 “a kind of hanḍi that lives in the jungle; female; she has long hair and old clothes; if people leave out supplies in the kitchen at night she will grind the condiments, scrape the coconut, cut up the fish and fix the fire”; (10) furāna (< Skt. purāṇa), a “ghost of the dead;” and (11) ravo (< Skt. Rāvaṇa), “a devi that causes disease to children; makes them lean and troublesome”;179 Maloney notes that jinnis “do not usually possess people as Hindu patron deities may.”180 By this, he means that there is no evident oracular possession. This indicates that the perceived spirit presences are largely infestations; sources of trouble rather than ecstasy. However, further work must be done on this.

These multiforms of bhūtavidyā demonstrate that it is an enduring feature of the South Asian cultural area, both in time and space, from the vedic period to the present, from the Silk Road and Tibet to the Maldives. These extravagant, even baroque, demonologies nearly always suggest possession, as affliction, harassment, and influence by a bhūta or graha indicate this likelihood in the South Asian psychophysical and cultural systems. The vedic demonologies, like those of modern Varanasi or the Maldives, are integral aspects of folk traditions. The former, however, were captured and canonized by early Sanskritic culture and, therefore, left deep and long-lasting influences on the images and typologies of bhūtavidyā in all strata and nearly all regions of South Asia.

The more systematized demonologies, in the sense of being directly associated with an extended literary tradition, such as are found in BĀU 3.2 and the āyurvedic texts, are consequently concerned primarily with formal epistemologies. In the āyurvedic texts these are more reminiscent of human personality, at least of powerful elements of its relatively normative dark side, than of uncontrolled, irrepressible, and dangerous elements of an invisible nonhuman wilderness, in spite of the exotic labeling in these texts. In other words, the Sanskritic demonologies appear to participate more in the domestic than the wild. In a cultural sense, then, they bespeak the domestication of possession. It is as if relegating them to the realm of literature both sanitizes and scientizes them, which is why they appear both better defined and less dangerous than, for example, the bhūtas of Varanasi. The grahas in the bhūtavidyā lists in the āyurvedic texts may also be compared to the child-snatchers, who were systematized in the MBh and in other sections of the āyurvedic texts. The latter were clearly regarded as horrific and relentlessly dangerous and were, in this sense, closer to the demons of present-day Varanasi. In practice, however, medical practitioners did not rely strictly on the designations from the āyurvedic texts. There always has been, I believe, a spillover from popular culture to text, which may be seen in the increasing numbers of possessing beings from Caraka to Vāgbhaṭa, as well as a spillover from āyurvedic texts into popular culture. The latter may be seen in the list of childsnatchers in the MBh and tantric texts, as well as in some of the more recognizable bhūtas of Varanasi and the Maldive islands.

## Piśācas and the Piśācmocan Temple
Because of the ubiquity of the piśāca, a few words must be said about it. An illuminating passage appears in the Nīlamata Purāṇa (NP), a text from Kashmir that depicts a social and spiritual universe densely populated with ethereal beings of nearly unimaginable variety, which readily interact with one another as well as with humans. These beings comprise devas, gandharvas, apsarases, yakṣas, guhyakas, kinnaras, nāgas, rākṣasas, piśācas, and millions of others.181 Pisācas enjoy an honored place in this pantheon. They roam the heavens and the earth, including the rivers, mountains, towns, and forests of Kashmir. Indeed, the geography of Kashmir is vividly portrayed, rendering this Purāṇa a valuable source of historical knowledge. It is also a handbook of popular festivals and astrologically based rituals. Although recent efforts have been made to historicize the NP, much work remains to be done.

The NP depicts gargantuan battles between hordes of these beings. NP 210ff. tells of piśācas in the employ of the gods. These piśācas are under the direct command of the piśāca lord Nikumbha, who has been hired by the god Kubera, himself commanded by Viṣṇu. These piśācas, numbering fifty million, are hired guns for the good guys and, therefore, themselves in some sense good, because they are allied with Viṣṇu.182 Their job is to battle an equally voluminous number of malevolent piśācas on calendrically regulated dates. In spite of their affiliation with Kubera and Viṣṇu, however, they remain dangerous to humans, thus deserving of their offerings. In one passage the goddess asks the sage Kaśyapa why she should attend to Kashmir, since it constitutes her very body, when there is more important work elsewhere. Kaśyapa replies that in Kashmir humans are always associated with piśācas, so she needs to see that their minds do not become perverted because of this association. Despite the watchful eye of the goddess, the NP (397–410) describes a highly transgressive festival in which humans become possessed by these good piśācas and appear to enjoy themselves immensely. Whether this constitutes defilement or perversion, or whether this matters, is undetermined.

The text of the NP has no clear divisions or properly marked narrative transitions. It moves in stream-of-consciousness fashion from the middle of one topic to the middle of another. Nevertheless, with respect to our story, we may surmise that, beginning on the full moon of the month of Asvina (mid-October), the celebrants should worship brahmans, honor their own ātman (probably indicating some form of meditation, mantra recitation, or brief ritual practice), then enjoy a vegetarian banquet and an evening concert or dramatic performance. On the following two days, they should bathe as usual in the morning, then attire themselves finely and perform appropriate fire rituals. The remainder of these two days should be spent relaxing in the company of friends. After the morning rituals, in contravention of the usual dictum not to engage in sexual activity during the daytime, the celebrants, followers (anuyāyinaḥ) of the good piśāca Nikumbha, should smear their bodies and those of their friends with mud, then engage in revelry and well-turned lascivious speech that is both sexually enticing and arousing (talliṇgārthaprabodhakaiḥ [brings about an erection]). They should shout vulgar words and cavort about. At that time, they become possessed by frightful-looking piśācas—the ones who work for Kubera, we later learn. In the late afternoon or evening, after the celebrants bathe once again, these piśācas exit the bodies of those who have properly engaged in this ritual and enter and curse those who have not. Then those followers of Nikumbha should worship Kesava. Afterward, they should keep an oil lamp lit outside their houses for one month, until the full moon of the month of Kārttika and observe certain ritual vows for six months.

It is not clear how much of this is protest, redemption, escape, or just good clean sybaritic and festive fun. It is possible that the sectarian and political history of Kashmir had an impact on this ritual, but this has not been researched. It is also not clear to what degree this mud-wrestling possession orgy has been reframed or fictionalized by the NP. I know of no equivalent ritual in modern-day India, though it is possible, even probable, that other sexual rituals, such as the tantric cakrapūjā, at one time had variants in which the dramatis personae became possessed by the goddesses of the cakra before engaging in ritual sex.183 We can also posit that the possession in this ritual was protective as well as transgressive, the ritual possession being the safety net that thwarted adharma. As a ritual mechanism, this possession shifted the onus of transgressive sex from dharmically conscientious citizens to liminally relocated and reconstituted personalities. Although the sexual aspect does not, to the best of my knowledge, appear in modern possession ritual, group possession ritual is often documented in India, for example, in the Draupadī festival in Tamilnadu and the Siri festival in the South Kanara District of Karnataka.

Pollock’s remarks on the genesis and role of the rākṣasa are apposite here. He cites the Rāmāyaṇa to the effect that the concerns of rākṣasas are “to master the sports of lovemaking and hold crowded fairs and festivals.”184 Their pursuit of lovemaking can be traced back to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and their powers of transformation to the ṚV.185 Pollock argues that rākṣasas are “the imaginative product of the confrontation of traditional Indians with their particular forms of desire—in its two primary forms, libidinal and aggressive—representing all that traditional Indians most desired and most feared.… [I]n their libidinized forms, they enact the deepest sexual urges—total abandonment to pleasure, as well as absolute autonomy and power in gratifying lust.”186 This verdict applies as well to the piśācas in the NP, where ritual both domesticates and liberates them, providing their hosts an opportunity to release their pent-up sexual aggression in a context that not only does not threaten to corrupt or overturn established cultural standards but, through that context—namely, the ritual—reinforces them. This, then, is a ritual of reversal—in this case, reversing an established expectation of monogamy—and is rather like certain other rituals of reversal in North Indian festivals. What comes immediately to mind is the day during the spring festival of Holi on which the women of certain villages in Braj (e.g., Nandagaon, Gokul) beat their husbands and other men, immune, that day, from reciprocation.187

The piśācas of the NP, at least the good ones, differ radically from the malevolent piśācas depicted in the āyurvedic and tantric texts cited above, where they are described as impure, dirty, desolate, restless, incapable of enjoyment, and so on.188 The latter piśācas are ever threatening and require ritual expiation. A specific venue for such expiation, the Skanda Purāṇa informs us, is a certain Pāsupata Śaiva temple called Pisācamocana in Varanasi.189 It is here, so the story goes, that once long ago, during the tretayuga, a great-souled ascetic named Vālmīki performed brahmanical rituals before the Kapardīśa liṇga, then sat for meditation on the banks of a nearby lake. He saw there a ghastly and miserable rākṣasa who described to him how he attained that sorry state. While alive he was a brahman temple priest in far-off Pratiṣṭhāna on the banks of the Godavari river, and while performing his priestly duties he accepted gifts from pilgrims (tīrtha-pratigraha), but kept them all, failing to donate any of them to the temple. For this he was condemned to exist as a piśāca. One day, while he was floating as a piśāca in Pratiṣṭhāna, a young brahman passed by. He failed to perform his sandhyā rites and did not purify himself properly after urinating and defecating. Like Kali possessing Nala, this piśāca passed into the body of this brahman boy (taccharīre ’haṃ saṃkrāntaḥ). Eventually that brahman made his way to Varanasi, for business rather than pilgrimage, but the ethereal guardians of the holy city refused to allow him into the inner shrine area (antargeha) without expunging him of his sins, along with the invasive piśāca, at least temporarily, both of which would reenter him when he left. So, the piśāca was stranded in the outer neighborhoods without a host. Just as it was about to seize and eat a healthy pilgrim, the latter uttered the name of Śiva, purifying the piśāca, which then followed the pilgrim to the Kapardīśa liṇga. There he was noticed by the ascetic Vālmīki, who gave him a small quantity of sanctified ash (bhasma, vibhūti) from his fire to apply to his forehead. This was sufficient to purify the piśāca to the point that it could be admitted for bathing in the sacred pond. As a result, the piśāca lost its frightful qualities and attained a divine body (divyadeham).

The Pisācmocan temple continues as a venue for exorcism. Two types of officiant serve those in need: the bhagat, who invokes the deity in charge of the exorcism, and the ojhā, who actually performs the exorcism. The important elements of the exorcism are, first, ritual procedure and, second, speech, which at Pisācmocan and elsewhere in Varanasi includes mantra and secret language. Among the substances employed are cloves, which, given to the client, serve to transport the pret away from the body, while lemons and sometimes rice-flour balls (piṇḍa) are used for bali or simple sacrificial offerings to the deity. Thus, the spirit, often that of an ancestor (pitṛ), is pacified, after which it is seated (baiṭhnā) in the temple, where the deity is deemed strong enough to hold it forever. Occasionally, the client will drive a nail into the trunk of a large tree on the temple grounds, fixing the offending spirit to it. It is important to note that the prevailing viewpoint is that the spirit rides or sits on the individual, not inside the person.

Many ojhās who frequent Pisācmocan are from or are connected with outlying villages. They bring their clients to Pisācmocan after working with them for lengthy periods, sometimes for years. Many of the clients are women who have suffered a miscarriage, influenced by the notion that an evil spirit has been sent by an enemy. Others are men—often brothers—enmeshed in legal disputes, believing that they have been cursed by spirits sent by the opposing party through hired tantrics. Many more are relatives of people who have died suddenly, a condition that is said to render the subtle body of the deceased vulnerable to possession by nasty spirits.190 Most of the traffic at Pisācmocan, however, is for fairly ordinary postmortem rites (srāddha, piṇḍadāna). This is performed throughout the year, though preponderantly during pitṛpakṣa, the fortnight of the waning moon in the month of Bhādrapad (usually mid- to late September). This serves the dual purpose of feeding the ancestors, the usual intent, and exorcising them of evil spirits, just in case.

## Childsnatchers and Therapy to Counter Demonic Possession
(Piśacagṛhītabhaiṣajyam)191

A section from the MBh (3.216–219) on the birth of Skanda and the origin of bālagrahas or childsnatchers was explored in Chapter 6. That passage contains much of the essential information found in the āyurvedic texts, including specialized works on pediatrics, descriptive lists of bālagrahas, diseases attributed to them, and remedies. Perhaps the most comprehensive of these passages appears in the Kāsyapa Saṃhitā (KS) of the seventh century, a text that now survives in only two fragmentary manuscripts, testifying to the fact that it was soon eclipsed by other texts, particularly the AH, despite sections like this one that are more comprehensive than the corresponding sections of the later texts. The passage in question is intact and has been translated well by Dominik Wujastyk.192 For this reason it is not necessary to enter into a full translation of it or corresponding texts.193 The important point is that the fundamental interpretation of the action of grahas, including bālagrahas, at least in the classical āyurvedic texts (we have seen that the perspective in the Tibetan medical texts can be different), is that they are agents of possession. Other symbolic interpretations of the meaning of grahas and verbs used to describe their actions (such as abhigharṣayati [attack]) may be valid as well,194 but they cannot override the centrality of possession or of moral missteps (even if inadvertent) or weaknesses that are consistently seen to lie at the basis of disease-causing possession. The KS describes many conditions, moral lapses all, ideologically consistent with what is found elsewhere, in which the archetypal childsnatcher, Jātahāriṇī, invades a pregnant woman and terminates her pregnancy. As expected, “only dharma can turn her away,” says the KS.195

Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati 41

Rather than discussing the canonical āyurvedic texts, it will better serve our interests to examine paṭala 41 of the Isānasivagurudevapaddhati. With respect to the relationship between the ĪŚP and the āyurvedic texts (as well as with the MBh), it is notable that the former is consistent with the latter in rendering semidivine grahas called “mothers” (mātṛ) as bālagrahas that afflict children below the age of sixteen, especially fetuses, while, as we saw above, the ĪŚP is also consistent with the āyurvedic texts in regarding yakṣas, gandharvas, rākṣasas, and so on, as possessors that bequeath insanity to adults.196

The author of the ĪŚP proposes that, out of the many traditions of treatment of balagrahas, he discusses two of them in brief: the procedures described in the Khaḍgarāvaṇa and in the Nārāyaṇīya.197 The procedure described in the Khaḍgarāvaṇa enumerates several general procedures, then prescribes modifications depending on the age of the child and the identity of the mātṛkā (Little Mother), the offending spirit. The ritualist should take earth from both banks of a river and construct an effigy (puttalīm) from it in the shape of a child. This will then substitute for the child in the ritual, though it appears that the child should also be present. Then the ritualist should make a packet of cooked white rice along with fresh rice grains, fish, meat, and liquor, together with flowers, yogurt, milk, and black sesame seeds. The wrapper should probably be a strong leaf (this is not mentioned, but is usually the case) and should, according to the text, be tied tightly with yellow thread. The intent seems to be to combine pure and impure offerings, presumably for Gaṇeśa and Vīrabhadra and the ill-intentioned spirits. After the ground for the ritual is cleaned, it should be embellished with thirteen svastikas, eight ghee lamps, and different kinds of fruit, including bananas. One should then make a large vessel, in the middle of which one should place the effigy, then set lamps and other ritual items around it.

Then, at the time of the midday sandhyā, Gaṇeśa should be worshipped with incense and other appropriate offerings. Brāhmī and the other mātṛkās should be installed as the deities of the primary directions around it, and Vārāhī and other goddesses, including Caṇḍikā, should be installed and worshipped in the directional corners. After the tantric ritualist invokes and worships Vīrabhadra and Gaṇeśa at the center, the substances for sacrifice (bali) should be divided in half, with four parts each for Vīrabhadra and Gaṇeśa, and four parts for the goddesses, placed on pipal leaves. The prescribed mantra should be recited for each deity separately, and peaceful (sāttvika) offerings should be given to both Khaḍgarāvaṇa and whichever goddess is to be named, in this case Nandā as the possessor of children in their first year. The mantra is: o namo bhagavate khaḍgarāvaṇāya dīrghadarśanāya hana gṛhṇa muñca bālakaṃṭhaṭha (O, salutations to the illustrious Lord Khaḍgarāvaṇa whose vision is far-reaching. Kill! Possess! Liberate the child! Svāhā.).198 Variants of this mantra are given for each of the offending mātṛkās. After these offerings are made and the child is exposed to them, one may take the child away.

The text then prescribes certain fumigants or demonifuges to be used as direct therapy on the victim. The substances that comprise these fumigants should be collected and burned in the presence of the victim in order to create an environment unpleasant to the spirit, hence encouraging its departure.199 Fumigation therapy is still practiced in India, including in Kerala, Varanasi, Rajasthan, and Pune.200 I was informed by a well-known vaidya in Kerala who still manufactures and prescribes such fumigants that they should not be burned for more than fifteen minutes three times a day.201 It is doubtful that the recipes used for fumigants today anywhere in India are identical to those listed in the AH, Caraka, Susruta, or other classical āyurvedic texts, or even in classical Tantras, such as the ĪŚP. In Kerala, the ingredients and processes employed in their manufacture are secrets closely held by the families of aṣṭavaidya Nambudiris who have been handed down these ancient medical traditions.202 These physicians have studied the appropriate sections of the AH (but probably not Caraka and Susruta) and have a rough familiarity with the ĪŚP, though it is no longer formally studied or used as a ritual handbook in any of the surviving Kerala āyurvedic traditions.

The fumigation rite for an infant prescribes igniting neem leaves and ghee mixed with mustard seeds left over from offerings made to Śiva.203 This smoldering concoction should be carried around the infant clockwise, probably in an earthen bowl (though this is not mentioned). Neem leaves have long been regarded as a natural antiseptic,204 and, along with mustard seeds, they give off an intense smoke when burned. The ghee is prescribed because it helps ignite fire and encourages smoke to become dense when the flames die down. This combination of substances is apparently inhospitable to bhūtas, as it surely is to humans. At the same time, the ritualist should place sprouts germinated from nyagrodha, udumbara, aśvattha, bilva, and pālāsa seeds in a pot, rinse or sprinkle them with water for three days, and wash them thoroughly on the fourth day. The reason for this is not stated, but these are all “auspicious” plants, recommended for use in sacrifice (medhya) or as offerings to deities, and are regarded as conducive to the growth and renewal of the child.205 We may assume from this that the ritual should be repeated for three or four days.

The procedures and substances are identical if the affliction, this time by Sunandā, occurs in the child’s second year. The instructions for the third year’s exorcism state that ajaśṛṇga (this should probably read ajaśṛṇgī) should be added to the fumigant. This is a malodorous shrub whose fruit is said to be sharp as a horn, recommended as early as the AV (AVŚ 4.37; AVP 13.4) as a remedy for sore eyes as well as for destroying evil beings.206 For the fifth- to twelfth-year ritual, neem leaves should be burned (dhūpayet) mixed with ghee and guggulu, an aromatic resin prescribed to strengthen bones and connective tissue but also commonly used in homa because it ignites easily and burns continuously. In all cases, after the fourth day the ritualist should take a purificatory bath. According to the Khaḍgarāvaṇa, grahas can take hold of children up to the twelfth year. Īśānaśivagurudeva adds, however, that it can occur up to the sixteenth year, though others say bālagrahas can attack up to age seventeen. The text does not state what one should do with the puttalī after the exorcism is concluded, but, following traditional practice, it is likely that it was to be discarded in a river, temple tank, or other body of water considered sacred (tīrtha).

The ĪŚP does not give the rationale for the puttalī, though it is consistent with both earlier textuality of healing and current practice to infer that the disease, as well as the grāhī, will leave the patient or victim and enter the puttalī. The Kauśikasūtra, for example, prescribes a treatment for hepatitis in which a yellow bird should be placed in a bowl on the floor beneath the head of a person lying on a bed with his head extended over the end of the bed. While a certain hymn from the AVŚ (1.22) is being recited along with other mantras specific to the Kauśikasūtra, water should be poured over the person’s head so that it flows onto the bird.207 The disease then exits the patient and enters the bird. The notion that diseases might disappear but exogenous disease-causing agents continue to circulate is also attested at Bālājī, where possessing spirits may be temporarily transferred to a ritualist or clinician, as described earlier, and eventually be retrained as good spirits in the phauj or army of Hanumān. In that case, they permanently leave the body (and mind) of the client, whose psychosocial dysfunction gradually disappears as the grip (grahaṇa) of the bhūt-pret attenuates.

### The (Viṣa-) Nārāyaṇīya

The (Viṣa-) Nārāyaṇīya, so-called because its first ten chapters deal with poisons (viṣa, primarily from snakes) and their treatment,208 mentions grāhīs not only for specific years of the child’s life but for the first ten days of life and the first twelve months as well. It does not mention a puttalī, but does prescribe the construction of yantras, the placement of divinities within them, and the offerings and primary mantras to be employed for them, some of the latter being quite long and complicated. After noting the name of the grāhī, Pāpinī, which might afflict a child on the day it is born, the text states that a square sacrificial altar (balipīṭham) should be consecrated. This should be performed in the home, though the alternative is given of a crossroad (catvari), a ritually potent locale that is prescribed as a site for balidana in the Madanamahāṛṇava. Vīrabhadra should be installed in the center and the goddesses (mātṛḥ) in the corners and primary directions. Gaṇeśa (vināyakam) and Cāmuṇḍī should be installed in the northeast and worshipped with grain cakes, fish, meat, cooked rice, sesame, powdered spices, and other similar items, including liquor, representing, as in the case of substances prescribed by the Khaḍgarāvaṇa, the spectrum from pure to impure, cooling to heating, right-handed to left-handed.

As before, fumigants or demonifuges should be burned, but here the ingredients may consist of more exotic substances. A simple demonifuge is prescribed for the first day: neem leaves dipped in ghee, then mixed with shoots from the uśīra, (apa)marga, and pipal trees. More difficult is the one prescribed for the second day. After rubbing an ointment of sandalwood, uśīra leaf, mayura leaf, and goat’s urine on the baby, a demonifuge of cow’s teeth, horn, and hair should be burned. More difficult still is the one prescribed for the eighth day. After an ointment of goat’s urine mixed with vacā, a “hot” root often recommended for bestowing mental clarity or sharpness, and kuṣṭha, a very bitter plant, is applied to the baby, a demonifuge of tiger’s nails is burned. On the tenth day, monkey’s hair and nails are burned, and the ritual for the second month consists of, among other things, the burning of a fumigant of neem leaves and garlic. The procedures are often lengthy, thus I cannot enter into a full-scale treatment of them. It must suffice to provide the names of the goddesses and discuss some of the mantras.

The goddess for the first day is Pāpanī (Transgressive Lady), for the second day Bhāṣiṇī (Lady of Speech), for the third Jhaṇṭālī (Misty Lady[?]), for the fourth Kākolī (Raven Lady), for the fifth Siṃhikā (Lion Lady),209 for the sixth Phaṭkārī (Lady Who Exclaims phaṭ!),210 for the seventh Mukakeśī (Lady Whose Hair Smells Like Cowdung), for the eighth Daṇḍinī (Lady Who Holds the Staff), for the ninth Mahāmahiṣī (Great Buffalo Lady), and for the tenth Rodanī (Tearful Lady). The grāhī goddess for the first month of the first year is Putanā (Stinking Lady), for the second month Makuṭā (Crested Lady), for the third Gomukhī (Cow-Mouthed Lady), for the fourth Piṇgalā (Tawny Lady), for the fifth Haṃsikā (Goosey Lady), for the sixth Paṇkajā (Lotus Lady), for the seventh Śītalā (Cool Lady), for the eighth Yamunā (Goddess of the Yamunā River), for the ninth Kumbhakarṇī (Pot-Eared Lady), for the tenth Tāpasī (Lady of Austerities), for the eleventh Rākṣasī (Demoness), and for the twelfth Capalā (Trembling Lady). The second year the grāhī is Yātanā (Vengeful Lady), the third year Rodinī (Weeping Lady), the fourth Caṭakā (Sparrow Lady), the fifth Cañcalā (Fickle Lady), the sixth Dhāvanī (Loping Lady), the seventh Yamunā, the eighth Hāyanī (Relinquising Lady), the ninth Kālinī (Lady of Time), the tenth Kalahaṃsī (Supreme Goose Lady), the eleventh Devadūtī (Lady Emissary of the Gods), the twelfth Palitā (Crone), the thirteenth Vāyavī (Lady of the Wind), the fourteenth Yakṣiṇī, the fifteenth Muñjakamuñcī (Wicked Lady of the Bullrushes [?]), the sixteenth Vānarī (Monkey Lady), the seventeenth Bandhavatī (Lady Who Binds), and the eighteenth Kumārī (Princess).

For all of these, sesame is offered into a fire with the mantra o muñca paca daha āgaccha bālike ṭhaṭha (Om, Liberate! Cook! Burn! Come! Young lady, svāhā). After these bali offerings are made, japa (simple repetition of a mantra) is performed while the ritual officiant touches the child. The japa mantras are long, for example, namaḥ sarvamātṝṇāṃ hṛdayamoṭaka mañja kaḍhḍha sphoṭaya sphura gṛhṇa ākarṣaya troṭaya evaṃ jñāpayati hara nirdoṣaṃ kuru bālakaṃ ṭhaṭha (Salutations, O remedy in the form of a heart-pill for all the Little Mothers, cleanse! kaḍhḍha[?]! Flash! Spring forth! Possess! Attract! Break apart! Thus one should announce. O Hara, make this child faultless, svāha).211 Other, longer mantras follow, which are said to lead to the liberation of the spirit (grahamukti). A number of protective verse mantras should then be recited. These resemble versified nyasas, invoking an abundance of male divinities to protect the directions and the parts of the body. In these texts, male deities are protective and liberating, especially Gaṇeśa and Vīrabhadra, while goddesses either play a subservient role or are themselves the possessing grāhīs.
 
## Healing and the Circulation of Knowledge
As important as it is to examine the categories and taxonomies of bhūtavidyā, it is equally important to examine the healing process. This involves investigating the broader dynamics of exorcism: ritual, pharmacopia, healers, and the interaction between healer and client. Some of this has been addressed above, in anthropological and other ethnographic discussions of the healing process.212 We shall here look more closely at selected passages from the vast āyurvedic and tantric material, mostly the former.

It is impossible to address the exorcistic material in all the relevant texts. With the limitation of employing selected passages it is best to approach them chronologically, because this is the best way to convey an idea of how the practices and, indeed, the vidyā of bhūtavidyā evolved. This also helps illuminate key aspects of the morphology of the cultural, linguistic, and moral underpinnings of mental illness, especially of exogenously produced unmāda. A much longer study could be undertaken on this if more material is used. But the following should provide a few guidelines for such a study.

In discussion of these treatments, I must first summarize some of the exorcistic procedures found in Caraka, Suśruta, and Vāgbhaṭa, including the diagnostics, pharmacopeia and other “rational” modalities (yuktivyapāśrayacikitsā),213 as well as ritual and moral treatments (daivavyapāsrayacikitsā). Then I discuss in some detail the procedures found in the Cakradatta, an important āyurvedic text of the eleventh century that brings together āyurvedic and tantric therapies. It would be a mistake to assert that exorcisms are of a single style of practice or generated by indigenous scholars equally informed about the intricacies of medicine and ritual, especially after the turn of the first millennium C.E. Like all ritual in India, this was diversified even within specific performative traditions.214 The ethnography that concludes this chapter is drawn from fieldwork I conducted in Kerala and demonstrates how medical, tantric, and astrological traditions operate in tandem, in a seamlessly functioning and fairly ancient system of referral, how they strengthen rather than isolate one another.

### Treatment in the Early Āyurvedic Compendia

The earliest compendia, Caraka and Susruta, of the early centuries of the Common Era, as well as those of the next chronological level four or five centuries later, Kāśyapa and Vāgbhaṭa’s AH and ASaṃ, do not mirror each other as closely as might be expected in their treatment of unmāda. Considerable differences may be found among the texts, including differences in opinion that go beyond the enumeration and designation of grahas. The most glaring instance of this is Caraka’s overall treatment of unmāda, which is less nuanced and more straightforward than Susruta’s. One aspect of this is Caraka’s more substantial treatment of the psychopharmacology.

Susruta defines the terms graha and bhūta more specifically than Caraka, but he adds details that were probably borrowings from other genres (e.g., the Sanskrit epics), namely, that grahas are powerful beings who achieved their present form through severe austerities, religious donations, performative and moral vows, and observation of appropriate socioreligious duties. These enabled them to achieve the “eight powers” according to their respective strength.215 However, adds Susruta, they do not themselves possess humans; it is their minions who do their bidding, who do the dirty work of possession, and, in a statement presumably directed at Caraka and others, Susruta states that “those who say that they possess are to be removed from the orbit of bhūtavidyā due to their ignorance.”216 This agrees with the general tenor of what may be found in the Mahābhārata, Rāmayana, and other major texts of the time, which mention myriad demons under the control of a few, an ideology of bhūtas that we still find today at Bālājī in Rajasthan, Chottanikkara in Kerala, and generally throughout India (as well as in many areas of Christendom, where the “evil one” is said to have innumerable agents).

After distinguishing the different bhūtas, Caraka (CaCi 6.9.23) declares that, if unmāda is caused by possession by spirits that demand sex or worship, the physician (bhiṣak) should determine the nature of the possession through the intent and behavior of the client and then prescribe suitable medicinal treatment and mantras, as well as sacrificial offerings and gifts of food.217 Caraka subsequently recommends a variety of therapies common to both exogenous (āgantukā) and endogenous (nija) unmāda—intended to cleanse the victim internally and restore his or her balance of doṣas. The therapies include laxatives, dietary modification, emetics, medicated oil applied to the head (sirovirecana), full-body oil massage, inhalation (of smoke from a dhūmavarti, a medicated cigar) and fumigation therapies, bloodletting, and, especially for exogenous unmāda, consumption of ghee. These therapies “enliven the mind, intellect, memory, and consciousness” (manobuddhismṛtisaṃjñāprabodhanam; CaCi 6.9.32cd).

Incurable insanity is also recognized, in which case treatment is not recommended. However, extreme insanity that is deemed curable may be treated with extreme therapies, including forms of shock therapy including beatings (tāḍanam), which might be useful in “stimulating the mind, intellect, and body” (manobuddhidehasaṃvejanam; CaCi 6.9.29cd). A person might also be tied up tightly, though gently, with cloth (rather than rope), and confined to a dark room from which dangerous objects like iron rods and wooden sticks have been removed. Other kinds of shock therapies include shouting angrily at the patient, terrorizing him with the help of the local police who threaten to arrest or even execute him, having snakes that have had their fangs removed bite him, and threatening the patient with tamed (if still frightening) lions and elephants.218 At the same time, the victim should be given presents, reassurance, and consolation by friends, and exposure to emotions opposite from the one on which the patient is obsessing—passion, grief, fear, anger, exhilaration, jealousy, and greed are mentioned—that might help turn the mind in a different direction. The principles of these largely exotic treatments appear to be, first, to rebuild the mind and body with medicines that address both the humoral imbalance and the personality affliction; second, to bring the patient out of his or her condition by exposure to positive emotions; third, to shock the patient out of his or her obsessions; and, fourth, to bring a constant undercurrent of support and consolation to the patient. All of these should “lead to a state of mental normalcy by countering memory loss.”219

Thus, a full arsenal of treatments is brought to bear on possession. CaSū 11.54 defines the three areas of treatment mentioned at the beginning of this chapter: daivavyapāśraya, yuktivyapāśraya, and sattvāvajaya: “Daivavyapāśraya indicates the use of mantras, herbs, gemstones, auspicious offerings, gifts of food, fire offerings, scriptural observance, expiatory rites, fasting, chanting of hymns, surrender to deities, and pilgrimage. Yuktivyapāśraya indicates proper food, medicine and [other] substances. Sattvāvajaya is the holding back of the mind from harmful objects.”220 The last of these, sattvāvajaya, is not mentioned beyond this, possibly because it was regarded as implicit in proper observation of daivavyapāśraya.221 Thus, the texts describe in detail only the first two, at least by name. Much later in his text, as a conclusion to his section on treatment for unmāda, Caraka expands on his description of daivavyapāśrayacikitsā. As a partial remedy for unmāda, he enjoins,

One should perform pujā, offer sacrifice [bali], give offerings of food, ritually apply collyrium sanctified by mantras, and perform pacification rituals, Vedic sacrifice, repetition of divine name, rituals for auspicious occasions, and expiatory ritual. Worshipping Īśvara [viz. Śiva], the lord of the universe, the leader of bhūtas, constantly and with effort, one becomes victorious over the fear born of unmāda. One should perform puja to Rudra’s attendants [gaṇaḥ] called pramathas, who roam about in the world, thereby releasing them from various forms of unmāda. Exogenous possession [unmāda] becomes pacified [prasamam] through sacrifice, auspicious actions, fire ritual, wearing amulets that are healing because they contain appropriate herbs, observing truthfulness and good conduct, performing penance [tapas], developing knowledge, becoming charitable, observance of scriptural limits and vows, through honoring deities, cows, brahmans, and gurus, and through the application of perfected mantras and medicines. (CaCi 6.9.89–94)

Caraka’s exposition of the “rational treatment” (yuktivyapāsrayacikitsā) of unmāda consists largely of descriptions of medicinal preparations used to treat multiple conditions, most of them vāta debilitations.222 Because, according to Āyurveda, vāta evolves into prāṇa, it is in many ways a more fundamental doṣa than pitta or kapha. This is why, according to many practitioners, treatment for vāta derangement is more capable of abetting a cure for pitta or kapha conditions than treatment for one of the latter two would be for healing vāta debilitation.

This may also explain why ghee-based herbal preparations are prescribed as a remedy for unmāda in general, for one whose “mind is struck by a bhūta” (bhutopahatacitta), for bad luck (alakṣmī), for transgression (papa), and for demonic seizure (rakṣoghna). These preparations are also said to destroy all grahas (sarvagrahavināśanam; CaCi 6.9.41d). Ghee is believed to act directly to alleviate vāta and pitta debilitation, while taken in moderation it does not exacerbate kapha debilitation. Because of the esoteric nature of the descriptions of ghee-based preparations, and the extensive lists of ingredients used in their preparation, I can here offer only a brief description. To begin with, most of the preparations consist of a large number of herbs mixed with ghee. However, a few special, relatively simple, recipes require “old ghee” (purāṇaṃ ghṛtam). Caraka states that ten-year-old ghee used as a base is capable of rectifying all the doṣas and eliminating grahas. Ghee older than ten years is called prapurāṇa (very old), and ghee which is a hundred years old can cure any disease: “just the sight, touch, or smell of this casts out all grahas.”223

This practice is still current. In the eighteenth century, when the British finally defeated the Peshwas in Pune, they are said to have found a large number of pots of prapurāṇa ghee in Shanwar Wada, the fortress in the center of the old city. With respect to its manufacture, I am informed that “you must make sure that it is totally cooked, meaning that all the water is evaporated, and then it must be kept very dry. Then it begins to age.”224 Other informants in India have told me that the production of purāṇa-ghṛtam, which includes the manufacture and vigilant protection of ghee, occurs elsewhere as well. It is stored in large clay pots lined on the outside with copper or bell metal (kāṃsya), and was once a relatively common āyurvedic practice.

In an ensuing discussion of treatments for apasmara, also said to be effective against demonic infestation and other kinds of unmāda, Caraka prescribes a large number of animal products to be mixed into the preparations. Most common are recipes containing pañcagavya, the “five products of the cow”: milk, sour yogurt, ghee, urine, and liquid squeezed from dung.225 Goat’s or cow’s urine is also frequently mentioned as an ingredient independent of pañcagavya. One recipe calls for a number of herbs to be mixed with cow’s or goat’s urine along with leech excrement, ash from incinerated goat’s hair, donkey bone, elephant’s toenail, and hair from a cow’s tail (CaCi 6.10.39–40). From a modern perspective such recipes appear to be exotic, to say the least. However, Caraka and others probably did not include them for shock value, except possibly to shock an offending graha; a patient suffering from convulsions or any kind of mental disorder quite likely was not able to identify the ingredients in these preparations. More likely, animal products were deemed more antithetical to the possessing spirits, thus indirectly influencing, and even rectifying, humoral imbalances.226

Suśruta offers greater detail on antidotes to specific grahas (SuUt 6.60.29–37), as well as a number of more generally applicable remedies. The latter are not as profuse as are found in Caraka, but the attention paid to individual grahas indicates that Susruta emerges from a different, if related, medical tradition than Caraka, an oft-noted fact. Susruta states that grahas are nourished by the color red; thus, they should be given gifts of red clothes and offerings of red flowers, meat, and blood. The eight grahas mentioned by Susruta should be pacified with these and other appropriate items in rituals held in a temple (for a devagraha), at a crossroad (for an asura), amid cows (for a gandharva), in a pleasant room (for a yakṣa), by a river (for a pitṛgraha or a nāga), at a crossroad or in a dense forest (for a rakṣas), and in an abandoned house (for a piśāca). If these offerings do not succeed in alleviating the possession, the next recourse is fumigation therapy. One of these fumigants consists of goat, bear, porcupine, and owl skin mixed with asafoetida and goat’s urine. Another consists of oil (taila, unspecified, but sesame is usually the default oil) mixed with feces of a donkey, mule, owl, camel, dog, vulture, crow, or pig. Most of the recipes, however, consist of a mixture of herbs and animal products, including bile from different animals, including fish and cow, and the nails of various feral beasts, including a variety of large and small felines, alligator, mongoose, and so on. Like Caraka, Susruta may have selected these creatures in part because of their perceived dominant doṣa, but probably largely because they were feral and could thus overpower the afflicting graha.

Susruta adds a chapter (6.62) on the diagnostics of unmāda according to humoral imbalance. It is not necessary to enter into the details here, but it suffices to note that the diagnoses comply with the characteristics of the grahas and that the details of the shock therapy are in essential agreement with those given by Caraka (a few details are added, such as whipping or tying the victim with chains), and a bit more dietary advice is given.

Kāsyapa Kalpasthānam, chapter 1, lists a large number of recipes to be used as demonifuges, for example, “A fumigant [dhūpa] named Uttama [Best] is recommended for people overcome by pretas and pūtanās [indicating all balagrahas]. It should be prepared from ghee, siddhārthaka [?], honey, sheep’s horn, goat’s milk, donkey’s hair and urine, and soma” (KSKa 1.11–12).227

The AH Uttarasthāna (AH-Ut) 6.3 discusses balagrahas and recommends an array of possible treatments for such invasion, including various fumigants, medicated ghee, decoctions for nocturnal baths (snapana), and ritual. Much of this is found in Caraka and Susruta, but the corpus is here expanded. AH-Ut 6.5, titled bhūtapratiṣedha (repulsing bhūtas), again covers a gamut of remedies, including recipes for pills (guḍa) to ward off insanity (6.5.15–17), again with an exotic mixture of vegetal and animal products, special offerings for most of the species of offending grahas listed in 6.4 (translated above), mantras invoking Dvādasabhuja (Twelve-Armed) Īśvara or Āryāvalokita Nātha, the mahāmāyūrī mantra (cf. discussion of the Bower manuscript above), and worship of various other multiforms of Śiva, including Bhūtesa, Sthānu, and the latter’s attendants, called pramathas (agitators, shakers).228

### The Cakradatta: Pharmacopeia
As an example of the discourse of healing in the āyurvedic text passages on possession, I draw on the Cikitsāsaṃgraha, otherwise called Cakradatta, a therapeutic text of the mid-eleventh century, thus placing it chronologically in the third tier of āyurvedic textuality.229 The author, Cakrapāṇidatta, is best known for his commentary on Caraka. But he also wrote this independent treatise, which became widely followed in his native Bengal. Although much of the material is drawn from Caraka, it updates and situates it in a healing locus more definitively systematic, as Āyurveda had by then become a sastra with a long and distinguished tradition. This compendium of āyurvedic therapeutics is conspicuous for its rich pharmacopeia. Although it does not come out particularly strongly in the passage at hand, the Cakradatta surpassed its predecessors in integrating tantric medicine and practices, which include mercurial and other mineral-based preparations and a tantric repertoire of mantra and yantra, into the formulary and ritual recommendations of Caraka. This text probably came as close as any to representing a complete form of Āyurveda, in north India at least, at the time of its composition. Chapter 20 of the Cakradatta addresses unmāda, distinguishing psychological dysfunction with identifiable causes (nija) from exogenously induced (āgantuka) unmāda. In discussing the latter, Cakrapāṇidatta describes the pharmacopeia and mentions certain aspects of ritual treatment.

44. The practice of consuming ghee, etc., as well as the use of mantra, etc., are introduced for [treatment of] the exogenous variety [of unmāda]. The physician [bhiṣak], having undergone his own purification, should treat exogenous unmāda with ceremonies of worship [puja], normal sacrificial oblations [bali], nonsacrificial offerings [upahāra], vedic fire ritual [iṣṭi], non-vedic fire ritual [homa], mantra repetition, ritual application on the head or body of colored or scented salve or paste [añjana], etc., each according to its respective ritual injunctions.  
45. A salve [añjana] prepared from long pepper [pippalī], black pepper [marica], black sulphurous salt [saindhava], honey, and bovine bile [gopitta] destroys extreme insanity caused by all kinds of spirits.
46. A pill [guḍika] made from dāruharidrā and honey in the lunar asterism called puṣya is [powdered and] made into a salve.230  
47. Alternatively, marica mixed with bovine bile that has been placed in the sun for one month may be beneficial as a salve. This is used for distorted vision [hallucinations] when memory is lost due to imbalance of humors or spirit possession.  
48. A fumigant [dhūpa] that wards off enchantment [ḍākinya], etc., made of neem leaves, vacā,231 asafoetida [hiṇgu], sloughed-off snake skin [sarpanirmoka], and mustard seed, may be used to destroy madness caused by spirit possession.  
49. According to tradition, a fumigant [dhūpa] made of a ball packed together with cotton seeds, coppery eye of peacock feathers [mayūrapiccha], bṛhatī, and nirmālya, [added to a bundle consisting of] cinnamon [tvak], the soft extrusions at the joints of bamboo segments [vaṃśalocana], cat excrement [vṛṣadaṃsa-viṭ],232 grain husks, vacā, jatāmāṃsī,233 and sloughed-off snake skin [ahinirmoka], and equal quantities of [powdered] cow’s horn and dvipadanta, asafoetida [hiṇgu], and black pepper [marica], alleviates fever that arises due to possession [āvesa] caused by the skanda entities [skandonmāda], piśācas, rākṣasas, and suras.  
1. A nasal preparation [nasyam] of roots and ripened fruit of aindrī [indravāruṇī] and cow urine234 allows victory over brahmarākṣasas. A nasal preparation of svetā and ricewater [jyeṣṭhāmbu] mixed with ghee wards off bhūtas.  
2. In the case of madness caused by deities [deva], sages [ṛṣi], deceased ancestors [pitṛ], and gandharvas, an intelligent person should avoid irritant salves, etc., and other harsh measures.  
3. The symptomatology of the departure of madness is clarity of the senses, intellect, self, and mind, as well as normalization of the dhātus.  

We have seen many of the exotic substances recommended here in earlier texts. Among them, cat excrement (which may have been dried and powdered), sloughed-off snake skin (ahinirmoka), and the coppery eye of the peacock feather (mayūrapiccha) were probably classified, at least informally, as vāta (wind-reducing substances) and thus antispasmodics that at the same time rebuild afflicted systems.235 In present-day Kerala the vaidyas praise classical recipes like this one. They employ the herbal ingredients recommended, such as vacā, black pepper, asafoetida, neem leaves, and cinnamon, but use other substances in place of the animal products, including garlic, white śaṇkhapuṣpi, and chili.

Although unmāda could result from a specified imbalance of any of the three doṣas, most of the evidence encountered in both the āyurvedic and tantric texts suggests that externally induced (āgantuka) negative possession is vāta-based more often than it is pitta- or kapha-based. Among the symptoms of spirit possession described in these texts that are more characteristic of vāta debilitation are excessive facial gestures, uncontrolled body movements, stammering, cold limbs, and attention-deficit disorders. These symptoms, we should recall, align closely with Caraka’s general description of unmāda cited earlier, which, more than the other doṣas, is a description of vāta debilitation. Nevertheless, afflictions more often associated with other doṣas are also found in descriptions of the various grahas, as we have seen. Primary among these is extreme anger, more frequently associated with debilitated pitta. In all cases, however, it appears that antispasmodics, prescribed primarily to mitigate vāta debilitation, are recommended for alleviation of spirit possession.

## Possession and Exorcism in Contemporary Āyurveda
Much of the following is based on research conducted in Kerala in 2002 and 2004. I undertook this research after hearing a rumor from a usually reliable source that a number of āyurvedic physicians and tāntrikas (or mantravādins, as they are called in Kerala) still follow the practices of possession and exorcism outlined in the ĪŚP. On close investigation, I learned that this is not true. Nevertheless, it is likely that some of the current practices are derivative of what is found there or at least from a complex heritage of texts and practices that gave rise to the ĪŚP.

My primary conclusions, after speaking extensively to more than a dozen highly placed vaidyas, mantravādins, and jyotiṣis (astrologers), are that: (1) notions of bhūtas and bhūtavidyā are substantially unchanged from what appear in the classical texts;236 (2) most of the clients are women, including a large number of Muslims; (3) an entrenched system of referral among the three groups of practitioners, which constitutes a mental health-care delivery system of considerable sophistication, is still very much in place;237 (4) the groups freely borrow both textuality and ritual apparatus from one another. A full ethnography of the possession events that I witnessed in Kerala is beyond the scope of the present work.238 Instead, I present a summary account of the points mentioned above, particularly the latter two, the system of referral and the shared textuality. These are most important for our purposes because they are crucial in assembling an epistemology that encourages the development of a complex and integrated healing tradition among the vaidyas, mantravādins, and astrologers of central and northern Kerala, particularly in districts of central Malabar, north of Cochin.

Two lineages of āyurvedic practice are currently found in these and the districts to the south, from Kollam (Quilon) in south-central Kerala to Kozhikode (Calicut) and beyond in the northern districts of the state and from the coast to Palakkad (Palghat) in the hills of eastern Kerala and beyond to Coimbatore, a city of over a million people in Tamilnadu, barely fifteen kilometers from the Kerala border. The two lineages are the aṣṭavaidya tradition, transmitted for centuries by Nambudiri brahmans, and the non-brahman tradition established by Vaidyaratnam P. S. Varier in 1902 in the town of Kottakkal in Mallapuram District. The latter has since spread throughout Kerala and is now creating a discernible presence on the āyurvedic map as far north as Delhi.239 Both lineages maintain the AH as their primary text.

My most valuable informants were Vaidyamadham Narayanan Nambudiri of Mezhathur and Kumaraswami Nambudiripad of Kāttumataṇ Mannā, both in Palakkad District. The latter is well known locally as an expert in mantravidyā to whom Vaidyamadham occasionally refers patients diagnosed with exogenous unmāda. Vaidyamadham, who learned Āyurveda from his father in the aṣṭavaidya tradition, is one of Kerala’s most-respected āyurvedic practitioners. His practices and opinions carry considerable weight.240 I spoke with him at length and observed some of his practices. As is the case with the other vaidyas in the predominantly Muslim districts of Malabar, most of Vaidyamadham’s patients are Muslims, including those who come to him for treatment of mental dysfunction or illness.

After observing a fair amount of practiced, but nevertheless unpredictable and captivating (to both ethnographer and participant), possession ritual at the Chottanikkara “Bhagavathy” temple, a well known goddess temple about thirty kilometers east of Cochin, where the use of puttalīs is common, it became clear to me that most of the victims were girls and young women from about fifteen to about twenty-five years old. This is in keeping with ethnographic reports throughout India. The women exhibited the classic symptoms of possession on having darshan of the goddess, exhibiting rhythmic rotating of the head with hair unbraided, wild body movements, shouting and thrashing about, and so on. Although this temple is noted for both possession and exorcism, what I observed was not entirely “negative” possession, even if there was undoubtedly a negative onus cast on the girls by their families. I say this because their apparent dissociation is in many cases accompanied by palpable states of exhilaration, rendering it more accurately a highly focused, if at a certain point uncontrollable, liminal state, albeit one without an apparent oracular component. Were it mere dissociation, as most scholars understand it, this complexity would be negated, particularly as the girls in question appear to maintain some awareness of their complex state of consciousness and the transformations (albeit temporary) wrought on their persons as a result of their possession. The temptation to express themselves through possession states appears to contain an element of choice, at least some of the time; even if many of the girls are “clinically” ill, the temptation to “act possessed,” to unleash this “spirit” within themselves to the point at which their self-imposed liminality overwhelms their socialized personalities, includes critical elements of excitement and fascination.
Similarly, their psychophysical attitude or comportment (bhava), regardless of whether a product of illness, is clearly liberating, at least in the short run. In either case, whether the possession fits into indigenous categories of ecstasy or derangement (or both), the experience is valorized, sanctified, and healed or exorcised by the goddess. In cases of negative possession, the evident attraction of this kind of ecstatic healing environment is that the uncontrollable meandering and eclipse of the socialized personality are given an opportunity to express themselves. This is exemplified in girls who appear to engage in both sides of a dialogue, in different voices and intonations, in which the goddess and the possessing spirits argue or even fight. If the possessed person is deemed by the healer, family members, or ritual officiant to be ready to expel the spirit, and if adequate administrative and ritual preparations are made, including payments and the acquisition of the proper material items (including a puttalī), a brief ceremony is then performed. Several regular attendees who had seen this ceremony (I did not witness it) described it to me. In it, I was told, the officiant drives the bhūtam, sometimes in the form of the puttalī, into the tree with a nail or railway spike in the presence of the afflicted individual and accompanying family members, after which the victim beats her (or, less frequently, his) fists or head on it. As expected, this act is less practical than symbolic and “ritual”; the human head cannot beat a nail or railway spike into a tree without causing irreparable damage. Thus, we must assume, the nail has been placed in a hole already drilled or otherwise hammered into the tree. The purpose of beating the nail with the head or fists, then, is to provide conviction and a sense of personal immediacy to the exorcism and, perhaps, to draw blood as an attractive offering to the goddess.

It is important to note that the girls (and a few men) at Chottanikkara are Hindus (and possibly a few Christians), and their conditions did not appear to be irreversable. By contrast, most of the victims of unmāda who attend the clinics of the local vaidyas are either Muslims who would not travel to Chottanikkara or members of other communities with serious psychological dysfunction. Vaidyas of both the aṣṭavaidya and Varier traditions, when repeatedly asked why most of their patients suffering from unmāda diagnosed as āgantuka were young women, gave one response with regularity: Young girls did not modernize as seamlessly as young men, and this opened them up to possession. This was not a satisfying answer, and it gave the impression that they were not telling the whole story. Finally, Vaidyamadham Nambudiri told me that these girls frequently are depressed, abused, and isolated, and suffer from drug addiction. Much of the abuse is sexual, he said, and occurs within the family; they have no outlet for expression in their families, and thus they are psychically weakened and become susceptible to possession, a situation greatly exacerbated by drug addiction. Regardless of the identity of the intoxicant, which from its description could be an opiate, he treats the victims with his arsenal of āyurvedic medicines, or refers them to Kumaraswami Nambudiripad for ritual treatment.

Kumaraswami was also very forthcoming with me, and I asked him what he does with these girls. On the whole, he counsels them and uses his position to establish a comforting and positive rapport with them. Very rarely does he perform tantric rituals for these girls. More than ritual, he says, they need someone to talk to, an admission that he has little ability or authority to deal with their actual problems. But Vaidyamadham, a physician, takes a more proactive āyurvedic approach. He prescribes fumigation (dhūma) with “foul-smelling substances,” three times a day for up to fifteen minutes, usually for several consecutive days. Although the vaidyas of Kerala continue to praise classical recipes for fumigants, such as the ones we saw in the Cakradatta, they employ only some of the herbal ingredients recommended, including vacā, black pepper, asafoetida, neem leaves, and cinnamon. They use other substances in place of the animal products, including garlic, white śaṇkhapuṣpi,241 and hot chili. Fumigation is administered on the premises of his clinic by his trained staff. He also prescribes emesis or induced vomiting (vamana) in which the patient expels the offending bhūta after drinking a concoction of goat’s milk, white śaṇkhapuṣpī, and a few other unnamed herbal substances (this concoction is used by several vaidyas in Kerala), oil massage (a specialty of Kerala āyurveda), and, if necessary, mantravidyā, in which case he refers the patient to Kumaraswami Nambudiripad.

If Mr. Nambudiripad or certain other members of his family who are privy to the meticulously protected family secrets deems mantravidyā to be advisable, they will counsel the victims and prescribe for them certain kinds of medicated ghee that help eliminate the bhūta. In the āyurvedic idiom employed by Vaidyamadham and Kumaraswami, drinking ghee (snehapānam) and inducing vomiting (vamana) are effective therapies for unmāda because they “boost buddhi [intelligence].” They manufacture their ghee-based medicines themselves and subsequently potentiate them by offering them to their deities, Bhagavatī (Durgā) and Gaṇapati, with mantras known only to them. Only then are they dispensed to their clients. In fact, irrespective of whatever ritualizing they might enact on the patient, their main form of mantravidyā is empowering these medicines with mantras.

I asked both Narayanan Nambudiri and Kumaraswami Nambudiripad whether their mantravidyā and practices of exorcism derive from the ĪŚP or other similar tantric compendia that were composed in Sanskrit long ago in Kerala. They had heard of this and other similar texts, including the (Viṣa-)Nārāyaṇīya, and knew, vaguely, that they contained mantras and instructions on possession and exorcism. However, they had not read any of them. Because of the secrecy of their traditions, I have no way of knowing whether their mantras resemble those found in these texts. I can only conjecture that the tradition of employing mantravidyā in exorcism remains unbroken in Kerala and that this tradition has always allowed considerable flexibility and variation, but with only a small number of survivals into the past few generations.

Kumaraswami Nambudiripad, as well as members of an unrelated family of Nambudiris from Poomkutil Mannā near Manjeri, in Mallapuram District, about fifty difficult kilometers away, state that they learned their mantravidyā and associated healing practices from their forefathers through direct observation and instruction, not from books or Sanskrit manuscripts.242 Kumaraswami, as suggested, is not the recipient of any immediate Sanskrit tradition. He regards himself as a mantravādin, not a tāntrika. In Kerala, he explained, tāntrikas perform temple ritual with the help of Tantras and Āgamas. He hails from one of four Nambudiri families of mantravādins ritually affiliated with the Mookambika goddess temple of Kannur, in northern Kerala. Not all four families, he says, actively practice mantravāda. Mantravādins specialize in treatments that require personal attention outside the temple. These treatments need not be based on known sastra. On Sundays, he says, more than a hundred people come to his Mannā for treatment of bhut-bādhā. The mannā itself is picturesque, consisting of a large family house at the bottom of a long driveway sloping down from the main road. Next to it is a well-maintained temple. These are surrounded by several acres of lush and well-tended fruit trees, with one prominent pipal tree in the front yard, which, says Kumaraswami, houses a chāttan.

This is a spirit indigenous to Kerala. All my informants agree that this is a class (gaṇa) of bhūtas, specifically a janglī bhūta (primitive, undomesticated jungle spirit).243 Among the symptoms of harassment by a chāttan are rocks falling inexplicably on one’s roof or large amounts of hair found in one’s food (specifically in ḍāl). A chāttan is also explained as “a force, something like a yakṣa.” It is not always malevolent and could even be protective if regularly and properly appeased, which, it is said, is accomplished by leaving votive offerings for it at a shrine constructed beneath certain large trees. In addition, certain people are called chāttans. They are most often depicted as members of backward classes who are short, dark, and demonic in a modest, nonfatal manner. They practice chāttan upāsana, meaning that they are possessed by a chāttan and practice chāttan jādu (black magic associated with a chāttan). However, even Nambudiris are capable of performing chāttan upāsana. In Thrissur District live several chāttan maṭhas or extended houses of people, mostly related, who are trained through family or lineage tradition in ritual appeasement of chāttans by making offerings at their shrines. Although leaving votive offerings beneath trees appears to be a simple matter, it is not so simple that any untrained person can do it. Another person informed me that his father once called in a Nambudiri from Kāttumatan Mannā to perform chāttan sevā, as the Nambudiris call it. His father believed that he was being bothered by a chāttan, as his businesses were going bad and illnesses were occurring in the family.

Kumaraswami’s clients report that they are afflicted by enemies, ancestral spirits (pitṛs), and chāttans. When they come to him, he recites simple mantras, most of them inaudibly, talks to the client, ties a black string around the wrist—a protective device that lasts several months before it weathers away, and, as mentioned above, gives medicated and ritually empowered medicinal ghee. Most referrals are through astrologers (jyotiṣī), but some come from vaidyas, such as Vaidyamadham. Kumaraswami says he knows only pratihāra (exorcism), mantra, and other procedures that “strike against” invasive beings; he does not claim to know medicine or astrology.

Vaidyamadham Nambudiri and Kumaraswami Nambudiripad also accept clients referred from astrologers. I therefore contacted a few highly recommended practitioners of this ubiquitous South Asian art form in Coimbatore and Kozhikode. Astrology and priesthood have had a long association in India,244 as have astrology and medicine, especially in South India. One of the convergences is textual. Perhaps the most important text of prasna or horary astrology (see Chapter 11), at least in Kerala, is the Praśnamārga (PrMā). The twelfth chapter of this complex text discusses the influence of the planets on health. Most of the chapter (verses 18–62) is dedicated to a discussion of unmāda and apasmāra. Verses 18–20 divide disease (roga) into the two familiar divisions of nija and āgantuka. Nija diseases may be either physical (sarirottha) or mental (cittottha), while those classified as āgantuka are unnatural, though they may be born of either visible or invisible causes (dṛṣṭādṛṣṭanimittajāḥ). The PrMā then describes the astrological configurations in a person’s natal horoscope (kuṇḍali) that indicate mental dysfunction. Space limitations prevent the discussion of the astrological significations here; I can only note that if a critical mass of discord exists between the planets, houses, and signs that govern one’s mind, emotions, general state of well-being, social capacities, and tendencies toward conflict, then mental or emotional instability of the visible (dṛṣṭa) type results. If these conditions are not met, and there is still instability, then the unmāda must be judged to be the work of obstructive spirits (bādhakagrahasambhavāḥ; 12.24d). The PrMā and its commentaries link planetary discord with emotional instability, untoward life-style choices, curses (sāpa-), black magic (abhicāra-), and other kinds of incidental decline, including social ostracism, into a fully evidentiary and cross-referenced whole, which is to say as consistent with the general presentation of astrology as a tightly woven epistemological or sāstraic system.245 According to my āyurvedic informants in Kerala and Coimbatore, the AH recommends astrology as an adjunct to Āyurveda. Their authority for this is AHSū 1.31c, which suggests that healing is facilitated when the planets are congenial (graheṣv anuguṇeṣu). This is widely quoted as a justification for employing astrology as a diagnostic tool.246

The PrMā (12:34a–c) describes the causes of unmāda in language familiar from the āyurvedic texts: excessive joy, desire, fear, grief, eating forbidden or unclean food, and the wrath of the gods and gurus. After breaking down the symptoms of unmāda according to the afflicted doṣa, the PrMā describes possession by a devagraha in familiar terms, but does not name other grahas. Instead, the text personifies as female grahas a dozen symptoms of seizure (apasmāra, 12.53–54): Svāsanā (Gasping), Malina (Dirtying), Nidrā (Sleep), Jṛmbhikā (Yawning), Anaśanā (Not Eating), Trāsinī (Fear), Mohinī (Enchantress), Rodanī (Weeping), Krodhanī (Anger), Tāpanī (Excitable), Śoṣaṇī (Dryness), and Dhvaṃsinī (Destructress). Throughout this section the PrMā prescribes different kinds of medicated ghee, including pañcagavya, and various kinds of sacrifice and homa. Most of these are to be administered only by qualified āyurvedic physicians and tantric ritual specialists.

One ritual, however, deserves special praise in the PrMā: the mṛtyuñjaya homa (13.36–39). This consists of a simple burnt offering of rice, black sesame seeds, and other uncooked grains, roots, fruits, and so on, with the so-called mahāmṛtyuñjaya mantra, the mantra that “conquers death.” This is perhaps the most commonly recited mantra for homa in India. The mantra, oṃ tryàmbakam yajāmahe sugandhím puṣṭivárdhanam | urvārukám iva bándhanān mṛtyór mukṣīya mmtāt| (We make offerings to Tryambaka (Rudra), the fragrant, increaser of prosperity; like a cucumber from its stem, from death may I be loosened, not from immortality) (ṚV 7.59.12, TS 1.8.6.2, etc.).247 The PrMā 13.36ab states that this ritual should be practiced to pacify all diseases, especially sharp fever (tivrajvara) and those brought on by black magic (abhicāra; 13.37), a category in which most spirit possession generally abides. This belief, as mentioned earlier, continues to the present day, as Dwyer’s survey at Bālājī attests. In Kerala, this takes the form of kaiviṣa, a Malayalam compound meaning “poison from someone’s hand” (Mal. kai [hand]; Skt. viṣa [poison]). In this form of abhicāra, a poison that is said to bring on unmāda or apasmāra is given surreptitiously to a person to drink or swallow, often with milk. The poison may be an ensorcelled hair, iron powder, aconite, or an insect’s body. Thus, the PrMā, standing outside the textuality of Āyurveda and Tantra, at least formally if not practically, actively invites the participation of experts in these two allied bodies of knowledge to treat what is to this text primarily astrological affliction.248

## Diagnosing Possession
Beyond astrology, and beyond our concern with practices in Kerala, it is relevant to ask how is nija unmāda (mental illness with traceable physiological or psychological origins) distinguished from āgantuka unmāda (mental illness believed to be the result of possession)? In the case of nija unmāda, the vaidya takes a case history and undertakes a medical evaluation. In most cases, the cause is readily acknowledged: family problems, a death in the family, financial pressure, a life-threatening illness. The usual problems are depression and anxiety, as elsewhere in the world, and the unmāda is usually diagnosed as a vāta affliction and treated accordingly.

The tool most commonly employed for diagnosing āgantuka unmāda is observation. What vaidyas look for is abrupt and specifically defined behavioral change. However, this is not usually accepted as the final word, as most vaidyas try to verify these findings by taking a detailed case history and initiating a full medical evaluation. Never, to the best of my knowledge, except at last-resort places that specialize in exorcism, such as Bālājī, is there an assumption of possession. Besides observation, the diagnostic tools ordinarily used to check for āgantuka unmāda are pulse diagnosis, urinalysis, and the detection of physical signs of different families of spirits. For example, Clifford reports, “If the brightness of the eyes has deteriorated, if there are changes in the blood vessels in the whites of the eyes, if there are very small black dots on the whites of the eyes, or if the eyes look blurred or scratched, these are all signs of possession by a kingly or royal spirit (rgyal-po).”249 With respect to pulse, according to some of my informants in Pune, one should stare at the third eye of the patient, then take one’s own pulse. If the radial pulse is strongest, the unmāda is judged to be nija; if the ulnar pulse dominates, it is believed to be spirit possession (bhūtonmāda); if the medial artery pulse is dominant, then the unmāda is said to be caused by possession by an ancestral spirit (pitṛgraha). The urinalysis procedure reported by the same vaidyas is as follows. First, fill a cup with the patient’s urine. Then carefully place at the center of the urine one drop of sesame oil. If the oil flows to the south, then the unmāda is caused by a malevolent spirit, to the east by a devagraha, to the west by an animal spirit, but if it flows to the north then it is regarded as internal (nija).

This procedure, called tailabindu-parīkṣā (examination through a drop of oil), is related to a divinatory technique of urinalysis described in an eighteenth-century text called Yogaratnākara (YR), which is an excellent example of the integration of Āyurveda with tantric principles.250 The practice described to me in Pune is not found in the YR, but it appears to emerge out of a body of practice that is old and gave rise to the practices described in the YR. The passage in question is contained in the first chapter of the YR, in a section called mūtraparīkṣā (examination of urine). It will be instructive to give a near-verbatim account of the passage, because it illustrates the manner in which divination has been accepted in a medical work of the past few centuries. This is given neither to discount nor to accept the findings of the text and derivative practices, but to note that principles of a very different scientific paradigm were applied.

In the last hour of the last part [yāma] of the night, a vaidya should collect the urine and store it in a glass [kācamaya] vessel. He should then examine it after sunrise. The first part of the stream of urine should not be used, but the middle part of the stream should be collected. Only in this way can the vaidya determine the cause of the illness and its remedy. One should then take a drop of oil with a blade of grass and carefully place it in the middle of the vessel of urine. If the oil spreads, the disease is curable. If it does not spread, then the disease is difficult to cure. If it floats randomly on the surface, then the disease is incurable. If it flows to east, good health will be restored quickly. Movement to the south indicates a fever that will subside only gradually. If it flows to the north, a cure is definite. Movement of the oil to the west indicates happiness and health. If it flows to the northeast, then the patient will die in one month. If it flows to the southeast or southwest or if it breaks up, death is inevitable. If it flows to the northwest, then the patient will die even if treated with the best medicines [sudhā]. The same is true if it outlines the form of a plow, a tortoise, a buffalo, a beehive, a headless man, a part of an arm or leg, a weapon, an axe, a wooden pestle or spear, an arrow, a mace, or a crossroad with only three roads. In such cases it is better to do nothing at all. If it takes the shape of a goose, a duck, a pond [tāḍāga], a lotus, an elephant, a chowrie [cāmara], an umbrella, an arch, or a mansion, then good health will definitely be restored. If the drop of oil wanders aimlessly, there is possession by a family member [kuladoṣa] or a spirit [pretadoṣa]. If it resembles a human being or two skulls [mastakadvayam], there is possession by a bhūta [bhūtadosa] and bhūtavidyā should be applied. If it takes the shape of snake, the condition is due to vāta aggravation. If it takes the shape of an umbrella, the condition is due to pitta aggravation. If it takes the shape of pearls, the condition is due to kapha aggravation.251

In addition to the fumigants and varieties of medicated ghee prescribed for alleviation of bhutonmāda, some vaidyas in Maharashtra prescribe bhasma or ash from incinerated emerald (pannabhasma) or from the nine gems (navaratna) associated with the planets.252 Emerald is associated with the planet Mercury, which in astrology is associated with the mind. Thus, in astrological thought, an infusion of emerald in its subtlest form, alchemically produced bhasma, is believed to strengthen the influence of Mercury and, consequently, the mind.253 I am unable to find a prescription for this in any āyurvedic text. However, Indian alchemical literature of the last three hundred years has been insufficiently researched.254 I should add that these prescriptions do not appear to be followed in Kerala, where the physicians inform me that they do not use such bhasmas.

However, the most consistent statements on the application of pulse and urinalysis for diagnosis of possession come from Tibetan sources. Clifford states that these are not found in the Gyu-zhi. Her sources, rather, were contemporary practitioners, who probably learned these from other texts and from oral tradition. The most likely source is a series of thangkas that is used as a textbook, along with copious written and oral commentary, in Tibetan medical colleges.255 Three of the thangkas depict (among other things) divinatory diagrams that appear within the larger maṇḍalas that constitute the thangkas themselves. These smaller diagrams are circles trisected vertically and horizontally, thus yielding nine divisions, the central one being a square.256 To produce this maṇḍala or yantra, a circle is inscribed on a small mobile object, possibly a glass or copper plate. On this, the grid is created by placing four thin sticks one-third of the way into the circle from both sides, the top, and the bottom. The resulting nine sections are imagined as a turtle lying on its back, with its head toward the north, as a mirror of male urine, and as a turtle sitting right side up, with its head toward the south, as a mirror of female urine. The nine partitions represent the residence of sadak (sa-bdog; ground-owner demons), said to come from the Bön tradition.257 The center represents the self. Surrounding it, clockwise from the northeast corner are, in the case of the upside-down turtle, the ground-owner demons represented as gods (lHa), ancestors (pha-mes), cremation ground demons (dur-sa), house demons (khang), field demons (shing), progeny (bu-tsha), ghosts (gDon), and humans (mi). In the case of the right-side-up turtle, they are, from the northeast, cremation ground demons, ancestors, gods, humans, ghosts, progeny, field demons, and house demons. The category at the center, namely, self, requires explanation. According to the Fundamentals of Tibetan Medicine, a widely used handbook, this represents “a spirit associated with a person with whom the patient is emotionally close, although not necessarily friendly.”258 This yantra is then placed over a bowl of urine. If a bubble that looks like a fisheye appears in the urine and settles beneath one of the partitions, then the identity of the invading spirit becomes known.

## Conclusions: Notes on the Textuality of Āyurveda
The recognition of disease-producing spirit possession in South Asia has an epochal history of more than three thousand years and an equally epic variation and complexity. It can be traced from the Atharvaveda, where unmāda was first discussed, to the early canonical texts of Caraka, Susruta, and Vāgbhaṭa, where diagnostics and treatment modalities were more formally discussed. Contemporaneous with these texts, it is discussed in the Mahābhārata and Buddhist medical treatises. From these sources it was dispersed to a variety of Tantras and āyurvedic texts beginning in the late first millennium and finally drifted into dharmasāstra and astrological literature. It will come as no surprise, then, that, given this deep history, the idea of negative, invasive spirits has not ceased in India. Rather, under the influence of thousands of years of new religious movements and sociopolitical formations, as well as updated scientific notions, it has been reconfigured and reintroduced in recent medical and paramedical texts, the latter represented by Tantras composed in the past few centuries. One of the chief characteristics of this history has been a flow of ideas on bhūtavidyā and bhūtonmāda from educated elites who control texts into the popular imaginaire and, conversely, from popular, non-Brahman, culture into texts. The juxtaposition of and exchange between classical and folk is, in fact, nowhere more evident than in the area of bhūtavidyā. It appears from the material presented copiously in the preceding pages that the banishment of the subaltern from much of classical discourse is a thin and tenuous construction or, perhaps more generously, an artifact of orthodox conditioning within the minds of both classical Indian and modern Western-trained scholars.

One of the dynamic aspects of bhūtavidyā, the dialectic between continuity and change, is the identity of possessing entities. The vedic literature recognizes an array of such beings, most of them male, including the gandharva, nāga, siddha, sādhya, vipra, yakṣa, rākṣasa, piśāca, and yātudhāna. Only rarely are female possessors mentioned in the Vedas, notably the apsaras, the wife of the gandharva. Many of these appear to be early instances of Sanskritization, imported into the pantheon of vedic deities as minor but essential players in a sumptuous cosmogony. Contemporaneous with the latter phases of the vedic period, the second half of the first millennium B.C.E. or perhaps a few centuries later, an alternative genus of female possessors appears to have been imported from popular culture into the MBh and the early canonical āyurvedic texts.259 These were the bālagrahas (child-snatchers) who attacked and possessed pregnant women and children. They were much more malevolent and far less playful and Sanskritic than the male grahas who preceded them in the literary record. Most grahas found in the bhūtavidyā sections of the āyurvedic texts, the Bower manuscript, the ĪŚP, the Madanamahārṇava, and, to a lesser extent, the ethnographies of Varanasi and the Maldives are male and described by their personalities. It is as if they have life histories that can be deciphered through their names and literary contexts. By contrast, the grahas of the MBh, the pediatric sections of the āyurvedic texts, and, to a great extent, those represented in popular culture, are female, usually demonesses known only by their names, with little discernible life history, such as Mukhamaṇḍikā and Lohitāyanī (MBh).260 The more general terms found in modern Indian culture, such as the bhavānī and the cuḍail, signify categories of demoness, rather than historically situated ones. This representation in popular culture is, however, consistent with the earliest vedic literature and with a number of intermediate genres in which minor goddesses are given much less definition than male gods or demigods.

Also evident in the modernization of the texts is an updating that has taken a turn perhaps unexpected by Caraka. It is clear, as Meulenbeld has pointed out, that Caraka and Susruta attempted to forge an empirical medical system, in part by expunging from their texts material from the AV and its supporting literature, such as the Kauśikasūtra, that was viewed as unscientific or otherwise opposed to the system that they were attempting to construct. However, with the rise of Tantra and the application of astrology to nonritual, personal situations, a good deal of material from these increasingly defined bodies of knowledge was adopted into āyurvedic literature and the discourse of āyurvedic practice, as the medical textuality of the seventeenth to twentieth centuries testifies. The tantric and astrological literature differs considerably from that associated with the AV and could not have been derived from it in any significant way. Rather, the infusion of textual elements of Tantra and astrology into medical texts, as well as the reverse, an infusion of medical textuality, including extensive passages on bhūtavidyā, into texts on astrology, Tantra, and karmavipāka, indicates a blurring of boundaries between these genres in the past five hundred years. Thus, Āyurveda has, in a limited and updated manner, come full circle. Caraka and Susruta might not approve, but the project of scientizing and sanitizing, as well as the introduction of Tantra and astrology into Indian popular culture have afforded them access into the expansive domain of Āyurveda. The evidence from Kerala, with its history of intertextuality and the overlapping concerns of vaidyas, mantravādins, and jyotiṣīs, appears to resist the notion that the rise of Western educational models, the ascendance of allopathic medicine, a national āyurvedic curriculum, and an increasing reliance on text rather than apprenticeship as authoritative,261 could end the diagnosis and treatment of exogenous mental illness any time soon.

3. None of my informants knew the textual source of this verse, and I am unable to trace it. However, for a number of similar passages in Purāṇas and Smṛtis see Thite 1982:17–18. One vaidya told me that it is from a karmavipākaprāyascitta, or section on “expiation of ripened karma,” found in various Tantras and Dharmasastra texts. For more on karmavipāka, see the discussion below on the Madanamahārṇava.
4. Daiva, lit. “divine,” from deva, “deity,” has the extended (and usual) meaning “fate.” See CaSā 1.116: “Action that a person performs in a previous body is known as daiva. In time this also becomes the cause of diseases”; also CaSā 2.44: “That which is done in a previous birth is called daiva, while whatever action [karma] is seen in the present birth is called pauruṣa. That which is seen to be unbalanced is the cause of the onset [of disease], while that same thing brought into balance is the cause of its cessation.” Thus, daiva is contrasted with pauruṣa (human), from puruṣa (man or person); cf. CaVi 3.33–34.
5. Scant mention is made of sattvāvajaya, following the āyurvedic texts themselves.
6. Engler 2003:438 translates this as “science of demonic seizures.” This is a misunderstanding of the term.
7. See Kleinman and Seeman (1998:237–252), who show, through comparative analysis, that religious healing is a form of moral practice. They write: “Calculations of locally defined utility, construction of self and cosmology, and the micro-politics of local social life are all central to healing as moral practice” (p. 251). This assertion is abundantly supported by the āyurvedic and folk texts and practices presented in this chapter.
8. For example, CaCi 9.33:93–94. Zysk (1985:63) translates this as “accidental” and distinguishes it from madness caused by external agents such as gods, sages, deceased ancestors, and a variety of demons. My reading is that the latter are the primary agents of āgantuka unmāda. Zysk states the general theme as follows:
   Causes of diseases are not attributed to physiological functions, but rather to external beings or forces of a demonic nature who enter the body of their victim and produce sickness. The removal of such malevolent entities usually involved an elaborate ritual, often drawing on aspects of the dominant local religion and nearly always necessitating spiritually potent and efficacious words, actions and devices.… The Vedic Indian’s attitude toward disease, therefore, was dominated by the belief that evil spirits, demons and other malevolent forces invade the body and caused their victims to exhibit a state of dis-ease. (p. 8)
   See Zysk 1991:15 for another similar assertion.
9. Dash and Kashyap 1980:1. These authors, following Ṭoḍarānanda (hence the intellectual lineage of Susruta), divide Āyurveda into ādhyātmika duḥkha (śārīraka and mānasika), ādhibhautika duḥkha, and ādhidaivika duḥkha, employing familiar Indic hermeneutical categories.
10. For convenient summaries see, e.g., Keith 1925:231–242; Oldenberg 1988:131–134. Bhattacharyya 2000 supplies much more detail in his diffuse and irregularly documented study of bhūtavidya; see esp. ch. 2 on “Vedic Demonology.” I cannot here enter into all the detail Bhattacharyya discusses, because the nature of the present project is to discuss only those bhūtas that are involved in possession, rather than all manner of vedic bhūtas.
11. Cf. also Chāndogya Upaniṣad (ChU) 7.1.4, 7.2.1, 7.7.1. The best accounts of bhūtavidya are Filliozat 1937 and Sukla 1985. Filliozat’s remarkable work provides a succinct introduction to the topic (p. 24–28) and tracks bhūtas through a stunning array of texts, languages, and cultures. Sukla contains more data than anyone else, except Bhattacharya 2000, but he organizes it much more effectively. I do not here address postcolonial interpretations or what Langford calls the “narrative of decline,” in which Āyurveda has been subjected to a secularization process. As part of this narrative, bhūtavidya has been regarded by many indigenous scholars and physicians dedicated to discovering modern science in ancient knowledge as superstition or psychotherapy, and bhūtas as microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses; see Langford 2002:85ff. and notes.

13. Dhaky 1984:240. His interpretations are often far-fetched, but he may be right to take bhūtas back to their roots in the elements, the bhūtas or mahabhūtas. He posits bhūtas as “elementals” and bhūtanāyakas as “captains of the elementals.” Cf. MBh 9.44.74–108; Matsyapurāṇa 53.1–46, 182.64–66, for physical features and other details of gaṇas, gaṇanāyakas, and gaṇeśvaras. The elements—earth, water, light, air, sky—have bhūtas and gaṇas (clans or tribes of the divine retinue) as their representatives, their symbols of noumenal and phenomenal reality.

20. Āyurveda is often considered an upāṇga or upaveda of the AV; cf. e.g., Sukla 1985, in Sanskrit, intro. p. 10; cf. e.g., Aṣṭāṇgahṛdaya Saṃhitā (AH) 5.84; Aṣṭāṇgasaṃgraha (ASam) 7.118cd: daivavyāpāśrayaṃ tadvad atharvoktaṃ ca pūjitam. However, Wujastyk notes, “such medical material as is recoverable from the Vedic literature is remarkable more for its differences from classical āyurveda than for its similarities.… Of course there are some points of contact, but the overall sense is that, culturally speaking, āyurveda comes from somewhere else” (1998:17). Wujastyk’s translation of this chapter of the AH (ibid.:294–301) is the clearest exposition of its kind yet published. See also Meulenbeld: “In my opinion, Caraka’s list of sages, many of whom are known from Vedic literature, may have been inserted in order to stress the connection between āyurveda and the Vedic tradition, the orthodoxy of its teachings, and its association with the brāhmaṇa” (HIML IA:10).

39. One of the primary alleged causes of abhiṣaṅgaja disease is abhicāra (cf. Türstig 1985); that is, a bhūta that “sticks to” (abhiṣaṅga) a person is regarded as abhicāraja, sent by a hired sorcerer to possess the person. Cf. Dwyer 1998 and Chapter 4, note 35, and above p. 517f.

41. Sanskrit lexicographers also acknowledge bhūtāveśa; cf. Trikāṇḍaśeṣa 3.230 and Hemacandra’s Anekārthasaṃgraha 4.161. The Rasaratnasamuccaya (5.2, 6.7), a thirteenth-century medical text prescribes a bhūtāveśapraśānti (procedure for pacifying possession by bhūtas). For further attestations of bhūtāveśa and piśācāveśa (and variants), see Kalhaṇa’s Rājataraṅgiṇī (c. 1150) 8.114.6 and the late dramas Vasantatilaka (c. 1800) 25.19 and Amṛtodaya (1710) 3.7, 3.18. Synonymous with āveśa is upahata (struck, afflicted); thus, also attested in the lexicons are bhūtopahata (afflicted by bhūtas); bhūtopahatacitta (the mind possessed by bhūtas); and, of course, the antidote, assuming the former: bhūtapratiṣedha (warding off bhūtas).
42. Other texts, many of them now lost, existed in both periods. See Meulenbeld HIML IA:689ff. (and notes), for a discussion of ancient authorities cited by Caraka, Susruta, Vāgbhaṭa, and their commentators, and HIML IIA:117–55 (and notes) for discussion of a number of other texts from the seventh to the eleventh centuries.
43. Meulenbeld (HIML IA:42) calls them “character types,” which is more accurate than “mental faculty,” “psyche,” etc., used by other translators. For discussions of the category sattva, see the many sources cited in Meulenbeld HIML IIB:82n112.

Whitney 1905:2:914).
56. Bṛhatsaṃhitā 5.11; BṛS 5.13 reads uparāga (darkening) for eclipse; cf. also Bhāgavata Purāna (BhP) 5.24.3.
57. I am not able to find the words āveśa or praveśa in these contexts to indicate the sun or moon becoming possessed by Rāhu or Ketu (or vice versa). Rather, these two grahas assail (abhidhāvati, BhP 8.9.26, Rāhu only) or devour (grasati, MBh 1.17.8, again only Rāhu) their quarry, rather than “enter” or “possess” them. For references and discussion see, e.g., Bedekar 1967; O’Flaherty 1975:273–280. Although the word ketú is found as early as AVŚ 19.9.8–10, where the word appears to mean “comet,” its reconfiguration as the descending node of the moon occurs only in the early second millennium C.E.; cf. Gail 1980.

Honko 1998:251) speak of nigraha and anugraha in Tulunad, meaning the protective and punitive activities, respectively, of different spirits. Honko notes that the Siri epic was performed at possession rituals that were similar to bhūta rituals “with the purpose of supporting the mental health of participants with a history of illness” (p. 261).
70. On this, see Zysk 1993.
71. Eventually Āyurveda was used to confirm Sāṃkhya. The Sāṃkhyasaptativṛtti, an early commentary on the Sāṃkhyasaptati of perhaps the sixth century, uses examples from Āyurveda to support its arguments. See Larson and Bhattacharya 1987:193ff.
72. For these lists, and accompanying discussions, see ibid.:59~61, 161, 177, 206, 284. Larson’s speculations linking the eight realms of the SK to the eightfold prakṛti (p. 61) are thought provoking, but entirely lacking in textual support.
73. For the use of some of these categories in the Mālinīvijayottaratantra, see Vasudeva (2004:326).
74. Cakrapāṇidatta glosses abhidharṣaṇam as āveśaḥ and niyamavratādi as niyamety ādinā aihikaṃ karma devādyāveśakāraṇaṃ brute (by niyama, etc., worldly action caused by possession [āvesa] by gods and others is indicated). The term niyamavratādi may be a reference to Yogasūtras 2.30–32. In these sūtras the five yamas ([external] restraints) (YS 2.30)—non-injury, truthfulness, abstaining from theft, sexual continence, non-covetousness—are called mahāvrata (the great vow) (YS 2.31). The niyamas ([internal] restraints) listed (YS 1.32) are cleanliness, contentment, austerity, studiousness, and devotion to Īśvara. Āyurveda and Yoga have long claimed a connection, but hitherto it has been difficult to actually find textual connections between the two, especially for the early periods. However, a sixteenth-century text called Ayurvedasūtra, which closely links the two, was published in 1994. This late, and rather labored, sutra collection contains within it the entire text of the YS, interspersed with material drawn from āyurvedic texts. Whereas it is fairly certain that Caraka predated YS by several centuries, it may be assumed that many elements of the YS were well known long before the final compilation of the sūtra text. Thus, there is no reason that the yamas and niyamas, as well as other elements of the eightfold (aṣṭāṅga) path, which were quickly incorporated into yogaśāstra and may be found in Buddhist texts, could not have been known to Agnivesa or other compilers of the Caraka Saṃhitā.
75. This verse is adopted as a basic definition of possession in many later texts; cf, e.g., Mādhavanidānam 20.17.
76. On the evolution of the pitṛ in Indic thought, especially in the Harivaṃśa, see Saindon 1995.
77. One wonders about the models on which some of these categories are based. Mozart, it is reported, would suddenly burst out laughing in the middle of a conversation, jump up and down, turn somersaults, and impulsively leap over tables and chairs.
78. Often the texts do not distinguish between waxing and waning fortnights. We must assume that both fortnights are assumed unless otherwise specified.
79. Ḍalhaṇa: bhinnamaryādaṃ tyaktocitakramam abhakṣyabhakṣaṇe agamyāgamane; abandonment of propriety, such as eating what should not be eaten or going where one should not go.
80. Ḍalhaṇa: sṛkkiṇyau oṣṭhaprāntau.
81. Ḍalhaṇa: uddhasto vikṛtadarśanaḥ (deformed or disfigured). Verses 8, 9, 13, 15, and 16 contain the word juṣṭaḥ (pleased, welcomed, visited). This is a rather milder and more positive manner of speaking than Caraka’s equivalent verses: unmattaṃ vidyāt. Verses 10 and 11 read, for “possession,” paripīḍitaḥ; verse 12 reads abhibhūtaḥ; and verse 14 gṛhītaḥ.
82. Ḍalhaṇa: adriḥ parvataḥ, dvirado (two-tusked) hastī, nago (non-moving) vṛkṣaḥ.
83. After Ḍalhaṇa, who cites the variant reading vardhakena rather than vardhakena: vardhakena chedakena hiṃsārthinā kenacid graheṇa juṣṭo gṛhīta iti vyākhyānayanti.
84. This apparently general description could also be an indication of oracular possession, which we have seen from the account of Pātañcala Kāpya and his daughter in the BĀU, was well known by then.
85. Ḍalhaṇa: the eight attributes (guṇāḥ) are the eight siddhis: aṇimā (minification), laghimā (lightness), mahimā (physical expansion), garimā (heaviness), prāptiḥ (instant acquisition), prākāmyam (irresistable will), īśitvam (lordliness), vaśitvam (power of influence). Ḍalhaṇa also cites CaŚā 1.140, which has a different list: āveśaś cetaso jñānam arthānāṃ chandataḥ [or ca svataḥ] kriyā | dṛṣṭiḥ śrotraṃ smṛtiḥ kāntir iṣṭataś cāpy adarśanam-ity aṣṭavidham aiśvaryam āhuḥ | (Possession [āveśa] of [another’s] mind, knowledge of objects according to one’s will, and [the powers of] action, vision, hearing, memory, beauty, and invisibility, all gained in accordance with one’s desire, these, they say, are the eight kinds of majesty). Ḍalhaṇa glosses vyastaḥ as dvitricaturaḥ and samastāḥ as sarve, which is to say fewer of the eight siddhis are manifested according to the power of the possessing agent. He concludes that fewer of these attributes are found in asuras, etc., and all in divinities (tatra vyastā guṇā asurādigrahāṇāṃ samastā devagrahāṇām).
86. Ḍalhaṇa confirms that saṃviśanti refers to sexual intercourse (te devayonayo manuṣyaiḥ saha na saṃviśanti). Thus, medical practitioners of the day must have encountered such claims, based, no doubt, on references in the epics and elsewhere to divinities and semidivine beings cohabiting with humans, e.g., Purūravas and Urvaśī. Ḍalhaṇa glosses āviśanti with anupraviśanti. Cf. Weiss 1977:54 for discussion of this verse.
87. “Infinite numbers,” koṭisahasrāyutapadmasaṃkhyāḥ: koṭi, ten million; sahasra, one thousand; ayuta, ten thousand; padma, according to Ḍalhaṇa, fourteen times the multiples of the previous numbers.
88. Ḍalhaṇa asks, rhetorically, how a being who shares at least part of the essence of deities can relish blood, fat, and flesh, etc. He answers that Nirṛti is the grandfather of the demons (nirṛtī rakśasāṃ pitāṃahaḥ), who, through their association with the deities, etc., acquired part of their natures.
89. Aruṇadatta glosses: sadyaḥ adhunātanaḥ pūrvajanmakṛto vā hetuḥ (action performed at the present time or during a previous birth).
90. See this chapter, n. 236, for more on the continued use of this term.
91. The editor of the text cites “Candra” (Candranandana’s Padārthacandrika): śmaśānacatvaracaityādiṣu (burning ground, crossroad, or [Jain or Buddhist] funeral mound).
92. parasūtakasaṅkaraḥ, cf. Candra: strīprasavasaṅkāryam; also Meulenbeld HIML IB:563n90, on this difficult term.
93. The critical text reads kāṣṭhāśvaṃ tathā (who mounts a wooden horse). This makes no contextual sense and at best could be an idiom (found nowhere else, so far as I am aware) for delusional sensory activity. In the absence of certainty with regard to that, however, the translation I offer is of a minority reading: kāṣṭḥāśmarāśim, for which, compare Caraka 6.9.20(8): aśmakāṣṭhādhirohaṇaratiṃ (who enjoys climbing on assorted heaps of garbage and walking on rags).
94. tṛṇachidram, lit. “one [who digs] holes in the grass”; Weiss: “who burrows in the grass” (1977: 291). Unfortunately no commentary addresses this compound. I prefer to take it metaphorically: chidra in its known meaning of “imperfection”; tṛṇa as “straw,” “grass,” “insignificant,” “minute,” “worthless.”
95. AṣṭāṅgaSam 7.2 replaces kūṣmāṇḍa with kārkhoda, but includes the kūṣmāṇḍa elsewhere. See Chapter 11, n. 97; this is surely a variant of khakhōrda. For more complete information on the kūṣmāṇḍa see Meulenbeld HIML IB:563n101.
96. The notes to the text provide several alternative readings: maukiraṇa, uttaruṇā, ramautkiraṇa. None of these help in identification of this enigmatic graha. For other occurrences of this word see Meulenbeld HIML IIB:564n103.

100. Ibid.:183. It may be of interest to note here that what is now regarded as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was interpreted in Europe as demonic possession and treated with exorcism until the nineteenth century, when clinicians decided that this condition was a disease rather than the devil’s work. Freud recommended psychoanalytic guidance to free such victims from their obsession, which he believed was the result of being torn between guilty fear and defiant rage born of draconian toilet training. One treatment to which OCD has been surprisingly responsive is prefrontal lobotomy (PFL). Since the heyday of this treatment, genetic markers for OCD have been discovered in laboratory animals, and drugs such as Prozac and Zoloft, which are selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, have become cornerstones of treatment, though Pflis still often recommended in extreme cases.

102. Ibid. It is important to recognize that Weiss is not the first to attempt such an analysis. His work represents significant advances over that of Sinh Jee, who wrote in 1896: “The demoniacal diseases of the Hindus are but other words for hysteria, epilepsy, dancing mania, and other disorders of the nervous system” (cited by Weiss, 1977:53–54).

105. See also Weiss 1980:105, for a discussion of sattva. He says that Ca 4.4 uses it in the sense of “personality,” but that Ca 4.3 identifies it with manas.
106. Suddham here is equivalent to sāttvikam, characterized by sattvaguṇa.
107. Weiss mentions the “insane character” (1977:34) in the Mattavilāsaprahasana, but fails to mention that the character is possessed.
108. Meulenbeld states: “Weiss tried to correlate [mental disorders according to Āyurveda] with the syndromes of Western psychiatry. In my opinion, the results of his efforts are not convincing” (1997:197). However, I also agree with Meulenbeld’s more nuanced sentiment on Weiss’s work: “I would misrepresent the basic assumptions and views of M. Weiss if I were to attribute to him a simple scheme of one-to-one equivalents of Indian and Western diagnostic entities. He explicitly rejects this in theory, but, nevertheless, he often suggests it” (ibid.:192).

111. This was the same decade that Obeyesekere published his initial studies and that Kakar (1978), Goldman (1978), Masson (1974, 1976), and others initially applied Freudian psychodynamics to Indian cultural and literary history. These studies stand out today as period pieces. Kripal 1995, discussed in Chapter 2, is much more substantive and sophisticated, though, as I pointed out there, not beyond criticism.

This text needs to be found and checked, as there is much in Fenner’s article that is questionable. It is not mentioned at all by Meulenbeld in HIML. For a good discussion contextualizing the Gyu-zhi, see Obermiller 1989.

For although they arose from projections, they are said to be real in a relative sense. That is, they have to be dealt with” (p. 159). Along the same lines, she states: “Two predominant themes emerge in the Dharma view of ‘demons.’ One, from the level of absolute truth, they do not exist. Like everything else, they have no self-nature. Two, from the level of relative truth, they have conditioned existence. One should protect oneself from their negative influence” (p. 161).
118. Ibid.:214. Heinroth’s most famous work was Störungen des Seelenlebens (Disorders of the Soul, 1818). Heinroth was the first to use the term “psychosomatic” to describe the connection between the psyche and the body.

121. Indeed, Clifford repeatedly defends Buddhist positionings. I look forward to a more perspicacious approach to cross-cultural, particularly Buddhist, psychology. Clifford’s effort may be compared to Vogt 1999, discussed in Chapter 4, in that the point of reference for both is abhidharma and that neither inspires confidence in their psychoanalytic expertise. In this sense, Weiss’s study is more reliable. As mentioned earlier (see Chapter 2), a more productive cross-cultural methodological exercise is Littlewood 1996.

135. Nevertheless, her study would have been greatly enhanced if she had utilized Weiss’s work, which was completed several years before the publication of her book, or if she had used the published and translated āyurvedic texts as a check on her textual history.
136. For example, Lutz 1988; Lynch 1990. Recall Lutz’s argument that emotion is an “ideological practice.”
137. On this, and much more about the sources and variation of emotion, see the comprehensive study of Nussbaum, 2001:151ff., passim.
138. This opposes Freud, who argued, at least in Totem and Taboo (1946), for the universal applicability of his system.
139. Very few studies have been conducted on the origins of any of these classifications. See, however, Mukherjee (1981) for speculations on an early group of five: pitṛ, gandharva, deva, asura, and rakṣas.
140. In addition to those mentioned below, some Purāṇas describe a certain class of beings as simply “possessors” (āvesaka); cf. VayuP 2.8.40, ŚivaP 2.2.33.22a, SkandaP 1.2.26.42c.
141. A brief text that I cannot deal with extensively here (because I did not discover it until the present manuscript was sent off to press) is the Āviṣṭaceṣṭāvidhiparivartaḥ (ĀCVP), “Chapter on Instructions Regarding Behavior of the Possessed,” appearing in the Mahāyānasūtrasaṃgraha, Part 2, pp. 255–259. This text is taken from the Mañjusrimulakalpa (MMK), the exact dating of which is uncertain, but appears to have roots as early as the fourth century C.E., but was probably not fully compiled until the tenth century. This fragment, like the rest of the MMK, is presented as a dialogue between Sākyamuni and Mañjusri Kumārabhūta. The question Mañjusrī poses to Sākyamuni concerns the behavior of people whose bodies have been possessed by other beings, including Buddhist teachers (ārya), divine beings, mendicants, perfected spiritual practitioners, gandharvas, yakṣas, rakṣasas, piśācas, great serpent beings (mahoraga), and so on, whether human or nonhuman, what kinds of physical actions and symptoms of these beings are revealed by these individuals, as well as the different courses of action to be taken in such cases.
     Sākyamuni then delivers a discourse in 59 verses that covers two topics. The first deals with the symptoms of positive possession, describing the symptoms of auspiciousness in a person thus possessed by a deva. The second topic is a linguistic circumnavigation of India, attributing the peculiarities of speech in different parts of the subcontinent to a primal ancestor that could be identified as a yakṣa, mahoraga, kinnara, piśāca, garuḍa, and so on, along with a caricature of the speech of these regions, in phonological detail. Thus, this text should be of interest to scholars who study the dialectology of first millennium C.E. South Asia. Also of interest is the fact that the word most commonly employed in the ACVP for possession is avatāra (“descent,” which we have discussed above in reference to bhakti texts), though the words āveśa and āviṣṭa also appear in the text. It appears then, that the ACVP employs demonology as a sociolinguistic trope, rendering it qualitatively different from its use in the āyurvedic and tantric literature.
142. For the full story of the discovery of the manuscripts and an accounting of the contents, see Wujastyk 1998:195ff.
143. Hoernle 1909:2:223, 227; plate 49, part 6, leaf i, Reverse. Compare this to a sixth-century manuscript fragment from Bāmiyān; cf. Ojihara 1984:308.
144. Perhaps this is identical to Vinatā, the śakunigrahaḥ, from the MBh (3.219.26) noted earlier.
145. Cf. MBh 3.269.2, in which Pūtana is an enemy of Rama. But this is probably the same as the Pūtanā-graha (despite the short “a” at the end of the word) from MBh 3.219.26–27.
146. Cf. AVŚ 8.6.21, chyaka; this hymn is meant for the protection of pregnant women and therefore precedes the notion of bālagraha in the MBh and the medical literature. This hymn contains a large number of difficult words; cf. Whitney 1905 II:493ff. Hoernle suggests “unnatural change in appearance” (1909:2:227n5) after Caraka 5.7, Susruta 1.31: “morbid appearance” (ibid.:172n383). On chāyā-graha, see Jamison 1991:142ff.
147. Hoernle regards this problematic word as most likely an orthographic error for dustāraka (difficult to cross over), hence “evil eye” (1909:2:227n6). However, this word appears in the ACVP unambiguously as the name of a possessor.
148. It is not possible that in this context maruta indicates either the vedic deities known as the Maruts, or Hanumān, even as a possessing entity, one of whose names more than a millennium later was Mārutī; cf. Chapter 11, on possession of Hanumān.
149. Cf. Manu 12.71cd, amedhyakuṇapāśī ca kṣatriyaḥ kaṭapūtanaḥ (a kaṭapūtana is a kṣatriya [spirit] that eats impure objects and corpses). Kullūka glosses amedhyakuṇapāśī as purīṣaśavabhojī (an excrement and corpse eater). Manu 12.71–72 contains equally horrific fates for members of other varṇas who neglect their ordained duties, but for some reason kṣatriyas alone were singled out here.
150. This term is still widely used in Kerala; cf. Caldwell 1999:213.
151. There is a class of tantric texts, now mostly lost, called bhūtatantras. One of them, the Totula, is quoted by Kṣemarāja in his commentary on Netra Tantra 19.70.
152. This division (or variants of it) is often found in tantric texts. See, e.g., NT 19.30c–31: balikāmas tathā cānye bhoktukāmās tathāpare || ratikāmā hantukāmā vātajāḥ pittajāḥ pare | śleṣmajāḥ saṃnipātotthā bhūtā vividharūpakāḥ || (Various species of bhūta, fond of sacrifice, of eating, of sex, and of killing, are produced from disorders of wind, bile, phlegm, and all three together [saṃnipātajāḥ], respectively). The commentary on NT glosses bhoktukāmāḥ as māṃsaraktābhilāṣiṇaḥ (desirous of meat and blood).
153. Verse 1 reads heḍhra. I am not able to locate this word elsewhere in Sanskrit or Prakrit. I am grateful to Robert Zydenbos for the following: “It could be a Sanskritised Dravidian word. Kannada has a word heḍḍa, ‘a dull, stupid man, a fool’ [Kittel 1968–71:4:1755], with derived words like heḍḍatana / heḍḍu ‘stupidity, foolishness,’ and heḍḍāṭa, ‘stupid, foolish behaviour’” (e-mail communication, February 16, 2003). It appears, then, that we can be fairly certain that heḍhra was Sanskritized from this or a related South Dravidian word. See Prasnamārga, an astrological text in Sanskrit from Kerala (dealt with below), for the word hedva (15.62c), with probably the same meaning. The description could be that of spasticity or another kind of muscular or motor disorder, or, just as likely, severe mental retardation.
154. sutkāravān (makes the sound sūt). This could also refer to whistling.
155. Dwyer reports: “As many Hindus often comment, ‘Women have a weak heart; so spirits severely attack them’” (aurato ke kamzor dil hotā hai; islīe bhūt-pret us par jyādā hamlā karte hai)” (2003:45).
156. Kane (HDh I.2:800 ff.) dates it to 1360–1390.
157. The other important work is the Vīrasiṃhāvaloka; see below, n. 248.
158. For a more extended explanation of the principles of this literature, see Nambiyar’s introduction to the Sanskrit text of the Madanamahārṇava, pp. 15ff.
159. Nambiyar, in his introduction to the MM, writes: “Most of the causes are more or less connected with immorality and violation of the social customs and manners” (p. 25). For an account of karmavipāka in more canonical dharmasāstra texts, see Rocher 1980.
160. On the problems of violence and killing in the ritual arena, see Knipe 2004: “goats and humans have identical structures and therefore goats are the best offerings to the gods. No goat is ever ‘killed,’ that is, annihilated. Rather, it is transformed by ritual speech and practice” (p. 438). See also Houben 1999; Tull 1996.
161. Cf. Taittirīya Āraṇyaka II.7. This is performed before most śrauta rituals, rites of passage (saṃskāra), and other complicated brahmanical ceremonies.
162. Cf. Kane HDh IV:134ff.
163. Ashok Aklujkar has suggested to me that the reading apastamba could be wrong, that it could be avaṣṭhambha, which can have the meaning “arrogant” or “resolute.” However, the text does not record a pāṭhabheda here, nor do the orthographic possibilities support such a reading.
164. Probably he was a Ṛgvedin, as he quotes the entire sūkta, ṚV 6.24 in his comments on the karṇagraha. This sort of block quotation is unusual in Sanskritic commentarial tradition.
165. The discussion on the navagraha, probably a “new” or “recent spirit” rather than one of the nine planets, refers explicitly to a sexually transmitted disease. This spirit afflicts a man who has had sex with the wife of a friend, an ascetic, a guru, of a master. He is afflicted with a burning penis (meḍhradāhī), among other things.
166. This is the view of Kātyāyana, cited by the MM. Viśveśvara Bhaṭṭa comments that the rice and ghee can be offered separately.
167. Cf. Śāṇkhāyana ŚSū 9.9.5 (cf. Āśvālāyana ŚSū 8.6.13 for a slightly different application). That Viśveśvara Bhaṭṭa would know the ritual applications for this also suggests that he is a Ṛgvedin.
168. The Vidhānamālā (Garland of Ritual), a text probably dating to the nineteenth century, deals with this topic in much more abbreviated and bloodless fashion. Cf., e.g., VM, p. 26, for an account of the karṇagrahapīḍāśamana-vidhānam (ritual that allays affliction by a karṇagraha), p. 27, for the skandagrahapīḍāśamana-vidhānam (ritual that allays affliction by a skandagraha), and p. 28, for the skandāpasmārapīḍāśamana-vidhānam (ritual that allays affliction by a skadāpasmāragraha), and other childhood and planetary grahas.
169. Thanks to Ashok Aklujkar for this suggestion.
170. Shukla 1980:170f. For a lively but fragmentary account of a local North Indian demonology, see Kakar 1982:20-31.
171. Shukla 1980:170f. Also see Parry 1994:230f. for discussion of some of the same material. Note Parry’s statement, which we have countered often here, “that spirit possession is really an oblique aggressive strategy by which the weak and the exploited get back at those who oppress them” (p. 231). An example of a more recent “orientalist” missionary who dealt with this is McClintock (1990), dealt with in Chapter 2. His detailed account of bhūtavidyā draws largely from others’ ethnographies, rather than from his own work in Pakistan in the 1980s. Thus, his account does not situate the material in a specific local tradition or geographic area. He lists five categories of bhūta among Muslims in India (and presumably Pakistan): (1) jinn (a class of beings between angels and men); (2) pari (fairy of entrancing beauty); (3) shayatin or shaitan (devils, demon hosts, fallen angels); (4) ifrit (a powerful and malignant genius, the ghosts of the wicked are sometimes so termed) (5) marid (an evil genius of the most powerful kind) (pp. 39–40). McClintock’s Christian evangelism biases his description and views of other people’s beliefs and practices; it is thus comparatively unhelpful. Although his outlook is more generous than that of Ziegenbalg in the early eighteenth century, he still does not understand academic ethnography. His main source is Crooke 1894. It is valuable that he brought together Crooke’s data in a single organized list; yet to him it serves no purpose other than to vouchsafe the indigenous people’s need for a liberating nonsuperstitious Christianity.
172. Pollock 1991:81.
173. This word is uncertain, possibly from būṛnā. Shukla’s transliteration is random, at best.
174. Another problematic word, possibly marua.
175. The word ḍīh refers to a mound on which its shrine is situated. I am grateful to Philip Lutgendorf for assisting me with these Hindi terms and their significance. For another extensive catalogue of local bhūtas and a discussion of their relations with disease, see Prabhu 1977.
176. Maloney 1980:245.
177. Maloney suggests, rather, that this is from “Buddha,” but I question this.
178. I have doubts about this etymology.
179. For these descriptions, see ibid.:242–246.

181. Such numbers occur in Tantras as well. For example, see NT 19.62cd-63: “I made thirty trillion (triṃśatkoṭī sahasrāṇām) fearsome Vināyakas with the brightness of blazing fires from my thumb. If someone is impeded by them he will be overcome.” Cf. McHugh 2000.
182. The idea of hordes, gaṇas, acting for good and ill is a persistent and powerful idea, dating from the earliest vedic texts to the adālat of Bālājī described in Chapter 4.

187. In the NP, however, this ritual of apparent fertility appears, rather oddly, in the fall, perhaps as a final opportunity for revelry before the Kashmiri winter sets in.
188. See the translations earlier of Ca 6.9.20.8, Su 6.60.15, AH 6.4.30–34b, ĪŚP 42.22ab.
189. See the Kāśīkhaṇḍa of the Skanda Purāṇa (uttarārdha, ch. 54) and trans. Tagare (1997:28–35). See also the Pisācamocanamāhātmyam, published in 1910, which contains an introduction in Hindi describing the Pisācmocan tīrtha and its importance, the SkP chapter, the Śrīkapardīśa Stotra, and instructions for the ancestral rites to be performed at the temple tank (piśācamocane tripiṇdīśrāddhavidhiḥ). See Parry 1994:242ff. for an ethnography of an exorcism at Pisācmocan.
190. Daniel Cohen reports a phenomenon known as pretpañcayat, modeled after the local village governing body called pañcāyat (cf. Chapter 4, on the venue for exorcism at Bālājī modeled on another judicial paradigm, the adālat). The pretpañcayat features competition between exorcists, usually in family disputes, brother against brother. Cohen observes that the primary locus of exorcism in Varanasi is the exorcist, not any temple or specific place, including Pisācmocan. What this means in practice is that exorcisms are generally performed in the home of the client or the “office” of the exorcist, not usually in a public arena like a temple. I am grateful to Cohen for sharing with me his research and insights on the Pisācmocan temple.
191. This term is used by Dārila, in his commentary on Kausikasutra 25.22; cf. Bahulkar 1994:90.
192. Wujastyk 1998:212–235; cf. also Kāśyapa Saṃhitā, pp. 351–374.
193. For a fairly comprehensive discussion of bālagrahas in the major āyurvedic texts and the Agnipurāṇa, see Kumar 1994:284–312. See especially p. 287, table 42, which compares the names of the bālagrahas in different texts (though without explanation). Kumar does not theorize about balagrahas, except to enter into highly suspicious speculations on the diseases wrought by them. For example, affliction by Revatī (“Lady Opulence,” in Wujastyk’s felicitous translation) results in diarrhea, dehydration, anemia, and vitamin B deficiency; Mukhamaṇḍikā afflicts with “Indian Childhood Cirrhosis,” etc. (p. 304).
194. Also bhūtābhiṣaṅga (intimate contact with a bhūta) (Su 6.39.60; Ca 6.3.116; Bhāvaprakāsa 8.1); and bhutopasarga (touched by a bhūta) (BhP 4.29.23). The Śabdakalpadruma cites under āveśaḥ (1:194): bhūtādinā rogaḥ; bhūtasaṃcāraḥ, grahādayaḥ (Rājanighaṇṭu); āsaktiḥ, abhiniveśaḥ (Raghuvaṃśa 5.19).
195. tasyās tu dharma eva nivṛttikāraṇam uktam iti | KS kalpasthānam 6(?).3.7 (Kāśyapa Saṃhitā, p. 352).
196. To take one further example from the later āyurvedic tradition as a case in point, see Aḍhamalla’s Dīpikā on the varieties of bālagraha presented in the thirteenth-century Śārṇgdhara Saṃhitā. Aḍhamalla states that “seizers [graha] beginning with skandas possess children” (skandagrahādayo bāleṣv āviśanti). Thus, by the time of Śārṅgdhara, followed by Aḍhamalla in the fifteenth century, graha was defined in terms of āveśa (rather than the more expected praveśa). Śārṅgadhara lists twelve varieties of bālagraha: tathā bālagrahāḥ khyātā dvādaśaiva munīśvaraiḥ | skandagrāho viśākhaḥ syāt svagrahaś ca pitṛgrahaḥ | naigameyagrahas tadvac chakuniḥ śītapūtanā | mukhamaṇḍitikā tadvat pūtanā cāndapūtanā || revatī caiva saṃkhyātā tathā syāc chuṣkarevatī | (1.7.189–191b).
197. On Khaḍgarāvaṇa and the lost Khaḍgarāvaṇabālacikitsā, see Goudriaan 1977. On Khaḍgarāvaṇa as a form of Śiva, also called Caṇḍeśvara, Rudra, and Caṇḍāsidhārāpati (Lord of the Edge of the Fierce Sword), see Bühnemann 1999:325. On the importance of Rāvaṇa in this context, see Zysk (1985:67) for discussion of the Rāvaṇaproktabālācikitsāsūtra, a pediatrics text; also Filliozat (1937:159–178), on the Buddhist transformation of Rāvaṇa into a peaceful king with healing powers. Filliozat’s volume is an expansion of his earlier article (1935). The Kumāratantra draws heavily from the MBh, AV, Caraka, and Suśruta, all of which Filliozat discusses in detail. The Nārāyaṇīya mentioned here is undoubtedly the Tantrasārasaṃgraha, known in Kerala as the Viṣanārāyanīya. For this text, see below.
198. The text prescribes the manner in which the mantras are to be recited. The terms tārapūrvaṃ namo ’ntam and praṇavādinamo ’ntam (beginning with o and ending with namaḥ) or svāhāntaḥ (ending with svāha) often indicate the recitation of a full mantra or series of mantras. This is irrespective of whether the mantra actually ends with namaḥ or svāhā. Tāra is equivalent to praṇava while ṭhaṭha indicates svāhā.
199. Cf. ĪŚP 41, p. 288.
200. On Rajasthan (and rural UP), see the video Kusum (see Chapter 4, n. 17). The healer, who was not an āyurvedic physician, gave the father of the possessed girl (Kusum) a handful of packets of an undisclosed substance with instructions to burn them regularly in front of the girl.
201. I am grateful to Vaidyamadham Cheriya Narayanan Nambudiri for this information.
202. On aṣṭavaidya physicians, see Zimmermann 1987:212–213, and below.
203. This sort of “hot” substance is a tantric innovation; it is not commonly offered to Śiva, generally considered a “cool” or ascetic deity.
204. For this reason neem twigs have long been a common form of toothbrush in India and are still widely used in the countryside.
205. In modern-day India, sprouts of various kinds are germinated on a small raised plot of ground inside the house as part of the ritual of the nine-day festival to the goddess (Durgāpūjā) in the month of Asvina (September–October). It is likely that this is a very old practice.
206. Cf. Meulenbeld HIML IB:237n6. Meulenbeld does not suggest a botanical name or identification for this plant.
207. For closer examinations of the KausSu on this, see Bahulkar 1994:109–110, Bloomfield 1897:263–264, and Zysk 1985:29–31.
208. Chapters 11–16 deal with bālagrahas and unmāda. This text is in print and can thus be compared to the account in the ĪŚP also see Meulenbeld HIML IIA:456–457, IIB:468–469.
209. Mother of the dark graha Rāhu, daughter of Dakṣa or Kaśyapa and wife of Kaśyapa or Vipracitti; cf. MBh 1.59.12,30.
210. This bija is exclaimed at the funeral pyre when the skull cracks and the jīva exits the body.
211. Many of the words here (e.g., mañja, kaḍhḍha, and ṭhaṭha) are incomprehensible and would be accepted for their mantric value alone were it not for the fact that this mantra reads rather differently, and more comprehensibly, in the text of the Nārāyaṇīya, viz. the Tantrasārasaṃgraha (pp. 158–60), demonstrating that the ĪŚP had either corrupted it or was itself in possession of a corrupt version. The mantra in the Nārāyaṇīya reads: oṃ namaḥ sarvamātṝṇāṃ hṛdayaṃ moṭaya bhañja paṭa sphoṭaya sphura gṛhṇa ākaṭu troṭaya | evaṃ siddhiṃ jñāpayati | hara nirdoṣaṃ kuru bālakaṃ bālo vā sarvagrāhīṇām upakramyatu | (Om, salutations to the heart of all the Little Mothers. Crush! Break! Rip! Flash! Spring forth! Possess! ākaṭu [You whose pungent odor comes forth(?)]. Break apart! One should announce this clearly. O Hara, make this child faultless or let the child approach all the possessing demonesses!) (The commentator advises doubling the impv. 2 sg. forms, e.g., moṭaya moṭaya, bhañja bhañja, consistent with what we have seen in the South Indian manuscripts examined in Chapter 11.) The text continues: oṃ cāmuṇḍe namo divye hraṃ hrīṃ apasarantu duṣṭagrahāḥ | hrūṃ tathā gacchantu guhyakāḥ | anyatra sthāne oṃ rudro jñāpayati ṭha ṭha | One of the striking features of these mantras is the extensive use of retroflex consonants, e.g., kaṭa, ṭhaṭha, troṭaya. This could be due to a brahmanical assignation of these mantras to lower-class, non-Sanskritic strata of society, in this case an assumption or recognition of Dravidian or tribal origins, as these languages have much more retroflexion than Sanskrit. For somewhat similar speculations regarding the secret speech of Himalayan tantras, see Davidson 2002:267ff.
212. Cf. the discussions in Chapter 4 of the work of Srinivas, Mumford, Pakaslahti, Dwyer, and Vogt, which provide very different models of healing processes associated with possession.
213. For a review of scholarship on the term yukti see Engler 2003:426, 428. Engler describes it as “empirically based inference,” drawing principally on CaSū 11.21–25 and arguing against its modern interpretation as scientific reasoning.
214. See F. Smith 1987 for an idea of how the vedic sacrificial rituals varied within traditions defined by affiliation with a single Śrautasūtra, such as Apastamba or Baudhāyana.
215. The eight powers (guṇāḥ) are probably the eight archetypal siddhis; see note 85.
216. SuUt 60.21cd: ye tv āviśantīti vadanti mohāt te bhūtavidyāviṣayād apohyāḥ|| Though Caraka says that grahas are innumerable (Ca 6.9.21.8, above, p. 490; also Su 6.60.22, above p. 492), he does not attribute the possession to lesser spirits in a hierarchy of fiends.
217. See Stephens for accounts of sex with demons as an “aspect of the more general European fixation on physical interaction with demons” (2003:14). Agreements were contractual, including the sale of one’s soul to the devil. This idea does not appear to have resonance in India, where such sexuality is more prominently formalized and medicalized. Nor did this lead to crises of belief among the Hindu clergy, as appears to have been the case among Christian clergy in Europe.
218. This is not so far-fetched as it may seem at first glance. See Slater 2003 on the work of the psychologist David Barlow of the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders at Boston University. Slater writes:
     Barlow’s method for treating anxiety disorders is surprisingly simple, although its philosophical and clinical implications are anything but. He aims to reduce anxiety not by teaching customary relaxation techniques involving calming mantras or soothing imagery, but by doing just the opposite: forcing the patient to repeatedly face his most dreaded situation, so that, eventually, he becomes accustomed to the sensation of terror. Barlow claims he can rid some people of their symptoms in as little as five to eight days. His treatment promises to be psychotherapy’s ultimate fast track, but while many clinicians praise its well-documented results, others take a dimmer view of what one clinician calls “torture, plain and simple.” (p. 34)
     There can be little doubt that the extreme forms of psychological treatment recommended by Caraka et al. were as controversial in their day as Barlow’s are today, testifying, at the very least, to the composite nature of the āyurvedic compendia.
219. CaCi 6.9. 31cd: vismṛter hetor nayanti prakṛtiṃ manaḥ; cf. also 6.9.79–98.
220. On daivavyapāsrayacikitsā, see, in addition to the above, AHCi 1.171, 5.83–84; ASaṃSū 9.76; cp. Hārīta 3.3.2–3. Rasaratnasamuccaya 22.60–69; Chattopadhyaya 1979:314–320.
221. It is also possible that this term referred to internal practices, such as yoga, which do not require priestly or other formal mediation. Neither Caraka nor Susruta mentions yogic or Buddhist practices, to which sattvāvajaya might refer. Such practices might have been expunged from these texts in an attempt to enhance their scientific credibility. Their empiricism would have admitted observable or inferred phenomena, which to them included at least some ritual, use of gemstones, etc. By the same token, possession was admitted as a valid category, legitimated by repetition of characteristic behavior. For the same reason, sattvāvajaya, which must have been an inherited category with which they were uncomfortable, was relegated to the scantiest offhand mention. On the word sattvāvajaya, see references in note 2.
222. Oracular possession also may be characterized as a vāta disorder. Knipe observes that most goddess ritualists in coastal Andhra Pradesh are “by nature excitable, sometimes volatile and raucous, their monologues punctuated with belches, yawns, hiccups and other marks of incipient possession” (2004:440). All of these are characteristics of vātaprakopa (affliction due to vāta imbalance).
223. dṛṣṭaṃ spṛṣṭam athāghrātaṃ tad dhi sarvagrahāpaham; CaCi 6.9.62cd.
224. I am grateful to Robert Svoboda for this information (e-mail communication, March 4, 2003).
225. See the comments of Raman 1991:1:383. He states, on PrMā 12.62, that the proportion of dung, urine, milk, and yogurt should be 1:2:16:5. Raman does not note the proportion of ghee, but presumably the mixture should consist predominantly of ghee, the quantity of which might remain unspecified. Raman does not state his source. Vaidyamadham says that the ghee should measure four times the quantity of yogurt.
226. Cf. CaCi 6.9.50–52, for dog’s bile (śunaḥ pittam), beak and feather, probably incinerated, from inauspicious birds including the owl, vulture, and crow. These were likely recommended for their native properties that could contribute to an atmosphere inimical to bhūtas.
227. Recall that the mixing of animal with vegetal substances goes back to vedic times. Note in particular that surā, a kind of multigrain wine, produced for the Sautrāmaṇī sacrifice, is mixed with milk and the hair of a lion, wolf, and tiger (cf. Kane HDh II.2:1224–26). The Śatapatha Br. 12.7.3.19–21 (Eggeling 1900:229–230) demonstrates that the mythic idea is to include potent elements of wildness (raudra), because this is for Rudra. A similar notion of integrating different aspects of nature is presented here, the purpose of which is to present a multilevel front against offending bhūtas or grahas.
228. For recipes from the Tibetan Gyu-zhi, see Clifford 1984:88.
229. For a summary of the text, see Meulenbeld HIML IIA:86–90 and notes.
230. For dāruharidrā, elsewhere called dārunisā, see Meulenbeld HIML IIB:305n900, given as Berberis aristata DC. Like the barberry in Europe and the Oregon grape in North America, it is more a bush than an actual tree and possesses at least some of the medicinal properties of turmeric (haridra). The reason for preparing this under puṣya nakṣatra is not stated, but possibly the name puṣya itself, “prosperity,” is sufficient.
231. Vacā (Acorus calamus Linn.) is a widely used root that is dried and chewed to alleviate the discomforts of a sore throat. As mentioned earlier, it is also recommended for the enhancement of mental clarity. It is “hot” in the sense that it induces the release of heat in the body.
232. According to two of my āyurvedic informants, this is included because the cat has the capacity to recognize a bhūta, and the dried and ground up excrement captures that quality. Whether this kind of associative thinking was also that of the authors of the classical texts is uncertain.
233. The text says kesa (hair). However, according to my āyurvedic informants, this means jaṭāmāṃsī, a cooling and sweet root that is easily acquired and is often used in havan (tantrically inspired fire ritual). The word jaṭā means “dreadlock,” specifically those of sādhus, grown in the image of Śiva. Thus, jaṭāmāṃsī may be viewed as a kind of keśa.
234. Priya Vrat Sharma, the editor and translator of the published text of the Cakradatta, translates pakvaindrī, as “ripe fruits of indravāruṇī mixed with cow-urine and ghee,” following the commentary (pakvaindrīphalamūlajam sājyam).
235. In fact, mayurapiccha does contain trace elements of copper and gold, which was apparently known by classical practitioners of tantric medicine. Baidyanath, the well-known Indian pharmaceutical firm, manufactures an antispasmodic under the trade name Mayuracandrikā Bhasma, in which the central ingredient is mayurapiccha. The indications on the container state: “Antiemetic. Relieves hiccough, asthma, and vomiting.” All of these are vāta conditions. Similarly, sarpanirmoka (snake skin) is recommended today as an ingredient in a dhūpa meant for alleviating piles—another vāta affliction.
236. Some vaidyas have altered their views, however, under the influence of Western scientific and psychological theory. Dr. Raghavan Thirumulpad of Chalakudy (Thrissur District), the most prolific modern author of āyurvedic texts in Malayalam, explained to me that bhūtonmāda is always the result of one’s mistaken or non-dharmic actions, prajñāparādha, a word taken from the āyurvedic texts (cf. above AH 6.4.4), which I have often heard vaidyas (and many others, including a variety of vedāntins) use as a descriptor for moral transgression. In his view, bhutonmāda is comparatively rare today, because of changes in contemporary belief systems. This, he says, is an artifact of outdated cultural notions. This view expresses the voice of modern, Western-influenced Sanskritic culture. On his diagnostic approach to bhutonmāda, he said: udāharaṇamātraṃ tu budhimatāṃ, yadoktānusāram evāśrayo maṇḍabudhīnām (An intelligent physician is free to design a clinical approach to each problem, irrespective of the texts, but a slow-witted one strictly adheres to the letter of the texts). This has apparently been the practical approach of Āyurveda for millennia.
237. Shadows of this might have once been found in Buddhism, where Āryaśūra, in his Jātakamālā, refers to experts in bhūtavidyā as Siddhavidyās; cf. White 1996:58.
238. For an account of the possession at the Chottanikkara “Bhagavathy” temple near Tripunithura in the eastern suburbs of Cochin/Ernakulam, see F. Smith 2004.
239. The institution founded by P. S. Varier, the Arya Vaidya Sala, maintains its home base in Kottakkal, but has dispensaries and pharmaceutical outlets throughout India. According to one of my informants familiar with the Arya Vaidya Sala educational system, this institution has trained more than four hundred non-Hindu vaidyas, most of them Muslims. I have also encountered a number of non-Brahman and Christian vaidyas trained at the aṣṭavaidya medical colleges. The education in the latter institutions is still conducted by Nambudiris, some of whom know the entire AH by heart. I have met a few non-Brahman Hindu pandits in the Varier tradition who have also memorized the entire AH. I mention this to counter the common assertion that only Brahmans study Sanskrit and only Hindus study Āyurveda. In both Kerala traditions, however, I found the non-Hindu vaidyas considerably less skilled because they did not have access to the Sanskrit texts.
240. A measure of his prestige is that he also bears the title sālāvaidyam. This title indicates that he has the unique eligibility (adhikāra) to sit in a vedic sacrificial arena (yāgasāla) during the performance of a soma sacrifice. In Kerala a doctor is required in a sacrifice, and only a sālāvaidyam is qualified. Vaidyamadham is a follower of the Dakṣiṇāmūrti temple at Shukapuram in Mallapuram District. Historically, he says only members of his family have served as sālāvaidya. Frits Staal does not mention this position in Agni, his massive 1983 study of a vedic agnicayana performed in central Kerala in 1975. Thus, it is doubtful that this tradition is or has been in general currency throughout Kerala. In order to confirm his eligibility for the position of sālāvaidyam, at one time he had to spend forty-one days at this temple “doing dhyāna and bhajan,” meditating and singing hymns to the deity. In addition, he says, yajñikas or sacrificial patrons (āhitāgnis) assemble at this Dakṣiṇāmūrti temple to practice for their sacrifices, as Dakṣiṇāmūrti is “the deity for right thinking.”
241. The botanical identity of this herb is disputed, as several plants have been identified with this name. One possibility is Convolvulus pluricaulis. Another is Canscora decussata, reportedly used for śaṅkhapuṣpi in Bengal and parts of north India. A third is Clitoria ternatea, reportedly used for śaṅkhapuṣpi in Kerala. In any case, śaṅkhapuṣpi is said to increase sattva (brightness, mental clarity, positive qualities) and was prescribed for use in brāhmighṛta and other tonics for the nervous system. (I am grateful to Robert Svoboda for this information.) For similar information, see AH Uttarasthana 1.43, 6.24–25, 7.24, 39.44–51. It has also been called viṣṇukrānta, probably denoting that parts of the plant were used in Hindu worship. See www.thehimalayadrugco.com/herbfinder/h_evolvulus.htm; for the results of research on it, see http://ccras.org/publication/clinical&experimental_1.htm.
242. This is the family of P. Nilakanthan Nambudiri, with whom I also spoke at length. Their burgeoning practice is limited to the treatment of mental disorders. A large majority of their clients are Muslim girls, as Mallapuram District, listed in the 1991 census of India at 68 percent Muslim, now probably has an even higher proportion (this information is missing in the 2001 census). The family of Nilakanthan has a residential facility and empowers their medicines with mantras and puja, all of which are tightly guarded family secrets. For a more complete description of the Poomkutil treatment center, see Unnikrishnan 1998.
243. For more on this bhūta, see Tarabout 2003.
244. Cf. Inden 1992.
245. For all of this, see the rather hurried and unreliable edition and translation by Raman (1991). It is to a great extent this systematic elegance (or elegant systematics) that makes astrology (jyotiṣa) so attractive in India to this day.
246. See Brahmānand Tripāṭhī’s note on this in his Hindi commentary on the AH titled Nirmalā: āyurved kā jyotiṣaśāstra se ghaniṣṭh sambandh hai (Ayurveda’s relationship with the sastra of astrology is of the closest kind).
247. Trans. Keith 1914:118.
248. The connection between astrology, tantric ritual, and Āyurveda is found elsewhere in India; it is not limited to Kerala. Another text that is much more expansive on this than the PrMā is the Vīrasiṃhāvaloka, composed in North India, possibly in Gwalior, dated 1383 (see Meulenbeld HIML IIA:229–230 and notes). This text, never the subject of serious academic study, deserves far more attention than I can give it here. It purports to be a jyotiśśāstrakarmavipākāyurvedaprayoga, a term that appears in the colophon to each of its seventy-one chapters. It is a handbook discussing the astrology (jyotiḥ) and karmic causes of disease (karmavipāka, see the above discussion on the Madanamahārṇava), and at length describes medicinal treatments for more than fifty diseases. Curiously, the astrological significations are absent from the account of unmāda, though they are present in the account of apasmāra. The bulk of the section on unmāda consists of recipes for medicated ghees, powders (cūrṇa), and fumigants (dhūpa). It is possible to argue, drawing from Langford’s view of Āyurveda as a cultural commodity in the West today (2002:263ff.), that the four of these taken together—astrology, medicine, ritual, and karmavipāka—have constituted a form of local knowledge and correlative local commodity for more than a thousand years. For more on the situation at present, see Friedman 1986; Perinbanayagam 1982; Pugh 1983.
249. Clifford 1984:157–158. Kakar reports the following on Tibetans in exile in India: “If the patient is possessed by a bhūta, his eyes move downward toward the left; in the case of possession by a dakini—a female spirit often addressed as ‘Mother,’ who is said to bestow esoteric knowledge and power on its devotees—the eyes move upward toward the right” (1982:110).
250. Cf. Meulenbeld HIML IIA:348–52. This text is widely cited in Maharashtra as an authority on strīroga, (diseases of women), especially regarding questions of childbirth.
251. This is from the first few pages of the YR, pp. 12–14 of the Varanasi edition, verses 1–3, 11–20, 22.
252. The same vaidyas prescribe pearl (muktā) and silver (rajata) bhasmas for nija unmāda.
253. The nine gems are: Sun–ruby (māṇikya), Moon–pearl (mauktika, muktā), Mars–red coral (pravāla, vidruma), Mercury–emerald (gārutmata, garudodgāra), Jupiter–yellow sapphire (puṣparāga = topaz), Venus–diamond (vajra, hīra, or often simply ratna), Saturn–blue sapphire (indranīla), Rāhu–hessonite or onyx (gomeda), Ketu–cat’s eye (vaiḍūrya). For variations on these gems and how to prepare them, see the sixteenth-century encyclopedia Āyurvedasaukhya 4.649–701. For information on gems in ancient India, see the references cited in Meulenbeld HIML IIB:742–743nn.389–403. Navaratna bhasma is, needless to say, very expensive. It is, however, available.
254. Cf. Meulenbeld HIML IIA:581–787 (Part 10), works on rasaśāstra and ratnaśāstra.
255. An edition of this was published in the 1990s in Lhasa. See Byams-pa ’Phrinlas and Wang Lei n.d.:32, thangka 63 and description, pp. 402–405, and thangkas 66–68, pp. 33–34, descriptions, pp. 430–443. This extraordinary text deserves much closer work than that volume gives it.
256. One of these is reproduced schematically in Clifford 1984:158; two are reproduced in Tsarong et al. 2001:116.

259. While virtually all āyurvedic compendia of the past few centuries have an obligatory section on bhūtavidyā, this was not always the case in the first millennium. For example, the Siddhasāra of Ravigupta (from Kashmir, c. 650 C.E.) does not. See Siddhasāra:2:307–313, ch. 20, on unmāda, Āveśa is not mentioned. Ch. 29, called kumāratantra, is somewhat more relevant in its concern with pharmacopeia. The Siddhasāra was translated into Tibetan, Uighur, and Khotanese (at least). This text includes Ronald Emmerick’s edition of the Sanskrit and Tibetan versions.
260. However, see White 2003:35ff., and above Ch. 6 note 52.
261. See Reddy 2000 and Langford 2002 for illuminating theoretical accounts of the modernization of Āyurveda.
