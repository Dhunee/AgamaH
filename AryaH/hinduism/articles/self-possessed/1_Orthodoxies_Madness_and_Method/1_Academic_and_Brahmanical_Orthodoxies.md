## Sanskritic Culture and the Culture of Possession

Ethnographic work at the beginning of the twentieth century, which has been supplemented and revitalized during the past forty years, shows that spirit or deity possession is a widespread epstēmē—a historically situated discourse, phenomenon, and practice—in Indian thought, culture, religion, and medicine.1 However, if our knowledge of the subject were limited to the accounts of classical Indologists and others who have privileged the “high” intellectual and religious traditions while eschewing the history of actual religious practice, we would scarcely know of the existence of this phenomenon, much less its pervasiveness. One might say that it is the “ism” of Hinduism, the Hinduism essentialized by its most literate propagators and translators that has nullified and delegitimized its breathtakingly broad spectrum of popular practice, including possession.2 More specifically, non- or scant recognition of possession in premodern India has been due to a longstanding aversion among educated Judeo-Christians as well as educated Hindus, for whom possession has fallen outside the realm of both reason and social accountability.3 Perhaps the most common perception—and consequent stigmatization—of possession among both academic and indigenous orthodoxies is that it is a nettlesome aberration, a blemish on the face of epistemological order, a phenomenon subject to benign neglect, or, at most, sanitized into nonrecognition. To whatever degree this perception is borne out by taxonomies in both Sanskrit and regional languages that distinguish various loci and states of possession (a topic dealt with extensively below), the more important point is that possession and, indeed, emotion itself, the kinder, gentler ancestor of possession, have been considered to bear the stigma of primitivism:4 they are associated with people of lower social rank, including low castes, tribals, and women,5 or more generally with those lacking literacy, the great (and, before modern times, extremely rare) tool generally believed capable of bestowing introspection, self-knowledge, and control.6 Therefore, discussion of it has been avoided or denounced by the self-conceived (and, by no accident, highly literate) orthodox among both scholars and indigenous practitioners. And among scholars, even when this stigma has not been inflicted, possession as the exclusive property of lower-ranking individuals has been assumed so casually as to preclude a search for it among other groups and individuals. Even the eminent sociologist Louis Dumont declares possession a “mystic ecstasy … which so far we have not encountered at a learned level.”7 The present study aims to rectify these shortcomings.

In this study, I press two overriding contentions, both of which not only are paramount for the present study but have implications for the methodology of future scholarship. The first is that the force of the ethnographic accounts should elicit a re-examination of classical texts for evidence of possession. The second is that possession as described by anthropologists and other ethnographers, and as understood by native and scholastic orthodoxies, does not represent the full spectrum of possession as revealed in Sanskrit texts. No doubt, such possession is described in or assumed by certain Sanskrit texts, and the bulk of the present project is dedicated to the exploration of Sanskritic possession. However, as shown below, the category of possession as understood in Sanskrit literature must be expanded beyond the parameters assigned to it by previous scholarship, which is largely drawn from prevailing Western notions. As an indigenous category in ancient and classical India, possession is not a single, simple, reducible category that describes a single, simple, reducible experience or practice, but is distinguished by extreme multivocality, involving fundamental issues of emotion, aesthetics, language, and personal identity.

Both of these contentions contribute to my principal project here, which is to retrieve, as far as possible from texts, an understudied aspect of ancient and classical Indian cultural practice, religious experience,8 and disease production. I become suspicious of the apparent nonexistence of possession in antiquity when we read present accounts, such as that of David Knipe, who states, based on fieldwork in East Godavari District, Andhra Pradesh, “it appears that the number of householders subject to possession states is astonishingly high, and the phenomenon occurs within families of all communities as a central component of religious life.”9 This suspicion is verified, at least for non-Sanskritic classical culture, when we read David Shulman’s reports on “Tamil Hinduism.” Beginning in the Pallava-Pāṇṭiya period in the sixth century C.E., writes Shulman, “The focus is entirely on the interaction between the devotee and the god who has entered him, mastered or ‘possessed’ him without destroying his empirical, sensually motivated, autarchic being.”10

Despite vivid descriptions of possession in Tamil texts of the first millennium C.E., which on the whole bear out the contemporary ethnographies, as lucidly discussed by Glenn Yocum,11 most Sanskrit texts, conspicuously “canonical” religious texts, entirely neglect—or, perhaps, avoid—discussing what people actually do or experience. The reason for this is well known: The major commentaries on the philosophical darśanas and primary texts of aesthetic theory set the epistemological agendas for the remainder of religious discourse in Sanskrit. The principal epistemological feature of these primary texts and commentaries is a quest for programmatic perfection, with unwritten rules that discourage discussion of personal experience except as a mythical, fictional, or paradigmatic figure might have a paradigmatic experience. These texts clearly are mindful of the requirements of canon, which, as mentioned, privilege theory over experience.12 Thus Sanskrit texts are almost always oriented uncompromisingly toward concepts, prescriptions, and mythology—what their authors understood to be “true”—but rarely toward “human” concern (except insofar as theorizing is a human concern)—what we (and probably they) deemed to be “real.”13 However, with persistent searching—a task doomed to incompleteness—perhaps we can begin to retrieve descriptions of this “deemed reality” from texts that both approximate those found in ethnographic literature and shed light on the parallel issues of emotional construction and personal identity in India.

The problem of retrieval, however, is not just one of oppositional texts; equally problematic is scholarly re-engineering of possession states, a problem that continues to the present day, albeit rather reduced from that of previous decades or centuries. It is well known by now that the academic agendas of respectable Indological scholarship were set in the middle of the nineteenth century by Europeans who cast a long shadow of doubt on the “authenticity,” hence validity, of a number of subjects.14 The important subjects, which quickly became canonical, which is to say orthodox, in Indology, following to some extent a sanitized brahmanical presentation, were the Vedas, Sanskrit grammar (vyākaraṇa), the “six systems” of Indian philosophy (ṣaḍdarśana), Buddhism and Jainism, law (dharmaśāstra), epic poetry (kāvya), and, to a lesser extent, poetic theory (alaṃkāraśāstra). Among the subjects neglected by respectable scholars were Tantra, bhakti, and astrology (jyotiṣa), the texts of which, interestingly, are included in disproportionately high numbers in manuscript collections throughout India, but were cast into disfavor by the orientalism of the day.15 Factors weighing against these latter texts were their relative modernity, their popularity, and their intellectual movement away from the more classical texts, which, following the orientalist prerogative (consonant with their nostalgia for classical Greece and the Renaissance), expressed in general the ascendancy of reason. Thus certain topics and texts were destined for neglect because they participated in and typified a perceived intellectual and cultural malaise that rendered the defeated, superstitious, caste-ridden, economically straitened, and technologically underdeveloped India the natural subjects of the European Enlightenment. In other words, not only were most of these texts composed after the close of the first millennium C.E., which is to say on the wrong side of the tracks, temporally, to count as true or ideal representatives of ancient India, but their very subject matter was beneath the intellectual and cultural prestige or dignity of contemporary European scholarship.16

If the brahmanical orthodoxies engineered popular and experiential content out of their texts, if they cavalierly shredded context and imposed an artificial and hegemonic discursive order, as standard Indology suspects—and this is a big “if”—it becomes immediately necessary to pose a question that will inevitably bear on everything dealt with here: Are Sanskrit (and other classical Indic) texts appropriate sources for our inquiry? More precisely, is Sanskrit literature or Sanskritic culture capable of representing the interests of a clientele more broadly based than a brahmanical elite that is usually characterized (and caricatured) as unregenerate and epistemologically prejudiced? At this point, which is to say until we have recounted and taken stock of the evidence—or its absence—we must be content with the unsatisfying observation that this question is fraught with ideological considerations and is thus unanswerable.

Nevertheless, a preliminary inquiry into this question is possible through a consideration of two opposing viewpoints on the capabilities of Sanskrit literature. In one corner is the eminent historian and Sanskritist D. D. Kosambi, who does not mince his words in the introduction to his critical edition of a collection of Sanskrit court poetry and miscellanea, the Subhāṣitaratnakoṣa, compiled in the eleventh or twelfth century C.E. in Bengal by one Vidyāpati. Kosambi observes that the life depicted in such poetry “was not shared by most Indians of the poet’s or of any other time; in essence, not even by the poet himself.”17 According to Kosambi, Sanskrit poetry, as well as classical Sanskritic culture, was the shared property—as well as the shared fantasy (Kosambi would likely regard it as a shared conceit)—of a brahman/ ruler class collusion.18 The end product was “the empty bombast of a Rājaśekhara,” thoroughly detached from the lives and livelihoods of the majority.19 In the other corner is the Sanskritist Richard Lariviere, who parries “criticisms of Sanskrit philology” in a wonderfully contentious article entitled “Protestants, Orientalists, and Brāhmaṇas: Reconstructing Indian Social History.”20 It is Lariviere’s view that “if we return to the philological techniques and values that have been exhibited with such consistency in the study of Greek and Latin classics, and that were once an important part of Sanskrit philology, but seem, in recent years, to have fallen out of favor, … [the result will be] to give the fullest possible voice to the views of classical Indians—of all social classes.” To achieve this, he states, “we must carefully and thoroughly edit their texts.” In Lariviere’s view, “[t]he better the data we have the better our answers will be, and philology provides the data.” Although Lariviere sanctimoniously calls for more and better critical editions of Sanskrit texts as the central requirement in the noble mission of expanding our knowledge of the historical South Asian underclasses, it must be remembered that in the Subhāṣitaratnakoṣa Kosambi has also taken on the task of constructing a critical edition, always with a view toward understanding Indian social history—and has arrived at radically different conclusions. Regardless of how this debate eventually plays out—and I am not particularly optimistic that Lariviere’s hypothesis will be upheld in any great measure21—the present work is, I hope, an example of data-gathering from a large number of Sanskrit texts and of how such data gathering can help us to retrieve and identify some of the religious views and practices of a broad spectrum of ancient and classical Indian society.22 In the process I hope to demonstrate implicitly some of the areas in which both Kosambi and Lariviere might be right.

Several scholars have declared that possession is conspicuously absent in Sanskrit texts, at least possession as classically understood from ethnographies. In addition to Dumont, cited above, Richard Gombrich states, “Later brahmanism … denied all value to possession states and they were screened out of brahmanical religion. To be possessed is to lose one’s self-awareness and self-control. Brahmānism inculcated control.”23 Gombrich’s remarks were to some extent responsible for alerting me to the possibility of possession in Sanskrit texts. While it is true that brahmanism inculcates control, to what extent, I wondered, did brahmans strictly observe brahmanism, and to what extent was this aspect of brahmanism an instigating force in a broad sampling of Sanskrit texts? I wondered, in other words, was the relationship between brahmans, brahmanism, and brahmanical texts very different a thousand or two thousand or three thousand years ago from what it is today? It is important for our purposes to note that brahmans, perhaps as much as others, participate in rituals of possession (and enter into states of possession), as is evident in the bhūta cults of South Kanara District,24 the pilgrimage to Nandadevi documented by William Sax,25 bhakti derived possession by smārta women in Madras by Mary Hancock,26 and rites of exorcism in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Varanasi, and doubtless elsewhere.27 This is analogous to the participation of Buddhists, unswervingly loyal to their textual traditions and text-based practices, in an array of possession rituals in Tibet, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, if not elsewhere.28 As is the case with Buddhists and Buddhism, participation by brahmans in ritual must be distinguished from “brahmanism” as Gombrich employs the term. Indeed, many if not most brahmans demur in practice, at least part of the time, from the “ism” of brahmanism, and probably always have. We examine in Chapter 5 a passage from the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad that confirms this in part.29 The tidy conflation of brahmans and brahmanical practice with the “ism” is all too hastily associated with both and leads to conclusions such as Dumont’s, which are little more than weary stereotyping. To be more generous, however, what Dumont and Gombrich are doubtless referring to are the official brahmanical doctrines espoused by the literary elite for the past two or three millennia, as they appear in the normative dharmaśāstra texts and philosophical darśanas. In this sense, Gombrich is correct in noting the importance of “brahmanism” in delimiting the parameters of control, self-awareness, and the self as a single discrete independent entity. Indeed, these are some of the issues I must address in unpacking the category “possession.”

Restated in the form of fundamental questions, these issues may be expressed as follows: Is the “self” or “person” revealed and explicated in possession states genuine? Is there a true self (assuming for the moment that this is a viable concept and can be located) contaminated or camouflaged by possession states, spirits, or deities? Is the self a singular stable undiluted entity? Or is it a referential, explanatory convenience, an individualized composite construction, and thus unrealizable beneath its layerings—in agreement with the Buddhists? If the former, is deity or spirit possession a superimposition on a pure and realizable self? If so, then possession should be distinguished from that insular self, which is to say that the self and the personality are distinct. If the latter, is such possession a random or occasional component in a mutating multiform self, and if so can we really call this a “self” rather than a “person”? Or—another possibility—is possession merely a trope, a significator for an essentially plural or composite self? These are all questions intended to explore the experiential and soteriological trajectories of possession as well as its historical and sociopolitical contexts.

With respect to Buddhists, to whom control and mindfulness were paramount, Gombrich observes that they “set themselves against such vulgar lack of self-control in favour of what they considered more ‘civilized’ standards.”30 Thus, possession skirted the various crossroads of native scholasticism, “civilized standards,” and control, self or otherwise. The assumed—and unaddressed—questions were: Is the deity or the true self revealed more accurately when one is in control or out of control? Is the self revealed out of control different from or, as some would have it, inferior to the one revealed while under control? Or, is there not much difference; which is to ask, does being out of control lead to states of knowledge, surrender, and spontaneity that are similar or identical to those manifest while under control? Or, is spontaneity in religious expression possible only under controlled (which is to say ritualized) circumstances?31

With respect to the integrity of the self, which cannot be easily separated from the body, the early and middle Vedic texts are clear. For example, the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (9.5.1.11) insists on a self that is constitutive of an intimate interplay between human, divine, and sacrificial bodies, while the Atharvaveda (11.3.1–2,7–8) holds that “of this porridge Bṛhaspati is the head, Bráhman is the mouth, heaven and earth the ears, sun and moon the eyes, the seven seers the in- and out-breaths … dark metal its flesh, red metal its blood, tin its ash, gold its complexion.”32 Whether porridge or human being (and often there is little difference), this theme of a composite body and self recurs in Vedic and Purāṇic literature (the figure of Yajñavarāha, the “sacrificial boar,” and the kāmadhenu or wish-fulfilling cow is employed in Chapter 10 to help explicate this) and, to a great extent, sets the tone for widespread textual and extratextual acceptance of possession as a natural phenomenon and of power sharing across apparent individual boundaries.

As suggested, one of the primary goals of this study is to examine the notion, generally recognized by anthropologists, though not by religious orthodoxies, that possession is not just one thing and apply this insight to the evidence from Sanskrit and other classical Indian texts. What I hope to show is that the category of possession as it has been commonly understood in religious studies and Indology, where it has been addressed at all, does not work well in the context of the classical Indian view of the self. As I demonstrate, it is a self with permeable layerings and boundaries, both of which constantly shift and mutate, and this can be known in part through a study of possession, as suggested by recent anthropological studies. Janice Boddy, an anthropologist who has studied possession in Sudan, writes that possession, within a wide spectrum of anthropological situations, is “a broad term referring to an integration of spirit and matter, force, or power and corporeal reality, in a cosmos where the boundaries between an individual and her environment are acknowledged to be permeable, flexibly drawn, or at least negotiable.”33 Furthermore, I hope to show that the questions asked above can be answered, at least in part, through a better understanding of the experience and construction of possession in premodern India.

I retain the term “possession,” though it may not work very well in some of the circumstances that I discuss.34 But I preserve it because the broad semantic boundaries of the terms under study here provide no attractive alternative. Consistent with this, I also suggest, in agreement with Gombrich, that the disregard or oversight of possession is a product of its construction (or lack thereof) by orthodoxies. In spite of concerted efforts at ideological exorcism, possession is frequently found in Sanskrit texts, but locating it, thinking about it, and understanding it cannot be undertaken by applying our usual category of possession, even if Gombrich is quite correct given his assumptions of what possession actually is.

Close scrutiny leads me to conclude that forms of religious experience and expression since the time of the Ṛgveda disclose much more possession than hitherto believed. After reviewing notions of possession derived from ethnographic literature, important because these notions define the commonly understood terms of our investigation, I discuss examples from a broad range of Sanskrit texts, including the Ṛgveda and Upaniṣads, the two great epics, the Mahābhārata and Rāmāyaṇa, the primary classical medical texts, classical poetry and fiction, classical yoga and Vedānta texts, tantric texts in both their philosophical and ritual incarnations, sectarian devotional texts, and of utmost importance for “negative” possession an array of āyurvedic texts. Throughout I attempt to summon a few conclusions about possession that might augment our appreciation of the phenomenon.
In spite of the generally accessible chronology of the selected texts and genres (and presumably of the development of the concepts contained therein), I must emphasize that, in view of the thematic organization of the subject matter presented here, I cannot rigorously adhere to the chronological order of text composition in assembling my account of possession in Sanskrit texts. Although text chronology does not necessarily correspond to the logical order of my presentation, neither is my assemblage of evidence, often lexical in nature, merely associative. Not unexpectedly, many of the text passages are ritual in nature, though a notable feature is that the objects and intentions of the rituals as expressed in the early texts are often not the same as in later texts. In the Ṛgveda, for example, possession was associated with ritual consumption of soma, while in the later Tantras and other explicitly ritual and devotional texts it was associated with initiation, ritual lapses, hostile takeovers by spirits, immersion in the regulated (hence ritualized) “life” of a deity, and the very equivalent of enlightenment. This shift is significant because the relevant passages from most of the later texts as well as occurrences of possession found in modern religious practice, including religious drama, appear to be predicated more explicitly on an ethos of possession that in time became more characteristic, recognizable, and predictable. It is not that the early texts suggest spontaneous states of possession that were later suppressed or domesticated through ritual confinement, but that the earliest accounts may be skewed by frustratingly incomplete descriptions of both ritual and states of possession.35

Regardless of the extent to which early texts may be incomplete or later texts and ethnographic accounts complete, an unchanging fact was that spiritual and social forms of control were to a great extent mediated through intricate ritualizing, in which the domestication of possession was undoubtedly a factor. But this probably came about not because of more possession, or ritualization of possession, but because of increasing recognition of it through a more developed vocabulary of possession. After possession was recognized and named—and this appears to have already occurred by the time of the Ṛgveda—the category or categories denoting this activity became multivocal; they expanded to include varieties or shadings of itself. As is often the case with an action or phenomenon that is inherently uncertain or difficult to identify, possession as experienced and thought about in India suffered the discomfort of certainty and confidence arising from linguistic identification. In other words, one of the methods of controlling possession was to identify it, however vague or variant it might be, as something that was already known. Thus the forms of experience reflected in this vocabulary appeared to require control, given the social and ritual fabric of control in ancient India and the increased tendency to codify such control through the careful use of language and the composition of texts.

Perhaps as important as any other feature inhibiting orthodox recognition of possession was the very fact of literacy itself, which presupposes the composition of Sanskrit texts (not to speak of scholarly exegesis). One might say that in general textuality itself was, or at least epitomized, the antithesis of possession. Walter Ong notes, “By separating the knower from the known, writing makes possible increasingly articulate introspectivity, opening the psyche as never before not only to the external objective world quite distinct from itself but also to the interior self against whom the objective world is set.”36 In other words, literacy—or, more simply, text—potentially releases the knower from the necessity of intense bodily engagement, from interaction with other beings, human or nonhuman, real or imagined, and, at the same time, establishes self-sufficiency beyond the pale of relational intrusion, a realm in which possession naturally abides. Indeed, to the culture of the situated word, possession dictated a relational intrusion beyond the realm of self-sufficiency; it was, rather, a technology or mode of representation, an improbable and intractable self-effacement and a wholesale replacement of one set of memories for another.37 The response of most of the orthodox among Sanskrit paṇḍitas to the problem of possession, or more generally of human experience itself, was a civilizing and, not incidentally, a benignly controlling neglect, a response not far from that of their more modern Indological counterparts.

Regardless of whether writing was a universal fact of life among the educated (and in India education did not always require the written word), the brahmanical culture was one in which certain behavioral norms were propagated and largely observed. The very propagation and observance of these norms, regardless of how closely tied they were to written texts (and eventually their link was very close), constituted at least a cultural or brahmanical literacy that became extratextual, though emphatically not universal, as the discipline of anthropology constantly confirms. Indeed, I try to demonstrate, inspired to some extent by Ong, that the ideological literacy of “Sanskritic culture” was not universal, that it was, at various points, strongly under the sway of nonliterate and “vernacular” modes of thought.38 While it is probably true that literacy, wittingly or unwittingly, inculcates control, what we find in India is that certain cultures, highly refined (saṃskṛta) yet, at the same time, comfortably “vernacularized,” share certain features that allow considerable spontaneity and emotion, positioning them more or less against the grain of a “Sanskritic culture” commonly understood (or, more accurately, misunderstood) as uniform or monolithic. At the risk of oversimplification, I posit for the moment that the most prominent among these are the early vedic culture and the culture of post–first millennium C.E. bhakti, with the more normative, control-oriented, darśana-based cultures situated between them.

## The Sanskritic Vocabulary of Possession

It is difficult to recommend a single definition of possession, or indeed a single word for it, in the Indian context, primarily because this context—even as described in Sanskrit texts—is more accurately a shifting series of contexts that betray a broad life experience. Kathleen Erndl states, “The word possession can … provide only a rough and partial semantic equivalent for what is a fluid, multifaceted set of concepts.”39 The fact that I am able to locate only one attempt to define possession in Sanskrit literature, by the great tenth-century Kashmiri paṇḍita Abhinavagupta (discussed below), and that this definition does not easily suit most of the Sanskritic contexts of possession, demonstrates that possession as apprehended from these literary contexts constitutes a category in need of clarification. Determining the extent to which such a clarification can be expedited by comparison with the interpretations of possession states proffered by ethnographers is a necessary part of this study. This matter is dealt with below, but here I need simply to mention that comparisons with shamanic ecstasy, yogic samādhi, and hypnotic states must be undertaken cautiously. Mircea Eliade, who many years ago proposed these distinctions in his book Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, has not given adequate attention to possession states in spite of contributing the valuable observation that yogins and fakirs may practice the exercises of particular schools of yoga while separately (or even simultaneously, which is to say eclectically) engaging in “ecstatic practice,”40 which has too often been regarded as synonymous with possession.41 So, without overburdening the reader with taxonomies, at least in the beginning, of what has been regarded in India as spirit or deity possession, I shall try to convey what the ancient and classical texts have said about both the process and the accompanying states of deity and spirit possession.

I began thinking about this topic with the idea that I could do justice to the subject by searching the texts for examples of āveśa (entrance into), the word used perhaps most widely for possession. This derives from the lexeme ā√viś (to enter in) and is attested in the sense of possession in many of its verbal forms and nominal derivatives (including, notably, samāveśa). Forms of ā√viś are nearly always distinguished from its close colleague pra√viś (to enter toward), which provides relevant nominal derivatives such as praveśa and praveśana. In the former case, ā√viś, friendly, benign, or self-motivated possession is indicated, while pra√viś more often indicates possession generated from outside.42 In fact, C. J. Fuller, undoubtedly reflecting on contemporary ethnographic data, comments, “In all Indian languages, a distinction can be made between involuntary, ‘bad’ possession by a malevolent being and voluntary, ‘good’ possession by a deity.”43 Although not all possession induced from outside, which is to say involuntary, can be regarded as “bad” (cf. below the Mahābhārata story of the possession of Ruci by Vipula Bhārgava), it is significant that this differentiation appears as early as the Ṛgveda.

Other words for possession occur as well, most frequently derivatives from the root √gṛh (to grasp, seize), e.g., graha, grahaṇa, parigraha, though other derivatives are attested from adhi√sthā (to inhabit) and abhi√mṛś, upa√spṛś, sam√spṛś (to touch, contact). Usually these convey a comparatively malefic sense, an inimical entrance or hostile takeover, in which the possession occurs independent of or even contrary to the intention of the one possessed. However, other more extended ideas or descriptions of emotional states may occur in place of a single word. Most important here is the word bhāva (mood, attitude, experiential state), which is often closely associated semantically with āveśa. Therefore, an examination of this word must be incorporated into a study of āveśa, especially in Purāṇas and other devotional texts, as well as in ethnographies of possession. Indeed, one of the primary aims of this study is to elucidate the vocabulary of possession, to understand the complex semantic parameters of the lexical field relating to possession, recognizing that the Sanskrit (and other Indic) terms, as well as the English term “possession,” are polysemous and multivocal, thus presenting an array of unenviable problems in cross-cultural understanding.44

## Problematics of Interpretation
Until the 1970s it was acceptable literary practice to employ terms such as “person,” “self,” and “experience” unquestioningly in academic discourse. Since then, however, these and other related terms have come under close critical scrutiny. The word “consciousness,” for example, is used in contemporary Anglophone culture in ways never imagined, for instance, in classical India; indeed, I have identified more than thirty different words and terms in one Sanskrit text alone, the Bhāgavata Purāṇa, that have been variously translated with this juggernaut significator of contemporary culture.45 These words and terms have distinct meanings with distinct, if partially overlapping, semantic fields. This confers specificity to each word and term that is not conveyed through the blanket translation “consciousness.” Thus, because of the abuse, confusion, and ambiguity of this word revealed in contemporary discursive practice, I have avoided it whenever possible.46 This is not always practical, however, because possession inevitably touches on issues raised by the concept of consciousness as variously formulated.47

With this example in mind, we should discuss a few problematic English terms that are prominent in the present discussions of possession and that, like “consciousness,” call for greater precision and sensitivity to context. I need not dwell here on the central term of this study, namely “possession,” as I must, obviously, deal with it throughout. But a few others should be highlighted at the outset because of their general relevance. In addition to “consciousness,” we consider here “experience,” “person,” and “self.” These three terms do not come close to exhausting the problematics that could be raised with respect to the terminology employed in this volume; but to discuss them more deeply here would deflect the focus of this work and impose greater restrictions on my own freedom of discourse than is necessary or comfortable. Some of these other terms, such as “rationality,” “incarnation,” “intentionality,” “belief,” and “mediumship,” could also have been mentioned at the outset. But these and several others are better addressed in situ. Several of these terms received dedicated space in Mark C. Taylor’s Critical Terms for Religious Studies,48 which I occasionally cite here. However, I limit my remarks specifically to the subject at hand.49

## The Concept of Experience
When I speak of an experience of soma (Chapter 5), a cultural or religious experience, a personal experience, a dissociative experience, and especially an experience of possession, I am employing with apparent ease terminology that hovers on a precipitous edge of ancient and classical Indian discourse maps. No one can doubt that people as well as cultures and civilizations experience in some sense, and that they experience all the time. Several scholars, however, including Wilhelm Halbfass, Wayne Proudfoot, and Robert Sharf, have noted, or even reinforced, certain relatively recent doubts cast on the “notion” of experience, particularly religious experience, positing that its validity can be situated only within highly specified cultural contexts. Halbfass sorts out the concept in Indian thought, particularly in its encounter with Western models of experience,50 while Sharf, following Proudfoot and others, traces the conceptualization of experience to the German philosopher Arthur Schleiermacher in the early nineteenth century and shows that personal religious experience was not an issue of doctrinal concern in the textuality of Asian religions until the early twentieth century.51 Thus, when I speak of experience in the ways mentioned above, am I injecting into the personal and cultural networks of possession in South Asia an epistemology that threatens to bury the subject beneath fragile and dissembling layers of modern discourse? Am I reading possession in South Asia as a servant of the overwrought contemporary, peculiarly Western, discourse of experience? With such dangers in mind, Sharf resolves to employ the term “experience” guardedly.

I do not eschew the notion of religious experience to the extent Sharf does, thus I do not feel it is necessary to justify its use by attempting to establish an empirical epistemology of it. Sharf pointedly writes:

I have suggested that it is ill conceived to construe the object of the study of religion to be the inner experience of religious practitioners. Scholars of religion are not presented with experiences that stand in need of interpretation but rather with texts, narratives, performances, and so forth. While these representations may at times assume the rhetorical stance of phenomenological description, we are not obliged to accept them as such.52

I do not contest Sharf’s basic point, that we are dealing with texts, narratives, performances, and so forth. In this volume, we are not encountering possession directly, but approaching it through the side door of academics, which is to say through linguistic examination, textual description and prescription, ethnographic reportage, and text-critical, anthropological, psychological, literary, and historical interpretations. Similarly, I agree with Sharf that we are not obliged to accept at face value the phenomenological descriptions of these texts and narratives; but neither can we reject or neglect them out of hand as a methodological stance, replacing them with secure propositions of our own making. The hermeneutic of suspicion on which rests much of value in our fields must not become a hermeneutic of mandatory, routine rejection. At this point, no scholar will disagree that texts, as well as performances or orally produced descriptions, are representations that at best asymptotically approach facticity or are themselves the only realities that they construct.

As for the rhetorical stance that informs my own material, most classical Indian philosophers and theoreticians agree that smṛti (memory), on which representation is constructed, is inadmissible as pramāṇa (means of proof).53 Perhaps for this reason they, like Sharf, shied away from discussions of personal experience, in the present case of possession by spirits, deities, yogins, or other adepts. But perhaps this is also why they questioned the consensus view of their world, and why they do not appear to have denied the ontological possibility of spirits, deities, and possession. While they rejected the final validity of memory and memory-based representation, they readily admitted observation (pratyakṣa) as a valid means of proof. Thus the stance that classical textuality takes with regard to possession approximates that of performance and oral narrative: What you see is what you get, but you might also get what you do not see.

In virtually all the approaches I consider here—textual, anthropological, psychological, and historical—assertions of the inner and individual nature of the experience of possession are stripped away and “the phenomenon” in question is presented as discursively realizable only through reconstruction of context, whether performative or textual. It is with reference to this interpretive tradition that I feel compelled to contribute my own remarks to the discussion on the nature of the experience of possession. In spite of Sharf’s and Halbfass’s observations that personal inner experience is a notion imported to interpretations of Asian religious phenomena by Western and Western-informed scholars and practitioners,54 I contend that the removal of the role of individual inner experience, or subordinating it to a normative context, is another kind of ill-conceived construction of the object of study.

## The Person and the Self
The notion of a “person” distinguished from a “self” was initially, if vaguely, proposed by Marcel Mauss in his final but seminal essay, “Une catégorie de l’esprit humain: la notion de personne, celle de ‘moi,’” written in 1938.55 Since then, philosophers and anthropologists have inquired further into these categories. This distinction is important in problematizing possession, especially in India, where the oppositions person/self share conceptual territory with the indigenous categories puruṣa/puruṣottama and ātman/brahman, and in early Buddhism with the terms attabhāva (Pali < Skt. ātma-bhāva; individuality) and puggala (Pali < Skt. pudgala; person). Consideration of these terms, especially of the paired opposites puruṣa/puruṣottama and ātman/brahman is advisable for establishing the ground on which possession may be understood in Sanskritic discourse. Only through such consideration will it be possible to comprehend the discursive context, for both scholarly and Indic categories, of the question “What or who is possessed?”

Leaving aside Mauss’s evident evolutionism,56 a summary of his concept will prove useful here. Observes Mauss, given “that there has never existed a human being who has not been aware, not only of his body, but also at the same time of his individuality, both spiritual and physical,”57 a “person” (personne) or sense of situated “I” (moi) is as close to a natural human phenomenon as is reasonably possible. After sketchily reviewing the evidence from two North American native cultures (Zuñi and Kwakiutl), Australian aboriginal culture, classical India (in two brief paragraphs),58 China, and Rome, then early Christianity, he proffers several features of personhood: absorption within one’s clan, name and title, hierarchical rank, rights and obligations, roles and functions, and property. In addition to these local accretions and constructions, a person is also a legal category. Thus it is no surprise to learn that the word “person” (Latin persona) indicates a mask—tragic, ritual, or ancestral. The Latin and Greek persons were also moral ones, with “a sense of being conscious, independent, autonomous, free and responsible.”59 If Mauss is correct and this was the case in Europe, it was less so in India, which had more sharply wrought notions of fate, circumscribing this autonomy and freedom. It was Christianity, asserts Mauss, that conferred personhood on the shell or mask or conditional person and provided the person (personne) with a metaphysical foundation, a rational substantiality, indivisible and individual. Although this view was much more nuanced, and not uncontested, in the history of Christian theology, the general trend was to regard the self as an inner, unchanging, stable, and ultimately detachable core known as the soul, and this is what lay at the center of an integrated if not always balanced wholeness constitutive of personhood. It is here that the situation differs so markedly from that of South Asia, where, as seen below, fluidity, divisibility, and penetrability were features of personhood, where dissociation and fragmentation (sometimes called possession) produced an alienness that at least temporarily overshadowed the familiarity of the person and rendered the self Other, and where a metaphysically conceived “self” was often, though far from always, conceptually sedimented within that person.60

Thus a person is made, not born. This construction is not merely conceptual; it possesses a rarefied corporality or concreteness, the building blocks of which are what McKim Marriott calls “coded substances,” the subtle residue of acculturation.61 These accrete through the materialization and legitimation of any of Mauss’s qualities of personhood, by the performance of a particular action or series of actions, or by any other intentional or interactional process. A brahman, for example, becomes a brahman “person” by virtue of an initiation (upanayana), a rite of passage that complicates his identity and individuality by rendering him twice-born (dvija). Similarly, a śūdra becomes a śūdra person not just through the passive act of birth into a particular family, but through his or her occupation, expectations, low ritual rank, and relation with non-śūdras. Personhood, then, according to various modern Western-derived schools of cultural critique, consists of a collocation of contextual substantialities with a locus on a physically demarcated individual.

Selfhood, by contrast, is more internally realized, a personal objectification of one’s own subjectivity. A recursivity may be seen in the relation of person and self: While personhood is an objectification and representation of selfhood, it nevertheless illumines and engages this selfhood, the definitions and boundaries of which the “person” has set. This, then, sets in motion a reciprocal process of the self producing, engaging, and placing limits on the person. But the person, closer to the world and its vicissitudes than the self, is more easily subjected than the self to shifts and modalities of objectification; indeed, in its engagement with the person, it would be pointless and contradictory to assert that the self objectifies the person, even as it engages it. Thomas Csordas, citing Merleau-Ponty, states the critical view succinctly, a view that is at odds with traditional Indic views: “The person already objectified is a culturally constituted representation of the self. The preobjective self, however, is a culturally constituted mode of being in the world.”62 It is the status of this “preobjective self” that most Indic schools of thought would dispute. Stated in these terms, we might say that the culturally constituted Indic notion of selfhood is of a self that is not culturally constructed; it is of a preobjective self that is free of cultural constructions of the world. In sum, it is helpful in the present study to be aware of how contemporary Western-derived models of cultural critique contend that person and self are culturally constructed and constitute each other, whereas non-Buddhist Indic systems tend to preserve a one-way process of self as prior to person.

In his article “Person,” in Critical Terms for Religious Studies, Charles E. Winquist traces the changes in the concept of the person in Western philosophy as it progressed from philosophies of being to philosophies of consciousness to philosophies of language. “The subject experienced in the transcendental unity of apperception, which is itself an effect of differential series of active formal processes, can then be asserted as the basic meaning of the person in an epistemological construct.”63 In other words, depending on the immediate and ever-shifting coloring of perception conferred by local context, a person is the sum total and unified representation of all autonomic and conceptual systems operating within an individual. This, it appears, is a philosophical iteration of Marriott’s sociological notion of substance-codes: The individual is systemic, with a collocation and hierarchy of autonomic, ethical, perceptual, and conceptual systems. When taken together in a dynamic and shifting unity, they constantly produce usable knowledge. When these factors combine in a uniquely situated and usually culturally validated manner to produce an epistemic shift of sufficient quality, a self may be represented. From the emic perspective, this self is produced within, and is sometimes distinct from, the person. This self, at least as it is expressed in Indic thought in the concept of ātman, is a metaphysical residue of the person that operates in an inherently reflexive manner.64 Through ascribing to it reflexivity, freedom, and autonomy, it is thus constituted as Other, while its counterpart, the person, contains within itself antinomies that, if separated from the whole, constitute a differently conceived otherness, an otherness that does not contribute to selfhood but expresses fragmentation of personhood. Similarly, Marriott’s notion of substance-code expresses these antinomies, as well as juxtapositions, overlaps, and possible fragmentations of the parts of the person.

The distinction I am attempting to forge between person and self in terms of the two sets of Sanskritic categorical oppositions puruṣa/puruṣottama and ātman/brahman can at best be partial and tentative. Given the widely divergent intellectual histories of these English and Sanskrit lexemes, it is foolish to assert exact equivalences. puruṣa literally means “man” or “person,” while puruṣottama is translated as “highest person” and usually refers to Kṛṣṇa. puruṣottama is, in fact, one of the most prominent names for Kṛṣṇa in both the Mahābhārata and the Bhāgavata Purāṇa. puruṣa as “person” is rarely used in the sense of “a free and autonomous self devoid of definable qualities and behavioral environment.” The only place this meaning is preserved is in Sāṃkhya and Yoga philosophy, where the singularity or multiplicity of puruṣa, which Gerald Larson renders in its philosophical sense with the dangerous terms “consciousness” and “contentless consciousness,” has been much debated.65 In most narrative contexts in Sanskrit, puruṣa is assumed to possess forms and qualities. This is exemplified in the person of Kṛṣṇa, the highest person, who contains within himself all forms (rūpa) and attributes (guṇa), the entire spectrum of materiality (prakṛti) as well as universal selfhood, brahman or akṣarabrahman. Personhood in the Indian sense, then, is a manifestation of form, attribute, substance, and materiality.

The opposition puruṣa/puruṣottama may be contrasted with ātman/ brahman in that ātman refers to a certain residue of the person, a “thumb-sized person” (aṅguṣṭhamātrapuruṣaḥ) residing in the heart, according to the Upaniṣads,66 which, though dependent on a body or person, is separate from substance and substantiality. It is free and autonomous, an inseparable microcosmic component of the absolute macrocosmic brahman. More precisely, in its generalized vedic sense, where it underwent considerable semantic development, ātman signified “the center of a personality determining its individuality” or “the substratum underlying the phenomena and functions of life,” in the words of Jan Gonda.67 Conversely, brahman’s microcosm is ātman, the self or identifiable center of personality. It is not puruṣa, a person with many parts and systems but no definitive or consensus ontological center. Furthermore, according to the devotional schools of Indian thought that gained prominence early in the second millennium C.E. and figure significantly in our discussions of possession (cf. Chapter 9 on bhakti), although all puruṣa are engulfed within the puruṣottama, they can never become that puruṣottama. Nor can they ever fully identify themselves as that puruṣottama, as ātman can with brahman.

Buddhist texts, as Steven Collins clarifies in his providentially titled book Selfless Persons, distinguish between “individuality” (attabhāva) and “person” or character type (puggala). While other Indic texts, particularly within the vast medical literature, engage in protracted discussion of personality or character types subsumed within the rhetoric of demonology (see Chapter 12), early Buddhist texts, which preceded the extant medical literature, speak of an attabhāva, a uniquely composed and constantly mutating edifice of khandas (Pali < Skt. skandha) or constituents of personality, and puggala, character types defined by temperament, ethical disposition, spiritual aptitude, and so on. Both attabhāva and puggala are driven by kamma (Pali < Skt. karman), the sum-total of sense-desires, feelings, and perceptions. It is these that produce individuality, the internal sense of self, and character type, the person observed from without. Collins states: “Where attabhāva was more oriented towards expressing, in a suitably impersonal way, the structure of individuals and rebirth as particular forms of existence, puggala is more oriented toward description of those individuals and reborn ‘persons’ as character-types.”68 Both of these are, according to Buddhist doctrine, void of reality; attabhāva, the status, condition, or experience of selfhood is no proof or guarantee of an ontological self. And it is this empty set that serves as the basis for puggalas or observed character types, rendering the latter equally baseless and empty. Given this status, the Buddhist individual becomes inconstant and permeable, capable of penetration, displacement, or permeation by forces, moods, entities, or beings of different but equally empty constitution.69

Because of possession’s complexity—āveśa, praveśa, or any other variety of it—we might say that it directly engages and affects the person, the puruṣa (though no Sanskrit text speaks of it in quite this way) or attabhāva. Possession may in certain cases, for example in initiatory possession described in tantric texts, help illumine a self, but it occurs within and is mediated by complex systemic units that we might call persons or puruṣa. Thus I am careful to keep discussion of possession within the domain of personhood, with the cultural and behavioral environments that these perforce require and refer to emergent selfhood when the context dictates. This is not only because it makes good English sense, but because it makes good Sanskrit and Indic sense.

## NOTES
1. See references in Stanley 1988:7, Jones 1968, and Schoembucher 1993. A small gem of a book (with hardly a single reference to India), which anyone interested in the subject must seriously examine, is Bourguignon 1976; see also Boddy 1994, a global review of secondary literature on possession.
2. “Hinduism” takes on a life of its own when it becomes a concept wielded by a self-interested elite. As Foucault writes about Christianity in his essay “Technologies of the Self,” it “has always been more interested in the history of its beliefs than in the history of its real practices” (Foucault 1988:17). The academicians’ (especially anthropologists’) quest for an “essential culture” is lucidly criticized in Turner and Turner 1998, their controversial book asserting strong, even incontrovertible, evidence for cannibalism among the Anasazi of the American Southwest at the end of the first millennium C.E. It is important to note that though anthropologists were once as guilty as others, e.g., Indologists, of reifying and essentializing culture, anthropologists in particular are now at the forefront of questioning this sort of reification.
3. Humphrey and Laidlaw note, “avowedly atheist academics [still] routinely display deep Protestant prejudices” (1994:57n1). This occurs notably in translations. I understand from William Sax (personal communication, November 1999) that among those who now cast a cold eye on possession are scientists and Hindu nationalists—not surprising in either case, as both trumpet the ultimacy of their respective theologies. I might mention here that one of the problems in dealing with possession in South Asia is that, in spite of the fear and derision cast on it by certain early evangelical Christians (see Chapter 2), it was never the target of colonialist discourse; it was factored out, mostly ignored by nineteenth- and twentieth-century occidentalizing narratives of Hinduism. Thus it was not manipulated, constructed, or reconstructed as part of a colonizing project or a nationalizing discourse. The sub rosa quality of possession, sub rosa perhaps because of the fluidity of the South Asian person, to which the South Asian and the occidental were blind for very different reasons, rendered it unaccountable for either colonizing or nationalizing.
4. Carstairs (1957) observed a pronounced repugnance toward devotional religion and the singing of religious hymns among high-status brahmans, Rajputs, and Jains of Rajasthan. Among academics, however, especially anthropologists, the study of emotion has gained legitimacy in the past three decades; cf. Lynch 1990 and Marks and Ames 1995.
5. This is beginning to change in certain quarters. For example, the town of Mehndipur in eastern Rajasthan hosts a temple to Hanumān, called Bālājī, as well as several other facilities well known for exorcisms and other treatments for psychological disorders; cf. Kakar 1982:53–88; and the recent work of Dwyer, esp. 2003; see also Chapter 4, n. 16. Most of the clientele at Bālājī are from first-generation literate families, thus with strong memories of the lifeways of oral cultures, many of whom come from great distances (relevant here is the work of Luria, cited in Ong 1982). For information above and beyond that presented by Kakar and Dwyer on the possession and temples at Mehndipur, I am indebted to Antti Pakaslahti, who has been conducting fieldwork for many years on the processes of psychological healing that occur there.
6. Ong 1982 develops this as a major theme.
7. Dumont 1970:57. Although Dumont often criticizes his great predecessor, Max Weber, here they agree. In 1917 Weber remarked of brahmans “that orgiastic and emotional-ecstatic elements of the ancient magic rites were not taken over and for long periods either completely atrophied and were tolerated [only] as unofficial folk magic” (1970:345). Cf. Weber 1917 [1970] and 1958:137, cited in Gellner 2001:34. Weber continued: “The status pride of cultured men resisted undignified demands of ecstatic therapeutic practices and the exhibition of neuropathic states … [but] could take quite a different stand toward the forms of apathetic ecstasy … and all ascetic practices capable of rationalization” (1958:149, cited in Gellner 2001:35).
8. I do not feel it is necessary here to problematize the term “religion” or “religious” by replacing it wholesale with “way of life” or any similar phrase, as Ronald Inden and some of his students have done. “Religion” remains an adequate term around which supplementary concepts such as belief, creed, practice, ritual, liturgy, and institution may be organized. See Inden, Walters, and Ali 2000, esp. pp. 23ff.

13. This tendency was noted as early as the Atharvaveda; cf. Heesterman 1962. The major exception to this is in bhakti, which, as noted in Chapter 9, does not easily fit the paradigm. The conflict between precept and practice is a major concern of Bell 1992.

15. Trautmann (1997:23ff.) reminds us that not all orientalist scholars of the earlier periods should be branded as “orientalist” in its current pejorative sense.
16. Considerable attention has been paid in recent years to the “construction” of the ancient and classical “East” by the West. Among the more noteworthy studies are Inden 1990, Trautmann 1997, Bishop 1989.
17. Kosambi and Gokhale 1957:xlvi.
18. That this is true can hardly be doubted, though it is equally true that Kosambi oversimplifies matters. Many of Kosambi’s ideas and historical conclusions are dated.

20. Lariviere 1995. He proposes three categories of scholarly Other: “orientalist critics,” with Edward Said as its exemplar; “essentialist critics,” typified by Ronald Inden; and “distortionist critics,” including Sheldon Pollock and other postcolonial and postmodern theorists. Lariviere’s terms should, of course, be understood as “critics of orientalism,” “critics of essentialism,” and “critics of distortionism.” Said attained his status as exemplar through his well-known (and often-criticized) work Orientalism (1978); Inden through his thought-provoking (but increasingly criticized) work Imagining India (1990); and Pollock through his brilliant (and controversial) article “Deep Orientalism? Notes on Sanskrit and Power Beyond the Raj” (1993a). Lariviere might peg Kosambi as a prescient postcolonialist, though it is likely that Kosambi would have enjoyed the label.
21. Indeed, the evidence he provides in his article, preliminary though it admittedly is, has less to do with reconstructing the history of India’s underclasses through the construction of critical editions than with a careful reading of well-known Sanskrit texts. For other acknowledgments and discussions of the dissonance between text and the practice of daily life, see Bailey 1995; Salomon 1989.
22. The most ambitious critical editions undertaken thus far (and it is difficult to imagine more ambitious projects) are the Poona Mahābhārata (MBh) and the Baroda Rāmāyaṇa. It is difficult to say that the editions of these texts in their critical incarnations contribute more to our knowledge of the underclasses than does any single manuscript or regional rescension of these texts. One test of Lariviere’s theory would be for a brave, preferably retired, Indologist with an enormous amount of time to spare to examine the entire critical edition of the MBh with all the text-critical notes and appendices of excised passages, thus determining which manuscripts or rescensions contribute most in this area. Perhaps it would be better to sensitively examine texts on śūdradharma. An excellent beginning to this has been made by Vajpeyi 2004, a foray into the “philology of oppression” (I am grateful to her for this felicitous phrase).
23. Gombrich 1988:36–37; see the quotations from Weber in n. 7. Gombrich extends this view to the more general field of emotion: “my guess is that the apparent dearth of emotion in early Indian religion is due to its being censored out by the intelligentsia, both brahman and heterodox, just as they censored out the widespread practice of possession” (p. 170). I am in essential agreement with Gombrich, though I see more evidence of emotion in early Indian religion than Gombrich does; see Smith 1998b.
    It must be noted, however, that control is a major issue in all possession, brahmanical and non-brahmanical. See Wadley 1976 for an account of dank, a ritual of snake possession on the fifth day of the bright half of the month of Śravaṇ (nāg pañcamī), Wadley states, “Control is necessary at all times … there is control for causing possession, cessation of possession, and control during the rite itself. At no point is there lack of control” (p. 247). Gellner essentially supports Gombrich and states, “Lack of control is evident in spirit possession. Thus one can see how both women and low castes are associated with spirit possession, and why high-caste males should shun it, except in closely defined esoteric contexts. This secret possession by the tantric gods of Buddhism and Hinduism is part of tantric initiation in both religions” (2001:42).
24. On the bhūta cults of South Kanara District, see Prabhu 1977. For a more theoretical treatment, see Brückner 1987, 1995. I am also grateful to Edwin Gerow, who informed me of his own observations in Karnataka. For another important study of possession among brahman women, see Harper 1963.

28. For Tibet and Nepal, see, for example, Mumford 1989. For Thailand see Morris 2000. Both Mumford and Morris observe a conflict of interests. On the one hand, both lay Buddhists and priests condemn shamanistic practice, including varieties of possession, perhaps a relic of clashes long past. On the other hand, they furtively—though sometimes openly—attend these same ceremonies. Thus it comes as no surprise that Morris observes: “For many Buddhist men, mediumship still has the rank odor of the feminine and emanates the aura of a not-yet-recuperated primitiveness” (p. 85), recapitulating a stereotype that has persisted for millennia. Nevertheless, in later—though by no means recent—forms of Buddhism there was a reaction against this. See, for example, Faure 1998:100–104. He refers to eccentrics in Chan Buddhism who “seem to represent the nostalgia of a lost spontaneity” (p. 102). These eccentrics were initially regarded as subversive and dangerous, but after they became culturally fashionable they lost their subversive edge. This transgressiveness revealed a deep-seated ambivalence, which served “to legitimize the norm that it transgresse[d], like an exception confirming the rule” (p. 104). This masculine construction of the weakness of women was expressed as penetrability, no doubt sexual in origin, which Morris sees in “the ethnography of Buddhist gender ideology … as softness or pliability. Thus women are deemed within dominant ideology to be soft-souled or malleable as well as volatile.… For this reason, they are said to be particularly unsuited to the ascetic traditions of Buddhist meditation and particularly likely vehicles for spirits” (pp. 124–25).

34. This problem has arisen for other scholars as well. See, for example, Shulman 2002, who rightly labels the term possession “problematic” (p. 145) and admits to using it “with some trepidation” (p. 133).
35. See Csordas 1994:222ff., 252ff., for discussions on the criteria for spontaneity and control in American Charismatic Catholic trance healing. Spontaneity lies outside the accepted boundaries of intentionality.
36. Ong 1982:105. The literature on orality has advanced considerably in recent years; cf. Falk 1990 and Lopez 1995a, both of which are concerned more with the dynamics of orality and scripture than with the dynamics of culture.
37. See the incisive comments of Morris (2000) on remembering, forgetting, and literacy,

See Hufford 1977, indicating an incomplete hypostatization of oral exegesis into the ideologies of literacy; Davidson 2002, on the influence of nonliterate people on Mahāyāna Buddhism; and Campany 1996, esp. ch. 1. Campany writes: “As scholars including Walter Ong, Jack Goody, Michel de Certeau, and Jacques Derrida have shown, writing lends itself to ‘fixing’ objects of discourse by creating a uniform field of textual space and time in which they assume a definite place” (p. 16). Countering this, however, is a “nostalgia for the oral [which] is often part of a larger protest against the sort of locative cosmography for which writing had served as a medium” (ibid.). Although this nostalgia is largely unconscious, it helps explain why possession could not be effectively suppressed among the literate in classical India.

43. Fuller 1992:231.
44. I explore the vocabulary and senses of possession in both their “microstructures” and “macrostructures,” as elucidated by Gonda 1962: “There are ‘microstructures’: ‘meanings’ which are complex, consisting of semantic aspects, grouped round a ‘kernel’; there are also ‘macrostructures’ or ‘fields’ composed of groups of words which are in some way or other—morphologically, notionally, etc.—more closely associated” (p. 245); also Gonda 1970a:177–178.
45. I cannot treat this fully this here, so it must be reserved for a future article. But see, e.g., BhP 4.7.26, cinmātram; 5.12.11, jñānaṃ viśuddham; 5.19.4, viśuddhānubhavamātram; 8.18.12, avyaktacit; 10.51.57, jñaptimātram.
46. Were I to struggle for a definition of consciousness in the present context, I would begin by revisiting the discussion of over a century ago by William James in Varieties of Religious Experience (1958:140–156), in which he considers it an open-ended, responsive, and adaptive mental activity.
47. The philosophical analysis of consciousness is problematized differently in the fields of neurophysiology and cognitive science. The questions raised by neurobiologists ultimately involve behavioral and cognitive function. But, asks David Chalmers, a cognitive scientist, why is it necessary for these functions to be accompanied by conscious experience? This question remains unanswered, but the issues it raises are now being addressed by physicists, neuropsychologists, geneticists, information theorists, and an array of metaphysicians. Chalmers (1997) sees an explanatory gap between physical processes and consciousness, which, he posits, may be negated (if not closed) by considering consciousness as an independent, irreducible, fundamental property in a final “theory of everything.” As such, awareness would be defined as physical and objective, while its psychophysical counterpart, consciousness, would not. See also Black, Flanagan, and Güzeldere 1996.
    I should acknowledge that “states of consciousness” have different constructions in the contexts of South Asian philosophical and religious textuality: deep sleep, dream, waking, or, in the Upaniṣads and elsewhere, turīya, a fourth transcendent state. It has also been construed as a momentary finite unit connected by time or innate tendency. Elsewhere it has been regarded as identical with thought, with the thinking I; as the central product of embodiment; as an event connected with embodiment but not necessarily limited to it, and so on. Much modern anthropological and philosophical reflection on the term draws on Merleau-Ponty’s now rather quaint view (1962) that consciousness derives from embodiment. As noted in the previous paragraph, the questions asked today are nuanced differently.
48. Taylor 1998a.
49. Winquist states, in partial introduction to his article in that volume on the concept of person: “It is a commonplace in scholarship to recognize that words, ideas, or concepts are embedded in historical and cultural settings and cannot be isolated or abstracted without being misplaced, or translated without accounting for the transformation of or the difference in the cultural milieu into which the word is rendered or onto which it is inscribed” (1998:225).

54. Sharf writes elsewhere: “The notion that the term ‘experience’ is self-evident betrays a set of specifically Cartesian assumptions, according to which experience is held to be immediately present to consciousness. It would appear that the phenomenological transparency of consciousness—what Richard Rorty has called the ‘glassy essence’ or ‘mirror of nature’ picture of mind (Rorty 1979)—is reproduced in the conceptual transparency of the category ‘experience,’ obviating the need for definitional precision or critical analysis” (1995:229).

Less Indological, but more anthropologically informed, is Carrithers (1985:234–256).

57. Translation of Mauss 1938 by W. D. Hall in Carrithers et al. 1985. This deceptively simple statement may be used to counter in part the tired (and tiresome) idea, caricatured from Dumont, that Indians have little or no independent self-identity, only a corporate or systemic reflexivity.
58. Sanderson comments on Mauss: “What is striking in his cursory treatment is not so much his evolutionism as the inadequacy of his evidence and his lack of sociological and historical perspective” (1985:190).
59. Mauss 1938:18.
60. See Shulman 1994:26f. I address Shulman’s views more fully in dealing with the Mahābhārata in Chapter 6.
61. This is explored more extensively below; cf. Marriott 1976.

68. Collins 1982:160, 172, for mention of an ‘inner soul” (abbhantare jīva), used conventionally, in the Milinda Pañha.
69. The texts Collins exploited were the Visuddhimagga, Dīgha Nikāya, Nettipakaraâa, Anguttara Nikāya, Saṃyutta Nikāya, Paramattha-joṭikā, and the Katthāvatthu. The latter is discussed in Cousins 1994, which relates Vasubandhu’s representation of the Vātsīputrīyas, a remnant sect of early Buddhism that maintained a certain pudgalavāda view based on the coalescence of the aggregates or skandhas. See also the references cited in ibid.:28n6.
    In Jainism, poggala is an ontological category that denotes particles of matter or basic constituents of nature. These can be aggregated, recombined, and transformed to yield substances (davya < Skt. dravya) that may serve as a locus for a jīva. But they do not in themselves bear the weight of a person or personality. Cf. Deleu 1970:145, 183f., passim.
