1. The nearest attempt so far has been in the collection of articles edited by Assayag and Tarabout (1999). As good as this collection is, it lacks a general historical context and the syncretism that only a single-authored study can provide. The same is true for possession studies elsewhere in the world. For Africa, see Behrend and Luig 1999; for Indonesia and Oceania see Mageo and Howard 1996.
2. Both films were released in 2005. Emily Rose was directed by Scott Derrickson, Paheli by Amol Palekar. See Philip Lutgendorfâ€™s discussion of Paheli at www.uiowa.edu/~incinema/Paheli.htm.
