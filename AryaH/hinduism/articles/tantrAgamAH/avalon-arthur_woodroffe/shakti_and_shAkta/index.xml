      <description>CHAPTER ONE. INDIAN RELIGION AS BHARATA DHARMA
A FRIEND of mine who read the first edition of this book suggested that I should add to it an opening Chapter, stating the most general and fundamental principles of the subject as a guide to the understanding of what follows, together with an outline of the latter in which the relation of the several parts should be shown. I have not at present the time, nor in the present book the space, to give effect to my friend’s wishes in the way I would have desired, but will not altogether neglect them.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWO. SHAKTI: THE WORLD AS POWER
There is no word of wider content in any language than this Sanskrit term meaning‘Power’. For Shakti in the highest causal sense is God as Mother, and in another sense it is the universe which issues from Her Womb. And what is there which is neither one nor the other? Therefore, theYoginihridaya Tantra thus salutes Her who conceives, bears, produces and thereafter nourishes all worlds:“Obeisance be to Her who is pure Being-Consciousness-Bliss, as Power, who exists in the form of Time and Space and all that is therein, and who is the radiant Illuminatrix in all beings.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER THREE. WHAT ARE THE TANTRAS AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE?
A VERY common expression in English writings is“The Tantra”; but its use is often due to a misconception and leads to others. For what does Tantra mean? The word denotes injunction (Vidhi), regulation (Niyama), Shastra generally or treatise.Thus,Shamkara calls the Samkhya a Tantra. A secular writing may be called Tantra. For the followingnote,I am indebted to Professor SurendranathdasGupta.“The word‘Tantra’has been derived in the Kashika-Vritti (7-2-9) from the root‘Tan’‘to spread’by the Aunadika rule Sarvadhatubhyah tran, with the addition of the suffix‘tran’.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER FOUR. TANTRA SHASTRA AND VEDA
In writing this Chapter I have in mind the dispute which some have raised upon the question whether the Agamas, or some of them, are Vaidik or non-Vaidik.
I do not here deal with the nature and schools of Tantra or Agama nor with their historical origin. Something has been said on these points in the Introductions to the English translations of Pandit Shiva Chandra Vidyarnava’s Tantra-tattva.</description>

(What follows this bracket is a translation, done in literal fashion, from the German, of an article by the learned Sanskritist, Professor Winternitz, entitled“Die Tantras und die Religion der Saktas”published in the Berlin monthly, the Ostasiatische Zeitschrift, 1916, Heft. 3. The article does not show a complete comprehension of its subject-matter, nor was this to be expected. In European fashion Sadhaka is translated“Magician”and Sadhana is thought of as“magical evocation”and Mahayogini as“Great Magician”.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER SIX. SHAKTI AND SHAKTA
Shakti who is in Herself pure blissful Consciousness (Cidrupini) is also the Mother of Nature and is Nature itself born of the creative play of Her thought. The Shakta faith, or worship of Shakti, is I believe, in some of its essential features one of the oldest and most wide-spread religions in the world. Though very ancient, it is yet, in its essentials, and in the developed form in which we know it to-day, harmonious with some of the teachings of modern philosophy and science; not that this is necessarily a test of its truth.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER SEVEN. IS SHAKTI FORCE?
There are some persons who have thought, and still think, that Shakti means force and that the worship of Shakti is the worship of force.Thus,Keshub Chunder Sen (New Dispensation, p. 108), wrote:
Four centuries ago the Shaktas gave way before the Bhaktas. Chaitanya’s army proved invincible, and carried all Bengal captive. Even to-day his gospel of love rules as a living force, though his followers have considerably declined both in faith and in morals.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER EIGHT. CINACARA (VASHISHTHA AND BUDDHA)
It has been the subject of debate whether the Tantrik Pañcatattva ritual with wine and so forth is a product of Buddhism, and whether it is opposed to Vaidika Dharma. Some have supposed that these rites originally came from yellow Asia, penetrated into India where they received its impress, and again made their way to the north to encounter earlier original forms. I have elsewhere put forward some facts which suggest that these rites may be a continuance, though in another form, of ancient Vaidik usage in which Soma, Meat, Fish and Purodasa formed a part.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER NINE. THE TANTRA SHASTRAS IN CHINA
Adopting for the purpose of this essay, and without discussion as to their accuracy, the general views of Orientalists on chronology and the development of the Buddhistic schools, the history of the Buddhistic Tantra is shortly as follows. The Mahayana (which commenced no one knows exactly when) was represented in the first and second centuries by the great names of Ashvaghosha and Nagarjuna. Its great scripture is the Prajñaparamita.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TEN. A TIBETAN TANTRA
[This Chapter is an admirably understanding review (reprinted from The Theosophist of July 1919) by Mr. Johan Van Manen, the Tibetan scholar. It was written on the seventh volume of Tantrik Texts which contains the first Tibetan Tantra to be published. The Tantra which was selected for the series was the Shricakra-Sambhara, because the Editor happened to have manuscripts of this and other works of the same school.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER ELEVEN. SHAKTI IN TAOISM
The belief in Shakti or the Divine Power as distinguished from the Divine Essence (Svarupa), the former being generally imagined for purposes of worship as being in female form, is very ancient. The concept of Shakti in Chinese Taoism is not merely a proof of this (for the Shakti notion is much older) but is an indication of the ancient Indian character of the doctrine. There are some who erroneously think, the concept had its origin in“Sivaic mysticism,”having its origin somewhere in the sixth century of our era.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWELVE. ALLEGED CONFLICT OF SHASTRAS
A NOT uncommon modern criticism upon the Indian Shastras is that they mutually conflict. This is due to a lack of knowledge of the doctrine of Adhikara and Bhumika, particularly amongst Western critics, whose general outlook and mode of thought is ordinarily deeply divergent from that which has prevailed in India. The idea that the whole world should follow one path is regarded by the Hindus as absurd, being contrary to Nature and its laws.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER THIRTEEN. SARVANANDANATHA
The Sarvollasa, a copy of which came into my possession some three years ago, is a rare MS. It is a Samgraha by the Sarvavidyasiddha Sarvanandanatha who, though celebrated amongst the Bengal followers of the Agama, is I should think, almost unknown to the general public. There is a life in Sanskrit of Sarvanandanatha entitled Sarvanandataramgini by his son Shivanatha in which an account of the attainment of his Siddhi is given and I am indebted in respect of this article to a short unpublished memoir by Sj.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER FOURTEEN. CIT-SHAKTI (THE CONSCIOUSNESS ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE)
Cit-Shakti is Cit, as Shakti, that is as Power, or that aspect of Cit in which it is, through its associated Maya-Shakti, operative to create the universe. It is a commonly accepted doctrine that the ultimate Reality is Samvid, Caitanya or Cit.
But what is Cit? There is no word in the English language which adequately describes it. It is not mind: for mind is a limited instrument through which Cit is manifested.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER FIFTEEN. MAYA-SHAKTI (THE PSYCHO-PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE)
Spirit, Mind and Matter are ultimately one, the two latter being the twin aspects of the Fundamental Substance or Brahman and Its Power or Shakti. Spirit is the substance of mind-matter, the Reality (in the sense of the lasting changelessness) out of which, by Its Power, all Appearance is fashioned not by the individual mind and senses but by the cosmic mind and senses of which they are but a part.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER SIXTEEN. MATTER AND CONSCIOUSNESS
The subject of my lecture today is Consciousness or Cit, and Matter or Unconsciousness, that is, Acit; the unchanging formlessness and the changing forms. According to Shakta Advaitavada, man is Consciousness-Unconsciousness or Cit-Acit; being Cit-Shakti as regards his Antaratma, and the particularized Maya-Shakti as to his material vehicles of mind and body. The reason that I have selected this subject, amongst the many others on which I might have addressed you, is that these two ideas are the key concepts of Indian Philosophy and religion.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN. SHAKTI AND MAYA
In the Eighth Chapter of the unpublished Sammohana Tantra, it is said that Shamkara manifested on earth in the form of Shamkaracarya, in order to root out Buddhism from India. It compares his disciples and himself to the five Mahapreta (who form the couch on which the Mother of the Worlds rests), and identifies his maths with the Amnayas, namely, the Govardhana in Puri with Purvamnaya (the Sampradaya being Bhogavara), and so on with the rest.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN. SHAKTA ADVAITAVADA
I have often been asked-In what consists the difference between Vedanta and‘Tantra’. This question is the product of substantial error, for it assumes that Tantra Shastra is not based on Vedanta. I hope that, after many years of work, I have now made it clear that the Tantra Shastra or Agama (whatever be its ultimate origin as to which little is known by anybody) is now, and has been for centuries past, one of the recognized Scriptures of Hinduism, and every form of Hinduism is based on Veda and Vedanta.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER NINETEEN. CREATION AS EXPLAINED IN THE NON-DUALIST TANTRAS
A Psychological analysis of our worldly experience ordinarily gives us both the feeling of persistence and change. This personal experience expresses a cosmic truth. An examination of any doctrine of creation similarly reveals two fundamental concepts, those of Being and Becoming, Changelessness and Change, the One and the Many. In Sanskrit, they are called the Kutastha and Bhava or Bhavana. The first is the Spirit or Purusha or Brahman and Atman which is unlimited Being (Sat), Consciousness (Cit) and Bliss (Ananda).</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWENTY. THE INDIAN MAGNA MATER
Introductory
On the last occasion that I had the honor to address you, I dealt with the subject of the psychology of Hindu religious ritual from the particular standpoint of the religious community called Shaktas, or Worshippers of the Supreme Mother. To-day I speak of the Supreme Mother Herself as conceived and worshipped by them.
The worship of the Great Mother as the Grand Multiplier is one of the oldest in the world.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE. HINDU RITUAL
It is well said that Ritual is the Art of Religion. As practiced by the Hindus, it is not rightly judged, because the religious and philosophical doctrines of which it is a practical expression and method are either unknown or misunderstood. If we add to incapacity, a temperament hostile to all Ritualism, the resultant criticism is “mummery,” “idolatry,” “gibberish,” and so forth. It is true that Ritual is meaningless to those who do not know its meaning; just as a telegram sent in cipher is without sense to those who are ignorant of the code according to which it is written.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO. VEDANTA AND TANTRA SHASTRA
When your representative asked me to speak this evening, he suggested to me as my subject, that Shastra which is a practical application of the Vedantic teaching. Mere talk about Vedanta is nothing but a high form of amusement. If more than this is to be achieved, definite Sadhana is necessary. In the grand opening chapter of the Kularnava Tantra it is said: “In this world are countless masses of beings suffering all manner of pain.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE. THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HINDU RELIGIOUS RITUAL
The word “religious” in the title of this lecture has been inserted in order to exclude magical ritual, with which I do not deal, though I have a word or two to say on the subject.
As regards the word “Hindu,” it must be remembered that there is considerable variety of doctrine and ritual, for there are a number of communities of Indian worshippers.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR. SHAKTI AS MANTRA (MANTRAMAYI SHAKTI)
This is in every way both a most important, as well as a most difficult, subject in the Tantra Shastra; so, difficult that it is not understood, and on this account, has been ridiculed. Mantra, in the words of a distinguished Indian, has been called “meaningless jabber”. When we find Indians thus talking of their Shastra, it is not surprising that Europeans should take it to be of no account.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE. VARNAMALA (THE GARLAND OF LETTERS)
The world has never altogether been without the Wisdom, nor its Teachers. The degree and manner in which it has been imparted have, however, necessarily varied according to the capacities of men to receive it. Soalso,have the symbols by which it has been conveyed. These symbols further have varying significance according to the spiritual advancement of the worshipper. This question of degree and variety of presentation have led to the superficial view that the difference in beliefs negatives existence of any commonly established Truth.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX. SHAKTA SADHANA (THE ORDINARY RITUAL)
Sadhana is that, which produces Siddhi or the result sought, be it material or spiritual advancement. It is the means or practice by which the desired end may be attained and consists in the training and exercise of the body and psychic faculties, upon the gradual perfection of which Siddhi follows. The nature or degree of spiritual Siddhi depends upon the progress made towards the realization of the Atma whose veiling vesture the body is.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN. THE PAÑCATATTVA (THE SECRET RITUAL)
The notoriety of the Shakta Pañcatattva ritual with wine and women has thrown into the shade not only the practical topics with which I have dealt, but every other, including the valuable philosophical presentment of Vedanta contained in the Shakta Tantra. Notwithstanding, and indeed because, of the off-hand and (in certain respects) ignorant condemnation which this ritual has received, the interests of both scholarship and fairness (which by the way should be identical) require, that we should first ascertain the facts, think clearly and fearlessly, and then determine without prejudice.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT. MATAM RUTRA (THE RIGHT AND WRONG INTERPRETATION)
In connection with the doctrine and Sadhana just described it is apposite to cite the following legend from Tibet, which shows how, according to its Sadhakas, it may be either rightly or wrongly interpreted, and how, in the latter case, it leads to terrible evils and their punishment.
Guru Padma-sambhava, the so-called founder of“Lamaism,”had five women disciples who compiled several accounts of the teachings of their Master and hid them in various places for the benefit of future believers.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE. KUNDALINI SHAKTA (YOGA)
The word“Yoga”comes from the root “yuj” which means“to join”and, in its spiritual sense, it is that process by which the human spirit is brought into near and conscious communion with, or is merged in, the Divine Spirit, according as the nature of the human spirit is held to be separate from (Dvaita, Vishishtadvaita) or one with (Advaita) the Divine Spirit. As, according to Shakta doctrine, with which alone we are concerned, the latter proposition is affirmed, Yoga is that process by which the identity of the two (Jivatma and Paramatma), which identity ever in fact exists, is realized by the Yogi or practitioner of Yoga.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER THIRTY. CONCLUSIONS
Brahmanism or Hinduism, as in its later development the former has been called, is not merely a religion. It is a Socio-Economic System, the foundation of which is the Law of Caste and Stages of life. That System has its culture of which several forms of Religion, resting on a certain common basis, are but a part. Dealing, however, with Brahmanism in its religious aspect, we may say that it, together with Jainism and Buddhism, are the three chief religions of India, as opposed to those of the Semitic origin.</description>
