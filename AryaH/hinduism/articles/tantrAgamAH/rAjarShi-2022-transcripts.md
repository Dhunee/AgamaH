Rajarshi Nandy Sir, welcome back to TRS -for what I would like... -Thank you. To believe is a sequel episode
3:01
of the extremely powerful episode that we created the last time. It was electric.
3:07
That's how I’ll describe the last one. How do you look back upon that one? Oh, it was wonderful. Wonderful.
3:15
This is a recurring theme on the show you know that, honestly, the show gets some amount of criticism for that.
3:21
We talk about ghosts, higher beings, divine beings, aliens, angels.
3:27
But my take on that is human culture is about 3-lakh years old, possibly older than that.
3:34
Things like these have been spoken about for millennia. We're just trying to revisit
3:40
those conversations. This is not to prove to people -that ghost exists. -You are right. Or don't exist. But where do you actually begin
3:47
this conversation from a tantric perspective? Let's just try getting a deeper understanding of it.
3:52
-So where would you like to begin, sir? -Right. So, the first-- The way I look at it
3:58
and the way traditional tantra shastra and tantra upasana looks at it is that just like...
4:04
There are millions of people, I don't know, 6-7 billion people in the world right now.
4:09
So, this is the physical plane we are existing in. This is the earth, is the physical plane.
4:15
Beyond that, there are stacked layers and layers of reality. There are subtle planes going up to the realm of the Gods.
4:20
And then beyond, the devatas, etc. All the realms are there. So, in those realms, also,
4:26
there are many types of beings. And because there are innumerable beings,
4:32
just like innumerable human beings, some of them are very high-caliber spiritual beings. Some of them are average beings.
4:38
Some of them may be not spiritual at all. Some of them may be of the kinds who are to us they appear negative
4:45
in their behavior, in their mannerisms, etc. So, it is a fact.
4:51
There's no question about-- If you ask me that, do they exist? It's like asking me, does gravity exist? It exists.
4:57
What you do with it, that knowledge or not. The other thing is that I believe that denial is also not a good idea.
5:03
That okay. I don't believe in it. No. In fact, I remember once during a conversation with a friend,
5:09
I was telling that it's far easier to experience one of these entities than to experience a deity.
5:14
And again, you'll have to do a recap on what deity means. So, deity is basically a divine being,
5:21
a God whom we worship as one of the great gods in Hinduism, who is capable of acting as a personal--
5:28
As a figure of personal reverence for a upasaka, as well as each of these gods
5:33
are capable of manifesting the full domain of-- full range of spiritual abilities
5:40
what is there, till the highest. They can become transcendental. They can also come down into the form of a murti,
5:45
and we worship them. It's their benevolence towards the human race, towards us, our culture,
5:50
and the whole of Dharma is basically how do we interact with these gods. Okay, so that's what.
5:57
Hinduism describes the being, as having three parts. A sthula sharira. -A sukshma sharira and a-- -Karan sharira.
6:03
Karan sharira. So that's basically your physical body. Your astral body. -And your causal body. -Yes.
6:09
What we know of each other and of regular life is that we see
6:16
each other's physical bodies. I would like you to explain, according to Tantra,
6:21
what an astral body and a causal body is, because it's a great entry point into this world of higher beings.
6:27
Right so... So, we exist in the physical body,
6:33
but our astral bodies are also active at any given point. Active means, it’s still--
6:39
We are functioning both through the astral body as well as the physical body. Like in the movie Doctor Strange,
6:44
they show him getting out of his body. That would be a version of astral body. So, getting out is one--
6:50
When you are taking the astral body out of your physical. But I am saying that even now, at this very moment
6:55
when you are interacting with the world, your astral body is also interacting. Why? That's because very simply, to understand,
7:02
the physical body governs your physical existence. So astral body contains...
7:09
To bring it down to the basic ideas. So, your emotional life, what you are, you're emotionally,
7:16
you feel happy, you feel sad, somebody you like, you dislike all that processing is done in your astral body.
7:21
Your physical body does not do that. I also once read that the astral body is responsible for illness as well.
7:28
If something's going wrong in the astral body, then it manifests as illness in the physical body. Yes. And so illness can manifest
7:35
In physical also and astral also. -But yes. -Okay. Astral also. Definitely. So very often, in fact, illnesses...
7:42
There is some manifestation in the astral. First it'll come and then it'll come to the physical. I think, can you dive a little bit deeper
7:47
into the word astral in the first place, sir? Yeah. So astral loosely, what the astral,
7:54
I think the West understands by the term astral is something more than the physical plane,
8:00
something above the physical plane, something more subtle than the physical. The only difference between that world and this world
8:06
is we use the Sanskrit term sukshma. Sukshma means subtle. It's more subtle. Ours is gross. We have a physical body there.
8:12
So, in the astral world, you do not have this physical body, but you have an image of the physical body.
8:18
Like, the image would look -just like our face. -Almost same. And the tendencies that you have,
8:23
you like something, maybe you like this kind of food, this kind of clothes, this kind of conversations, this people, etc. The likes, dislikes.
8:30
All that's also very much there in the astral. What is the difference? The difference is, there's no physical presence.
8:37
There's no sthula sharira. Sthula means physical. Gross body is not there. Your gross body, arms and legs are not there.
8:43
-Okay. -Okay? So that allows you certain things. If you are able to control the astral body,
8:49
you can move around in that. You can see beings in that. But yeah, all types of entities are there.
8:54
Good, bad, everything is there. And it's large part of the various, what we call,
8:59
in all religions for that matter, beings whether they are a slightly higher beings,
9:04
or slightly lower beings, etc. It's all things that are there in the astral plane. I think in Islam there's Jinns.
9:10
-Yeah. -And in Christianity, there are aspects of Satan, like demons,
9:15
Yeah, demons and all things like that. Those are there.
9:21
So, the astral is also a wide term for-- There are subtle layers inside the astral also. It's not about one uniform thing.
9:28
Because obviously, a slightly higher kind of entity. For example,
9:33
let's come to our terms that we use in our scriptures. So, say a being which is like a Gandharva.
9:39
Gandharva is one of those beings who remain in those astral, higher astral realms,
9:45
who are excellent repositories of knowledge, Any topic. And they're very good singers also.
9:51
Okay, tremendous. Then there is something known as Kinnars Kinnars are fascinating dancers. They're the best of the dancers.
9:57
And once in a while, in fact, one of those beings, when they incarnate on earth, they'll end up being absolutely stunningly powerful
10:04
in that domain. -They’ll be-- -We'll come back to this. Because these are other topics, sir. -Yeah. -I still just want to dive
10:10
a little bit deeper -into this constitution of the body. -So, this constitution of the body, so basically there is this sthula sharira,
10:16
which is this, integrated with it. For most people, it's integrated is your emotional body.
10:21
Look at it that way. Emotional body is your portal to the astral world. Whatever emotions you feel, good, bad, etc.
10:27
How you develop that, a lot of upasana, sadhana, when you're doing worship of a deity, you're trying to develop
10:33
the emotional body. So that it becomes more steady. It has the capacity to take the energy of the deity.
10:39
So this is what the astral realm is and it contains, astral realm contains in the outside world
10:47
higher beings and lower beings also what we call bhoota, pret and pisach, things like that. Negative entities and all that.
10:53
They also inhabit the astral worlds. These things. In a way, if I kind of dumb things down
11:01
into a statement, the whole idea of heaven and hell, naraka and swarga that we have
11:06
is all in the astral domain. Everything. The higher realms of astral or lower realms of astral. And it's just like the world.
11:12
There are, as I said, 7 billion, 6 billion people are there. So, innumerable entities. They are of all kinds.
11:18
Some benevolent, some malevolent. Some indifferent to you. Just like that, it’s just like the world. And you follow the same cautions,
11:24
if you go out on the road, you follow the cautions of, when you meet an ordinary person or an average outsider. Same cautions you will have to follow
11:30
perhaps more than that if you were to traverse into these zones. Like possibly going out at night -is more dangerous-- -Yeah, yeah.
11:36
-Than going out in the day. -Yeah. Those times. So, there are certain zones you would be careful of entering. And secondly, there are many things
11:45
involved actually on this, but this is a domain you will have to pass through. You cannot bypass the astral, by the way.
11:52
So, when you're trying to make a spiritual progress, what you're doing is, your own energy, innate energy.
11:57
We have a term for it. We call it Chit Shakti. It's a technical term that's used, Chit Shakti,
12:03
which is the flip side of what is more popularly known as Kundalini.
12:09
So basically, when your Kundalini is awakened through some practice, it is trying to pass through the realms.
12:15
It's basically passing from the material realm, Which is the gross world, into the astral realms,
12:20
one after the other, one after the other. It's going to cross. You'll have to explain what Kundalini is. So Kundalini is basically a hidden divine,
12:27
very simply put, a divine energy that is there to a degree in every individual who is born.
12:33
But for 99.99% of people, it remains in a sleeping state as long as it is sleeping,
12:39
you are functioning as a well-integrated individual. So, how do we define an integrated individual?
12:45
So, you have friends, family, etc. You are speaking, you are rational, everybody likes you, all that. That is a well-integrated individual.
12:51
The spiritual practice, whatever practice you do, whether you do yoga, kriya, hatha yoga, this, that, or even tantrik upasana of devatas,
12:59
it's trying to awaken this force, but not consciously. And there is a catch. And this is a very complicated topic, actually.
13:06
Once this awakens, it will start making a journey within you. That power will start awakening
13:13
and rising within you through the deepest channel. There's a subtle channel.
13:18
It's not a physical channel, mind you. It's a subtle channel. It's a part of your astral body. Exactly. It's called the Sushumna Nadi.
13:24
It will pass, nadi means a channel. It will pass through that. And as it goes, it will pass through various realms, one after the other, one after the other, it will pass.
13:31
Which are all within you as we speak. But also, outside. See, this is important to understand.
13:36
Not everything-- Inside and out-- It's like just like a computer has ports, so just like that,
13:42
your body has each of these so called chakras, which do not have any physical presence, by the way. So, these are confluence
13:48
of various multiple nadis at specific points in the body. And they are points
13:54
through which you can access various realms. Now, as shakti arises inside you,
14:02
it opens up this. Opens up this. Opens up this. Once it opens up, you are able to communicate
14:08
or whatever, integrate with that. But there is a-- And that is where this becomes risky, because as I say, the astral world is all types of things.
14:14
So there, once it opens up, opens up is good, but what do you do after that? And that is where you will need
14:19
solid guidance, because otherwise, there are more people who fall down with these kind of experiences
14:25
than people who integrate them properly in their life. And after this little bit of the Kundalini movement when it starts,
14:32
your normal life is going for a toss, first of all. Your perspective of everything is going to change. That's like, you can't deny,
14:38
Means, you would not be able to deny the reality. You are in the same room with the same set of friends. But what you are seeing,
14:43
what you are experiencing, what you are hearing, your panch indriya, five sense organs, they have--
14:51
The inputs that they get are slightly different from the inputs that other people are getting at the same space because of this.
14:58
And I'm just dumbing it down very much to explain it to you, because there are many complication in this,
15:03
but more or less, as you go higher, as this Kundalini awakens, your access to the astral planes
15:09
become stronger. Okay, this is a great point you’ve mentioned, sir.
15:14
Basically, it's like a brain  has filters, which filters out a lot of stuff, because if we were able to see that stuff,
15:20
-Yeah, yeah. --we would have lost our minds. -Absolutely. -And it's around us -now as we speak -Yes, yes, yes. But your gross body
15:26
consciously blocks it out because maybe your soul is not ready -to experience those experiences. -Right, right. Now if you also begin
15:31
to spiritually advance and you chase this process of making your Kundalini rise, those filters get removed
15:37
-from your brain. -Yes. Then you're able to start seeing things. But you need to be mentally, spiritually ready
15:43
to be able to see those things -and experience those things. -Right, right. Otherwise, you will lose your mind. So here just small interjection,
15:50
because lot of viewers will be seeing this. So the conscious aim is not,
15:55
in my opinion, the conscious aim should not be to, I have to awaken the Kundalini, because that is disastrous.
16:00
It's a power you cannot describe it. It only, once it hits somebody, you'll realize it. It's tremendously powerful.
16:08
-It's like an atom bomb inside your body. -Sort of. And it moves at the speed of your thought. This is faster than the speed of light,
16:13
if you ask me. Speed of thought is faster than your speed of light. Speed of light is the physical phenomena and the physics all that is there.
16:20
In thought, right at this moment, you can reach the sun, whereas light takes 8 minutes -to reach from sun to the Earth -Oh!
16:26
Moves at the speed of your thought. And the other thing is yeah,
16:31
so conscious aim is not to awaken the Kundalini. Conscious aim has to be to reach the higher realms of divinity,
16:37
where you come to the Devata, who is all powerful, who knows, who's the Ishwara.
16:42
You mean connecting with God. Yes. Connecting with God. But I prefer to use the term Devata. Only reason is, because in our culture,
16:50
we look at it that way. So, I may be connecting to Shiva, you may be connecting to Krishna. Somebody, all of them are gods,
16:56
by the way. When we use the term only God, there is one singular. No, each of these are equally gods.
17:02
There's no difference about any of them. Only the path may be slightly different. So, Shiva, you have to offer the Belpatra
17:08
and to Krishna, you offer the Tulsi leaf. That's about it. But Kundalini is like a power
17:16
that accelerates your path and safely handling for individual is impossible.
17:22
You'll need the grace of a very powerful Guru to handle this.
17:28
Buddha, Mahavira, Guru Nanak Dev ji, Did these people also have a risen Kundalini?
17:34
Because they also human beings to begin with and then they became evolved over the course of their lifetime or they were born as already evolved beings.
17:41
Was their Kundalini also risen according to you? So, two parts in this question, as I see.
17:46
One is that, did they have an awakened Kundalini? Absolutely, it doesn't matter what you call it. It is going to happen.
17:52
Whatever name you want to put to it. You may also not want to acknowledge it consciously. That is fine.
17:57
Because it's possible that some of the masters may not want, because if their divine mission was to spread the Dharma to various--
18:06
Say the ordinary people, I want to inspire them to a specific kind of worship. You cannot introduce terms
18:11
like Kundalini so easily there because it's fraught with danger. So, if I want to tell them that you do this particular text,
18:18
say in the, you know, in Maharashtra, for example, Maharashtra, you have this great Varkari saints.
18:24
Great saints are there. So, they introduced the Gyaneshwari Geeta To ordinary people
18:30
who have with initiation, with devotion, they chant it, etc. So, in that if you were to introduce
18:36
too much of-- There is some reference to this in this text. But if you were to introduce too much esoteric processes,
18:41
it's difficult for people to get it. So, you do something, you say that okay, let's not think about Kundalini. Let's think about the Devata,
18:48
let's think about devotion to the deity. Let's think about how do I get closer to the deity.
18:53
-Bhakti. -Bhakti. Through it, kundalini will awaken also. It will happen in the background process.
18:58
Bhakti is blind faith -towards the almighty. -You don't have, yes. And you don't have to, and purification of bhakti is important.
19:05
Initial stages bhakti will not be perfect. So, you do processes. That is where the sadhana comes in. So that your Bhakti becomes
19:12
more purer and purer. And as Bhakti becomes purer, that will trigger these things.
19:17
So, in one set question, if you ask that did these people have Kundalini experiences? All of them.
19:22
Tantra says that there's nobody, no spiritual progress is possible without a Kundalini experience. Whether you call it that
19:28
or any other name you call it, it's going to happen. But a Kundalini is also, there are many nuances in this.
19:34
In kundalini awakening. And the other part of the question that you had, were they evolved?
19:40
So, there is some fitness of things, by the way, that is there. For very high grade of spiritual evolution
19:46
if a person has to have, then he or she must have had gone through lifetimes of tremendous preparation,
19:51
practice, something like that. So those signs will already be manifesting from a young age.
19:57
Let's put it this way. It takes lifetimes of effort so, for somebody who's very perceptive,
20:04
if they see a child like that or something like that, they will figure out that this is… In fact, Baudhas, Vajrayana Buddhists
20:11
have this system where the lamas, when they reach a very high state so that they can continue their upasana,
20:18
they ensure a specific kind of rebirth. They have the capability of doing that. And before death,
20:24
they'll mention clues, that I may be born here and this and that signs will be there.
20:29
And then there are occult processes, occult means, through oracular processes and other things,
20:35
they find out that who is this incarnated lama. What was he doing in his past life? And then from a very young age,
20:41
they will take him into the monastery and start training him back into the practices which he was doing. So that it kind of saves time.
20:48
And they're very good at this. They have been doing this for centuries, etc. So, in a way, yes,
20:53
some fitness is there. It may not be that you are born with a Kundalini awakened. Some fitness is there. You still have to go through the process.
21:00
You have to do, nothing is going-- no one is going to serve you a full plate of food and just eat. No. So, you have to still struggle.
21:06
That's specifically for those great saints who come for, what in Sanskrit,
21:12
we call as lok kalyan, which is helping the masses. So they have to show that how they have had to struggle for this.
21:19
It's not that I was born with it. Then people will say, you're born with it. What will I, I am not born with it. Why should I do it?
21:25
It won't happen for me. But they say, no. It has happened through practice, through the process,
21:31
through following this path. So, if it has happened for one, it may happen for you also. So, you do that.
21:36
Let's also talk about the downside to having a Kundalini that rises too early before you're ready for it.
21:42
I've heard all sorts of stories, But what's the spiritual truth about this? Do you actually lose your mind?
21:48
Can you get some sort of a brain stroke? I've read things like this. Yes and it can be very, very dangerous.
21:55
In fact, there is a term that is used sometimes to refer to this. It's like the lightning creeper.
22:00
Vidyutlata, it's like a lightning. As fast as it rises, it can make you fall that fast
22:05
into a condition worse than that when you started. If it happens unrestricted,
22:11
unrestricted means out of the blue it happens, sometimes, once in a while there may be cases. Somebody has had an accident or something
22:18
and suddenly it gets triggered. Obviously, if a triggering happens through an accident,
22:24
that means that some lifetime, they must have practiced it without practice it's not going to happen. An accident means what? I've seen cases like this,
22:31
just like that an accident. See what is a Kundalini
22:36
you have to understand a little bit more, which is basically it remains for average human being, it's sleeping.
22:41
It's completely sleeping. But suddenly when it awakens, it requires a triggering state.
22:48
It's not going to happen if a comfortable lifestyle is going on. That trigger may be through stress,
22:57
through pain, through something like that, through intense spiritual practices. Or if you are Arjuna in the battlefield,
23:04
suddenly the realization comes to you that you are going to kill your relatives. You can't do that. So, you're running away. That's a stressful condition of the mind.
23:11
So you have to get out of the normal zone. Normal comfort zone has to be lost.
23:17
So sometimes it may happen in the case of just a sudden accident or something has happened and in that state, it got triggered
23:25
automatically once in a while. I'm not saying it's very common, but happens. So, there it will be very difficult to integrate
23:31
Because you don't know what to do with it afterwards. It's very difficult. It's like suddenly portals may open up
23:37
and suddenly you may start seeing things, etc. Most people will put you straight into a mental asylum. Doctors will put you into medicines.
23:43
You will not know what to do. And on top of that, if your belief system does not support this, then you are even more screwed.
23:49
There's nothing, no help. So, you think there are people currently in mental asylums who have an awakened Kundalini?
23:56
I can't say. But possibility is there. I mean, I'm not saying that every person who is…
24:02
-In a mental asylum. -Asylum has an awakened Kundalini. But there's a possibility that if you take 1000 people like that
24:09
from mental asylums who are completely raving mad, it's possible that a few of them actually, have had a Kundalini disaster.
24:16
And you're saying once it rises, it stays? No, to make it stay. To make it rise safely, smoothly.
24:21
That's where all the sadhana processes come in. Okay, so all these people who get it done by accident,
24:27
but they are not spiritually ready, what does the actual reality become? What do they see? You cannot put a single definition to it.
24:33
It depends on the individual. That's why I said that Kundalini is one term, an umbrella.
24:39
The way it arises in an individual is not going to be the same for everybody. There will be subtle differences.
24:45
For some people it may start, they may start your indriyas, which are the five senses through which you operate in this world
24:51
may suddenly become very sharp, one or two of them. So, you may start hearing things, you may start seeing things,
24:57
you may start smelling things. And that's very common, by the way. I don't know if you have, recently, there was a film
25:03
that became very popular in Kannada, which is the Kantara movie I have seen.
25:09
I very much liked it. There were certain scenes they were showing in that film where the protagonist of the movie,
25:16
he hears certain things. And there's a-- The approach of the deity when it comes, he hears certain sound of jewelry, etc, etc.
25:23
So those are all typical signs of when the Kundalini is awakened to the higher planes, etc. So, these are okay experiences.
25:31
In the negative side, it may suddenly open you up to astral planes, where there are all sorts of dangerous entities and you'll get scared,
25:37
you'll lose your sleep, you'll lose your mind. -You're a Tantra practitioner? -Yes.
25:44
And you just highlighted Kantara. I wanna know this angle,
25:50
that you're an actual Tantra practitioner, and for those of you who are tuning into this podcast for the first time,
25:55
you need to check out the first episode to understand Rajarshi sir's experiences.
26:01
What did you like about that movie? I've not seen it yet, and I intend on seeing it. But everyone from entrepreneurs
26:07
to mainstream Bollywood, To people like yourself are talking about this movie. Why is that movie special?
26:13
Because something in the last 15-20 minutes of that movie is beyond acting.
26:20
It was like what is called as, is a term we use called avesham, where the deity enters into an individual,
26:25
and that is part of the sadhana. It will happen everywhere. Whatever deity you are worshiping, the higher ranges, the deity will enter.
26:31
And this phenomenon happens across India in Hinduism. And it's not even a new thing.
26:37
In villages, it happens. You'll see, whether you go to the foothills of the Himalayas, in Bengal side, we have a term we call Bhorha.
26:44
Bhorha means, deity taking possession of you. So, possession is not-- The Abrahamic idea of possession
26:50
is that it's a negative thing. For us, no. Possession can be a divine thing. In fact, one of the oldest texts
26:56
mentioned that a man gets liberated when Shiva possesses a person. A deity can possess you.
27:01
And as I was saying, your highest state of upasana is when the deity is inside of your body. Then who are you?
27:07
That's the big question. Are you Ranveer? Are you the God? So, this is a very Hindu concept.
27:13
In this lies so many things, concepts of our upasana. And in that movie, in the last part of it,
27:20
there is the main Devata, whatever is the storyline, etc.
27:26
And he has a Kshetrapala. The Kshetrapala possesses the protagonist and he fights against certain enemies.
27:33
That scene that is there, it was not, it cannot be acted. There is some shift in the energy
27:39
very clearly. And later I read, I was curious that how did he do it? So, I read some interviews and all that.
27:44
He actually stopped eating non-veg food 20 days before that movie.
27:49
And those last few days he survived on coconut water and he had help from people who are more advanced upasakas
27:55
of that path. So, they told him what to do. It's like he enters into that zone And that energy gets transmitted onto the screen.
28:01
That's why people, once they see it, after that, when they're alone, even in front of the group,
28:06
they may say, oh, okay, it's just a movie. But once they're alone, it hits you. It hits you that what is it? What did I see?
28:11
It's the same thing that will happen. If you're a nonbeliever, you'll run away from it. You'll say, oh, it's just superstition,
28:17
I don't want to think about it. That's the way of protecting your mind from reality, of that kind of a liminal reality.
28:23
And if you're a believer, you'll just fold your hands and say, what did I see? Okay, without giving any spoilers,
28:28
can you give the plot of the movie a little bit for people who’ve not seen it? We have international listeners as well. So, the plot is very simple.
28:35
It's a conflict between a village and certain government officials who want to, it stays in a forested area,
28:43
inside, in interior Karnataka.
28:49
And basically, there are two-- There's a king who used to live there
28:54
and the king one day decided that I want to go out in search of peace. So, he goes out and he finds two devatas.
29:00
One is Guliga Deva, who is basically a Kshetrapala, protector of that village.
29:06
And then there is another boar, a deity like a boar. Like we have Varaha Avatar.
29:12
Which is Vishnu’s avatar. Similarly, he's called Panjurli Daiva. So those are the two local manifestations
29:18
of the devatas. And he tells them that I-- He feels very peaceful when he comes in front of them.
29:24
And then there is an oracle. Oracle means somebody in the village who gets possessed by the deities and he speaks for the deities.
29:30
So, he tells him that you can take the two devatas, devatas manifested in a stone
29:35
or just the way we do murti upasana, same way. You can take them. You'll have tremendous peace.
29:40
But in return you'll have to ensure that the village is given to the villagers. This land is given to the villagers and they are not disturbed, etc.
29:46
So, he takes it. He says that okay, I promise, make a promise. And then the gods tell him
29:52
that if you break this promise or later generation, anybody breaks this promise, then the Kshetrapala is not going to leave you.
29:58
So, if you make a promise to a deity, it's a very serious matter. It's not like human beings. Then eventually the movie goes into that,
30:04
there are later generations of that individual who wants to, he's dead, then a few generations later,
30:10
they want that forest land back because it's very high priced, they can sell it and things like that. That lends into a conflict
30:16
with the villagers. How does this conflict gets resolved is the movie. While in the process
30:22
the main protagonist of the movie, he is somebody who belongs to a family of these priests
30:28
who gets the Devata, the avesham of the deity, and he tries to run away from his destiny. He doesn't want to do that.
30:34
The movie shows that he has no interest in it. Everything else he's doing in his life. But the moment he's asked to do that, he says, no, I don't want to do that.
30:41
But the deities are like this. He has a chosen destiny. The devata keeps manifesting signs to him.
30:47
There are dreams that are happening. He's hearing voices, etc, etc. Eventually it brings into a culmination
30:52
where he finally gets possessed by the deity. And in that state, it's beautiful.
30:57
It's like it's indescribable how the last few scenes come out in the movie. That's why I think it's a wonderful movie.
31:04
And the spiritual concepts shown within the movie -are based on actual Tantra. -Yes, exactly.
31:09
Those are real concepts. He wasn't making anything up. That is precisely how devata upasana
31:15
happens in Dharma. And by the way, this concept of being possessed is not at all a new thing by a deity.
31:22
It's there from the Vedic times. It's there in the Mahabharata. It's there in various other texts.
31:28
In fact, in the previous podcast, I was just referring to something. When you do an upasana of a Devata,
31:34
You do something known as Nyasa, which is basically, you place
31:39
specific mantras -in different parts of the body. -Yeah. Why? Because you divinize the body.
31:45
What happens if you divinize the body? You will have little bit of avesham of the deity. In fact, as you go to higher--
31:51
What is avesham? Avesham is possession by the deity. Not fully, but little bit. Little bit of possession by the Devata,
31:57
the energy of the deity will enter into you, and that energy will do the upasana through you. Your own effort is not enough
32:04
to reach there. -Upasana is practice. -Practice. Any practice you are doing. So eventually at the higher stages,
32:10
the person realizes that even his efforts are not his efforts. It is he or she whom he is worshiping.
32:16
The Devata, the God. Whoever is. It’s anugraha, blessings of the deity
32:22
who enters into you, his or her shakti enters into you and gets this practice done through you.
32:27
And that happens through a mild amount of avesham mild or more avesham, depends. -That's the practice. -Okay, okay.
32:37
The director of the movie, Rishab Shetty, has also come to the forefront, and he's the mind behind this concept of Kantara.
32:43
-Okay. -So, I'm sure he had some idea -about these concepts. -Yes. -And that's how he manifested it. -Of course.
32:50
But on a more spiritual level, is it the choice of the deities around us
32:55
to have movies like that come to the forefront and concepts like this come to the forefront? Where were podcasts like these 5 years ago?
33:01
I wouldn't have dared to do it as a content creator, why do I dare to do it now? And we get deeply criticized
33:07
-for doing podcast like this. -Right. So, I can feel Maya pulling me, trying to pull me back
33:13
-and then I can feel Tara Maa... -Yes. Making me meet people like yourself. I firmly believe,
33:19
and it's, absolutely firmly believe, there is some shift that has happened. Because this kind of a movie
33:25
would be impossible even a few years ago, for various reasons. Not just impossible. I mean, when I think of it,
33:31
whatever news I get is from the newspapers. Obviously, I don't know any of these people. So, they thought
33:38
it will be some kind of a low budget, just okay-okay film and run in the local people, that all.
33:44
How word of mouth spreads like wildfire, then gets translated into Hindi and throughout In Calcutta, I'm amazed that the show
33:51
has been running for so long. And I see people at one of the shows and after, at the end scene, organically there are people
33:58
who are folding hands and all that. Then they will question you. Rational mind kicks in and oh, what am I doing? Because you are not accustomed to doing this.
34:04
Because the moment you come face to face with a reality like this, I do believe that there is a tremendous shift
34:10
that is perhaps coming in this country. In the world? I don't know about the world. -Really? -I am focused more on in this land.
34:19
World, maybe, I don't know. I never traveled outside India. So, I have no idea. But here, yeah.
34:24
Definitely there is some shift that is happening. As if some of the old gods are waking up
34:30
and when they get a thing done, they have one of these things. If a deity blesses a creative endeavor,
34:36
be it a movie, be it anything, it will cause a tremen-- This kind of--
34:41
The kind of reaction that you're seeing to the movie.
34:47
It’s cult following that I'm seeing. Cult following of the movie that is happening. This cannot happen only by,
34:52
you can plan things. You can be the best director and the best actor and whatever, greatest creative genius,
34:58
you cannot plan this reaction. It happens through transmission of the shakti, of the Devata.
35:03
Somehow the other, it got captured in the screen. And whoever saw that movie, it left an impression on their mind
35:10
and it has its own way of working. That's all we can say.
35:16
Do you think Tara Maa is this podcast? Why not? I mean, as I was saying, just before coming to this podcast,
35:22
I finished sadhana of Maa Tara and it went very well. So, I was very pleasantly surprised
35:29
and very happy to see Vigraha of Maa Tara here. So that's how, as I said,
35:35
if the deities are happy, they'll always point you that okay, I'm here. I'm watching you. -It’s like that. -Yeah.
35:40
It happens. I wished there was a way for listeners and viewers to feel the energy in this room right now. Even Sanchit, Manjot are feeling
35:46
whatever you and me are feeling right now. And this is not like a podcast experience
35:52
we've had in the past. I feel the podcast itself has hit some new zone, not just through this episode,
35:57
but some of the episodes we've recorded lately have just been much more intense. Keeping that in mind, sir
36:04
we spoke about India. -Right. -And then I mentioned the world. We had someone called Ambika Devi on the show.
36:09
-Okay. -She is a Hare Krishna devotee. -She's from Colombia, originally. -Okay.
36:15
-Her mother was a practicing exorcist. -Okay. And had dealt with Satanism, had dealt with depositions,
36:23
exorcisms, basically. She and her family
36:28
actually had been affected by the things that she was curing the people from. So, say if a demon,
36:34
this is what Ambika Devi relayed on the show. If a demon possessed someone, some negative energy possessed someone,
36:40
her mom would go in, do the exorcism. Then those negative energies would attack the mom -and the family of the exorcist. -Yeah, right.
36:50
Ambika Devi herself, while growing up, she had witnessed a lot of crazy things. She had seen figures in her house, etc, etc.
36:57
On that same podcast, we spoke about another movie called Hereditary.
37:02
-Okay. -It's on Netflix. It's a very dark movie. I've watched a lot of horror movies in my life.
37:08
Horror movies scare you, but they give you a bit of a thrill. This one stays with me even now, and I'm washing it off till today.
37:15
Just the thoughts of that movie. It didn't have too many jump scares, only the climax had a few jump scares.
37:20
-Okay. -But just the whole plot. The concept it was based on, was very creepy. And the way you talk about Kantara
37:26
And how it's coming to the forefront of positive energy, Yeah, that way. Ambika Devi said that the actual stuff,
37:34
according to Catholicism, according to Christianity, the dark aspects of Satan all that,
37:41
was legitimately shown in that movie. -The way we have mantras in our country. -Right. Like our chants, there are Satanic chants.
37:48
And those Satanic chants -were put into that movie. -Okay. And that movie spread like wildfire -in a parallel way. -All right.
37:54
In terms of word of mouth, etc. So, while we have positive energy
37:59
rising in one part of the world, or maybe the world in general, is the negative energy
38:04
also trying to rise and pull it back down? And that's one part of the question. Secondly, I would like to talk
38:11
about Satan in general. What does our country say about Satan, the devil, all that? Do we have a concept like that?
38:17
Okay, so the first part is that there is always going to be,
38:23
when we are talking about the astral planes, there's always going to be both the good and the bad.
38:28
Bad means those that cause harm. Now, those that cause harm, there is a very interesting thing
38:34
you have to understand. They cause harm because it is their Dharma to cause harm.
38:39
Their duty. Your duty as a human being is your Dharma. The God and Devatas have their own Dharma.
38:45
They have their own Dharma. It's like you are asking that why is a tiger biting? Because that's the natural thing for it to do.
38:50
This is his Dharma. You are judging from your perspective that it's harmful for you. That's very good.
38:55
But this whole process assumes that you’re at the center of the universe. Human beings love to think that we are at the center of the universe.
39:02
But these entities for various reasons, they behave in certain ways, there's no doubt about it.
39:08
And yes, even at a very global scale, I cannot say, because I really don't know
39:15
if there is an awakening of the negative forces, these entities. But in general, it is believed
39:23
that as Kali Yuga progresses, these things will start manifesting more strongly. There's no doubt in that sense, one way.
39:30
And the other is that, from a very, let's come down to an individual scale, So, if you are practicing
39:36
any kind of Devata upasana and your upasana is hitting the right notes, so, you are going closer to the deity.
39:42
As I said, there are realms of devotees. One is the straight, the nursery level. So, no offense to them, it's all good
39:49
the way they are doing, etc. One is that he's taken his upasana, the practice to the level where he's coming close to the deities.
39:55
There are innumerable entities who will straightaway come and start putting problems in your path, and the deities will be aware,
40:02
but he or she will not interfere -Really? -Oh, yes. That's the test of your commitment.
40:09
How is it the test of your commitment? That's because you have to pass through them. Test of your commitment means how serious are you?
40:15
Because that realm, if you reach, the realm of a Devata, you are effectively not a human being anymore.
40:20
The energy of the Devata is inside you. What does it mean not to be a human being?
40:26
You are not affected by sorrow, you're not affected by depression, which is the standard thing for all of us. Today it's good--
40:32
As they very colloquially said, today it's summer, tomorrow it's winter. Those cycles are going on.
40:37
Doesn't matter how good are you, how try, etc. Whatever you are trying, etc. To transform, go beyond that stage
40:43
where you are unaffected by this, where you are effectively like a deity,
40:49
a God staying among humans. That kind of a level you can reach in upasana. In our path--
40:54
In Dharma that's very much possible. I'm saying the highest. I'm not saying everybody can reach there,
41:00
But why do you think reaching there will be a smooth flow for everybody. Every bit of it you’ll be tested.
41:06
Every step. And it's like this 100 meters or maybe, those marathon races are there,
41:12
I don't know how many kilometers and all that towards the last, say if it's 100 meters, 90 meters, it's fine.
41:17
Last 10 meters. Every step you'll be tested. And the deity will be fully aware that the testing is going on.
41:22
When you say testing, because of these negative entities, on a very practical basis, what happens? They try attacking you?
41:28
They will disturb your practice. First of all. Sexually? A lot of things, anger, lust. These are the two primary things.
41:35
They'll put anger and lust in your head. So yes, not only that and not just head.
41:41
Bring you into situations where there'll be an easiest way to lose the energy that you build up
41:49
through your practice is anger and lust. When you say bring you into situations,
41:55
you mean that these entities are also higher beings. So, they are capable of manipulating reality a little bit.
42:02
Everything in the astral plane can manipulate reality. Everything. -The reality that we experience... -Yes. -As human beings. -Absolutely.
42:08
Okay, just again for an example. So, say you've been praying, you've been meditating,
42:13
you're growing spiritually, And you go out to meet your friends
42:18
and then the place you're going out at, there'll be a sexually attractive person
42:23
who comes to you and really is forward with you. So, you'll be tempted to sleep with that person.
42:29
That's a good example of what you're saying? That's one example of that you're saying,
42:34
what I'm trying to say. That's very much possible. So, if you are, suppose let's, this example only, let's build on this example.
42:41
So you are in the middle of a specific what I was saying as an anusthanam. Anusthanam means,
42:46
you have already taken a sankalpa. That okay I am doing this practice for the six months. -Promise. -Promise to the deity.
42:53
And your practice is going really well. So right at that time, this kind of societal environment
42:59
suddenly gets created where you end up meeting somebody and you feel tremendously attracted towards that individual
43:04
and you end up sleeping with that individual and that specific practice, what you're doing entails
43:10
that you may have to maintain certain degree of celibacy during that period.
43:15
So, the moment you do that, your practice falls. And you will not get the result anymore.
43:21
In fact, you may even fall depending on what practice it is and more details of it. You may even fall lower
43:26
than the condition that you were in initially. -Just by having sex once. -Depends. See, here is the thing.
43:32
If you are married, so it depends, these are, you cannot-- What I'm giving is a broad formula.
43:37
It changes based on the Devata you are doing, what practice you are doing. But more or less...
43:45
unrestricted sexual activity is an easy way for downfall in the spiritual path.
43:51
Unless you are very sure what kind of karmas that person has? Who is it that you are sleeping with?
43:56
What is that person's tendencies inside? Because it's the easiest way to take the karmas of the other person
44:05
is through unrestricted sexual activity. Number two is anger. Anger is very, very,
44:12
In one shot it throws away things. But here is another catch. Certain Devatas, if you worship,
44:18
deities, gods you worship, there will be an upsurge of anger because it is the nature of the deity. There is a tricky situation.
44:24
You’ll have to control that. There is practice. That is why in the traditional field, traditional approach
44:30
to the tantrik upasana of Devatas there are Parivar Devatas. Family of deities you have to worship.
44:36
So, each one has its own role. If you're worshiping Shakti upasana tremendously
44:42
and you're going very deep into Shakti upasana, say you're worshiping Maa Kali for example, or Maa Tara even, for that matter.
44:48
Our conception of Maa Tara, she is quite fierce. She is very fast and very fierce. It is naturally going to cause
44:55
some amount of increase in aggression. I know just day before I was,
45:01
somebody who does upasana, I know her for quite some time. So, she had mailed me,
45:07
exact thing was this that she has been worshiping one of the Mahavidyas and a very simplistic worship,
45:12
not even the complicated worship, but she does it very diligently and beautifully she does it. But there's an increase in anger, tremendous
45:19
and a detachment from everything. That's what the deity is. You are in the same situation, same house, same people,
45:25
but suddenly you are a little bit more, you are there but you're not there. This part of you comes out of you.
45:30
It looks at your own life and everything And you see that okay, these are my friends, These are my families, these are everybody.
45:36
But this is because nature has created the circumstances. Maybe next life they may not be there or maybe some other equation
45:42
will be there either way. But there is also the increase of anger. That happens. And there it is important
45:48
to calm that down. One of the ways to calm that down. That is why in Shakti upasana, worship of Shiva becomes very important
45:54
to do abhishekam of Shiva, properly done regularly, calms down the mind. Calms down lot of energies.
46:00
He has the ability to digest anything. He is Mahadeva. That is why he is Mahadeva.
46:06
He can digest everything and he can still remain unaffected by it. It's a lot to absorb.
46:11
But I have so many questions about Satan, especially after watching that movie.
46:17
Just curiosity. Specifically, without giving too many spoilers away about Hereditary,
46:23
it was about one of Satan's servants. He has I think seven demons
46:30
which are not to be mixed with seven sins, seven servants of his. And the way we pray to deities,
46:35
like how you spoke about Shiva and Shakti right now. You're supposed to pray to one of the demons -for that demon's particular abilities. -Okay?
46:42
I'm not even going to take the name of the demon, though it's in my head. And every time it's in my head, I wash it off with one of our mantras.
46:49
It starts from P. And it was such a creepy movie.
46:55
You could feel the presence of that particular demon in that movie, in scenes, the way you spoke about Kantara, and you said that maybe that deity
47:01
-possessed the hero. -Right, right, right. Here, you can see even the acting of those actors
47:07
that it's not them doing it to a certain degree. I was trying to show Sanchit the movie,
47:12
and he just stopped watching in the first ten minutes. He was like, I'm not going to see this. And it's not even scary, the first ten minutes,
47:17
But you feel the creepy shadowiness of it taking over you.
47:23
Earlier, I used to recommend the movie. I don't recommend that people watch the movie after speaking to Ambika Devi. What is this whole side of things, sir?
47:31
Does Hinduism have an equivalent of this? And when we say that particular demon,
47:36
-let's call it P-demon. -Okay. P-demon, it’s not a joke.
47:42
But when you worship these things like P-demon,
47:48
I'll tell you the Christianity aspect of it. They say that initially it will give you a lot of the things you want,
47:54
your material wishes, but it takes something in return. And if you don't obey it enough, it comes after you.
48:01
It makes your life hell. It gives you scary experiences, painful experiences. There are also, then,
48:06
lots of conspiracy theories attached to it, saying that a lot of the successful, materially successful people in the West
48:12
have prayed to either one of these demons or Satan. -Again, this is not my input. -Yeah okay.
48:18
Or a reality that I vouch for. These are all conspiracy theories. It's just things I want to discuss.
48:24
-Okay. -So, what's your opinion on all this? So, from our perspective.
48:30
I can only speak from what, though I do have some experience with,
48:36
I have had some experience with Western occultists, too, even before I fully entered into Tantra upasana,
48:42
I knew quite a few who were very powerful, but that's different matter, but-- Do they do a Western version of Tantra?
48:48
No, they have their processes. I won't call it Tantra. Because Tantra is Devata upasana.
48:54
It's just the colloquial understanding that is mixed up with all sorts of kala jadu and black magic and all. Tantra is Devata upasana.
49:00
Tantra is Shiva Shakti upasana. You pray to God. Yeah, absolutely. That's what. It's a method of praying, that's all.
49:07
And, you know, this is where I feel the West gets it wrong. They look at all these things -as paganism without understanding. -Yeah exactly.
49:12
That there's a very stark difference here. That's there plus, they're looking at it as paganism
49:18
starts at a very ancient time. So that is not going to get rectified. That is there. So, I believe our culture,
49:25
Hinduism for example, is the last of the classical religion surviving everything else has been gone. Taken over by the standard idea
49:33
of anti-pagan or Abrahamic concepts. All the other cultures that were like us,
49:41
they're all gone. Only Hindus are the last surviving classical religions. So we classical religions
49:46
had a typical format like this, all of them, anyway. So, coming to the Hindu Dharma,
49:53
there are negative entities. There are realms of negative entities. There are Bhootas, which are spirits.
49:58
There are Pretas, which are angry spirits. Then there are Pishachas,
50:04
which are very malevolent kind of entities, very malevolent. If one of them comes,
50:09
God forbid that anybody even comes into contact with any of them, it's destructive to the power of infinity.
50:17
Then there are Rakshasas, which are, like Ravana was a Rakshas who Lord Rama had defeated.
50:23
Then beyond the Rakshasas, there are also the Asuras. Asuras are extremely powerful,
50:28
extremely powerful negative entities. Highly intelligent. It’s said that Asuras are--
50:36
In fact, Sri Aurobindo has some beautiful writings on these negative realms also. He has written tremendously on all aspects.
50:42
So Asuras are those kind of entities who do tremendous amount of tapasya, by the way.
50:47
Their capacity for spiritual practice is far more than an average human being. So what they end up doing
50:54
is that they will worship one of these great Gods that we have Shiva, Shakti, Brahma,
51:00
Some of the great Gods, except much higher up. So, they worship them, attain boons and blessings and powers.
51:07
And then they use that power to do negative things because they use it in the service of their ego.
51:14
A saint, when he's worshiping a deity, he loses his ego. His ego is gone.
51:20
He becomes one with the Devata. His devotion becomes that high caliber.
51:25
But here what they do is that they attain those blessings from the Gods and they can because they are capable of tremendous amount of tapasya.
51:31
Tapasya is penance. The penance, the Asuras can do, humans can never think of it. And then after getting that,
51:38
one of the typical things they do is that they try to cause havoc everywhere
51:44
because they want to usurp things, take things for themselves. So, our Shastra has mentioned
51:49
one of the first things Asuras do is that they stop the Yajnas to all the gods once they get the blessing.
51:56
One of the typical blessings they ask for is that nobody can defeat me. No human, no God, nobody can defeat me.
52:02
So, the average gods who are there, The other gods who are there, once the blessing is set into motion,
52:08
they can't do anything. But inside that blessing there will always be some catch for their fall somewhere.
52:14
But regardless, that catch is not going to manifest immediately. So, for a long period of time
52:20
they are going to reign supreme. That Asura, okay. And he will wreak havoc in the divine realms
52:26
and everywhere and etc, etc. Until finally one of the great gods, be it Shiva or Vishnu or Shakti,
52:31
somebody or the other will decide that enough is enough. Then they will incarnate and they will destroy the Asura. -And this can happen even in 2022. -Oh, yes.
52:38
Only difference is that, what I feel personally is that, the Asuras are too powerful.
52:43
They don't need to incarnate. During the Mahabharata, there were incarnations of Asuras, by the way, lot of them. In fact, in the Mahabharata,
52:49
there's a beautiful part before the Yudha actually happens,
52:55
the war actually happens. So, Duryodhana, who is the head of the Kaurava army,
53:01
who is Duryodhana, he's taken and the demon-- The Asuras actually,
53:07
the Rakshasas and the Asuras and the negative beings, they tell him that do not worry about anything. You just enter the battlefield.
53:12
Our forces are going to take possession of the bodies of your warriors and they are going to fight for you. And their powers are much higher,
53:19
than the average human being. So, we are there with you. They are telling him that, just go ahead. Victory is yours. We are fully there.
53:25
And they name even that this Asura is going to enter into the body of this warrior and this warrior and this warrior and this warrior.
53:31
Because other side Lord Krishna is there and the Pandavas are there. They're also great, fantastic,
53:36
superb warriors. So that was an era still, there were asuric incarnations which used to happen.
53:41
Asuras used to take the physical form. The men of that caliber were entirely different
53:48
than what we have right now. Spiritually, intellectually, in physical prowess, everything. Exceptional caliber people.
53:54
The Asuras had to incarnate to fight them. Today, Asuras don't incarnate so easily
53:59
because the intellectual, spiritual, moral and physical stamina and strength
54:05
of human beings is far lower. Because of the general environmental corruption and various other things. But are there some human beings
54:13
who attained such a high level of spirituality that Asuras have already gone inside them? Asuras influence people all the time.
54:20
Are they powerful and famous and rich people in the world today who are being influenced by Asuras. Today, I cannot say.
54:26
But there's a very strong general belief and I also believe that. In fact, Sri Aurobindo had written
54:32
that Hitler was possessed by an Asura. He used to get, in fact, he wrote a lot of things about it.
54:37
I'm just relaying what Sri Aurobindo had written about it. There's a lot of talk about how serial killers,
54:43
and there's so many Netflix documentaries -made about serial killers. -Yes. Many of them have said that I was being influenced by another being.
54:49
-Very much possible. -That he was telling me to kill all these people. And the moment they're jailed, they kind of have a reformation.
54:55
So, reformation and all, I don't know. But I'll give you a simple case. A few years ago, it had come out in the newspapers.
55:01
I was in Delhi at that time. -Burari case. -Burari. -The Burari case. -Exactly. So, what happens in that case?
55:06
So, this gentleman, whoever that family is, One of their ancestors starts visiting them
55:11
and telling them various things, what to do, what not to do. They start following those advices. Why did that ancestor start telling them,
55:18
-in the first place? -Listen to it first. -Yes. -Ancestor comes and tells them,
55:24
do this, do that, etc. And they start making a lot of progress in their business,
55:29
material progress for two years, two years it goes on. Fantastic progress they are making it. Obviously, what happens?
55:35
Average human beings, you get greedy, and you have started believing in it. Then one day that that entity
55:40
who came in the form of their ancestor, because these beings are very good at shape shifting.
55:45
They can even pretend to be a deity. By the way. They are very good at this. So this comes in and then says that now
55:53
I am going to change your full destiny. All you have to do is just tie a rope
56:01
around your neck and jump but you will not die. You'll have a rebirth, complete. Everybody will live from there.
56:07
And then magical things will happen. This, that, etc. Whole family does that and finished.
56:12
What happened to their souls, according to you? They will enter a very negative state.
56:19
They will attain as-- They will go to a state which is lower than that entity which was influencing them.
56:24
And for a very long time they will remain there until and unless somebody who's very higher or something takes pity on them
56:31
and liberates them from there. It might seem that--
56:36
These things, when you see, if you think about it in a very shallow manner,
56:41
in a limited manner, you think that this is so unfair. They were tricked into it. But if you take a large enough time scale,
56:47
you'll see that there's nothing that happens without some karmic link in some past life or something of the other.
56:53
I know one instance here, and I had a friend who was an excellent exorcist. He was very good.
56:58
He is not in India. I won't mention any details about him here. So, he used to tell me
57:03
and because we had similar interests and he was one of the very genuine people. So that's why my interest was there.
57:10
Because normally if it’s not genuine, I lose interest and I move on. But he was very genuine
57:15
and he had equally a proper understanding of our systems. He was not Indian.
57:20
He was a very good exorcist. So, he used to tell me that when he sees a person, he sees if there is a spirit
57:26
or something attached, anything, he sees them also. And at a young age, he used to see people roaming around
57:33
first he used to think that everybody sees it. Then he saw that only he's able to see. And others can’t see. Then he had a guru who taught him what to do
57:39
and how to process this information into a meaningful manner. Used in a meaningful manner. So, he told this very beautiful thing
57:46
and that is so accurate. It applies even to our systems also. Said that never does a possession happen
57:51
without some karmic link in some past. There is some permission that that entity has from nature
57:57
in order to cause that harm. Because somewhere or the other you might have harmed it.
58:02
You will not remember. That entity will also not remember. So, I said then how do you remove?
58:08
How do you bring a cure? He said that the-- And in fact, he had sent me a lot of their occult texts
58:14
and things to do. But I lost it. I was not interested. Because what we have is more than sufficient for us, I feel.
58:21
This was more of just an intellectual curiosity. Spiritual also because he was very good.
58:27
So that way. So, I told him how do you deal with it? He said that his role
58:33
was to primarily convince that entity to give up on its own.
58:39
Because if you apply force to remove which can be done then that is the beginning of another karma.
58:45
-Oh! -Oh yes. -Because you're interacting with it. -Yes. Nature has a law. Nature is the biggest chartered accountant
58:52
in the world. One left and right balance sheet is perfectly maintained. Possession can happen only if that,
58:58
the one who is getting possessed had at some point done some activity which you may or may not remember, nobody perhaps remembers,
59:04
in some past lifetime to the possessing entity. So, nature does a balancing act.
59:10
You come back and you have a chance to do it. But the problem is that we don't remember anything.
59:16
So, we don't know that where the line is to draw. If you overstep that line,
59:22
then also there is another beginning of a new Karmic chain that happens. So this guy, what he used to do
59:27
is that he used to try, and it used to take time, 15 days, 20 days, 30 days sometimes
59:34
and convince that entity of its own to leave that being.
59:39
And this process by the way happens here also. In India also when a possession is to be removed
59:46
then very often it happens is that a mix of threat is given to that possessing entity
59:54
which could be a Bhoota, Pret, or whatever else, etc. Normally possessions are done by these only.
1:00:01
Bit of threat. Because you have the power of-- Some blessings of some deity has to be with you. Otherwise, they'll not be scared of you.
1:00:07
In fact, they are very nasty. Some of the nasty pieces of things that are there The moment you sit in front
1:00:12
they know everything about you. Everything okay? Whatever things you are doing in public, whatever you're doing in private, etc.
1:00:18
They see how much power actually you have. They see that you don't have power, They'll straightaway blurt out something that is going to embarrass
1:00:24
the hell out of you, and then they'll give you one bad word and tell you now get lost from here. It's not your capacity to do anything,
1:00:29
but if somebody is an upasaka of a deity and has a blessing of the Devata then they will not try all these stunts.
1:00:35
Then they will be a little bit more reserved in dealing with that. So anyway,
1:00:40
There what happens is that those entities are told that okay, you leave this person
1:00:46
in return we’ll do you something good, tell me what you want? Sometimes they may say that some issue has happened
1:00:53
or something like that, or my descendants are not giving me the…
1:01:02
There are offerings to be given to the ancestors or something-- This person has done some negative to me
1:01:08
when he was alive or something like that. So, some resolution sometimes happens. So, they say that okay, I promise you,
1:01:14
they extract a promise from that entity. You leave. Instead, I'll give-- And in return I'll give you XYZ.
1:01:19
This, this, this. And once the entity says, okay, I agree to it, then they will leave. They are also, in a way a bit,
1:01:25
not entirely like deities. But they don't have a physical form.
1:01:30
So, this is a process, one of the ways. So, you basically tell that entity that you leave. But you can force them out also,
1:01:37
by the way. Forcing out has this only issue that you don't know what kind
1:01:43
of karmic thing you're interfering in. I believe the forcing out is to be done only when the exorcist
1:01:49
has the blessing of a deity. Because a deity, proper blessing of a Devata, if you have
1:01:55
and the deity has blessed you and you are tightly connected to the deity, the deity can take away the karma
1:02:03
the deity knows. So, you don't do anything. You wait, the deity will inspire. Go and do this.
1:02:10
Then it's not your responsibility. Then whatever karma is there, etc. Deity will take care. In Christianity, with the priest exorcist,
1:02:17
like how they've showed in the movie, -the Exorcist.-Yeah. Is the deity Jesus Christ? The original Exorcist movie I had seen,
1:02:26
I think they were invoking angels. I don't remember exactly, but I think they were invoking
1:02:31
two of the archangels they have. Perhaps it was that. Which is an equivalent
1:02:36
of what we have in India, like where you say Aum Maa. This Maa, like all the deities we have?
1:02:42
No, deities are not angels. Deities are more powerful than angels. -Okay. -What we worship as Devatas
1:02:48
are more powerful than angels. Is there a Western equivalent of it? No, that is because the Western religions
1:02:56
have negated the concept of deities. They came in as more like a counter force before they became more popular,
1:03:02
whether it's any of the Western religions, etc. So, their original culture of the Greeks,
1:03:07
original Roman culture, original Egyptian culture, they had multiple Devatas.
1:03:13
They used to worship multiple Devatas. So, these new religious currents came in and said that no deity, no deity.
1:03:20
We won't accept any deity, we'll only worship one. So, all deities had to be canceled, rejected, removed, etc, etc.
1:03:25
So how can there be a concept -of a deity in that? -Okay. So, it is more of a-- Some people believe
1:03:30
that let's put angels as equivalent. No. Some of their angels could be very powerful,
1:03:36
I'm not denying that. But they are also tied to those cultures. They will not come here so easily. -Like geographically you are saying? -Oh no.
1:03:43
These entities have ties to the kind of people who are worshiping them.
1:03:49
They have the specific type of worship and they respond to that. So, a specific kind of angel is there.
1:03:55
If you just sit here and do some bhaktibhav, etc. -It's not going to happen. -Okay. I wanted to talk about many other things
1:04:02
on this episode, but because we've spoken about astral body, physical body and now Satan,
1:04:09
there's a couple of final questions for you. And then we'll do a sequel episode to this as well, where we'll expand upon all these entities
1:04:15
a little more. The first question is an explanation
1:04:21
-of the causal body. -Okay. -Karan Sharira. -Karan Sharira So, at the start of the podcast,
1:04:26
we spoke about your physical body your gross body, -your subtle body, your astral body. -Yes. How do you begin to explain
1:04:31
-to someone what a causal body is? -Okay. What is a Karan body? And correct me if I'm wrong, sir,
1:04:37
it's also present in us right now? It's present in us, but it is completely inactive.
1:04:42
So inactive means somebody who is, unless you are actually into very deep spiritual practices,
1:04:48
you’ll not experience the Karan Sharira. Experience the Karan Sharira means?
1:04:55
It's like this. You have the Atman inside also, right? The soul, or what we call
1:05:01
the specific Hindu term, we use, the Atma. But how many people have experienced the Atma?
1:05:09
Experience of the Atma is very different. Have we experienced the Astral body? Astral body, you are experiencing the moment,
1:05:15
you are experiencing any kind of emotion. It is very close to the physical. What is close to the physical, you will experience very easily.
1:05:21
These are very far off from the physical. These are very, very, very subtle. So subtle that unless you are consciously
1:05:27
able to take yourself to that subtle realm, -you'll not so easily experience it. -Do we experience the astral body
1:05:33
in our dreams as well? Yes, very much. Absolutely. -Always when we are dreaming? -Oh yes. -The astral body is at play. -Yes, yes.
1:05:40
In fact, dreams are not-- So, dream analysis is another very,
1:05:45
very beautiful topic. Another podcast episode. So, yeah.
1:05:50
More or less during dreams, your astral body is fully active. That's where all the thing is playing out. Whether it's good, whether it's bad, everything.
1:05:57
Now, how do we begin to explain -causal body? -Okay. Causal body or the Karan Sharira,
1:06:03
as we call it, is the root, the seed of the karmas are planted there.
1:06:08
From which you might have done at a very ancient time, something. -Many lifetimes back. -Many lifetimes ago.
1:06:14
Obviously, you have no memory, nobody has any memory of it, but it has kept some impression from there, from there that matures
1:06:21
and percolates down into your astral. By the time it comes to astral, Already things are happening here
1:06:26
related to that karma. So, second thing is that the causal body is--
1:06:33
In that state, if you are able to consciously attain to the causal body in yoga, in meditation,
1:06:39
in Tantra sadhana, anywhere else, etc, by the time you reach the causal body,
1:06:44
you are already beyond the astral. So, there are no negatives in the causal body. In that realm of the causal body.
1:06:50
No negative entity has the right to even enter into that realm…
1:06:55
-The don't have the capacity. -Correct me... Correct me if I am wrong, sir. So, in Autobiography of a Yogi, which is my all-time favorite book,
1:07:00
I've learned so much of spirituality from that book. There's an entire chapter -That talks about the astral realm. -Okay.
1:07:06
So, they say that when you attain enlightenment here, you gain access to the astral realm. So rather than being born again
1:07:13
on our plane, you're born in a higher plane. But spiritual progress doesn't stop there.
1:07:18
Even as an astral entity, you keep evolving until you earn the right -to experience the causal reality. -Yes.
1:07:25
And the closest thing to explain a causal reality to a human mind
1:07:30
is what you feel in REM sleep. REM sleep. Like when, sometimes you're very tired and you sleep
1:07:36
and the moment you open your eyes it's morning and you are just feeling fresh. But that time in the middle wasn't even time in the first place.
1:07:42
It was a causal reality. -Is that kind of close? -Sort of. That's kind of broadly similar to the idea
1:07:50
that I was trying to explain? -I'll let you take the reins. -Yeah. That's broadly similar to the idea. So causal body is not easy to reach,
1:07:56
But it's where your true spirituality -starts in a way. -Okay. It is not a true spirituality.
1:08:02
Astral also, there will be spiritual things possible. And there's a wide range of activity that is happening in the astral.
1:08:07
But the causal is very detached. It is not connected to all the ups and downs
1:08:12
of the astral realm or the positive negative. The polarities that we see here is not there.
1:08:18
And as I said, what we understand as the good, something, we like,
1:08:24
you like a painting, you feel good about it, you like an old friend who's meeting and you like good about it.
1:08:29
Or you love somebody, you like good about it. This whole feeling of positive. And on the other side,
1:08:34
just the opposite of it, you get scared. You see a movie, you don't like it. There's a nightmare, something like that. This full range of positive
1:08:41
negative thing business doesn't happen in the causal. It's beyond that. It's even beyond
1:08:47
for an average human being, imagine that there's something
1:08:52
that's happening here, it's a reality. And then there is a world of imagination. In the imagination, you can travel through the astral plains,
1:08:59
and then there is a world which is beyond your imagination. Understand this. Even you cannot imagine it.
1:09:05
You don't have the capacity to imagine that also. It's so rare. Like, try thinking of a new color.
1:09:10
Yes. It's sort of, exactly. Very good example. Try thinking of a new color. Very difficult.
1:09:15
So, it's something like that, but it's attainable through the practice of whether you do yoga
1:09:21
or whether you do Tantra sadhana or something like that, or whether-- Whichever deity you are worshiping, they will take you one day to that realm.
1:09:28
And you will see how terrific it is. So, all these Sadhus that we see in the Himalayas,
1:09:34
or even saints that we know of, Saint Tukaram or anyone who has completely evolved
1:09:41
in our earth. All these great saints of different religions,
1:09:47
did they only achieve access to the astral realm, or had they got access to the causal realm as well?
1:09:53
Or was there a mix? But I think there were many saints But I think there were many saints who have gone to the causal realm.
1:10:00
And beyond that, causal also, there are realms where, so basically, it's like this.
1:10:06
If you go to a causal realm And if you're permanently stationed, your consciousness is permanently--
1:10:12
See, again, these are very loose words. The actual word is Chit Shakti, is permanently stationed in the causal realm.
1:10:17
What is Chit Shakti? Chit Shakti is the power that motivates you to do sadhana and everything that animates you.
1:10:23
[laughter] The electricity of your soul. I don't know. I don't know.
1:10:30
So anyway, consciousness, for lack of better words, so if your consciousness goes to the Karan Jagat
1:10:37
the world of the causal and it stations there,
1:10:42
you are like a God. Understand this thing, our Dharma says that in theory,
1:10:51
if your practice is good at the highest realm, you can divinize yourself to the level of a God.
1:10:56
And not just our main, not just the Vedic Dharma,
1:11:02
even in the Tantrik religion, when the Shaiva Siddhantas came in, and not just the Shaiva Siddhanta,
1:11:08
the Kashmiri Shaivism, which is one of the nondual beautiful versions of Shiva philosophy
1:11:14
from which Tantra is derived, they mention this, that eventually you can reach, there are realms, Tattvas,
1:11:21
36 Tattvas are there. Changes that happen, etc. And you can attain to the condition of Sadashiva.
1:11:28
Condition of Sadashiva. You will not become Shiva. Shiva is one. But you can have that, and you means, one in millions.
1:11:35
I'm not even saying that everybody can do it one in millions and millions, but it is possible to attain
1:11:40
to that level of consciousness. In our lifetime? It may take many lifetimes?
1:11:45
All these things are not going to happen in one lifetime. But while you are physically present -in the human birth. -Earth.
1:11:51
Beyond that is also possible. But there you have to, the body is too gross to hold that energy. You have to go beyond that.
1:11:57
Which is what happens to some great saints where the souls just leave their body because they realize, -now I wanna go there. -Yes.
1:12:03
And in fact, I very recently that just, -again, a tangent that came into my head. -Go for it.
1:12:08
I was once guided very brilliantly, amazingly, by a gentleman
1:12:14
whom I never met, whose name also I did not know. I still don't know his name, but he was a Siddha Purusha.
1:12:20
He was a tremendous Bhairav upasak. What is Siddha Purusha? Siddha Purusha, the word Siddha Purusha
1:12:25
we use to describe these type of saints who have gone to the Karan Sharira, and the Mahakaran,
1:12:31
who have become like a Devata only, like a God almost. That we call a Siddha Purusha.
1:12:36
Beyond all ordinary conceptions. The spiritual leaders we see in India today?
1:12:42
I can't comment on any, -Don't want to comment on any individual. -No, no I won't ask you any names. But may or may not be.
1:12:50
Some, may be. Some may not be. But I believe that if you go very deep into this Siddha Avastha, means the condition of the Siddha,
1:12:56
Avastha means condition. Condition of the Siddha. You become Siddha Purusha. That level you reach it's--
1:13:03
To break it down, let's say 0 to 100, 100 is the maximum spiritual growth that you can happen.
1:13:09
If you are up to 60-65 only, You will already become pretty well known and famous. These days, even 20% also becomes famous.
1:13:17
That's a different matter altogether, in my opinion. But beyond 60, beyond 70, beyond 80,
1:13:23
those who go, they normally do not, they keep themselves very wrapped. They’ll not come out in public so easily.
1:13:30
They are the people who are meditating far away in the Himalayas. They may be in the cities also, but they'll make sure that your neighbor
1:13:36
also does not know who he is. This gentleman whom I was talking about, he was a very powerful Siddha.
1:13:42
Very powerful Siddha. He chose his time and place
1:13:48
and condition of death. He had the ability to do that. He chose that. And he had mentioned that when is he,
1:13:54
what time is he going to die, where, etc., where is it, etc. And he wrote that because he's experienced all
1:14:00
that is to experience in this life. Now he wants to go to the realm of the God whom he worships, Ishta Devata, Bhairava.
1:14:06
And he will continue his upasana there, even better upasana will happen because the trappings of the human body
1:14:11
are not there. Human body gets tired, it needs food, it needs rest, it has to go to the loo.
1:14:17
Various things are there. If you go beyond the human body and if you can continue that, it will be a wonderful experience.
1:14:24
This gentleman, what do you think his childhood was like? I have no idea because I hardly knew anything about him
1:14:30
except that very strange manner he came into my life and he provided some invaluable guidance
1:14:35
in certain upasanas I was doing. So, I deeply respect him.
1:14:40
I don't even know how he looks. I don't know his name. I don't know anything. I just know that-- Communication used to happen this way
1:14:45
that I used to write a question I had to a friend,
1:14:50
friend used to go and give it to another guy who lived in a particular state. Then he would go into an interior village
1:14:57
where he lived, go and ask this person. This person would say in his mother tongue
1:15:02
and then he will translate. And this process would take about 30 days for a question answer. But the answer was worth it.
1:15:08
The answer that he would give, I would be, it's like, I was amazed how the hell is he giving this kind of a, he knew every detail of what am I doing
1:15:14
sitting in my puja room? How many hours am I sitting? What deity am I worshiping? How am I sitting? What changes are happening?
1:15:21
What thought is flashing through my head? Suddenly he says that, one day he sends, so and so date you were doing something
1:15:27
and this particular thought came that you should do this mantra but you did not do, why did you not do? You should do it. Doing this, this, this, you do it.
1:15:33
You will see this, this result. The guy doesn't know-- I don't know how he looks. I don't know what is his name, nothing.
1:15:41
We've had a lot of monks who've come on the show. And one of the monks said that people often think
1:15:47
that monks are not ambitious people. But the truth is that they're the most ambitious people. They're so ambitious that they've left the material realm.
1:15:54
And I'd understood it. I didn't think that I had the right to say the truth that you just shared
1:16:00
on the internet. So, I'm glad that you're shedding light upon these concepts. -This is why monks choose a monk's life. -Yes.
1:16:08
Or rather, this is why the monk's soul chooses that particular body
1:16:13
-for that journey. -Yes. Because that soul knows that I've already come so far. -Now I don't want marriage. -Yeah.
1:16:21
-I don't want kids. -Yeah. I don't want a career. I just want to go to that higher realm.
1:16:26
Only difference between this and the material realm ambition, is that, so this is also ambition.
1:16:32
So, see, we worship the goddess, one of the most powerful forms of the goddess is Kameshwari.
1:16:37
Kameshwari is what? The controller of all desires. Without desire, no realm is going to run. Whether it's physical, astral, this that.
1:16:44
She is the one who holds the reins of all desires everywhere and only it is because of desire.
1:16:49
You may be meditating in the Himalayas For 10,000 years and suddenly there is this spark of desire
1:16:55
that comes in, immediately evolution. The world runs, cycles run because of desire. And she is the mother of all desires.
1:17:01
She's the controller of all desires. She's the Maha Tripura Sundari. She controls everything. When you pray to her,
1:17:06
your desires go away? No, that's more complicated. [laughter] Another podcast.
1:17:11
No, it can go away. It can go away to other-- But it’s not my-- The reason I brought this up is because
1:17:20
ambition in the spiritual field is perfectly all right, greed is not. That's one thing that happens
1:17:25
in the material plane very often, which is that I want it. I want it quickly, in double quick time.
1:17:30
I'll use whatever methods I want, and I am greedy about it. Greed is… Greed, dishonesty, you will not survive
1:17:39
in the spiritual realm. You will fall faster than you can. Because the beings you are dealing with, they know you inside out. They know you better than your parents know you.
1:17:45
They know you better than you know yourself. And we are human beings at the greatest capacity of self-delusion. I have seen so many characters like these
1:17:52
little experience, and then they'll dilute themselves into, I've reached this and that. But they know. They know how much honest you are,
1:17:58
how much you are making up stuff, how much your own pep talk, you are telling your mind that I am so and so,
1:18:04
but what exactly is the reality, they know. -So, you cannot fool them. -Okay. This and greed, if this is removed,
1:18:10
ambition is perfectly okay. What is the devil?
1:18:15
In Dharma, there is no devil. Is there Satan at all?
1:18:23
There are powerful negative entities, but there is no one single leader of negative entity. No.
1:18:28
What does Dharma say about pure evil? There is pure evil, pure evil Asuras are there.
1:18:33
But eventually they will fall when the gods decide that they have had their run and they see-- That is why the Avatar of Vishnu
1:18:39
keeps happening. Vishnu has not said that after this I am not coming, he will come when the necessity, when Dharma is completely trampled over,
1:18:46
he will come with a tremendous force and he will destroy the asuric forces at that time. Why did God create evil
1:18:52
in the first place? That's a very philosophical question.
1:18:57
There are various answers possible. One of them is that because the world is made up of dualities, always.
1:19:03
Everything will have a pair. There is day, there is going to be light, there's summer, there's going to be winter, etc.
1:19:08
So, this is sort of, like the creative process that it is. That's one way of looking at it. So, what I'm talking about is that
1:19:16
first understand that these things exist. Now, why do they exist? That's a question that is very difficult to answer.
1:19:22
Because there you enter into a realm of philosophy and speculation and you can choose which philosophy you like. You may believe in some other concept
1:19:29
that okay, there is no God who did not create evil, some other entity creates evil, etc. In our conception,
1:19:35
no, there's nothing like that. In fact, the realm of the gods, the great gods, Shiva, etc.
1:19:41
No negative entity, even has the chance of entering, even within a fraction of that space.
1:19:47
They're way high up. Way high up. All the negative, it's not that negatives do not exist. They exist. They're very powerful.
1:19:54
And they cause havoc, as we find in the puranas, they have. But eventually they get overtrumped
1:20:01
when they had their fill and they gain the capacity to do evil by the worship of the gods.
1:20:07
So, in a way, the Devatas, whom we worship, they're very high up,
1:20:13
way high up means, their realm and our realms, there’s a lot of gap. In order to-- The whole of Dharma, whole of rituals,
1:20:19
whole of Mantra, whole of Tantra, whole of upasana paddhati is a language of communication
1:20:25
between your realm and that realm. And with that, I will choose to stop this episode.
1:20:31
Because I haven't covered everything I wanted to ask you, sir. And I feel for the next one, we'll actually get into the topics
1:20:37
-that I wished that we spoke. -Okay. About on this one. But I feel this is a great prequel
1:20:42
to that episode -about ghosts and monsters. -Okay. So, thank you again, sir.
1:20:47
-Great episode. -Thank you. Any signing off notes, for the audience who've listened to this particular one.
1:20:53
I hope you enjoyed it. And these are wonderful topics. And I believe that if you think and you ruminate over this,
1:20:59
you contemplate, there are many things, you'll understand. Hopefully these may inspire some people to actually enter into the path of sadhana.
1:21:07
Forget the ghosts and all. Those things are there. But focus on the Devatas. If you focus on the Devatas,
1:21:12
It is a transforming experience -as you keep going. -Yeah. That's the hope from this podcast
1:21:21
and this team as well. -Yes. -That people get more inclined -towards meditation, prayer. -Yes, yes.
1:21:26
What ancient India was originally known, for knowledge, which I feel, has its own sort of meditation and prayer.
1:21:32
So, thank you again, sir. It was fun. -Yes. -And looking forward to the next one. -Namaste. -Namaste, sir.
1:21:38
As you can tell by this point, we had to split up this episode into two parts. If you've seen the first two episodes,
1:21:45
we've done with sir. Trust me, you don't know what you are in for, when it comes to the third one,
1:21:51
it's about Bhoota, Pret, and Pisach, etc. If you're from India, you’ll understand what those words mean.
1:21:58
That episode is extremely paranormal centric. All the episodes with Rajarshi, sir
1:22:03
are kind of paranormal centric, but that one will absolutely blow you away.
1:22:08
That's all I have to say about the next one. Don't have much to say about this one. Just make sure you follow TRS on Spotify.

0:00
I was there alone in the room um right in front of me there were two entities standing just imagine a human being but
0:07
without the physical body so some of them may have hunger some of them may have anger some of them may have lost various things Etc and for some reason
0:14
or the other they remain Trapped In This Plane they're not able to progress further what do they do with that hunger and lust Ah that's where the trouble
0:21
comes in okay so if uh if they're agitated then they they are going to
0:27
cause trouble to somebody other who may be around that same space and what's a
0:33
stupid way of inviting them to you oh there are so many ways a either you are one of those people who are like an
0:40
exorcist then enter into that but that is formal proper trained and entering
0:45
which is very different so somebody who's an exorcist knows how to protect himself what needs to be done Etc and
0:51
perhaps his Destiny is that he has to enter into that field for other people straight away do
0:58
Persona of the main date is know how to protect yourself in case there is an overlap and interaction sometimes that
1:04
happens that is the best an average human being can do this episode with rajashi nandi sir is the finale of our
1:11
Trilogy on Tantra and the occult if you haven't seen the first two episodes of course I do wish you go
1:19
check them out but even if you haven't this one in itself will create a very big impact in your psyche it will change
1:27
you kind of questions I've asked him the kind of answers that sir has given us
1:33
it's gonna stay with you for a very long time it's a very dark episode if you're watching this at night just be
1:40
a little careful um my intention with releasing this kind of content online is never to add more
1:48
Darkness to your life I do want to educate people about darker Concepts according to Tantra according
1:55
to ancient Indian culture but there's no intention of bringing any amount of Darkness into your mind just learn
2:03
gain and move closer towards the light move closer towards goodness
2:08

2:20
Concepts like these what's said in the world of Tantra is that the more you meditate the more
2:25
spiritualized you get the more you're able to protect yourself from darker energies whatever that means
2:32
I'm reeling information that I've read in autobiography of a yogi from dough base to light from rajashi so himself
2:40
meditation not only will protect your mind in the long term not only will it
2:45
keep you stable it will protect you in dark moments as well
2:51
make sure you begin your meditation Journey a meditation app level is now live the link is given down below
2:57
and now I will let you slip in to this Tantra and horror special with
3:04
rajashi nandi so
3:11
[Music]
3:19
thank you
3:30
I have a feeling this is going to be the heaviest episode let's see maybe the darkest because the kind of stuff I
3:36
wanted to speak about on this one we touched upon it in the last episode right uh but I think this is the episode
3:43
where we actually unpacked and feel free to also share experiences on this one because the kind of path you're on
3:50
um experiences meet you yes uh and we spoke about beings on the last episode
3:55
we spoke about the nature of the soul in the last episode yes but I think a great starting point for this one would be
4:02
the higher beings which might be considered harmful and we've had a lot of people who've come on the show uh
4:09
kind of just touch upon those topics I feel when you're authentic practitioner you have a much more intimate
4:14
understanding about these beings these topics you don't need to expand on this answer if you don't wish to
4:20
have you come in contact with such beings uh So eventually somewhere the
4:26
other your paths will uh sort of uh not Clash exactly but even if you it's
4:33
unavoidable as a part so I am saying that it is not that you will have to actually actively pursue them you pursue
4:39
the upasana the practice of the deity you're worshiping but eventually as you go higher chances are that once in a
4:44
while you will interact with these beings and these entities I remember one instance I was uh for practicing I was
4:53
doing some practice and then suddenly I remember uh peculiar kind of heaviness I started
4:58
feeling and there were thoughts which were completely strange which means parts of uh murder suicide things like
5:05
that out of the blue initially I just rejected it okay it didn't pay too much attention dreams
5:11
started coming which were very negative now this state continued for two three days what kind of dreams uh very violent
5:18
kind of dreams of uh you know death destruction this that uh more of a kind of nightmarish quality to the dreams
5:26
where you are portrayed in a you know you see yourself engaging in certain kinds of very
5:31
harsh activities uh two days it continued most of the time when I was I used to keep myself busy to get out of
5:38
it work and other things office work stuff like that Etc but after the second
5:43
third day I felt that these none of this is my thoughts one of the first things
5:49
is as you go deeper into yoga know that half of in not half ninety percent of the thoughts are not even your own it's
5:54
just passing through various sources or somewhere else your mind it passes through your mind and you attach yourself to it and you think it's you
6:00
are thinking it so first thought that struck me very clearly that this is not mine because I I don't think like this
6:06
okay I know myself I know what is the standard pattern of my thoughts even if it's negative how far it can go I know
6:13
that it can't go beyond this Etc so that uh third day it was so disturbing that
6:19
uh um I was not able to meditate I was not able to do anything and there was constant bombardment in the mind of very
6:26
strong thoughts of extreme negativity violence death uh
6:31
this kind of stuff so I remember I came back from office and at night
6:37
I started uh uh Mantra of matara good
6:42
and uh for two two and a half hours I did full month with little bit of Puja
6:48
adminster after that another and after that I read a small fire ritual to matara why specifically matara because I
6:56
was worshiping her at that time okay okay I was worshiping Mata at the time
7:01
and uh after a point of the practice after a
7:07
point of the sadhana it reached a very very detached very beautiful condition with her
7:13
blessing creeper we call it I've reached a very detached condition so I could
7:19
like I was there but I was kind of detached from myself and I could see things which otherwise I would not be
7:24
able to perceive and that's when I saw I was there alone in the room um right in front of me there were two
7:30
entities standing okay uh one was significantly negative looking and
7:38
very short night but very negative uh kind of let me just look at the
7:43
appearance and you'll feel a little cringe could you could you describe the appearance a little bit no it's it's it's like humanish uh but uh
7:52
the vibe was very very negative the eyes were very specific like I was sitting
7:58
here and I think just a few distance from here was standing this guy this entity this being it was uh the feeling
8:05
that you have that it has a human appearance but it is not human when it's difficult to describe it
8:11
properly but that's the typical feeling that you'll get and you could feel that it's like dripping with negativity and
8:17
then behind it there was another entity which was very calm and it felt even more dangerous but there's this cold
8:24
evil that you have this sense that you feel like Etc Richard I at the time I
8:30
had no idea and I what those entities are but what happened was because of the force of the Mantra that I was doing
8:36
these were the ones who were causing this whole rakas in my head and things were and also yeah I was having a lot of
8:43
conflicts to suddenly out of the blue just like that fights with people which and fights over things that is not my
8:50
normal propensity I know that I'm a fight over XYZ but this is not what I am I knew it very well so I think to truly
8:57
understand what sir is saying you have to actually listen to the previous episode because you spoke about astral
9:03
existence which means that within your body there are three bodies yes one's
9:09
the physical body once the Astro body once the causal body yes and these bodies exist on different planes which
9:15
are present all around us in our realm as well is that fair to say yes okay absolutely where we exist also exists
9:21
the astral plane that contains higher beings right uh and when you are meditating you were able to kind of
9:28
access that plane or rather you're able to remove your brain's filter in some ways uh no these entities can come to
9:34
you for various reasons there's no specific uh rule hard and fast rule as I said
9:40
sometimes you maybe you may be your practice may be going very deep that's when they will come to interfere that's
9:46
a very typical strategy they have why that's their nature that just the nature it's so we think of
9:53
it from we rationalize things from our point of view that we are like this so if you put your hand inside a Tiger's
9:59
mouth five times out of uh five times you do four times it'll bite you because it's Justice nature to do so so there
10:05
Dharma as I was saying some of these entities their specific Dharma is to cause disturbance and they feed on that
10:12
in people's in peoples in people's lives Etc uh there are some beings who will
10:18
come and interfere specifically to those who are into practices other normal beings normal person they will not
10:23
interfere with if you're doing a practice that is when they will come and try to disrupt your practice the whole aim is somehow break the Rhythm the
10:29
moment the rhythm is broken your energy is going to fall energy is fall means you will not reach where you are supposed to reach that's all and we have
10:36
evidences of this in the olders if you read the ramayana you see that Lord Rama
10:41
was brought by Rishi vishwamitra because they were asuras destroying the AG guess so he asks a very young Lord Rama and
10:48
lakshman other please come and protect the against the fire ritual elaborate Vedic ritual of the worship of the Gods
10:54
okay and they come and they fight with the asuras and the rakshasas and they remove them so there are specific
10:59
entities whose role specifically has been since time since historical times since
11:05
ancient times wherever there are upasana worship of devathas going on they will come to interfere and depending on your
11:11
caliber that will be matched by the caliber of the entity that is coming by the way it is don't for a very for a
11:18
person who is starting the journey do not expect that some you are not vishwamitra so no rakshasa or Surah is
11:23
going to come so easily to you they influence they obstruct when there is a large-scale in terms of person are
11:30
happening which can have a strong positive impact on a lot of people that they will obstruct and the other is
11:35
sometimes they influence people and they influence people only those people through whom they can cause large amount
11:42
of Destruction they're not interested in one single individual they are absolutely no interest in you me as an
11:47
average individual you can go about doing your life and I'm talking about asuras which are the highest of the negatives in our Dharma there's nothing
11:53
Beyond this whereas in negative scale if you look at it that way but they will only interfere and influence only those
11:59
beings those people those entities through whom they can cause lot of Destruction which is why I think history
12:05
written that Hitler was being influenced by nasula because through him so much
12:11
destruction could be caused um while there's many more questions I have so I want to actually address the
12:17
Skeptics here as well okay there's a lot of Skeptics when it comes to topics like this my viewpoint about Skeptics is that
12:24
there is a place for skepticism in the world actually progress in the world moves forward often because of
12:29
skepticism when we talk about scientific progress material progress but when it comes to Skeptics about things like this
12:40
uh the argument often is uh either where's the evidence or these are
12:46
stories that encapsulate and capture emotions and then used to manipulate people and uh also it's like just
12:56
as a concept is something that's present in Minds that treat only science as God
13:03
now science is important for the world and it's a very um integral part of the world it's full
13:09
of Integrity science a very honest approach to life but it has its own
13:14
limitations that's why we have scientists in the world to kind of constantly break those limitations and see what's beyond me
13:20
this is about all the stuff that's beyond and of course when you're talking about stuff that's beyond it can be used
13:25
negatively then you can just go crazy with it but what's your answer to the
13:31
Skeptics watching the podcast at this point so uh in general
13:36
I never tried to convince a skeptic because I had been a skeptic at one point of time so I believe that it's a
13:42
natural progression on their own so it is not something that can be proved via arguments so you no amount of argument
13:48
is good enough to convince a skeptic uh because the mind gets said that okay I don't want to believe it don't want to
13:54
believe it however there are people who are Skeptics and who may suddenly have an experience and I'm not even talking
14:00
about a Divine experience this negative experience is even more dangerous okay uh have an experience and then they
14:06
suddenly as I said an experience that is outside of a normal realm of existence the react how you react to it how the
14:14
mind reacts to it is very different I mean you may end up in a State of Shock and that doesn't matter how much skeptic
14:19
you might be you'll still end up in a State of Shock yeah or if you're fundamentally very strong-willed you
14:25
will survive it but your perspective will change my answer to Skeptics is let your experiences lead the way rather
14:31
than the words you see in books right because there is a whole world beyond the world of books and literature and
14:37
text as well uh the world of intuition the world of creativity imagination but
14:43
if you still need proof for yourself let your human eyes and senses find the
14:48
proof go out and experience the world go out and meet New Perspectives absolutely
14:54
true the best way to do you know somebody is a genuine skeptic but somebody who's a skeptic with a sort of
15:00
an agnostic Viewpoint which means that you are not firmed up your mind that yes or no I will base it on evidence that
15:06
kind of a person if he or she goes out spend months spend you know go out meet
15:11
people I'm sure there will be a lot of people who may be delusional frauds but even after 10 frauds you may meet
15:17
somebody who's actually genuine and you may come across an experience which you cannot explain through rational work
15:22
okay to rational understanding in fact something like that is how I got changed
15:28
into I I used to be in just the average guy in college with no interest in this no zero interest in engineering
15:34
engineering College you're interested in these things then I um I had an experience once I was I'd
15:40
gone to the Durga Puja panel and uh Bengali Durga Puja is like it's more
15:45
both the religious Festival as well as a cultural Festival so everybody goes there so I was there I remember
15:51
um and I was looking at the year of uh with and for suddenly for a few seconds just
15:59
like my mind entered into some kind of a Zone and normally if you go to Durga
16:04
Puja you'll see that all there is sound and noise and things like that everything stopped cut nothing no sound and I could see the deity almost there
16:11
standing right in front and for a second it was it was real than anything I've ever seen just real when you can't
16:17
describe it and um very organically I asked for two things that if there's a
16:23
truth to these matters I would like to know and another prayer came out which
16:28
is more private which I don't mention but this happened this whole thing must
16:33
have happened for maybe two seconds or three seconds not even that right after that the rational mind kicks in and
16:38
rational medicine or must be an illusion of the mind okay this is impossible all nonsense you're just believing making a
16:44
stuff up and you never tell anybody because I is rejected from the mind he this must not have happened I mean how
16:51
can this happen this is obviously you know some kind of a delusion or something but strangely seven days later
16:57
I am sitting with a friend of mine and there is the friend's uncle is a very powerful very Advanced
17:04
capacity it's one of the people I consider as my gurus so his he had called up this friend and he was just
17:10
speaking to him and he says asks him that um who's uh so in Hindi he says that
17:15
who's there in a room with you is there anybody there so he says yeah just a friend is there just pass the phone to
17:22
him so he gave me the phone and I don't even know what to speak of so I just say namaste blood out and Namaste and he'll
17:27
say namaste and then he says I'll come to Bangalore for some office work uh meet me once okay and after I hang up
17:35
the phone my friend is saying that people come from far and wide to meet him and all that and uh so in my mind
17:41
there's a mix of curiosity what is happening exactly okay I officially I was more of the agnostic skeptic nastic
17:49
and non-believer kind of things but there was this curiosity that why do people come to him I said why did he
17:55
call him go and see but I went to meet him after a few days he comes there and he's speaking to me and um suddenly
18:01
I realized that he's speaking to me things that there is no way on Earth He Can Know About Me step by step one after the other one
18:08
after the other what is going on I thought this is some trick is going on this is mind reading must be some
18:13
hypnotism mind reason something like that because my rational mind is trying to justify that experience how is it
18:19
possible and uh then he told me uh in coming months XYZ things are going to happen
18:25
with you so yes things like that I have a restriction on mentioning his name in
18:31
public so that I will never do is very clear on that but he was a very Advanced
18:38
of the bhagavadi you have to explain the word again is one who does sadhana one
18:44
who does practice of the deity okay okay so uh that is where I remember during
18:49
conversation with him uh he gave me a mantra and said do this Mantra just
18:56
chant this month I was curious because once I became uh once I analyzed in my own way I analyzed and saw that uh this
19:03
was not mind reading uh there is nothing for him to gain from me so if I were to hypnotize you and mind you I have to
19:08
gain something why would I do it either I have to gain your appreciation but why would I want your represent you're a nobody I'm just a policeman there's
19:15
nothing there neither do I have a lot of money he's not asking for my money I anyway I didn't have that much money anything so why what exactly is this
19:22
happening then like just a thought came that uh okay let us assume for the sake
19:28
of assumption that there is a possibility of something beyond what I can understand through rationality and whatever my limited understanding
19:34
rationality is then I asked him that how how do I how is this possible so he said
19:39
that that is where the processes you do um he gave me a
19:45
Mantra to chant and um for a year I chanted kept chanting
19:51
nothing happened then one day I called him and said that uh nothing is
19:56
happening something has to happen I mean why will I waste my time doing this and so many other things in life to do okay and uh
20:02
[Music] I wanted some experience at that time I
20:07
I used to I started off so first of all my entry was like from a non-traditional background into this field so I call
20:14
always say that I was more of a lateral entry into the path of the Dharma in the
20:19
path of you then he said okay you do an anusthanam you do you take a sankalpa as I was
20:25
explaining means you make a promise to the deity that I will do so much amount of sadhana in so many days with these
20:31
these XYZ rules that's all and then you follow those rules and do it but those rules were given by him uh somewhat
20:38
given by him okay okay and somebody but it's still a more relaxed it was not very complicated you can make this very
20:43
complicated also the more tougher rules you put the greater and you succeed higher is the result you will get okay
20:50
but it was more of a thing that was kind of relaxed only thing was the timing was to be fixed every day at this specific
20:57
time I had to sit at night and it used to take me close to one and a half hours of Japan
21:04
so I remember even during weekends when uh that time my friends would come and
21:09
say okay let's go to a pub and things like that I said ah just wait for some time I'll finish it and then we'll go okay so I had no expectation that
21:15
anything will happen but just mechanically doing it but I took it more as a challenge okay these are the rules
21:20
let's see I'll do the rules and I finished it in 40 days it was
21:25
supposed to be 41 days I remember then it was a Sunday at the end of it the next day morning I um it was a
21:34
basically I had not the faintest idea who was whatever I am from the background who has very
21:41
standard idea of gods there is a Shiva is there mahakali is there because Bengal Kali is most popular and there's
21:47
Krishna is there when all that I have no idea who is this so
21:53
after the 41st day I'm standing outside and I'm having coffee and having very
21:58
beautiful filter coffee and I'm uh suddenly I see there are cars coming one
22:03
two three four five six seven eight nine and all of them had the different cars but not even a group together it's like
22:08
separate cars individual cars coming and each of them had this poster of uh
22:14
and wherever is not that popular in South by the way it's popular not as
22:19
popular as it is in some areas or Not by the time the seventh rate car came in I was stuck that this is something is
22:27
going on this is not normal this is something different because I have been here all the while I've never seen so
22:32
many cars that two of the of a name that is not that popular I can understand if it is some of the other deities or in
22:39
Maharashtra if it's ganpati I can understand very popular forms but there it is not there and uh just tracked me
22:45
in my head but I again rejected it I will take it too seriously it could be a coincidence after all I don't know that
22:51
night I was in the room sleeping and 233 I woke up and uh uh right in front of me
22:58
I could see a presence of the deity of bhairav
23:04
yeah which is supposed to be a scary form of Shiva scary because your mind is not accustomed to taking it
23:12
okay and I got scared I got full scared I was like
23:17
and remember next day I called him up my Guru can you describe what it looked
23:23
like no full I will not go into description just that he was standing there okay and I couldn't sleep after that okay just standing and I
23:32
actually see there are more uh more
23:39
things involved because so around Shiva or around bhairava
23:45
there are always ganas who are Ghana means who are basically uh the family of the deity who are greatly connected to
23:52
the deity and from that realm okay specifically for Shiva they are called Shiva ganas or rudraganas or
23:58
bhairavaganas so if you do their upasana properly and suppose you have some past life link or something like that is
24:03
there it is often the case that before the prime Pradhan devatas the primary
24:09
deity you are worshiping comes one of these ganas will come just to see who is it calling they don't mean you any harm
24:15
but just to check if you can't take their energy how will you take the energy of the deity okay but this is a
24:20
very standard thing what do you mean take energy take means you are able to see what happened that whatever that
24:26
entity whatever that being was there it is not negative at all it was means there uh I got scared I got scared and I
24:33
called him next day I've called him uh on phone and said that xyzer he said it's okay don't worry too much about it
24:38
if you're feeling too scared go and stay with your any other friend's house one two days and then come back it will be fine I did that one two days later okay
24:45
and um for few days I stopped the practice because I could not process Q what
24:53
happened but then there is some urge within me that says that no don't stop let's do it again let's see where it
24:59
goes where where does this stop where does this go like this I kept continuing to practice
25:05
uh so this was one of my primary first
25:10
experiences now what happens is when a deity when one of these great gods
25:17
any of this suppose by some miracle or something where to come with the full
25:23
energy full Shakti full power even passes by near you unless you are ready
25:28
for it unless your mind and body has the power to take that you will be in a record State because this is a
25:35
tremendously different energy in fact uh if you read that autobiography Yogi which you were referring to I think I
25:41
remember one of the chapters is a very interesting line when he's explaining about kriyayo and I read it long back he
25:47
says that if your body so if you know it's like your your body is imagine your body is like a 40 watt bulb okay and if
25:54
you put instead of 40 watt if you put in 100 000 Watts about what is going to happen it will crack it doesn't have the
26:00
capacity to take it the whole process of upasana is that you attain to the fitness where you can take the
26:06
interaction with a devotee without either having any kind of a year but what happens during the interaction
26:12
there's a sort of energy exchange no no then that depends that's again these are
26:18
all very so if if suppose you reach
26:23
a very high state that there is a actually a deity interacts with you he or she will try to transform you okay
26:30
into something more spiritual something that will take you to a higher zones okay that is one of the primary things
26:36
of deities uh if they come and by the way because this will be heard by a lot
26:43
of people there are many instances where people see deities they feel they see they see something also and yet it
26:49
causes no transformation in them okay they remain exactly as it is so these
26:55
topics are more complicated than they appear in what we can verbally explain properly that's why the necessity of a
27:01
good Guru uh to take Give an example uh see in this case so what happened is
27:07
after that experience my practice became more intense okay that's
27:13
good fine that's a sort of a blessing from the deity there are people I know who see deities who claim to have seen
27:19
and I'm not doubting them at all but it has caused not the slightest change in them on the other hand if you go back
27:26
and read the biography of a saint luxury ramakrishna paramansa so he sees mahakali once okay once this is and it
27:34
changes him into a saint it becomes complete transformed completely so not all seeing is same
27:43
that's why these things uh we enter into zones which cannot be explained verbally
27:48
easily and that is why there is the necessity of somebody a guru who can hold your hand and can you know correct
27:54
you or guide you or what to take seriously what not to get too attached to things like that
28:01
um wow okay uh you know can something evil
28:08
something demonic pose as a positive deity absolutely and it happens uh one
28:15
two cases I knew of individuals uh
28:20
they can pose sometimes they will come with a lot of effulgence a lot of light a lot of power and lot of things but
28:27
there is one trick to it trick means I I say that it happens to people
28:32
who worship now on the surface of it if you ask that why are you worshiping
28:39
they'll say I want Moksha I want Liberation I want to because of my bhakti etc etc but deep down what is
28:44
your secret desire what is it that you want so I am worshiping that I become more powerful or I am worshiping I want
28:50
XYZ some uh things are there sometimes your greed and desire is much more than
28:56
what you are allowed by Nature so what these entities will come they will first come with a lot of effulgence lot of
29:02
Etc these things and then they will give you
29:08
to some degree what you want they will tell you oh you want this I'll make you the best in the this thing Etc there is
29:14
always from deep within there is it's like this this principle that happens in the spirituality no possession can
29:20
happen without an affirmation from within um and affirmation is not verbal verbal
29:26
speech is the worst of the all speeches it's the most useless of all speeches in the spiritual field
29:31
there are higher Realms of speech where you don't utter any word you can communicate but verbal speech is the one
29:37
where you can lie and you lie not to the world you lie to yourself that is the worst part hundreds of people do that
29:42
all the time I am doing the Puja for this purpose that purpose but your secret motivation is something else and
29:47
as is your motivation so will be your activity to judge a person observe the
29:53
actions not look at the words words don't mean a thing deities don't care about your words they see what is your
29:58
secret motivation so these entities often can come to people because of that
30:03
if there is some motivation for something else and there is agreed to uh succeed fast
30:09
motivation and speed so you don't want to wait you want the faster path normal for a day
30:16
tube person normal the gods we River as the great Gods Shiva Krishna they are
30:22
not going to come so fast to you if it is happening very fast then get yourself checked immediately
30:27
either you are a good that's where you have to go to a guru you cannot do it yourself how do you find a guru take
30:34
your time don't be in a hurry you meet people uh see if their words are you know sort of
30:42
gelling with it but not just words see the energy is dealing with you and the other thing is important to note is that
30:47
who what is the guru parampara which means what I mean specifically it is applied to since we were talking we
30:54
are talking a lot about Tantra sadhara so in Tantra it is very important that who is the gurus Guru who is the guru's
31:01
guru's guru three generations of accomplished gurus has to be there it cannot there is no Swami Guru I don't know who my guru's
31:08
Guru is one day morning he got up and became enlightened it doesn't work it may work in some cases but then all that
31:14
doesn't work because a guru is finally like imagine a huge Banyan Tree Guru is
31:19
one of the branches of a fruit in that tree but that is connected to that whole thing ecosystem is there that is what a
31:25
cooler is that is what a whole samprada is the date is whose his Guru has worshiped and his Guru has worshiped in
31:31
fact you have to do the worship of the gurus is very important you have to do tarpanam to the guru sarpana means
31:38
basically a process by which you tell them that let you be satisfied okay there's a
31:45
method of doing it we do it for pitrus also ancestors and all that who have expired in the Hindu ritual custom after
31:52
a year or so or specifically we do tarpanam to them we do tarpanam to rishis also and we do tarpanam to the
31:59
gurus to the three generations of gurus it is necessary to do them it is necessary to invoke Their Blessings when
32:04
you are doing a sadhana so that they can protect you they can guide you they can ensure that the right knowledge is passing through you you are never alone
32:11
you are just a part of this ecosystem even after having great Guru still you may not progress because there is
32:18
another factor which is time mahakal he is the Lord of time until he sets the tone this is the time for you to
32:24
progress you will not go but still you practice I remember once long back when I was initial days one very Advanced
32:31
upasaka and I was a bit confused about certain things he told me that what if I
32:37
tell you that you'll never make any progress in this lifetime would you continue the practice or did
32:42
you leave it so I was like it was a rhetorical question I didn't answer she says that it's a very simple thing if the person
32:48
says genuinely if you say that okay nothing is going to happen you're wasting your time it's useless this
32:54
lifetime is not going to happen anything for you so then he may think uh what is the use of doing I have so many other things I can do he was not even meant
33:01
for it in the first place the person who can continue with devotion even when there is no sight of
33:08
the result coming that is the person who has a chance eventually of succeeding and this and
33:13
nature is a very good filtering process it may be the time when all the Sacred Scriptures
33:20
which were originally passed down to the samprada guru to shisha are all open in the internet yet the number of people
33:26
who succeed is exactly fixed not one extra will succeed you can practice as much as you want
33:32
somewhere the other something will happen so Nature has this very good filtering mechanism very good I mean
33:38
there is no greater accountant than nature in the world yeah I feel it's like kind of a river
33:44
and a dam that you can keep trying even if you're not meant to do it and then mahakal will come and say okay
33:52
and then the river will flow with Force yes uh you'll probably progress really
33:57
fast in the next book and in fact one of the things that happens often is that initial stages I when I deal with other
34:04
upasakas younger and they're very promising and good people the initial stages when they start it's it goes like
34:10
this very fast very fast lot of experiences you enjoy it suddenly it will come this Plateau that is your test
34:16
how many people 70 people will fall off in this stage because you'll get bored and there are other more exciting things
34:22
in life and I am saying this in a non-judgmental way it's perfectly all right if you don't like it I have never
34:28
in my life post anybody into vasana in fact my first principle is if anybody
34:34
approaches me try to get him off get him off if this still sticks around and
34:39
there are the propensities that he's meant to do it and is meant to do it through me that is also there he may be
34:45
meant to do it but maybe he's supposed to get it from somebody else so I am not there to interfere in that process then
34:51
I may give him one small what I feel intuitively or something like that and tell him and then nature will take care
34:56
if he's serious if if everything is in set six months one year down the line the seed will start showing fruits then
35:03
you can decide that with whether more guidance is required and how to you know go about interact and how to hand hold
35:11
Etc necessary things but not as a guru because that's all there's a word called
35:18
Serendipity it means that situations come together you know again it's the same thing
35:24
that's effectively what you're saying that when situations come together progress will happen yes when it's meant
35:31
to happen things will happen yes but um there is a feedback loop in nature so if
35:37
you just wait that when situations will happen I will not do anything right now then the feedback loop is such that
35:43
suppose you were you were to start a spiritual journey 10 years from now nature can put it 10 lifetimes from now
35:49
because you're not making any effort now um gotcha all right the key is to maintain
35:55
your discipline yes okay uh I have to ask you about those higher beings no
36:01
because that was the theme of this episode and you just touched upon it you said
36:08
and asuras yeah I will let you break down each of those starting with both
36:13
so very simply speaking what we call bhuta is uh
36:19
discarnate entities entities who don't have a physical presence body like that and
36:25
they may be roaming around in this plane some of them were alive also okay so their Tendencies are very much human and
36:32
they have their own sets of uh just like that human beings are they they may like something just imagine a human being but
36:39
without the physical body so some of them may have hunger some of them may have anger some of them may have lost you know various things Etc and for some
36:47
reason or the other they remain Trapped In This Plane they're not able to progress further what do they do with that hunger and lust that's where the
36:53
trouble comes in okay so if uh if they are agitated then they they are going to
37:00
cause trouble to somebody other who may be around that same space so I told you
37:05
this astral and the physical are overlapping okay like where the physical plane is which is this plane around us
37:11
astral is at the exact same place you just can't see what's happening it's like a piece of paper right on top
37:18
you've kept exactly another piece of paper and you're looking from Top it looks like one piece of paper but there are two um
37:24
and but causal is not you causal is much higher okay all right okay causal is
37:30
like uh you have to lift yourself to the realm where all these things they'll all fall off they also don't know see there
37:35
is just a beautiful episode of uh Swami uh tulsidas ji comes to mind there's a
37:41
load story so he used to uh every day he was a devotee of Lord Rama and he used
37:48
to go in the morning ablutions and all and Puja part finish and then the water used to come and drop under a banyan
37:54
tree okay and 40 days 50 days has been dropping under the Banyan tree and suddenly one booth comes from down the tree he has been staying in that tree so
38:00
the bhut says that I am very pleased with you because you are dropping that water I am feeling happy because there is a method of tarpana that is to be
38:07
done but to satisfy the spirits basically it's done sometimes but he was not doing it with that idea he had no
38:12
idea that there was anything in the tree it's just dropping the water the spirit comes and says that what do you want I
38:18
want to give you say that but I was not doing to please you because I didn't even know you existed because it wouldn't doesn't matter you still ask
38:24
and he says that show me where is Lord Rama and he says that if I knew I wouldn't be stuck here
38:30
so then he says that but I will tell you how you can go to somebody who can teach
38:35
you where is Rama since there is a ramayana satsang that happens go there you will see that the person who comes
38:42
in last and who goes at the very end a kind of a you go and hold his arms he's
38:50
pleased with you he will teach you Lama and that was to come in that form to listen to the
38:56
ramayana okay wow so the point of this story is that these
39:02
Buddhas also do not have any idea about what is happening outside their knowledge is just as limited as human beings but they suffer from that anger
39:09
and they suffer from that sometimes and they project that into anybody who
39:15
comes in their environment or they may project it into and those are specifically those are pitrus pitrus
39:21
means ancestors who have uh who are dead they're dead but they're stuck in a
39:27
particular realm called pituloka which is also part of the astral plane that's true they asked this is all in the astral Dominion so when our ancestors
39:34
dive they've not progressed to Heaven they get stuck in the astral not heaven heaven is fine rebirth
39:41
if they are not able to take rebirth yes for some reason or the other okay so they very often will take out their
39:48
problems on their living descendants because they have the strongest genetic connection and they are not even doing it consciously perhaps they they get
39:54
angry that anger anger will be felt with whoever is the living descendant of that uh being and what does the living
40:01
descendant do to get rid of there are rituals for this okay there are specific places where you have to go and do you
40:07
cannot do these rituals at home okay the specific places where the right kind of Shakti or power is there for example in
40:13
nasik is one of those Shiva temples where um certain kinds of ancestral
40:19
problems can be solved I mean the panditjis there the priests they know this then the various other places one
40:26
of the biggest places Kashi you can go but you not you can go also these kind of things are there without giving the
40:31
name of the movie and the reason I'm not giving the name of this movie is because that was the whole plot of the film okay
40:37
um they actually begin the film with the main actor trying to talk to his wife and she's just pissed off with him she's
40:44
not listening Etc and over the course of the movie the main actor realizes he actually died and he's a ghost and he's
40:50
trying to interact but she's not picking up on his presence and he's taking it as why are you upset with me right is this
40:56
the reality of that plane that sometimes when your ghost you don't even know that you're a ghost and you're trying to
41:01
interact but no one's interacting with you uh I initial stages it might be there is a
41:08
sense of shock in fact one of the brother Disciples of Swami Vivekananda he had written a very beautiful book
41:13
called in Bengali I read it life beyond death or something like that in English translation so he mentions this
41:19
sometimes death can feel like you are like right now you're here suppose there's a devastating earthquake that
41:25
happens everything is flattened all the people you know are gone whole building is crumbled and you just next like you
41:31
are sitting here around said next moment you see that nothing is there so that kind of shock and Devastation that will
41:37
hit you sometimes death hits like this to some Souls and then it becomes very difficult for
41:44
them to recognize or uh or accept the fact that they are not in the physical plane so they will try and find out
41:50
people or try to communicate or something like that they're not ready to accept it what are we as living beings
41:56
in their eyes that depends on who you are speaking about that
42:02
you tell me so so if there is a normal uh isn't uh
42:08
is an entity that is stuck somewhere after some time the realization does come to them that they are not in the
42:13
physical plane Etc but if they're stuck and I'm talking about only those who are stuck those are progress that's well
42:20
enough so they are going to cause disturbance to you try and block things for you and things like that basically
42:25
they're trying to draw your attention attention to the fact that they still have unsatisfied desires uh it's like
42:32
assume that you suddenly tomorrow you don't have the physical body but you still feel hunger what are you going to
42:37
do it's a terrible state you are hungry but you don't have a body you can't eat
42:43
various things like this so the rituals entail that in in in you know Dharma we
42:49
until that uh we offer pindathana rice balls and other mantras specific food
42:55
items on this specific tithies of departed ancestors uh things like that we do is there in a lot of cultures is
43:02
there a lot of Asian cultures were offering food to that yes um when we speak about these horror movies
43:09
or hauntings cases of hauntings are we talking just about Buddha or it could be
43:14
it could be there are more dangerous than that it's called the preetha which is very angry type of spirit before we
43:20
head into that Preta section you mentioned a very uh cool story about tulsidas meeting hanumanji do you think
43:28
that that's where the Hanuman Chalisa was created no I think the Hanuman Chalisa came in later on but definitely tulsidas ji got full blessings of Lord
43:36
Hanuman or because of that blessings he was able to produce such a superlative ramcharitmanas it's the amazing text but
43:44
it was definitely the blessings of Lord Hanuman was there okay um why do you think the Hanuman Chalisa has
43:50
this antique host power Ah that's because of this answer will again deviate from the
43:57
central theme of your discussion that's what it's about yeah so certain deities are there in Dharma who have two
44:05
specific propensities their excellent as protected date is Hanuman Lord Hanuman is one of them bhairava is another
44:11
certain deities are there number one number two they respond faster
44:17
certain deities are closer to the Earth plane then they respond faster hanumanji is one who is an immortal who's never
44:23
given up his body so he's here in this plane so he will respond to your pure please faster than others specifically
44:29
on certain areas now if you ask hanumanji I want to become the richest man on Earth you may not get that
44:35
because his domain is strength Power Protection all these things instant you'll get that if you have devotion is
44:41
correct okay same for Lord bhairava also he's he also protects very fast
44:46
on the other hand if you have to call Lord Shiva the Shiva swarupa Mahadev he
44:52
is in his samadhi it will take you nine ten lifetimes of calling before he responds he will be aware that you are calling but he may not be bothered to
44:59
answer so easily wow that is precisely the power of Hanuman Chalisa it's a wonderful thing
45:04
there's so many sadhanas that can practices that can be done just with the Hanuman Chalisa really let's talk about
45:10
endless things let's talk about this because there is a lot of young Indians who are very into the Hanuman Chalisa
45:16
including myself including sanjit like superb thing superb means superb thing
45:22
in fact in uh in in I'm talking from the uh from the tantric perspective also so
45:27
Hanuman ji is considered uh Lord Hanuman is considered in the tantric perspective is also considered as one of the
45:34
protectors okay with the viras there are 52 Vedas okay Veer means there are powerful entities who protect an area
45:40
any area it can be and there are these viras are modeled around the primary devathas so there is Hanuman Veer
45:48
their worship is very popular there is nursing who is basically on Lord narasimha which is the Vishnu Etc so uh
45:56
you invoke Their Blessings uh
46:01
whether it's a disease related negative entity whether there is a spirit related negative entity whether something else
46:07
if you keep doing Hanuman Chalisa with faith properly and there are sadness means suppose
46:13
suppose you want to you know just for 40 days somebody decides that I want to do Hanuman Chalisa so you every day you sit
46:21
and do at least 51 54 times 100 times Hanuman Chalisa it will take you one two hours but if you're fluent will be very
46:27
fast you do this you maintain certain basic rules syllabus is one of them required for getting a higher experience
46:33
of Lord Hanuman because he was the Honda brahmachari okay and you uh offer some
46:43
Etc and after you finish your uh hanumanchal is a recital say 54 times
46:48
100 times calmly sit down and meditate on the name of Lord Rama do this for 40
46:54
days you will have a transforming experience what do you mean calmly meditate on Lord Rama do you just say
46:59
Rama Rama just that name power of the name is superlative he is
47:05
hanumanji remains in this plane because he promised that as long as there is a name of Rama here he will be here
47:11
okay and he is one of this best protected deities is the reason why he
47:18
is so popular in response so fast in my opinion as I said I have seen people who are more devotees of Lord Hanuman than
47:25
even of Lord Rama okay though Hanuman is considered as a bhakt of Rama
47:31
precisely because he remains in the physical plane he has chosen not to leave this plane and go and that is why
47:38
he is very fast If he if is pleased with a devotion if he's pleased with your call and you are in trouble some of the
47:45
blessings and the beauty of it is that they are Gods so they don't have to physically come to you from wherever he
47:50
maybe he can still get you protection just one blessing from you and he'll be protected it's like an armor armor
47:57
absolutely okay protection from prathasachas uh
48:04
yeah so I had a very deep seated fear of the dark when I was growing up and
48:09
that's a big reason I was drawn even more to the Hanuman Chalisa especially
48:15
when I would say that I would you know I have I mean obviously I've learned the Hanuman Chalisa over the course of my
48:21
life but I began by reading it out of a book and when it was that line I would that's the book to my head saying be
48:26
with me probably because I was always drawn to these topics uh throughout my life and they also say that when you
48:33
speak about these topics you're actually inviting those energies near you so what
48:38
we're doing here and maybe even the listeners listening they are kind of creating a sort of frequency that makes
48:45
them one step closer to negative entries my Outlook on this is one going with
48:50
faith in God uh and two uh when you have knowledge about
48:55
Darkness it brings you closer to the light that's what I believe yes and the other thing is that in my opinion
49:02
generally uh so it is one thing to be aware that there is a presence of this hierarchy of negative entities there
49:08
because after uh so as I was saying Prieta is one of the most difficult more
49:13
Angry type of things beyond that there are other pishachas and all that those are very dangerous very very dangerous
49:18
let's speak out Peters now so so pritas are basically very angry type of spirits
49:24
very angry they are completely they're like you know having a mad dog tied up are they formally human beings uh they
49:32
could have been formerly human beings yes but they are in a very negative state where the karmas have been so uh
49:38
Twisted that they are in a very negative State and off and on they may even be uh
49:43
entities who have indulged in various kinds of negative practices maybe criminals very good passed away or yeah
49:49
tantrix who use uh very violent kind of deaths very violent kind of deaths like what
49:56
would be a very violent kind of well suppose somebody uh has an accidental death at a very young age okay or
50:01
somebody commits suicide or something like that uh those type of uh very non-conventional violent and dangerous
50:07
deaths can often end into making that Soul into a prata and therefore there
50:15
are specific rituals done to calm down the pratham in the family it has to be done by the family in which family he or she was
50:22
born okay lived otherwise they are going to definitely cause trouble okay all sorts of trouble what kind of trouble
50:28
first of all they can bring diseases uh they can cause if you're trying to work
50:34
something they can cause obstruction and they can cause accidents also to family members one of the things you'll see sometimes
50:41
if it's a very negative entity negative kind of whatever you try to do they're going to cause an obstruction and things
50:47
will start turning negative you know whatever your effort is it will instead of producing the right result it's going
50:53
to produce a wrong result and you'll see that out of the blue things are happening even after your best effort
50:58
suddenly there's something it's like like uh you may even feel that perhaps it's not your destiny like weirdly uh
51:05
you know strange negative and occurrences happen at a very close frequency and even that is not a final
51:12
sign that it is you will have to still take advice from somebody who's capable in these things to to tell you even
51:19
judging of horoscopes can jyotisha can tell you if there is a problem from a prata and things like
51:26
that how do you know as an everyday human that you're coming in contact with one and moreover you know again when we
51:32
speak about these hauntings when you go to a house and some things are troubling you like they've shown this in Conjuring
51:37
and that whole Conjuring movie series as well but those praitas uh I haven't seen the movie so I can't
51:45
exactly comment but many of the air so from our perspective many of the negative entities that come in their
51:50
culture would fall in some of these categories of prithas or Max to Max they
51:56
may go up to categories of pisachas I feel okay okay because beyond that
52:02
the entities that come in they are very they're so they don't beyond the
52:09
um so the other thing the pishas are also very dangerous extremely dangerous it's like a mad Bull okay complete mad
52:14
Bull can the prathas cause physical harm as well yes absolutely so many things
52:20
they can cause diseases this that Etc accidents scratches on you very negative yes uh perhaps but this is
52:29
more see these this is not exactly like a science so science means everything is perfect
52:35
in the sinsky only a Preta can do this no it depends on how much power how much negative power it has in it okay but
52:42
there are entities higher than that we can do okay can these things enter your dreams yeah definitely that's the place that can
52:49
cause a lot of harm yeah that's why very higher order yogis sometimes don't sleep they are it's not
52:56
possible for ordinary people but there are people who may spend 12 years 20 years never sleeping okay
53:02
pass through a very haunted for lack of a better word place can things stick on
53:08
to you yes why would they choose you over other people it's not about you it's just that you're
53:14
passing through there so you're there at the wrong time at the wrong place but there is nothing wrong anywhere so that
53:20
means that you must have had some karmic link with that entity some lifetime that is why you are there at that particular
53:26
place at particular time uh to end up in that negative state with respect to that
53:31
entity and what's a stupid way of inviting them to you oh there are so many ways
53:38
there are some people who are very stupid so they think that they will do some kind of those uh you know those
53:44
plus other Spirit calling see answers are all to not even step into those zones you don't know what you are
53:50
calling and you will know it at a very late stage if at all something comes in and they come in very easily by the way it's not that difficult if you keep
53:57
practicing for few days will start happening not at all that difficult but my point is this do not enter into this
54:04
zone out of curiosity a either you are one of those people who
54:09
are like an exorcist then enter into that but that is formal proper trained
54:15
in entering which is very different it's just like you are entering into an army you don't you can't just say that tomorrow I want to go to the you know
54:21
Army and start fighting so they make you go through training process so somebody who's an exorcist knows how to protect himself what needs to be done Etc and
54:29
perhaps his Destiny is that he has to enter into that field for other people straight away do
54:36
Persona of the main date is know how to protect yourself in case there is an overlap interaction sometimes that
54:41
happens that is the best an average human being can do because the dark is also very powerful it doesn't end here
54:48
if you go if you keep going you will eventually face lot of problems and uh
54:56
not only you everybody connected to you so they have this thing by the way uh to
55:02
cause trouble to you one of the easiest things is uh to your family people who are close they connect your father
55:08
mother wife girlfriend of his friends Etc somebody else gets into trouble you'll obviously get affected you are a
55:14
family member you are living in society you are connected to so many dots here even why how many will you protect that
55:20
is the thing with these things so have a basic idea of protection and that idea of protection cannot come until you
55:27
first do basic you start to pass then only all these things problem with
55:32
people is that they want these things but they neglect the primary root of this spiritual tree which is the the
55:38
person of the date is in the way it is to be done okay uh also so uh
55:46
they are more dangerous than uh pritas they are most likely entities who never
55:54
incarnated many of them okay some of them did which is what is known traditionally as Brahma pisacha brahmap
56:00
is basically somebody who is highly knowledgeable in these spiritual matters Etc but somehow they either misuse that
56:07
knowledge or did not give it or became greedy or something like that holding holding of knowledge uh not giving it to
56:15
one who is fit for it so the text Shasta does not tell you that randomly give the
56:21
knowledge to everybody uh but somebody who's fit for it and not to and still not the knowledge is passed on and
56:28
nature then there's a holding of knowledge and the hoarding of this vidyas then such entities can such
56:34
people can become what is known as Brahma they began as human beings they began as human beings but they're very
56:39
Advanced human beings not ordinary human beings okay they're people who are top class super sakas in their life okay and
56:46
then there are other of these entities which are not human at all which were not they're very dangerous they are
56:53
by and large the average conception and the imagination of war is negative in
56:59
the world all falls in this category only they're like mad Bulls
57:04
they will just attack and attack and attack things like that then there are various types of in there also there are
57:11
various types of things there's something known as some people do version of that also uh
57:16
known as just like pishachas are there something else Pisha chili It's a female form of the Vishal
57:21
which is some people do passion of that so they will come and tell you in your various things that are happening
57:27
okay but catches that there they uh they can
57:34
so if you're doing a higher upasana you cannot do these things the moment you start chanting they will
57:41
not come near they don't like the vibration of those mantras whether the Shiva Vishnu Durga
57:47
Etc immediately they'll go I believe this is what we call Gins as well so uh
57:52
now I'm I don't know fully but I have some idea of what the jinns are a broad
57:57
term to use the wide range of things from Buddha to everything they call fall under the Gin category in my
58:04
understanding of uh what genes are and um they're there definitely there are
58:09
ways to counter them work is ways to counter just like the uh protection I am not talking about
58:15
anything else that you know fighting them you know not to go into that domain and pick up a fight that's stupid
58:21
but self-protection is very much possible and self protection both for these entities as well as from jinns and
58:27
other things very much Possible only thing is there's certain differences in the way it is to be done where are they
58:34
oh they are they are confined to domains they will not they will not be in a room like this
58:42
can roam around they are confined to specific areas that have extreme negative energy
58:50
uh extreme negative energy very dark settings very fill the settings very
58:56
often they will be surrounded with extreme kind of foul order
59:01
okay these are there various other things those are experts they'll tell you more things but these are some of
59:06
the primary things a recurring foul order which you cannot find a source from which means that you your house is
59:12
next to some drain or something some drainage leak is happening now that you know where it is coming from you can fix it but their presence often brings about
59:19
a complete foul smell in that area okay and they are extremely negative they're unreasonable irrational you cannot uh
59:26
those entities you cannot um talk to or judge what's their interest in human beings uh influence
59:34
getting things done in the world everybody likes attention it is their way of getting attention
59:40
possibly also because they're confined to that one place that is there but also it's like spreading your uh uh power
59:49
power or influence so if you have power how do you know that you have power unless you executed you don't know your
59:54
power so it is their nature to cause these kind of disturbances if you are unfortunate enough to be in the vicinity
1:00:01
or enter into that zone and remain unprotected so one thing that I picked up from this
1:00:06
whole peshaja conversation is that angle of influence um what does that truly mean for the modern
1:00:16
city human or the material life-oriented human and are they
1:00:21
human beings in the world today who are rich famous successful powerful as a result of them listening to these beings
1:00:28
uh I can't say yes or no because I don't have any direct experience of I hardly
1:00:33
know anybody who's that rich so the question does not arise for me but otherwise um
1:00:40
in theory it is you cannot discount it but then I don't have any direct evidence to say that you know the rich
1:00:46
and the famous somehow the other are engaged in any kind of practices that have made them that
1:00:52
on the other hand there is a wide amount of popularity of this the occult aspect
1:00:58
of Tantra where you can influence things uh by specifically two classes of people
1:01:05
one engaged in politics and the other in films
1:01:11
you wait you're talking as a general thing all over the world uh India I'm
1:01:16
not even outside of India I don't know I'm talking about India and that's because why
1:01:22
um some of the maximum so in in technically we call this as prayogas means an application of a power
1:01:29
there's nothing negative in it it can be for anything so you are somebody's sick somebody messages [Music]
1:01:36
something like that I do some Japan for him okay that just a simple to the deity
1:01:42
I worship that please cure that person against you that's an application of power but their technicalities involved more this is giving a simplistic
1:01:48
understanding but there are more details understanding so this thing happens across India across India and all
1:01:54
temples certain places it happens much more than others namakaya it happens a lot uh ujjain it happens mahakal Temple
1:02:00
a few other places it happens a lot uh because I keep going there for my upasana or my own practices I keep
1:02:06
traveling to various temples so I get to see them so uh these two broad classes of people get these kind of prayogas
1:02:13
done very often uh either not only for positive aspects which means that to
1:02:18
boost their career and things like that but also very often to remove enemies from the path or side track of various
1:02:25
things so they do the full full scale of it where does karma come into
1:02:31
play karma is always waiting it's but the thing is that human beings are like that we if the
1:02:37
greed is like that we want it right now karma can well we'll see when Karma comes we'll see like that so there is
1:02:43
this you know the beautiful uh question that yudhisthira was asked um by yaksha yaksa is a kind of higher
1:02:50
positive being yeah okay in the lake in Mahabharata various questions were there very famous then he asks that what is
1:02:57
the greatest Wonder in the world says that every day we are seeing people dying yet everybody believes I am not
1:03:02
going to die um well this is how you operate in the world okay so same with Karma I just let me
1:03:09
get this done first Karma will see later okay okay um I mean when you use these things for
1:03:16
your own material ambition there's no free lunches in life right what's the outcome you are paying some price yes
1:03:23
what is the price you're paying so the question is I'm taking say I'm assuming
1:03:29
your question for from positive point of view positive when you're using it for career progression key
1:03:35
um you know matara come to me and give me more money what are you paying in
1:03:40
return first of all at any given point when we are praying to the deity as I said in
1:03:47
the in the I think the previous episode I mentioned that all kinds of avichar or Blackmagic start from the human heart
1:03:53
okay the moment you have the desire that XYZ has to be done Etc and then uh then
1:04:00
you go and execute it in a more in a manner that has higher chances of success that's all the the process is
1:04:06
showing it is not making a moral judgment it is not even taking responsibility of the karmite is your karma okay you make a mistake and you
1:04:13
will do now uh karmic repercussion is always there for everything there's no doubt about it one is that you worship
1:04:19
the deity
1:04:27
and then you pray to her there is no no karmic
1:04:33
consequence of a prayer you can pray but remember one thing you
1:04:39
are the one who is praying the one who will grant the prayer has complete right to reject your prayer also if that is
1:04:45
there in your mind you are free no problem but the moment you want no I am not satisfied with the prayer I need an
1:04:52
exact execution of this result and there are methods of doing that also there's not uh our our Dharma is brilliant it is
1:05:00
given absolutely stunning methods D to Z depending on where you are so there will be a consequence of that
1:05:07
some payment somebody is very sick somebody is having a trouble uh somebody uh having a specific problem and to
1:05:15
remove that problem say another individual does prayoga of a of a very
1:05:20
powerful mahavidya one of the most powerful popular mahavidyas
1:05:26
results also come but some consequence this person will have to face whether he gets an injury he gets some issues at
1:05:32
the other because the balancing of nature will always happen the one way to get out of this which is very difficult is that you first attend
1:05:39
to a connection with one of the your ishta devatha and you do a prayoga not for smaller
1:05:46
material gains it's only when there's a permission from the deity deity says that you can do this
1:05:52
then you know that he or she is going to take care of the karma it's not your headache your your job at the highest stages of sadhana your job is to blindly
1:06:00
follow what the devatha is telling you but higher stages initial stages you don't have any contact you don't understand only what the rate is trying
1:06:06
to say but yes I have seen some people who are very good in helping others and
1:06:11
they're doing positive things by the way okay somebody is sick somebody's not getting a job somebody has a lot of loans things like that and they do
1:06:17
normal upasana of their deity and they try to help those people help also happens miraculously help happens but
1:06:23
there is always a karmic payback on their own lives always either they will fall sick or
1:06:30
something or the other um these things happen I mean this is the way it is there are no free lunches in
1:06:36
nature once you understand that then the intelligence is to know that can you
1:06:42
handle that Karma before even entering into that somebody's throwing a ball at you one of my gurus is to somebody's
1:06:48
throwing a ball at full space first you know that can you hand hold that ball it should not be the case that just to help
1:06:55
somebody you only end up in the you know Dire Straits in the worst conditions there's no intelligence in that yeah so
1:07:01
you understand who it is that you're trying to help what kind of karmas that person is and whether you can sustain the impact
1:07:07
of it okay okay mentioned in Mahabharata as well right
1:07:13
same thing same thing only thing is that they are very unlikely to come today directly back when they mentioned
1:07:20
bakasur who used to eat yes food as well as human beings it was in a physical form in a physical form and not some of
1:07:27
the surahs were not even physical also it may have been at a time when a very ancient time of the rishis see uh they
1:07:34
used to come in the physical form when the human beings were of that caliber today if an Asura were to Incarnate
1:07:40
there's nobody will be able to stand no human being has that capacity only yeah and I'm talking about not just you me
1:07:45
I'm talking about the people who are the best Saints even they can't handle their power they have such a raw power you can
1:07:51
imagine the story of the asuras when the Devi Mahatma if you read which is a text of MAA Durga and she's fighting
1:07:57
mahishasura the battle goes on for 100 years 100 years she is fighting is this an
1:08:03
astral battle consider it an astral battle that happened before uh humans of this era populated but uh had blessings
1:08:11
from God so he became very very powerful and uh and then the goddess had to Incarnate to destroy what do you mean
1:08:18
before humans of this era populated so what I mean to say is that
1:08:24
so the society as we know it today so it is possible that the time of the rishis
1:08:29
were very ancient I cannot say positively one way or the other but in the sense both in the physical features
1:08:36
as well as their spiritual physical emotional uh stamina and strength and
1:08:43
capacity was far more than ours okay also the population was far less I mean if you look at the population of the
1:08:48
world we are at one of the peak times there's been I think from mid 80s because of certain advancements
1:08:53
population graph has gone just like this okay population graph goes like this so
1:08:58
there are own consequences of that but we are talking of an era and specifically this mahishasura and all
1:09:04
that perhaps would have happened at a time when only a Selected Few rishis were there not even the average people
1:09:11
like this okay there's millions of years ago possibly I don't know I can't fix the timeline okay
1:09:16
but let's say that but the good part is that suppose you are a great upasaka you can experience that battle even today
1:09:22
of the great God oh yes the greatest person that but these that's why we say
1:09:30
that the activity of the gods are Leela Nila means it's a play even when they're
1:09:36
destroying the Asura they are creating an energy stamp so powerful that thousands of years six thousand seven
1:09:41
thousand years ago by remembering that story you are getting spiritually benefited
1:09:47
very science fiction oriented question but is it also a way of saying that very high levels of sadhna allow you to time
1:09:52
travel uh time travel in Watsons is there multiple senses no I I want to
1:09:58
understand what was in your mind when you say okay friends time travel x-axis Y axis z-axis
1:10:04
three dimensions time fourth dimension okay so uh time travel in the sense physically time travel yeah uh I don't
1:10:12
think I have no idea actually I don't think that's possible okay but uh knowing what happened at a very ancient
1:10:18
time accurate knowledge even if you were not physically present that is possible okay it's very much possible okay uh
1:10:25
in 2022 I don't think frankly I don't think that
1:10:30
there are any actresses here because I don't think that they have uh so they
1:10:35
will not incarnate in this plane their power is way too much and asuras are even more but they they don't incarnate
1:10:41
in this plane like that they're extremely powerful extremely one we
1:10:46
cannot even imagine they're like a god just like a devatha only in the negative sense
1:10:52
okay but they can influence people their influence is very much possible they can
1:10:57
influence the minds of people and do various things and from the plane they're setting in yeah yeah that they
1:11:03
can do in fact some people believe now I I can't either vouch for it one way or the other some people believe that one
1:11:09
of the things that Lord Krishna and Arjuna Arjuna was that caliber upasaka also it was not just a fighter it was a
1:11:15
great practitioner by the way so they ensured that the asuras do not get physically born
1:11:21
because they knew that the Kali yoga people don't have the power to take that so they ensured that the surahs don't
1:11:28
get physically born here other actresses don't come here physically but the influence cannot be stopped so there is
1:11:34
always a choice you have you want to follow that influence or not okay um there's a difference between the two but
1:11:41
yeah asuras are have a higher IQ let's put it this way you cannot argue with an Asura also it
1:11:48
will tell him one scripture will tell you 10 scriptures you will tell him one logic he is a master of logic he's a
1:11:53
master of the intellect he's a he's a being who has exceptional intelligence he's a being who has tremendous but
1:12:01
remember this thing they are not atheists they are not nastikas they they don't believe that there is gods they
1:12:07
fully know that there are gods but they want to do their stuff and Gnostic or what I tell a non-believer is
1:12:14
at the lowest rung of the person he's the one who denies reality which is fine I'm not even asking him to change what
1:12:19
his ideas but Asura is not one who is who does not believe in uh the Divine and does not believe in the presence of
1:12:25
the deities he is a terrific exceptional practitioner he has got that powers and
1:12:31
then he misuses it Powers he's fully aware of all the Realms he knows what his occult he knows everything he's equally confident and equally Adept in
1:12:39
the material rational world as he is in the spiritual realm how does he expect that he will like Escape Karma
1:12:49
uh I don't think they look at karma in the way we do first of all because the
1:12:54
other thing is that they live in Realms where time moves very slowly our realm time moves the fastest which means that
1:13:01
Maya or or the or the or on enveloping of the mind or attachment let's put it
1:13:08
this way you get attached to something it could be anything Etc so this happens very often in our plane but at the same time
1:13:14
progress can happen very well faster in this plane in few lifetimes you can progress you can go down also few left
1:13:20
hands but in those Realms time is very slow so there so in fact some of the asuriks some of the stories of the
1:13:26
asuras uh like coming back to mahizas was incarnated three times now by the
1:13:33
way there's an interesting thing about maisasura say that maisasura was an amsa was a part of Lord Shiva
1:13:40
see the player that's how our culture looks at these asuras they say that when the Great gods are involved
1:13:46
that is because at the immediate level there is a fight that is going on but the impact of that is still going to be
1:13:53
positive for the whole universe so Maisha Shiva says that how do I show to
1:13:59
the world the power of the Goddess so he incarnates gives the blessing a part of him not fully little bit of energy
1:14:04
projection and emanations from Shiva comes bonds and gets born in the family of an Asura he does tremendous tapasya
1:14:11
because without that power of Shiva he cannot do that kind of the person gets blessings that he cannot be killed by God he cannot be killed by human being
1:14:17
everything he forgets he mentions everything only thing he forgets is to add a woman okay so that one thing is
1:14:23
then used later on three times he gets killed not once three times in three kalpas three cycles of creation he gets
1:14:29
killed by the goddess Durga and in fact there's a beautiful section where myself
1:14:35
would actually before his in the second kalpa we call it the three culpas of death second kalpa when Durga manifests
1:14:44
and he he's an upasaka by the way he he's not he's not asuras are not
1:14:49
non-believers by the way they know the reality of these things they know fully so he knows in his meditation he sees
1:14:55
that he's going to die and he sees that who this great power is this goddesses okay and uh he goes into Rapture and
1:15:02
Bliss and he tells the Goddess that I don't want anything okay I am completely your
1:15:08
devotee okay I don't I know that this is meant to happen I don't even want anything I just want one blessing from
1:15:13
you that I should get offerings in the young girls so your guys are done for
1:15:19
the gods okay asuras you cannot give any offerings to them
1:15:28
has come by the way all these stories she says to him that I cannot do that
1:15:34
because if I do that it will completely turn the balance of the world Dharma will completely get rattled because the
1:15:40
yagya offerings can go only to the gods he said but I'll do something for you I'll give a blessing so that whenever
1:15:47
there is Durga upasana happening it has to be shown in that posture where her leg is on the Mahi sasura and she's
1:15:54
killing him and during the Durga Puja that actually happens in the mantras one Mantra is given to the Asura also he
1:15:59
says that by this act you will remain Immortal till the time there is Durga pasana that happens among humans and
1:16:05
then what she does she puts a veil on his mind so that he doesn't remember this conversation so that he can fight with his full force because if he has
1:16:12
this knowledge that he is who is he will not fight he is meant to die okay and then there is this whole battle
1:16:18
that happens and she kills him and that story till now is inspired and navratri
1:16:23
and everything that we do it's so beautiful so that when you go to the Karan jagati all this good bad Etc all
1:16:29
get balanced then there is no in our Dharma there is no one single Satan Divine kuchni nothing yeah wow you know
1:16:38
how uh young people say I'm trying to build Legacy in the world well even Asura say that yes
1:16:44
time immemorial and when we're celebrating yeah somebody remembering the Asura also
1:16:50
as a devotee of the and we our our second conception is that anybody who
1:16:56
dies in the hands of the great gods is liberated by the way
1:17:01
whoever in fact not just in in the case of this we see in the case of the Shiva purana when Shiva is destroying and
1:17:09
Shiva andaka is one of the asuras who has created very powerful etc etc and there's a lot of battle and beautiful
1:17:14
description in the Shiva purana how shiva's whole Army is going with Shiva okay the ganas and things like that Etc
1:17:20
at the last moment in the battle he pinsula and he lifts him up okay and Shiva at that time has become the energy
1:17:26
of bhairava the fierce form there and then in that condition the Surah is begging to him is saying that Lord I am
1:17:32
your devotee okay and that State uh then Shiva is kind he says that okay you will
1:17:39
become a devotee you will become one of my Gunners the people who are hanging out in around Shiva so that is a kind of
1:17:46
Liberation that is a kind of uh kind of mukti a freedom you know
1:17:53
um again do you think that there could be
1:17:58
possibly billionaires or world leaders who are being influenced by these I I can't say one way or the other I can't I
1:18:05
really can't say there is a possibility uh but one thing is there wealth has a corrupting influence
1:18:12
huge amounts of wealth average amount of wealth is fine but huge amounts of wealth extracts certain prices whether
1:18:18
it comes to health or something else or something like that wealth does have a suric influence on it and this is not my
1:18:24
word this is in those writings huge amounts of wealth not ordinary well the ordinary wealth is perfectly okay but
1:18:30
extreme amount of wealth when it comes there are always certain asurik influences that get tied with it what
1:18:36
are asurik influences uh Asura is trying to influence the environment for example if you have huge amount of wealth you
1:18:42
have to protect the wealth you have to end up doing certain things which are not normal or which you'd normally not
1:18:47
do and there will be places where you will do something that is adharma which is you know incorrect unrighteous
1:18:54
something negative things you'll have to do the moment you do one you're you are opening the Gateway so uh
1:19:01
there's a belief that huge amounts of wealth can also have certain amount of
1:19:06
acidic influence can it attract asuras whether it attracts the surahs or
1:19:11
whether they go and find yeah maybe uh
1:19:16
I don't know exactly but yeah a huge amount many obscene amount of wealth I'm not talking about ordinary wealth okay
1:19:22
the amount of wealth does involve negative practices and we we negative practices I'm not talking
1:19:29
sorry not talking about tantric practice and all that I'm saying that some of the other negative karma is there that gets
1:19:35
involved just to maintain that wealth as a protection in fact you'll see very interestingly that we worship
1:19:42
um mahalakshmi for wealth right mahalakshmi well so Lakshmi is not only wealth she
1:19:47
gives a sense of prosperity of well-being inside that happy space that you call about and use in today's language she's the one who controls it
1:19:54
so you may very well be a beggar in the road but if you have that happiness inside it is her blessing that gives you whereas there are beings who control
1:20:01
wealth specifically okay very specifically your controllers of wealth uh certain kind of reactions and all
1:20:07
that they guard those wealths very ferociously you will have the wealth and the condition that you will you cannot have
1:20:13
your peace of mind this is the deal with the devil thinking that this uh I don't know about that I'm
1:20:19
not I'm talking only from our perspective because I unless you study that properly I can't do a comparison
1:20:24
you mentioned that gandhar was and yes take birth in human form and then become excellent at something that they do yes
1:20:31
like maybe great music composers great musicians great artists yes yes great
1:20:36
what else uh depends great people of excellent knowledge in certain Fields
1:20:42
sometimes can be am I speaking to one statement
1:20:52
so but uh that's possible uh very often beings and
1:20:58
not just and all that being some higher Realms also can get born by the way okay even even in today's day oh yes even if
1:21:06
the karma is like that then for what purpose it could be various things uh sometimes
1:21:12
there may be something left unfinished to finish that off some karmic thing
1:21:17
there could be sometimes that some desire was there for something that needs to be fulfilled or sometimes it is
1:21:24
for as I say local which is that for the benefit of humanity uh somebody of of
1:21:29
the caliber of lahrimasha was the founder of Priya yoga it's an amazing caliber cinnamon we can't even imagine
1:21:34
why would a being like that I mean I am damn sure that he must have attained to his high States in past births only why
1:21:41
would he want to come down that is because this play can be created with Babaji and him so that this knowledge
1:21:47
comes to the people and even if five people are benefited that's good um do these beings know that they are
1:21:54
those beings when they are in their human form mostly don't they don't mostly don't
1:22:01
and what is the nature of reality no they will have to go through the process as I keep mentioning so moment
1:22:09
you're born nature is going to cause a filtering in your mind so you will not remember the past okay you will not remember the past and
1:22:18
just like any other person you'll have to be work through the whole process like anybody else but because of your
1:22:24
samskaras which is the tendencies that you have gathered through your past practices they will drive you into those
1:22:30
zones or these areas those practices once you start doing that nature will cooperate with you because you have done
1:22:36
these things in the past and there'll be an unraveling in fact a good eighty
1:22:41
percent of the spiritual path is just recovering what you might have done in past after that 20 new will start
1:22:50
portsmen possible I'm just guessing when I I it's not that I know everything about it but
1:22:57
this is the broad idea okay um one last question for you sir on this one
1:23:03
where does space come into all this the cosmos what's out there according to Tantra according to Hinduism what's
1:23:10
actually out there and I'm not specifically asking about aliens here uh generally I mean
1:23:16
if you actually just study the size of space obviously there's other life forms out there there's no way we can be the
1:23:23
only one that's arrogant to think that way etc etc but is there a role that space plays in Maya and Tantra in all
1:23:30
these things when we're talking about are there other planets which also have astral Realms that are home to these
1:23:37
beings I believe there are other planets that will have various kinds of beings who are spiritual in their way we may or
1:23:43
may not know about it and I think some of the references do come to us in our scriptures also there are multiple not
1:23:49
only multiple cycles of universes but there may be other beings it's not a about it uh space uh there's a famous
1:23:57
dictum that goes in yoga brahmandu or yeah whatever is there in the universe
1:24:05
is also there in the body now take it in the other since whatever is happening inside your body all these things that you say recognize that I have a physical
1:24:12
body the national body of a current Sharif that is reflected in space also
1:24:17
um fully reflected in space so this whole domain of the astral where all
1:24:22
this good bad etcetera going on okay and it's beautiful also by the way I still no need to take it as a negative sense
1:24:28
were some of the greatest pieces of art have come from the astral plane Inspirations from the astral print
1:24:33
beings who inspired people to create some of the greatest pieces of art legendary art art that is stand stood
1:24:39
the test of time for centuries after centuries those all come from the astral planes
1:24:44
so there is this domain there are mantras in The Vedas and the other places where they will tell you about
1:24:50
the there's the space then there's the antariksha and all that so this is a correlation to what is happening inside
1:24:55
you there's up to a domain is there in this space for example uh and I'm not putting so many kilometers and all that
1:25:02
reference where the astral plane exists where the thoughts ideas emotions
1:25:07
feelings good bad everything of human beings and all the animated entities are passing around okay you go beyond that
1:25:14
they silence Zoom everything is silent do the gods
1:25:21
exist yes the gods exist in fact in a very unconventional way
1:25:28
the one we worship as time what we call time the personification of
1:25:34
time the one who controls and holds time in his body is mahakal Shiva almost a form of Shiva and one who controls and
1:25:42
holds space is Vishnu these are the two entities so the more
1:25:47
you go it is like if you if you go into vaishnava theology you'll see that
1:25:53
there are Realms of vishnu's para Vishnu para Brahman who's greater greater greater greater greater greater Realms
1:25:58
from there he projects his Divine incarnations every cycle when there is a
1:26:03
balance that is lost in this plane okay so once you go to those realms is do the
1:26:09
great Gods play their role absolutely they're still there there's no doubt about it in that space and specifically
1:26:15
uh the concept of space I feel is very strongly linked to the personification
1:26:22
of the of the of the of the deity of whom we worship very strongly is Lord Vishnu
1:26:28
this is my conception I'm not arguing about it yes or no somebody doesn't
1:26:34
believe it that's perfectly fine I'm not even imposing it uh the other thing is that this has a link to the upasana now
1:26:40
space may be whatever it is most people if they go into space they'll go crazy there's no sound nothing
1:26:45
you have to live with yourself that's the most dangerous thing in the world so you you have to be you are alone
1:26:53
but not lonely that's the difference if you force somebody into being alone two days later they'll be lonely lonely
1:27:00
means you are craving for company somewhere the other is there no problem that's for that's fine that's normal that's human
1:27:06
but once you are you go into that zones you will know that there is also the possibility where you are swast you are
1:27:15
you are satisfied in yourself you don't need the single you don't have to see the face of a person and you will not go
1:27:21
crazy about it you will remain that same yeah perhaps you'll not speak you'll have to speak so much and then you will
1:27:27
have to but it would be a very Blissful existence it's a different matter altogether but it it's possible I'm not saying
1:27:33
everybody will do it and everybody should even try many people I know will go completely nuts if they are put into an isolation kind of thing but sometimes
1:27:41
it helps in upasana Sri aurobindo when he was put into jail in um
1:27:47
solitary confinement only the text he had was the bhagavad-gita and day in and day out history did not this face of a
1:27:53
person uh he could see nobody the month he stayed in there and during that state
1:27:58
he had tremendous experiences of Krishna and to the extent that that is like a transformative state that happened for
1:28:04
months he was he had no human contact solitary confinement in that era in British jail
1:28:10
is like strictest thing possible okay no human contact nothing absolutely no
1:28:16
human face day after day after day only one text he keep kept reading the Gita over and over and over and over until he
1:28:22
had a complete transformation and he had an experience of Krishna where he saw a state of advaitham Oneness with Krishna
1:28:29
he saw that everything has become Krishna even the Jailer has Krishna even the judge was sitting as Krishna even the even the jail the rods of his energy
1:28:36
Krishna okay and then he comes out a completely trans he's a saint comes out from there so uh space
1:28:43
has a link to this is the outer space there's another
1:28:48
space inside okay yeah that space uh it's very difficult to explain that but
1:28:54
if somebody enters into that space there is that is where the Divine the deity will
1:29:01
stay invoking the pranas okay inside the human body the most Divine part is only
1:29:08
two one is deep inside the heart deep inside mind you not the surface the surface heart has all sorts of emotions
1:29:14
desires likings disliking dislikings it's the emotional body it's useless behind that deep inside somewhere in the
1:29:21
yogic process somebody goes very deep uh you will attain Enter space
1:29:26
very different that's like a space where the gods can play that's pure enough to hold the deities but devatha will not
1:29:33
come into a place that is not pure it will not even touch that space and the other is domain this is where we
1:29:40
have in yoga called the Vishnu granthi you open that's not it's a guardian not of
1:29:45
it gets pierced by Shakti Kundalini call it or whatever
1:29:50
else you want to call it a Consciousness it's Pierce and then you experience something Divine Indescribable Bliss
1:29:59
gives you Bliss in the long run I'm not saying everybody who's doing is attaining to it then
1:30:05
there is rudra is here something [Music] um and not opens up and you enter a space
1:30:13
you go beyond time he's the controller of time maybe access to higher dimensions
1:30:20
it's not even higher Dimensions it's yeah higher but this is the highest Dimension this is the domain where even
1:30:26
the world is all this we talked about this they also don't have permission to enter those puzzles and if somebody has
1:30:33
activated either of these two either this is more difficult by the way to to open the rudraganthi and
1:30:40
experience that to open the Vishnu granthi and experience that space inside that individual
1:30:46
ever protected he can stand in the middle of 100 asuras they will not even dare touch him
1:30:51
because that protection is very different I have a thousand more questions in my head and I've got a strong intuition to
1:30:58
stop maybe it's just for saving content for later maybe it's because in this piece only
1:31:04
this much is meant to come out um I know all my questions and I can't see them you know so I don't know what we've
1:31:12
