      <description>tantra - upAsanA-technique, aimed at communion with the deity. Very little darshana-like philosophy beyond it. More focused on practice.
Origins
 shiva etc.. is said to be the ultimate source. Provides legitimacy.  Not some &amp;ldquo;revolt&amp;rdquo; against vedic system (see differences listed below). Eg. Feeding brAhmaNas (~ upAsakas in that age) important.   non-saiddhAntika stream of shaivism in kAshmIr, which focused on the bhairva arose. shakti-s started to get prominence in some substreams.</description>

      <description>TANTRA IN PRACTICE
Edited by David Gordon White
 As David White explains in the Introduction to Tantra in Practice, Tantra is an Asian body of beliefs and practices that seeks to channel the divine energy that grounds the universe, in creative and liberating ways. The subsequent chapters reflect the wide geographical and temporal scope of Tantra by examining thirty-six texts from China, India, Japan, Nepal, and Tibet, ranging from the seventh century to the present day, and representing the full range of Tantric experience - Buddhist, Hindu, Jain, and even Islamic.</description>
