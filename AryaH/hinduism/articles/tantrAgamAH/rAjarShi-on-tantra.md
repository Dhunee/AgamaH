tantra - upAsanA-technique, aimed at communion with the deity. Very little darshana-like philosophy beyond it. More focused on practice.

Origins 

- shiva etc.. is said to be the ultimate source. Provides legitimacy. 
  - Not some "revolt" against vedic system (see differences listed below). Eg. Feeding brAhmaNas (~ upAsakas in that age) important.
- non-saiddhAntika stream of shaivism in kAshmIr, which focused on the bhairva arose. shakti-s started to get prominence in some substreams.
- shAkta-tantras in the east (kAmAkhya area)

Differences

- Differences from saiddhAntika stream - Initiation was critical in both streams. non-saiddhAntika stream focused more on individual sAdhana than temples.
- Differences from vaidika stream
  - vaidika-adhikAra more birth based, with one initiation. 
  - tAntrika-s are not as birth-based. adhikAra comes via initiation - and there are multiple levels of initiations. 
  - tantra-s more suited for post-vedic changes in humans and circumstances.
  - Goal focus - possession by or union with the deity.

Classifications

- atimArga and mantramArga (go from one mantra-sAdhanA to another) split of early shaivism
- shaiva, shAkta, vaiShNava etc...
- kulas
  - shrIkula
    - southern
    - Avoids 5 makAra-s by using particular substitutes (anukalpa-s).
  - kAlIkula 
    - north and east

Instruction and practice

- Specifics are important in tantra. Even with regard to numbers (extra won't work) +++(4 Doubtful)+++.
- Guru and initiation are very important.
- Finding guru 
  - True:lunatic/fraud ratio is like 1:4.
  - Talk to many sampradƒÅyas - but don't be in a hurry to take a decision. 
  - Start practicing mantra-s (~1 hr daily) which don't need initiation. 
  - Multiple guru-s possible.
- Basic jyotiSha-knowledge (esp tithi-s) is vital in sankalpa-s for sAdhanA, prayoga-s
- AchAra progression (not necessarily in 1 lifetime)
  - vedAchAra
  - vaiShNavAchAra, shaivAchAra etc.. for initiates
  - daxiNAchAra. mantrasAdhanA, homas, tarpaNas, abhiSheka, feeding.
  - vAmAchAra. 5 makAra-s. 
    - Only for adhikArins. Can harm.
    - Only for particular deities. 
    - Ritual purification etc.. is needed. Not consumption based.
    - Idea is that the deity should be able to manifest in all 3 guNas (not just sattva).
  - vIrAchAra
    - Practice in liminal spaces (cremation grounds, caves, mountains etc..). Use of skulls.
- Initiate classification
  - pashu
  - vIra
    - Most instructions aimed at them.
  - divya (already in communion with the deity)
- mantra-progressions
  - 7 crore mantras from 5 faces of shiva-s. Gives rise to AmnAya-s.
  - Guru assigns mantra practice based on practitioner condition.
  - mantra is the body/ father of the deity. Hence, for communion - purshcharaNa is important. 
  - shAbara-mantras are in local languages. Work very fast - but exceptional faith required; and it should be received from an adept who is "activated".
