Perhaps more than any other Indian religious tradition, Jainism has placed a high value on maintaining barriers of physical and moral restraint and self-discipline in order to advance on the path to liberation. The entire regimen of the religion&amp;rsquo;s adherents, at least as ideally conceived, has been oriented toward the ascetic quieting of the mind, body, and speech. The aim is to reduce and ultimately eliminate the flow of karmic matter, which brings about both the soul&amp;rsquo;s embod</description>

Lay communities of itinerant yogins and yoginis have been a vital dimension of Tibetan Buddhist culture from at least the ninth century onward. These com munities were almost always irreducibly Tantric in character, in their ritual and contemplative practices, their textual traditions, and the very structure of their communal life. Although much of our information about early Tantric Buddhist . communities in India and Tibet is fragmentary and heavily mythologized, detailed biographical and historical narratives that emerged in in later centuries in Tibet give a fuller portrayal of the nature of these communities, and afford us a glimpse of actual male-female relationships.</description>
