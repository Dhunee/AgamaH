      <description>Transmission Rituals
William Bodiford
Although the Shingon lineage of Kukai (774 - 835) and the Tendai lineage of Saicho (767 - 822) can be most readily identified as the Tantric mainstream within Japanese Buddhism, we must not overlook the pervasive influence of Tan tric rituals, Tantric deities, and Tantric symbolism on Japanese religious traditions in general. Even today fire invocations (homa in Sanskrit, goma in Japanese), for example, are ubiquitous not just in Shingon and Tendai, but also in Hosso, Ni chiren, and Zen lineages, as well as in Shinto (Japan&amp;rsquo;s so-called &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; religion), mountain asceticism (shugendo), and many New Age religions, such as Agonshu.</description>

      <description>Glen A. Hayes
The Vaisnava Sahajiyas were Hindu tantrikas who lived in northeastern India, especially in the region of greater Bengal (Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Assam), from approximately the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries. Many things about the medieval Vaisnava Sahajiyas remain unclear to modern scholars, including their origins, social standing, major personalities, esoteric practices, authorship of texts, and their continued existence into current times. Although much about their beliefs and practices is elusive - we have, for example, no existing written commentaries to help us in understanding key words and phrases, and apparently no living connections to the medieval teachers - what we do know suggests a truly distinctive approach to Tantric expression and experience.</description>

      <description>The Tibetan Practice of the Mantra Path
According to Lce-sgom-pa
Yael Bentor
The text translated here is an exposition of the Buddhist Tantric path written in Tibet in about the twelfth or thirteenth century. It was chosen for the present volume because of its relatively concise and straightforward style of explaining Tibetan Tantra. The uncertainty concerning the author&amp;rsquo;s exact identity, dates, and sectarian affiliation need not concern us here. According to the testimony of the text itself, its author relies (specifically in the section on the completion process) on the authority of Naropa.</description>

      <description>the Kularnava Tantra
Douglas Renfrew Brooks
Few Sanskrit texts within Saiva and Sakta Hindu Tantra provide as clear and concise a vision of basic tenets, beliefs, and values as the &amp;ldquo;Ocean of the Kula&amp;rdquo; or Kularnava Tantra. Traditionally regarded as the fifth section of the Urdhvamnaya Tantra, a work that has never been recovered, the Kularnava Tantra as we know it today consists of some 2,060 verses divided among seventeen chapters called ullasas or &amp;ldquo;waves.</description>

The text translated below from the Chinese, entitled Ritual of the Secret Dharanis of the Three Siddhis for the Destruction of Hell, the Transformation of Karmic Hin drances, and the Liberation from the Three Conditioned Worlds (hereafter, Ritual), is a short but comprehensive summary of the doctrines and meditative practices of East Asian esoteric Buddhism. The ideas and practices presented in this text cir culated in various forms in China between the late Tang and the early Song periods (ninth and tenth centuries), and became very influential in Japan from the twelfth century onward.</description>
