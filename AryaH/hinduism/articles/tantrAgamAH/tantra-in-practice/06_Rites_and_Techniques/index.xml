The Pole Star and the seven stars of the Great or Northern Dipper occupy a prominent place in Chinese imperial and Daoist traditions, and have microcosmic and macrocosmic associations on both the astronomical and the human scales. It was widely believed that the stars and constellations of &amp;ldquo;heaven&amp;rdquo; (tian) had ana
logues in the &amp;ldquo;under-heaven&amp;rdquo; (tianxia) and within the human body, and that events and conditions in one of these systems affected the analogous structures in the other systems.</description>

The tradition of Bdud kyi good yul (literally, &amp;ldquo;the demon as the object that is to be cut off) is a medieval Buddhist practice developed in Tibet in the eleventh century. Becoming widespread soon after the so-called period of the &amp;ldquo;new trans lations&amp;rdquo; of the Indian Buddhist Tantras in Tibetan, it was developed directly in Tibetan rather than imported from India and translated from Sanskrit. It is a syncretic movement that marks the confluence of Indian Tantric Buddhist and pre-Buddhist Tibetan elements that are clearly shamanic in nature, which together gave rise to a religious phenomenon with an identity of its own.</description>

Tantra in Jainism has two distinctive features: it is largely centered around the use of verbal spells or mantra, and Jain Tantric practices are aimed at improving one&amp;rsquo;s condition within the realm of rebirth rather than liberating one from rebirth. Although Jain Tantric rites, such as that given in the second text below, also involve the use of diagrams known as yantras, these play a subsidiary role com</description>

The Silpa Prakasa is the only surviving text on Hindu architecture that was written from an explictly Tantric perspective. Its author, Ramacandra, was an architect who belonged to a community of Kaula brahmans residing in the Mahanadi delta of Orissa. Composed during the reign of an obscure local raja, the text&amp;rsquo;s date can be approximated by the fact that its prescriptions are best exemplifed by one particular temple.</description>

      <description>Gudrun Buhnemann
References to magical practices are found throughout ancient Indian literature, especially the Atharva Veda. Rites of magic are a common topic in Tantric texts, where we often encounter them in a group called the &amp;ldquo;six rites.&amp;rdquo; This group represents a systematization of magical practices. Although elements of folk tra
ditions are certainly present, the dependence on brahmanical rituals is clearly evident.
The Mantramahodadhi (Great Ocean of Mantras), a Sanskrit text that prescribes the mantras of different deities and ritual practices connected with them, was composed by Mahidhara at Varanasi, in 1588.</description>

      <description>Sanjukta Gupta
To many Hindu Bengalis, Kali is the most important divinity. Identified with the great Goddess, Devi Bhagavati, she subsumes all other goddesses. She is held to be equal in status to Durga and their annual festivals, which occur close to each other, are celebrated with the greatest grandeur: feasts are held, gifts are ex
changed, and new clothes are worn in honor of the Goddess. Both Durga and Kali, facets of the same supreme Goddess, are fierce and aggressive.</description>

      <description>Richard K. Payne
Every Tantric tradition has its own version of the homa, a votive ritual in which offerings are made into a fire. In one form or another the homa is found from Mongolia to Bali, from south India to Japan. The homa is also a link to the Vedic ritual tradition and the broader Indo-European religious culture that includes Iranian, Greek, and Roman ritual traditions.
The homa ritual presented here is from the Shingon tradition of Japanese Bud dhism, specifically the Chuin lineage, which predominates in contemporary Ja pan.</description>

      <description>Gavin Flood
The Tantric tradition&amp;rsquo;s most elaborated source for the purification of the body and its ritual identification with the cosmos is the Jayakhya Samhita, one of the three most important revealed texts of the Pancaratra, the tradition of Tantric Vaisnavism, probably composed between the seventh and tenth centuries c.E. The Pancaratra Samhitas are regarded by the tradition as revelation and are di
rectly parallel to the Saiva Tantras or Agamas, though these were not recognized by the Pancaratrins.</description>
