      <description>Andre Padoux
The importance accorded to the spiritual master, the guru or acarya, was a general characteristic of Indian culture from very early times, and the trait was developed and intensified in Tantric Hinduism and Buddhism. It goes back to the Vedic period and is still visible in India today.
A reason for the guru&amp;rsquo;s importance may lie in the fact that Indian traditions always gave precedence to the oral/aural/verbal, rather than to the written, form of religious or spiritual teachings.</description>

The traditions concerning the Indian Tantric adepts known as the Siddhas (&amp;ldquo;per fected ones&amp;rdquo;) have long fascinated scholars of the Tantric religions. This reflects the great popularity of these traditions in the arts and literature of India, Nepal, and Tibet, and the fact that several of the living Tantric communities, both Saivite
and Buddhist, trace themselves back to the inspiration of the Siddhas. Although some of the Siddhas were no doubt purely mythical personages, many were famed teachers and adepts who lived in India during the last centuries of the first millennium C.</description>

      <description>Feeding Skulls in the Town of Sacrifice
June McDaniel
Skulls are widely used in Bengali folk Tantra. They empower buildings and grounds, like the relics in early and medieval churches. They are buried in tem ples, under the altar or in a corner, and they turn the building into sacred ground. They are also buried at the foot of sacred trees, and they make ordinary ground into an empowered meditation seat.</description>

      <description>David N. Lorenzen
The Mattavilasa is a one-act comic farce written in Sanskrit and Prakrit and at tributed to a Pallava ruler of south India named Mahendra-varman, who ruled from his capital at Kanchi from about 600 to 630 C.E. The principal character in the play is a drunken Kapalika adept named Satyasoma.
The Kapalikas or Kapalins are one of the earliest mentioned sectarian groups of Tantric adepts. Unfortunately no texts survive that can unambiguously be as signed to Kapalika authors.</description>

She is regularly possessed by the Hindu Goddess Vaisno Devi. Mataji maintains a small temple attached to her home, where three days a week she goes into trance and, as the Goddess Vaisno Devi, answers questions and offers cures for people.</description>
