Although Japanese Buddhism is probably best known in popular circles for its rich tradition of Zen teachings and practices, from a historical perspective it is plausible to contend that no form has had more of a pervasive impact on the overall development of Japanese religion than the esoteric or Tantric Buddhist schools known in Japan as mikkyo (&amp;ldquo;secret teaching&amp;rdquo;). Mikkyo was first formally represented in the Tendai and Shingon schools founded in the early ninth century, but its roots are discernible in the eighth century and its branches, to continue the metaphor, extend throughout virtually all the subsequent schools that emerged in the Kamakura period (around the thirteenth century), in particular in the Zen, Pure Land, and Nichiren schools, where its presence bore significant and recognizable fruits.</description>

Near the head of the Mahuar River in Madhya Pradesh, in the small backwater village of Rannod, sit the ruins of an ancient Hindu monastery built sometime in the tenth century C.E. On a wall of the veranda, carved on a stone tablet, a lengthy inscription praises the community of Saiva monks who built and inhabited this monastic retreat in medieval times. The poet speaks of the Saiva lineage called the &amp;ldquo;Drunken Peacocks&amp;rdquo; (Mattamayura) as a stalk, &amp;ldquo;free of knots, its strong branches spreading widely.</description>

The document translated here represents the views of Kukai (774-835) on ritual and power, and gives insights into his articulation of the relationship between esoteric Buddhism and the imperial cultic system of Japan at the beginning of the Heian period (794-1185).
