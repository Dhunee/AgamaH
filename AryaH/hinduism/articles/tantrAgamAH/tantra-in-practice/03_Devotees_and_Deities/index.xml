      <description>Raising Snakes in Bengal: The Use of Tantric Imagery in Sakta Poetry Contests
Rachel Fell McDermott
What is Tantra in Bengal? The Sanskrit Tantras important to the region since the fifteenth century list several central elements: selection of the proper teacher; initiation; mantra repetition; fire worship; construction of mystic diagrams (yan tras); image worship; the honoring of young girls as embodiments of the Goddess; cremation-ground rituals performed to gain mastery over death; and the notorious &amp;ldquo;five M&amp;rdquo; ritual, in which wine, fish, meat, a type of intoxicating grain, and sexual intercourse (these are the makaras, all of whose Sanskrit and Bengali names begin with M) are used in controlled ritual circumstances - either literally (the hero&amp;rsquo;s way), through comestible alternatives (the bestial way), or by enjoying mental substitutes (the divine way).</description>

In our endeavor to understand the Hindu scriptural tradition in its astounding variety, we have to set up a number of distinctions as guidelines for our analysis. But such distinctions should not be understood as so many watertight compart ments, because these hardly ever exist in Hindu religiosity. Two instances of such analytical preliminaries are the distinction between &amp;ldquo;ideology&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;practice&amp;rdquo; in the Tantric traditions, and that between &amp;ldquo;Tantric&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Puranic&amp;rdquo; religiosities or literary traditions.</description>

The text presented here is an inscription from Nepal, a praise-poem named Sar vaparadhastotra, which King Pratap Malla had hammered into the golden doors of the temple of the Tantric goddess Taleju in the middle of the seventeenth century. A public and literary text, the Sarvaparadhastotra offers a concise - if difficult - instance of Tantra&amp;rsquo;s deployment in one historically specific social world.
Mise-en-scene
In late medieval Nepal, the temple of the goddess Taleju commanded the skyline of the city-kingdom of Kathmandu, while her principal servants - rulers of a dynasty named Malla - commanded the world of the Newar people.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Shoot me into Krsna,&amp;rdquo;
Antal told desire,
and performed the rites that made it happen.
The poet known as Antal, who called herself Goda, lived in the early ninth cen tury, in the deep south of the Indian subcontinent. She performed Tantric rites of the Bhagavatas and described them in her poems, excerpts of which follow. Bhagavata theology and the stories of her life will introduce them.</description>
