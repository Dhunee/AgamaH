Tantric Mantras





Providing a systematic and complete overview of the highest scholarly quality on Tantric mantras in Hinduism, this book presents a summary on the nature of Tantric mantras, their phonetic aspect, structure and classifications. Additionally, it explains the metaphysical–theological nature of Tantric mantras and gives an introduction to their beliefs and practices. In individual chapters, André Padoux discusses the extraction and examination of mantras, certain characteristics such as their ‘perfect nature’ and their imperfections, and describes certain mantrics practices.

For the first time, André Padoux’s work on Tantric mantras is made accessible to an English-speaking readership. This book will be of great interest to scholars of Religious Studies, Theology, Indology, South Asian Studies and Asian Religion.

**André Padoux** has had a distinguished career as a diplomat and then as a scholar of Sanskrit, notably of ‘Kashmir’ Shaivism and Shakta Tantrism. He was Director of Research at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris, for many years. He is a renowned expert on the ‘science of mantra’ \(*mantraśāstra*\) and has published important articles in this field.

*OṂ*, that syllable truly is *Brahman*.

That syllable indeed is the Supreme. …

Knowing that syllable, indeed whatever one desires, is his.

\(*Katha Upaniṣad* 2.16\)



The vast majority of those mantras are nonsense syllables such as Hring, Hung, Hum, Phat, sparks from the blazing furnace of aboriginal superstition whence the system arose, or from the equally superstitious stores laid up in the Atharvaveda.

### Foreword

Gavin Flood





In the following pages the reader will find a systematic exposition and explanation of Tantric mantras as they have existed broadly speaking within ‘Hindu’ Tantric traditions. It could be argued that mantras are at the heart of Indian religious practice and although they have been studied both from the perspective of indigenous philosophy and through western academic disciplines, there is still much that can be said about them. Some twenty years ago Professor Padoux reminded us of the vastness of the subject of mantras and the need for us to understand Tantric theories of mantra, such as those that developed in the medieval period in Kashmir and elsewhere, and also contemporary practices and practitioners of mantra.1 The present book goes some way to filling that gap and addresses questions of fundamental concern to Indology, South Asian Studies, and the study of religions, describing what mantras are, showing how they are used in a ritual context, and presenting what the Tantric traditions themselves regard mantras to be. The purpose of this foreword is not so much to summarise the following chapters but rather to introduce the idea of mantra and to put the material Padoux presents into a wider historical perspective.

But what are mantras? This entire volume might be seen as an answer to that question within the remit of the Tantric traditions. Among the definitions listed in Monier-Williams’ Sanskrit Dictionary are ‘sacred text or speech, a prayer or song of praise … a Vedic hymn of sacrificial formula … a sacred formula addressed to any individual deity … a mystical verse of magical formula \(sometimes personified\), incantation, charm, spell. …’2 This is a beginning but these definitions do not tell us much about the nature of mantra, its scope or precise use. As Padoux has observed, mantras are in Sanskrit, they are conventional formulas transmitted through tradition, and are not made up.3 In the Tantric traditions mantras must be seen in a cosmological context and different mantras correspond to different levels of the hierarchical cosmos understood as levels of consciousness or speech, as Padoux has demonstrated. This association of mantra with cosmology is arguably the case throughout the history of Indian religions. The cosmos is understood as the flow of the energy of the word \(*vāc*\) emanating from its transcendent source and returning there. Mantras are both expressions of this word and means of returning to that source. Mantras, Padoux writes:


appear as privileged instruments for the return to the source of the energy of the word. More than that, a mantra is often itself a symbol or, rather, a form of this primal energy. It retains this pre-eminently in a most effective and practical form. But it is also alive with an inner force tending intensely toward the primal source of all speech, toward the Power which is the Word. Mantra, therefore, brings together both the practically effective and creative, and the transcendental and liberating, powers of the Word.4


Mantras express or embody principles, powers, or deities that are thought by the tradition to exist at higher cosmic levels. Thus to repeat a mantra is to directly engage with a deity and become located within the cosmical hierarchy. We might say that even if mantras are non-linguistic, as with the ‘seed syllables’ or *bīja mantras*, they are meaningful in so far as they serve to locate a person within the structure of the universe and they are drawn from the Sanskrit alphabet. As Padoux has shown, one of the characteristics of Tantric mantras is that the mantra is the sonic form of a god. Jan Gonda also makes the point that a mantra that contains the name of a god ‘is indeed regarded as embodying the energy of the god which is activated by pronouncing the formula.’5 This sound form of the deity is generally imparted to the disciple at initiation at which time the master \(*guru*\) empowers the mantra with divine energy \(*mantravīrya*\). The master illuminates the energy of mantra, says the *Mālinīvijayottara-tantra*,6 thereby bringing it to life and making it efficacious.

While Tantric traditions entail different metaphysical systems, they all share the basic assumptions about mantra and the practices associated with it. Mantra pervades Tantric practice from esoteric meditation on the letters of the alphabet to repetition of mantras that accompanies the general ritual sequence of purification of the elements of the body \(*bhūtaśuddhi*\), the construction of a divine body through imposing mantras upon it \(*nyāsa*\), inner or mental worship involving the visualisation of the deity, and outer worship where the deity is offered external substances such as flowers and incense. By repeating mantras the practitioner is attempting to gain both power and liberation in the belief that repetition will make his mind conform to the mantra and so imbibe its power. Mantras can thus be used for magical or daily purposes, as Alper has observed, such as locating lost cattle, and also for redemptive purposes such as ‘escape from *saṃsāra*, the diminution of the effect of bad karma, transportation to the realm of the god to whom one is devoted.’7 Mantras have been used for magical purposes such as attempting to kill enemies or attract women, and soteriological purposes such as uniting with the pure consciousness of Śiva in non-dualistic Śaivism or become equal to Śiva \(*śivatulya*\) in the dualistic Śaiva Siddhānta.

Mantras have been used not only in ‘external’ ritual but also in yoga and meditation where they are linked to the breath \(*prāṇa*\). This would seem to be an ancient practice and is found in Tantric Upaniṣads such as the *Dhyānabindu* and the *Yogaśikhā*, where the breath is linked to the mantra *haṃsa*. This comprises two syllables *HA* and *SA* which are thought to be produced naturally in the process of breathing and when combined can make the phrase *aham saḥ*, ‘I am he’ and *so’ham*, ‘he is me’, indicating the practitioner’s identification with Śiva. Furthermore, the natural respiration is thought to be automatically repeating this mantra in a ‘recitation of the non-recited’ \(*ajapājapa*\).8

Behind these practices, even within traditions that have divergent metaphysics, a model of the mind is entailed that consciousness conforms to its objects: the nature of consciousness is such that it is purified by focussing on a pure object or conversely made impure through focussing on an impure object \(driven by anger or lust\). Perception, usually driven by desire, reaches out into the world to grasp objects and then conforms or is formed by them. This is not dissimilar to the medieval Christian idea of extramission in which perception grasps its objects through the eye actively reaching out and emitting a ray into the world.9 Through repeating a mantra which has been brought to life by the master and filled with divine power, the disciple’s mind is grasping a pure object, thereby becoming pure itself. This is an ancient idea attested in the *Yoga-sūtras* where yoga is understood as the process of redirecting the mind away from this habitual conformity to objects of consciousness that it calls ‘the fluctuations of consciousness’ \(*cittavṛtti*\).10 This fundamental idea seems to be unchanged in the Tantric period and helps us understand the way in which mantras are believed to be efficacious.

One of the major issues is whether mantras are, in fact, language. On the one hand we have the view that mantras have illocutionary force in that to utter a mantra is to perform a speech act, while on the other we have the view that mantras are not speech acts at all for they are not meaningful. Frits Staal has presented a systematic argument that vedic mantras are not language in the sense of conveying meaning and therefore cannot be understood in terms of semantics.11 Mantras are connected to ritual which certainly has a structure or syntax but has no semantics, being a kind of evolutionary leftover from a pre-linguistic stage of human evolution. On this view, what is important about mantras is their rhythm and their location within a ritual structure, not their meaning. While this is not the place to outline Staal’s argument or to systematically present any counter-argument, the material presented in this book lends weight to the idea that mantras must be understood in the context of human meanings and the worldviews they inhabit. While many mantras in themselves do not have direct linguistic meaning, they are used within a meaningful human context of intention and purpose, the achieving of particular human goals and the expressing of hope for power or liberation in this or some other life.



#### The history of mantra

Mantras have been used for a very long time. They are attested from some of the earliest documents of religious history, namely the hymns of the *Ṛg-veda*, and may go back millennia before that. Mantras are attested in mainstream brahmanical tradition and are central to brahmanical ritual, they are pervasive in Tantric traditions \(the subject of the present volume\), and exist in the other indic religions of Buddhism and Jainism. Mantras travelled to Indonesia, China, and Japan and now to the West and related practices are found in other religions – *dhikr* in Islam as Eliade observed,12 and prayer, such as the Jesus Prayer, in Christianity. But it is in the pre-medieval and medieval Tantric traditions that mantras became particularly important in religious practice, with systematic teachings about mantras, the *mantraśāstra*, being developed. Indeed a name for the Buddhist Vajrayāna is *mantrayāna*, a term that could equally be applied to Hindu Tantric traditions.

The history of Tantrism has been well documented by Alexis Sanderson in a number of publications13 and André Padoux himself has written a masterful survey.14 A general picture emerges of traditions developing in the medieval period that held to a different source of religious authority other than the primary revelation of the Veda and the secondary revelation of the epics and Purāṇas, namely the Tantras. A distinction was therefore made between a follower of the Vedas, a *vaidika*, and a follower of the Tantras, a *tāntrika*, a distinction that operated across sectarian divides of Śaivism, Vaiṣṇavism and Śāktism. Within these emergent Tantric traditions were varying degrees of conformity to vedic values and traditions with extreme Kaula and Kāpālika groups, on the one hand, rejecting vedic, brahmanical values as mere social convention and inhibition that had to be transcended for a higher enlightenment, to more conformist traditions such as the Śaiva Siddhānta, on the other, maintaining the compatibility between vedic and Tantric revelation. Indeed, intellectuals in Kashmir such as the Nyāyika Jayantha Bhaṭṭa, writing apparently from his prison cell, towards the end of the ninth century, defended the Tantric revelation but within the boundaries of reason and vedic values.15

Within Śaivism, by the time of Abhinavagupta \(c. 975–1025 C.E.\) as Sanderson has outlined in his publications, alongside orthoprax and orthodox vaidika tradition whose followers were known as Maheśvaras or Rudrabhāktas and who worshipped deities according to the Purāṇas, we have, technically, the teachings of Śiva \(*śivaśāsana*\) followed by the Śaivas who have undergone an initiation \(*dīkṣā*\). The Śaivas themselves can be distinguished between the Ati Mārga, the higher or outer path of the Pāśupata ascetics, and the Mantra Mārga, the path of mantras that can be divided into the Śaiva Siddhānta and non-Saiddhāntika groups, particularly the Trika, Krama and Kaula groups. Both the Śaiva Siddhānta and non-Saiddhāntika groups revered different Tantras as revelation and differed as regards metaphysics. The Śaiva Siddhānta were dualists or pluralists who maintained an absolute ontological distinction between Lord \(*pati*\), self \(*paśu* lit. ‘beast’, ‘cow’\) and world \(*pāśa*, lit. ‘bond’, ‘noose’\) whereas the non-Saiddhāntika groups tended to be non-dualists, maintaining that self, world, and Lord are ultimately identical, the world being identical with consciousness \(*saṃvit, cit, caitanya*\) or an emanation, a vibration \(*spanda*\) of consciousness. These non-Saiddhāntika groups tended to be non-dualistic also in their ritual practice, denying a distinction between the pure and the impure and using impurity in a ritual context such as the consumption of alcohol, the ritualised use of sex outside of caste restrictions, and offering meat to often ferocious female deities. A similar pattern can be found among Vaiṣṇavas with the Pāñcarātra being the Tantric wing of the Vaiṣṇava tradition revering a body of Tantric texts generally called Saṃhitās, although here the element of impurity is lacking. The Śākta traditions similarly develop in the early Tantric period with the Śrī Vidyā focussed on the Goddess Tripurasundarī and generally conforming to vedic values, especially with the adoption of the tradition by the Vedānta and the Śaṇkarācārya of Śṛṇgerī.16

All of these groups use mantras which are a defining feature of different Tantric traditions. There is, for example, a classification of Śaiva traditions flowing from the five mouths of Śiva in his form as Sadāśiva, namely Īśāna, Tatpuruṣa, Aghora, Vāmadeva and Sadyojāta, each of these facing one of the directions and from which a Tantric tradition flows.17 Similarly, as Padoux describes, Kaula traditions or transmissions \(*āmnāya*\) are based on the directions, each transmission associated with different deities and different mantras. Thus, for example, in the eastern transmission \(*pūrvāmnāya*\), Kuleśvara and Kuleśvarī are worshipped surrounded by the eight Mothers, Brahmī and so on.18 While these classifications are idealised, what is notable in all this is the centrality of mantras and the identification of the deities of the traditions with mantras. Indeed, as Padoux shows in the present volume, great emphasis is placed on mantras in all of our texts, with details of how to form them, how to use them, and their fundamental nature as identical with or emanating from a deity. Thus Abhinavgupta in the *Tantrāloka* identifies speech \(*vāc*\) as the essence of a deity and as power \(*śakti*\) expressed through the Sanskrit language. Thus the alphabet from the letter *a* to *kṣa* expresses the inner nature of the Lord, outside of time.19 While these traditions somewhat declined during the colonial period, they have not completely disappeared and the old traditions of mantra are still current in modern India along with the revived or more recent uses of mantra by modern gurus, particularly as they have come to the West. In Kerala, for example, mantras are used by the Tantris, orthodox Nambudri Brahmins, in temple worship and they are also used at a popular level in the *mantravādam* to cure disease and snake bites.

André Padoux presents us here with important studies in *mantraśāstra* which are brought together for the first time in this book. The importance for Indology and the study of religions of his meticulous work cannot be underestimated. Through focussing on the *mantraśāstra*, Padoux has demonstrated in detail how a concept and practice has gripped the imagination of a civilisation. In the following pages the reader will discover the Hindu Tantric understanding of mantra and the implications this work has for future research. We cannot understand Indian religions without understanding the place of mantra and the treatment of the Hindu Tantric systems presented here also needs to be done with Buddhist and Jain traditions as well. There are promising avenues of inquiry for comparative religion, for in understanding human spiritual practices we need to understand the place of verbal utterance \(mantra, prayer, *dhikr*\) in their ritual and meditational contexts across religious traditions and thereby deepen our understanding of ourselves and the institutions we have created and inhabit. But that is a task for another day.

## 1 Introduction





The medium is the message.

\(Stéphane Mallarmé\)


Why study Tantric mantras? One may well ask. Why Tantra? Why mantras? The answer is that Tantra, the Tantric phenomenon, is not, as was first believed, a limited and bizarre form of Hinduism \(or Buddhism\) but a fundamental aspect of the Indian religious world. It has pervaded the near totality of Hinduism \(and of part of Mahayāna Buddhism\) since, perhaps, the fifth or sixth centuries: religion, ritual, theology and metaphysics, iconography and temple building, even the structure of the state, in India and in part of Asia, would not have been the same without Tantra. The first ‘non-human’, purely verbal, theoretically eternal, self-proclaimed revelation of the Veda, the *śruti* \(‘what was heard’, the Vedic revelation being oral\), which goes from the Veda to the Upaniṣads and so forth, and is followed by Veda-based texts \(the *smr̥ti*\), has in some respect always had the pride of place: it forms the basic orthodox socio-religious teaching of Hindu society. Another, scriptural, revelation, that of the Tantras \(texts deemed to have been revealed by deities\), came later on and progressively pervaded most of the Hindu world. It did not so much reject the other revelation as depreciate it, considering it to be of merely social value and unable to offer the same access to liberation or other rewards as the esoteric Tantric teaching.1 And it progressively permeated and often transformed the orthodox Hindu world. One may say without exaggeration that since at least a thousand years Hinduism has been very largely Tantric or ‘tantricised’, not Vedic. The Tantric revelation cannot therefore be treated as secondary. Even though many of its texts, scriptures and exegetical works are arcane and obscure, the presence of the notions and practices it brought forth, together with its vision of the world, is to be felt everywhere in Hinduism – possibly also because most of these notions and practices have deep roots in the Indian soil.

As for mantras, they play, as we shall see, an essential role in Tantra. There is no possible study or understanding of the Tantric phenomenon without an examination and understanding of the peculiar ritual use of forms of speech that are mantras. Studying them is therefore entirely justified. But before taking up the subject of particular mantric practices, some precision on Tantric mantras in general, and an attempt at defining their nature and role as they appear in Tantric texts, is appropriate. Over the course of time, the Sanskrit term *mantra* was used for different sorts of verbal or phonic ritual utterances. \(I use ‘utterances’ here because mantras are by nature oral, aural – not written.2\) The earliest mantras are the Vedic hymns, poems or chants. They differ greatly from Tantric \(and even Pauranic\) ones – even though some are occasionally used in Tantric rites \(in those of the Pāñcarātra mainly\). But are also to be found in the Vedic ritual meaningless syllables, the *stobhas*, which are akin to Tantric mantras; among these is *OṂ*, an utterance of paramount importance in Tantric practice and theologico-metaphysical speculations. The sort of mantras developed in *śrauta* texts \(that is, those based on the Vedic revelation, the *śruti*\) or those used in later Veda-based texts, the *smr̥ti* \(those of the *smārta* or *paurāṇic* form of Hinduism\), are also used in Tantric Hinduism.3 Tantric mantras deserve a special study because, however important ritual formulas may have been in Vedism and in later Veda-based Hinduism, the role there of mantras was never as great as in Tantric Hinduism, where they came to pervade all types of religious or ritual action and gave birth to an enormous mass of literature concerning their nature and uses and extolling their power – an ensemble usually called *mantraśāstra*, the science or doctrine of mantras. The term is not of very ancient origin, but is a current and convenient one. It is an important one, too, since it sometimes came to be taken as synonymous with *tantraśāstra*, also a modern term, often used to refer to the Tantric ensemble of works and doctrines: a ‘rapprochement’ which is one more proof of the fundamental place of mantras in the Tantric domain. The importance of these formulas in the Tantric world is also shown by the fact that an early form of Śaivism was named *mantramarga*, and that a traditional division of Śaiva tantras is between those of the *mantrapīṭha* and those of the *vidyāpīṭha* \(*vidyās* being female mantras, whereas a *mantra* is that of a male deity4\). In fact, all Tantric texts deal either entirely or in part with mantras, a literature whose first elements date probably from the fifth or sixth century AD, and which went on for centuries and is still productive today. Tantric mantras are also to be found in a number of non-Tantric texts, in several Purāṇas, for instance, and even in some treatises of *dharmaśāstra*, that is, works concerning the laws, rules of conduct and customary observances of the Hindus.

Mantras also play an important role in Buddhism, the Tantric form of which is often called *mantrayāna*. Mantras as used in the Buddhist context in India, Tibet, South East Asia and the Far East are a vast and very interesting subject, very well worth careful and comprehensive study. We will, however, not deal with it here, where only the Hindu aspect of the Tantric phenomenon is considered.

A characteristic feature of Hindu Tantric mantras, which differentiates them from non-Tantric ones, is the prevailing use of non-linguistic elements, that is, syllables or group of syllables devoid of meaning but deemed to be imbued with supernatural power and efficacy. These are usually added at the beginning of the mantra \(after the initial *OṂ*, which, except – though not always – in the case of *bīja/bījamantras*, is always there\) or before the final ritual exclamation \(the *jāti*5\) of the mantra. A mantra may also be a sound sequence entirely made up of one or several such syllables; for example, the case of *SAUḤ*, the mantra of Parā, the supreme Goddess of the Trika, or the Navātmamantra *HSKṢMLRVYŪṂ*, or the fifteen-syllable mantra of the goddess Tripurasundarī, which, in its more usual form, runs *HA SA KA LA HRĪṂ HA SA KA HA LA HRĪṂ SA KA LA HRĪṂ*. The whole Sanskrit alphabet, as well as each of its constituent phonemes, either in the ‘normal’ traditional order \(the *varṇasamāmnāya*, called in that case *śabdarāśi* or *mātr̥kā*\), or in the *nādiphānta* order of the Mālinī,6 are also considered and used as mantras.7

The presence of such syllables as constituent parts of mantras can be explained in many ways. But it has also been theoretically grounded in the idea that all syllables being Sanskrit phonemes are forms of *vāc*, the Word, the primordial cosmic power, extolled in the Veda in Sanskrit. They are therefore all imbued with the infinite power of *vāc*, which in the Veda was identified with the *brahman: brahma vai vāc* \(*Aitareyabrāhmaṇa* 4.21,1\), ‘as much as *brahman* spreads out, as large is the Word’ \(*R̥gveda* 10.114,8\), a notion that has survived in Tantric traditions. In Tantric texts, Sanskrit phonemes are often called *mātr̥kā*, a term translated as ‘little mothers’. But these are presided over by, and are discrete forms of, the Mātr̥kā, the divine Mother in her aspect as *vāc*, the supreme power governing the world, hence their force and efficacy.8 However, the power of mantras is not confined in any one of these phonemes: it pervades the whole formula. A traditional Tantric saying is *mantrāḥ varṇātmakāḥ sarve, varṇāḥ sarve śivātmakāḥ*, ‘All mantras are made of \[Sanskrit\] phonemes, the nature of all phonemes is that of Śiva.’ This principle does not prevent speculation on the particular functions and forms of efficacy of certain parts of the mantra, as we shall see later. One may add here that, contrary to the notion we have just seen that mantras are born from the Sanskrit phonemes, several tantras consider the *bīja OṂ* or *bindu* \(the sonic dot, *Ṃ*\) as the source of the alphabet \(and hence of the mantras and of the cosmos\).9

Curiously, considering the absolute privilege of Sanskrit in mantras – which are Sanskrit ritual formulas10 – one finds in some Tantric works the notion that inarticulate sounds, or ungrammatical Sanskrit, or Prākrit syllables \(whether used in mantras or otherwise\) may be considered nearer to the Absolute than Sanskrit phonemes because they are farther from the norm of articulate rule-governed speech, a speech that can be used for mundane, inferior, purposes, which is not the case of mantras since these are linguistic utterances, but not speech. This view was put forward by Maheśvarānanda \(a Krama author of the twelfth century\) in the commentary of his *Mahārthamañjarī*. The notion was upheld earlier by Abhinavagupta, the great Tāntrika master of Kaśmir \(fl. *c*.975–1025\), who wrote in the *Parātrīśikavivaraṇa* – PTV – ‘The supreme Lord himself has explained that an unmanifest sound is generally somewhat like a mantra’ \(p. 189\).11 He also said that the power of mantras rests essentially on the unutterable and inaudible ‘parts’ \(*kalās*\) of the subtle phonic vibration that follow the *bindu* in the *uccāra*12 of *OṂ* \(or of other *bījas* ending with *Ṃ*\) and through which the subtle sound, the *nāda*, of the mantra progressively dissolves into the absolute. Such statements may seem to contradict the privileged role of sanskrit phonemes in mantras; but all phonemes, whether Sanskrit or not, are deemed to be born from the primordial Word whose original, highest, aspect is voiceless, a voiceless Word pregnant with all the possibilities of speech, but silent. Silence, in fact, was always held in India to be superior to uttered word or audible sound, a notion that goes back to vedism: in the Brāhmaṇas, the *anirukta*, the indistinct speech, was related to the Limitless and its power. The superiority of the unuttered over the uttered is an ancient and pervading notion in Indian thought. This extolling of silence explains the traditionally acknowledged superiority of the inaudible, secret \(*upāṃśu*\), and still more of the silent, mental \(*mānasa*\) mantra enunciation or repetition \(*japa*\) over the audible ‘voiced’ \(*vācika*\) one.13

But the very nature of mantras, and not merely their utterance, is often proclaimed, extolled even, as being not only mental but also spiritual, immaterial both in their essence and in their *modus operandi*. This appears in the saying quoted on p. 3, but also, for instance, in a traditional semantic analysis \(*nirvacana*\) of the term mantra often quoted in Tantric texts. The Sanskrit term *mantra*, accordingly, is said to be made up of the verbal root *MAN* \(to think\) and the suffix *tra* \(used to make words denoting instruments or objects\); a mantra would thus be an instrument of thought – not of ordinary discursive thought, of course, but of an intense, effective, non-discursive one.14 A traditional analysis of the term more often found in Tantric texts relates, however, the suffix *tra* to the root *TRAI* \(to save or protect\), an explanation which understands therefore mantras as forms of protective or salvific thought. The two interpretations of mantra coalesce somehow in the oft-quoted formula: *mananaṃ sarvaveditvaṃ trāṇaṃ saṃsārasagarāt/mananatrāṅadharmatvān mantra ity abhidhīyate* \(‘A mantra is so-called because it is in the nature of thought and protection, thought being omniscience, and protection \[the release\] from the ocean of transmigration’\). This would not apply to all mantras, for many are mere ritual formulas: powerful, effective, aimed at specific ends, but not specifically protective or salvific. It is, however, valid insofar as it expresses an important aspect of the nature of mantras: their efficacy being symbolic is mental, whilst the power they are believed to possess is deemed to be of an extra-mundane origin, and is always – if sometimes indirectly – transcendentally oriented.

Mantras in general, but especially in the Tantric domain, have different forms or aspects: they are considered as existing and acting on different planes, and are put to various uses, both transcendental and wordly. They thus appear to us as having – and they do have – an ambiguous nature. This, however, appears all the more because of the diversity of *mantraśāstra*, which includes texts and speculations of different traditions or schools, extending over fifteen centuries; a variety which we tend to ignore, taking as a homogeneous body of doctrine what is in fact a conglomerate of often very differing views. This point is to be clearly underlined: there is in India no systematic non-contradictory theoretical or practical view of Tantric mantras. A synthetic presentation of the subject such as this one cannot therefore be more than an overview of different conceptions and practices – and even so it cannot altogether escape the risk of being at least partly an intellectual construction of mine.

This being so, we can nevertheless usefully, if not construe a theory of mantras, at least try to describe a number of characteristic traits of Tantric mantras.

The first point to be underlined is that mantras, basically \(and this is a generally held view\), have a twofold nature: transcendent *and* empirical. On the one hand, they are conceived either as being in essence forms of *vāc*, the Word, the supreme unique cosmic Power, or as being individualised powers, discrete supernatural entities,15 being in that case the highest aspect, the essence of deities or of specific aspects of deities; being even by themselves, intrinsically, deities – as is sometimes said, Tantric pantheons are pantheons of mantras rather than of divinities. Mantras also represent, symbolise, for ritual use, cosmic entities. They are also conceived as discrete supernatural phonic powers, ritually or meditatively utilisable to various ritual or magical ends, their power being that of their phonetic content: they are words of power. But, on the other hand, mantras in so far as they are ritual formulas invoked, held in their minds or uttered by human beings, acting on \(and through\) their thought and body, exist mentally and phonetically on the level of the empirical world; they are sometimes made up of words or meaningful sentences \(they may even sometimes be written\). There are, too, many yogic somato-psychic practices where mantras are imagined, sometimes visualised, as present in the body of the performer, acquiring thus a quasi-physical or physiological presence whilst still being considered as transcendent supernatural entities.16 Whilst they are perceived as human, they are at the same time divine, and deemed to be effective on different planes of the cosmos. This, one could say contradictory, nature of Tantric mantras appears clearly in many of their ritual, meditative, mystical or magical uses. The double nature or aspect of mantras was \(in the non-dualist Śaiva perspective of the Kashmirian Trika\) expressed in Abhinavagupta’s PTV: ‘Mantras, it says, are the Venerable \[Power\] of the phonemes. They are in the nature of the world as well as of the supreme Lord, and other \[deities\].They are thought and liberation. They consist of discursive thought as much as of pure consciousness.’17 This view, in spite of its theoretical general validity, is, however, not equally shared by all Tantric traditions. Views also evolve in the course of time, and thus this non-dualistic Śaiva conception, if valid in the non-dualistic Śaiva domain or in later Saiddhāntika works influenced by non-dualistic thought, is not the conception of earlier fifth to eleventh century āgamas.18

Here, another more general point may be raised; namely, if Tantric mantras are not only groups of \(often meaningless\) phonemes, but consist sometimes of words or sentences, how does one distinguish the sentences, words or syllables that are mantras from those that are not? The answer is that there are no formal criteria to define mantras: mantras are those ritual formulas or utterances that are pronounced as such by the tradition to which they pertain. There are indeed formal traits proper to mantras, notably the initial *OṂ* and the final exclamations – the so-called \(originally Vedic\) *jātis: namaḥ, svāhā, vaṣat., vauṣat, huṃ* and *phaṭ* – but these are not always there. The lists of tantric mantras or *bījas*, Dakṣiṇāmūrti’s *Uddhārakośa*, for instance, enumerate these ritual formulas but do not give any theoretical definition. When mantras are described \(as we shall see in chapter 6\), the aim is usually not to define them, but mainly to enumerate and extol mantras of a particular tradition and to disparage or condemn those of other schools or traditions. There exist, too, classifications of mantras according to their length, to their nature, or to how and where they can be used – of these we shall see a few instances in chapter 6. Tantric mantras are also deemed to have six characteristic elements: a seer \(a *r̥ṣi*\) believed to have seeen it first, a particular meter \(*chandas*\), a presiding deity \(*devatā*\), a seed \(*bīja*\), one of its syllables \(sometimes the first one\) and an energy \(*śakti*\) \(usually one of its phonemes\).19 To which is sometimes added a ‘wedge’ \(*kīlaka*\), which is considered as making it more efficient.

Let us come back to the different uses of Tantric mantras, and to the conceptions associated with such uses. Mantras are ritual formulas; their main use is in ritual. There is no ritual without mantra. All Tantric ritual actions are accompanied by, or consist mostly or entirely in, the \(vocal or mental\) uttering of mantras. Sometimes, when a mantra is uttered, a ritual gesture, a *mudrā*, is to be displayed, accompanying but not replacing the action of the mantra.20 Such, as we shall see, is the case in *nyāsa*, but elsewhere also. However, and this is important, mantras can be used without any outside visible ritual action being performed. This happens, evidently, in *japa*21 and in all meditative mantric practices as well as in the mental worship, the *āntara* or *mānasa pūjā* performed before the outer, ‘gross’ *pūjā*, which consists solely in the uttering of the mantras corresponding to the different parts of the ritual worship of the deity. So important is the role of mantras in the Tantric *pūjā* that one may well say that the *pūjā* is nothing but a play or display of mantras \(and visualisations\). The mantras used in this way in ritual are supposed to be directly effective. They do what they say: they purify, they protect,22 they cut, they transform \(water into *amr̥ta*, for instance, or the body of the performer into a divine one, or into one made of mantras, a *mantradeha*\), they bring about the presence of a deity in an icon23 or on a *maṇḋala*, etc.24 In this capacity, mantras are used in ritual to build up, constitute, an icon – the *liṅga* used in Śiva’s *pūjā*, for instance, is to be imagined by the officiant as the throne \(*āsana*\) of Sadāśiva: a cosmic imaginary structure is thus built up, all elements of which are to be mentally placed, using the mantras embodying these cosmic elements, on the *liṅga* which, in this respect, is a mere vertical piling up of mantras, but of mantras as cosmic entities.

However, when used in the course of a ritual process, mantras cannot all be considered as having the same status or nature. In most cases they are used as supernatural forces of different power able to effect specific tasks. This statute is reflected in the Śaivasiddhānta terminology where they are usually called *aṇu*, ‘atoms’, that is, limited spiritual entities. Mantras are also spiritual supernatural entities in the system of the seven subjects/agents of cognition, the *pramātr̥* \(already quoted above\), which extends from Śiva, the supreme one, to the ‘great lords of mantras’, the *mantramaheśvaras* and the ‘lords of mantras’, *mantreśvaras*, powers on a somewhat lower plane, then to the mantras numbering 70 million, all of which are deemed to help humans on their way to salvation.25

When mantras bring about the presence of a deity – in such rites as *āvahana* or *prāṇapratiṣṭhā –* when they embody a deity in their phonetic structure, they do not merely participate in the nature of that deity: they are the very essence, by nature supreme and unlimited, of that deity. Tantric traditions express this by saying that they are the *vācaka*, that is, what expresses, enunciates, and therefore causes the existence of the deity; the latter being as such \(in its nature and form\) ‘what is to be expressed’, *vācya*, by the mantra. In this respect mantras are higher than deities.26 But they are also, as already said, themselves deities. We see here two different visions of mantras, but visions which, though different, cannot, I believe, be entirely separated, for they are two inseparable faces of the same, ambiguous, reality.27 During the same ritual, a *pūjā* for instance, mantras are in some cases mere effective words of power, in other cases, the phonic essential form of a deity or of a deity’s bodily form or parts.28 Such is also the case in the Śaiva initiation: some mantras purify the ritual area, others act on the initiand’s body; for instance, by ‘cosmicising’ it by placing on it the different parts or ‘worlds’ \(*kalās* or *bhuvanas*\) constituting the cosmos \(which, ritually, all have/are mantras\). But other mantras, in the same ritual, appear and ‘function’ as divinities: in the initiation ritual of the *sādhaka*, the *nirvāṇadīkṣā*, for instance, the *maṇḋala* in front of which the blindfolded initiand is brought is said to be blazing with the light of the mantras placed on it – these mantras are luminous because they are deities. In the ritual worship, the *pūjā*, the five *brahmamantras* – *Sadyojāta, Aghora, Tatpuruṣa, Vāmadeva* and *Īśāna* – placed on the *liṅga are* forms of Sadāśiva \(visibly represented by a human face when the icon is a *mukhaliṅga*\). What is more, the same *bījamantra* may be the mantra of a deity and be invoked as such, but it can also be used during a ritual or mental process as the support of mental representations: this happens, for instance, in some uses of *OṂ* or of *SAUḤ*.29

We must note here that in so far as Tantric mantras are deities, they, like all deities, have a visible form that the adept is to imagine mentally, which he does in such cases as when he is to ‘see’ a mantra placed on or in his body, on an icon or on a *maṇḋala*. This explains why the compendiums of Tantric iconography are works of *mantraśāstra*. Their aim is to give the descriptions of the deities to be visualised \(*dhyāna*30\) in ritual, each description beginning always with the *uddhāra*:31 the description of how to ‘extract’ – compose, that is – the mantra of that deity.32

A particular and important case is that of the mantra given to an initiate who wishes to become a *sādhaka*, a reward- or power-seeking \(*bubhukṣu*\) initiate. This mantra is the means whereby he will reach such aims as he wishes to attain. He must therefore be able to master it so as to use it for his own purpose. This is done through a complex and sometimes long ritual process during which the mantra is worshipped daily as a god or a goddess: a *mantrasādhana* also named *puraścaraṇa*,33 ‘preliminary ritual’. The mantra is thus a means to a particular end \(mundane or otherwordly\),34 but it is also an autonomous supernatural power to be mastered \(a *sādhyamantra*\). Such mantras must evidently be perfectly adapted to their user and to the end he wishes to attain: hence the practices of selection \(*mantravicāra*\) described here in chapter 2.

Mantras, we must not forget, are also used in magic. The well-known six Tantric ‘magic acts’ – the *ṣaṭkarmāṇi*, killing, subjugating, causing dissensions, attracting, etc. – are all done with mantras.35 These are also used in amulets or written on the body to various magical ends: inferior uses, of course, but ancient ones, and still present nowadays – superstition dies hard.

More interesting than such ritual uses of mantras \(some of which we shall see in the chapters in this book\) and perhaps more worth mentioning in this introduction are some speculations on the nature of mantras, and on how they function, that are to be found in Śaiva texts of Kashmir. These are put forward especially in works of two particular non-dualistic schools – the Trika/Pratyabhijñā and the Spanda – and are therefore proper to these schools and must not be taken as generally valid. They, however go deeper than many others in the analysis of how, within Tantric traditions, mantras may be conceived and are put into use, of the source of their power, and of how they can be imagined to function. They shed thus an interesting light on some aspects of the subject and deserve therefore to be, if briefly, considered here.36

The basic metaphysical tenet of these non-dualistic schools is that the ultimate supreme Reality is the divine absolute and omnipotent Consciousness which merely appears as separate individual consciousnesses. In truth, in these ‘*saṃvidadvaya*’ systems, nothing exists but Consciousness. The essential nature of mantras being divine – that of *vāc* – is therefore Consciousness: it is spiritual power, and it can only be used effectively by an adept if he/she gets hold, masters, this spiritual energy, this power of mantras, *mantravīrya* as it is sometimes called. The nature of the mantra, in this perspective, is summed up in *sūtra* 2.1 of the *Śiva-Sūtras* \(ŚS\), the basic text of non-dualistic Śaivism, which runs: *cittaṃ mantraḥ*, ‘The mantra is consciousness.’ Consciousness, Kṣemarāja explains in his commentary \(*Vimarśinī*\), is that through which one becomes aware of the supreme Reality, that by which one realises one’s identity with the Lord. A mantra, he adds, ‘is not a mere conglomerate of different syllables. It is the very mind of the devotee who, through intense awareness of the deity of the mantra37 \(*mantradevatāvimarśaparatvena*\), is fused, identified with that deity.’ Kṣemarāja then quotes two tantras which affirm clearly the consciousness nature of mantras and the fact that they can be grasped, and put to use, only through the consciousness of the user, the *mantrin*, whose ultimate nature is also that of the divine omnipresent and eternal Power, the supreme *śakti*.

The next *sūtra*, 2.3, of the ŚS is: *vidyāśarīrasattā mantrarahasyam*, ‘The Being whose body is \[pure\] Science or knowledge, such is the secret of mantras.’ Kṣemarāja explains that *vidyāśarīrasattā* refers to the essence of the supreme non-duality as it expands, its ‘body’ being then made of the totality of sounds \(*śabdarāśi*\) – the whole sanskrit alphabet \(or Bhairava as alphabet\), that is – ‘whose essence is the flashing vibration \(*sphurattā*\), the awareness of the fullness of the absolute I, the undivided totality of the universe. Such is the secret of the mantras’.38 This identifies the essential inner nature of mantras with the Absolute as the ever-expanding power of the supreme godhead. The same conception is upheld by Abhinavagupta who, in his commentary \(*Vimarśinī*\) on Utpaladeva’s *Īśvarapratyabhijñākarikā* \(ĪPK\), 1.5.14, says that the nature of mantras ‘is the free activity of consciousness which is the energy of the supreme Word’. This, he considers, is especially embodied in the so-called supreme great mantra \(*paramahāmantra*\) *AHAṂ*, ‘I’, which, embodying the self-affirmation of the Absolute, brings together in its phonetic structure \(A \+ HA\+ Ṃ \) all the phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet of which all mantras are constituted39 – a conception, incidentally, whose roots are Vedic.

Interesting too as to how mantras function is a passage of the *Spandakārikā* \(SpK\), 26–27, which runs: ‘Having seized that strength \[of pure consciousness\], mantras, endowed with the power of omniscience, perform their functions as do the senses of the embodied. There and nowhere else, they dissolve, quiescent and spotless, along with the adept’s mind and thus achieve śivahood’.40 Mantras, thus, though pure consciousness, can be used to attain different ends, even mundane ones, while still retaining in essence their transcendental nature. This, however, they are said to do ‘along with the adept’s mind’: not alone, but only insofar as they are present in the adept’s consciousness – an important point. As is often said ‘the mantra alone, the mantrin alone are powerless’: they can only act together. Hence the essentiality of the mental aspect of mantric practices – an aspect we shall see several times in this volume. The inner nature of consciousness of mantras thus posited by these Śaiva schools explains the role they give to mental practices necessary to activate and make use of mantras. This, of course, takes place in all *mantrasādhana* of whatever persuasion, but it is specially insisted upon in those non-dualistic schools.41 Thus the ŚS 1.22 says that ‘by one-pointed attention \(*anusaṃdhānāt*\) on the Great Lake one experiences the power of mantras’;42 this Lake is the supreme Consciousness on which the adept is to concentrate mentally. The role of memory or rather of recalling to mind \(*smaraṇa*\) is also insisted upon by some authors, Abhinavagupta notably; a view founded on the doctrine of non-duality of consciousness \(*saṃvidadvaya*\) for which, as is said for instance in the ĪPK 1.4.1, ‘he who remembers is none other than the supreme Lord’. Such metaphysical conceptions do not prevent these traditions from prescribing a number of ritual practices for the efficient use of mantras, practices where, as we shall see in this volume, concentrated mental activity, one-pointed attention, is present and important.43 Mantric practices have necessarily a mental aspect. Mantras are phonic entities, but their uses belong to the realm of representation and creative imagination, their efficacy is symbolic, imagined, not real: one is here entirely in the mental field. This, of course, being said without forgetting that the efficacy as well as the definition and the uses of mantras, Tantric or non-Tantric, are socially determined: mantras have no other legitimacy and power than those given them by the social group where they are being used.

It would be fair to add that the question of the nature and efficacy of mantras – especially of Tantric mantras – has also exercised the minds of Western scholars. Frits Staal’s study, *Ritual and Mantras* – *Rules without Meaning*,44 reviews many theories, comparing, for instance, mantras with the babbling of babies and with bird songs. Mantras have also been compared with poetry since in both cases the phonic substance of the utterance, of words, is essential. But poetry is language, discourse \(even if of a particular sort\), which Tantric mantras are not. In mantras ‘la teneur prévaut sur le sens’, to quote Louis Renou: there can be no meaning, merely the phonic content, whereas, except in the very limited case of ‘concrete poetry’, a poem always means, or suggests, or points towards something, which the mantra does not do, or at any rate not in the same way – it may invoke a deity or suggest an action, but the mantra does this through its form, its phonic structure, not by ‘saying something’.45 Mantras do not function ‘nominatively’, to designate something or describe an action, but ‘invocatively’, to invoke a deity, or performatively, to bring about a situation, to ‘do’ something. Tantric mantras are also sometimes seen as instances of the transcending of language towards a higher, perhaps silent, level of speech, a view that can be reconciled with some Indian conceptions.46 The term *japa*, the ritual utterance of a mantra, is sometimes translated as prayer, which, in fact, *japa* actually is in some cases. I shall come back to this point in chapter 3.

Tantric mantras being what I have more or less aptly tried to say, the selection translated here of papers I wrote or read in the course of years on the subject deal mainly with mantric practices, which is the main aspect of mantras: how they were and are being made use of. Theory is secondary – *im Anfang war der Tat* – even if it explains and often guides or orientates. Ideology is never a mere superstructure: if mantras, too, ‘*marchent à l’idéologie*’, ideology never comes first.

Chapter 2 deals with the ritual practices for the creation and choice of mantras. Then are seen two important mantric practices: *nyāsa*, the placing of mantras on the body or on various supports \(chapter 4\), and *japa*, their ritual repetition \(chapter 3\). Chapter 5 is on a form of *japa*: the repetition of a mantra using a rosary \(*akṣamālā*\) as it is described in a Vaiṣṇava text of the Pāñcarātra, the *Jayākhyāsaṃhitā* \(JS\). Then are seen the defects or flaws \(*doṣa*\) mantras may suffer from and the ‘perfectioning’ rituals \(*saṃskāra*\) used to eradicate these defects and to make mantras more effective or more powerful \(chapter 6\). This will be completed by a review of some uses of mantras and of practices meant to make them more effective \(chapter 7\), by a few notes on how mantras are deemed to circulate in the body of the practitioner \(chapter 8\) and, finally, on the relationship between the oral and the written in the case of mantras \(chapter 9\); chapters where we will come back briefly on the question of the nature of Tantric mantras as phonic and mental entities or representations. Other aspects of mantras or of mantric practices, some of which are mentioned in passing in these eight chapters, could also have been tackled: it simply happened that I did not study them carefully enough to deal specifically with them. One may add, however, that for an exhaustive study of Tantric mantras, of their manifold uses and of all that has been written on the subject, or done with them, in the field of Tantra, a much larger volume than this one would have been necessary. It would quote more Sanskrit texts, describe a larger number of facts and refer to other speculations. But mantric practices and notions, like many, if not most, Tantric ones, even when interesting, are often repetitive; a longer study, though more informative, would therefore probably not add very much to the understanding of the particular and very typically Indian phenomenon of mantra. A phenomenon which, in fact, is but an aspect of the ancient and universal belief in the power of speech, or the Word, and especially of the near universal superstitious belief in the power of ritual formulas and nonsense syllables: a popular credence also sometimes philosophically refined \(as we have just seen, and will see here\) in metaphysical schools of thought. But we too, when we use a number of conventional formulas, believe in the performative or illocutionary force of words. We should not therefore be too surprised by Tantric mantras for they are merely a particular, specially intense, sometimes bizarre, case of a universal human faith in the power of speech – speech, this remarkable activity uniquely proper to humans – *êtres de parole*.47



## 2 Mantroddhāra and mantravicāra
The extraction and examination of mantras







The use of mantras being prescribed in different circumstances \(in ritual, magic, yoga, or spiritual and meditative practices\) are quoted, revealed or prescribed in different ways. In ritual, and especially in the course of the mandatory daily worship of a deity, but also in many other rites, such as *dīkṣā, pratiṣṭhā, pavitrārohana* and so forth, their utterance at various moments of the ritual performance is prescribed by Tantras and other Tantric texts, or in compilations \(*nibandhas*\) or manuals \(*paddhati*s\) of ritual. The only condition for their use is that they are uttered exactly and as prescribed, by a socially and ritually authorised person. Such has been the case from Vedic times down to the present. It is, one may say, the normal, ordinary form in which the utterance of these constituent elements of all rites is prescribed, the form most often met with. It is, however, not the most characteristically Tantric and most interesting one. More interesting, and typically Tantric, is another way, first of quoting or revealing a mantra, then of examining and selecting it so as to be sure it is well adapted to its user and to the end pursued. This method is used whenever the mantra – which is the phonic, efficacious form of a deity and is therefore not to be revealed to inapt or uninitiated persons – is to be communicated to an adept or devotee. This form of revelation or secret \(ritual or non-ritual\) communication of a mantra is what is called *mantroddhāra*, whereas the method for examining and adapting a mantra is called *mantravicāra*, two practices some forms of which we shall see presently.

A mantra being the phonic form of a deity, replete with all the deity’s power and effectiveness, cannot be freely revealed to just any person. It is to be revealed in a particular, secret \(or at least indirect\) way. Though being a divine entity, a mantra is also in practice not merely a phonic entity, or a sound, but a verbal form, made up of letters or phonemes, that is, made up of the constituent elements of the Sanskrit alphabet, the *varnas*. Its revelation will consist therefore in extracting the phonemes of which it is made from the ensemble of phonemes of the alphabet, the *varṇasamāmnāya*, which, in this context, is not a mere collection of letters, but the phonetic form of the absolute, of *vāc*, the Word, which, as is said in the *R̥gveda*, is the mother of all the gods.2

One may say in a general way that the root or fundamental mantra \(*mūlamantra* or *mūlavidyā*3\) of a deity to be worshipped, or the mantra given to an adept for a specific reason, to achieve a particular end, has to be selected in a particular way. The principle underlying this selection is that mantras are basic, efficacious forms or aspects of the Word, of *vāc*, which is the original, fundamental ever-active form of the supreme godhead, its energy or power, *śakti*. To be made use of, mantras, which are made of phonemes and/or words, must therefore be taken out of, extracted from, this Word totality – hence the term and practice of *mantroddhāra*.

The term *mantroddhāra* \(or *mantroddhāraṇa*\) is made up of *mantra* and *uddhāra/uddhāraṇa*, from the verbal form *ud-DHR̥* \(to draw out, extract or select\). *Mantroddhāra* is thus the extraction of the mantra out of the totality of sound or, more precisely, out of the totality of the Sanskrit phonemes, the *varṇasamāmnāya* \(the alphabetical form of *vāc*4\). It is at the same time the selection and composition of the mantra of a particular deity, or of the mantra to be given to a particular person – the notion of extraction being, however, always essential.5 The various forms of *mantroddhāra* are to be found in a large number of texts, mainly in the ‘digests of *mantraśāstra*’, to use T. Goudriaan’s words,6 such as the *Prapañcasāra* \(eighth century\), or Lakṣmanadeśika’s twelfth century. *Śāradātilaka*, in manuals or compendiums of Tantric ritual such, for instance, as Mahīdhara’s *Mantramahodadhi* \(sixteenth century\), Kr̥ṣṇānanda Āgamavāgīśa’s *Tantrasāra* \(seventeenth century\), or the nineteenth-century *Mantramahārṇava*. There are also, as we shall see, *mantrodhāra*\(*ṇa*\) chapters in most Śaiva āgamas or tantras, in the Pāñcarātra saṃhitās, and, of course, in various Tantric works, all these too numerous to be quoted here.

We shall review rapidly in these pages some typical ritual processes, either simple or complex, which are all practical applications of the general organising principle of *mantroddhāra*.

The simpler and certainly the most frequent form of *mantroddhāra* consists in merely giving the syllables in the order which constitutes the mantra. Mantras being the energy aspect, the active form of deities, and being therefore powerful, their syllables are not simply enumerated for everybody to know them, but usually given in such a way that only initiates can identify them. There are, for such purposes, conventional names for the Sanskrit phonemes, which are not the same in all traditions: in practice, the guru will tell his disciple how to understand the secret *uddhāra* of his initiatory tradition. There are also books which list the conventional names of the Sanskrit letters:7 they can be made use of to decipher an *uddhāra* – but, as is well known, a mantra learned of in a book or deciphered with the aid of a book is powerless and therefore useless.

Here are a few instances of this simpler form of *mantroddhāra*:

First, that of the *bījā HRĪṂ*, of the goddess Tārikā, which I take from a Pāñcarātra text, the *Lakṣmītantra* \(LT\), Chapter 44, 7a. It is as follows: “The concentrated \[sound of\] Sūrya \(*H*\) and anala \(*R*\) together, joined with Viṣṇu, \(*Ī*\) with vyomeśa \(Ṃ\) at the end.” To take another instance, in the Netra \(NT\), 2.21, for the Netramantra *OṂ JUṂ SAḤ*, the *uddhāra* of the first syllable is given like this: “The first of all, that which comes after the \[phonic\] form of the universe, the one who kills the universe”. “The first of all”, says the commentary, “is the first phoneme, *A*; that which comes after the form of *māyā *\(*māya* being identified with the universe8\) which is *Ī*, is *U*; what kills this universe is time, expressed by the letter *M*.” We have thus A\+U\+M= OM.

A more cryptic *uddhāra* is that of the ‘heart-mantra’, *SAUḤ* given in a Śaiva Trika text, the *Parātrīśikā*. It runs as follows: ‘United with the fourteenth, O Fair One, associated with the end of the Master of the *tithis*, the third *brahman*, O fair-hipped Woman, is the heart of the self of Bhairava’:9 the fourteenth is the fourteenth Sanskrit phoneme, *AU*, the *tithis* are the sixteen ‘vowels’10 corresponding to Śiva, who is their master, the last of these being *Ḥ* ; the third *brahman* is to be understood as the letter *SA* or, more precisely *S*. One has thus *SAUḤ* – provided of course one knows the proper order of the phonemes, and also that ‘third *brahman*’ means *SA*.11

Those are *uddhāras* based on what we may call play of words. Though sometimes very cryptic, they are simple processes. But there are also ritual *mantroddhāras*, complex processes where the extraction of a mantra consists of several ritual acts to be performed by a master \(*guru, ācārya* or *deśika*\)12 or by a qualified, that is, an initiated adept \(a *sādhaka*\). These masters and adepts, being initiated, have already a mantra which they received when initiated and which they have mastered by the process of *puraścaraṇa*;13 they may however need to use a particular mantra for a specific purpose – in *kāmya* rituals especially – and would then need to have access to it either in a simple, ‘literary’ fashion, as shown above, or they would have to ‘extract’ it ritually, which is what we shall see now.

The general structure of the process to be used is always the same, referring also to the same basic principle. The performer, in such cases, is first to invoke and to display ritually, according to prescribed rules, the fifty phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet,14 and pay homage to them; then he will extract, that is, select, from among this phonetic ensemble the phonemes of the mantra. Then, when this totality of the divine power or energy \(*śakti*\) of *vāc* in her phonematic form has been duly, ritually, made present and honoured, the adept picks out of it the elements which, when assembled, will make up the mantra. Being derived from a totality, the mantra may thus appear theoretically as a somewhat less exalted form of phonic power than the whole alphabet \(though there are mantras which are deemed to embody this very totality – *OṂ* notably15\), but it is a more efficient, and especially a more usable one – one, also, which can be adapted to particular uses or circumstances.

One might say that the mantra thus made to appear out of the totality of the alphabet by a selection of its constituent elements brings together in a more practically usable and more effective form the individually distinct phonemic entities of the alphabet. To quote Arthur Avalon, ‘In the mātr̥kās, the mantra lies scattered. Mantroddhāra is the formation of the mantra by selection of the mātr̥kās’.16 Analogously, and infinitely more authoritatively, Abhinavagupta’s disciple, the Kaśmirian Kṣemarāja \(11th c.\), said in his *Vimarśinī* on Vasugupta’s *Śivasūtra*, 2.3: ‘the secret essence of the mantras is none other than the blissful \[Mātr̥kā\], “whose nature”, as has been shown, “is that of cognition”. And this is the reason why in every āgama the presentation of the extraction of mantras is preceded by the spreading out \(*prastāra*17\) of the *mātr̥kā* or of the *mālinī*’.18 *Mātr̥kā* is the ‘normal’ order of the Sanskrit phonemes, from *A* to *KṢA, mālinī* is an apparently haphazard disposition of the phonemes, the first being *NA* and the last one *PHA*: *nādiphāntam*, as is sometimes said. Without considering these two terms here, we shall note that *mātr̥kā* \(in the singular when applied to the whole collection of phonemes, or in the plural if these are considered separately, and in that case the word can very appropriately be translated by ‘little mother’\) is used for the *varṇas* to underline their character as mothers \(or as a Great Mother\) who bring into existence the whole cosmos, and, more specifically, the mantras. As is often said in Tantric works, she is the unknown mother of all the mantras, or, to quote Kṣemarāja’s commentary on the Svacchandatantra,19 2.30–31, ‘the universal mother, unknown, of all bound souls, begetter of all mantras and tantras, going from *A* to *KṢA*’.20 She is the original ground or substrate \(*pūrvabhitti*\) of all words and objects.

Many quotations from various sources could be adduced as proof of the validity of Kṣemarāja’s formula as well as of the general frequency of the *mantroddhāra* practice. For example, we may look at a passage of the first chapter, on the extraction of mantras \(*mantroddhāraprakaraṇam*\), of the *kriyāpāda* of the *Mr̥gendrāgama* \(Mr̥g\), with its commentary by Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha. The latter, commenting on sūtra 2 of this chapter, repeats \(after the āgama\) that the Power of the Lord is *kuṇḋalinī* as the supreme word \(*parāvāc*\). In her, a first form of subtle sound, a supreme resonance \(*paradhvani*\), the *nāda*, appears, which then condenses as a drop \(*bindu*\) of phonic energy \(described by Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha as an inner murmuring – *antarsam. jalpa*\). From it comes the *akṣara*, the Imperishable, the syllable *OṂ*, which begets the *mātr̥kā*, the mother of all words, consisting of the Sanskrit alphabet from *A* to *KṢA* from which all the mantras are born. The chapter then goes on enumerating the various mantras of this Śaiva tradition, which are displayed in form of a diagram. The mantras are thus deemed to be ‘extracted’ in that they derive ontologically from the phonemes of the alphabet. No actual method for ‘extracting’ them is described, but the principle is clearly there.

This being so, and the principle being always the same, in actual practice the ritual of *mantroddhā*ra is performed in different ways, details varying from text to text, but the overall pattern remaining always the same. The adept is always to spread out21 the *mātr̥kā* in front of himself, to pay homage to or worship it, then to extract from it the letters which make up the mantra.

Thus, the SvT \(1.30ff.\) says that:


\[Is to be prepared an area of\] white, red, yellow or black earth, purified by sprinkling \[water on it\], without any twigs, endowed with all \[possible favourable\] characteristics and able to bring about all that is to be wished, perfumed with pleasant-smelling ointments, adorned with flowers and beautified above by a canopy. \[There,\] the master, purified, smeared with sandal-and aloe-paste and made fragrant with incense, his mind calm and pleasant, facing the east or the north, with one-pointed22 and concentrated mind, is to spread out the *mātr̥kā* in the order from *A* to *KṢA*


The tantra goes on to say that the sixteen vowels are Bhairava and the consonants are Bhairavī: the supreme god and his energy whose conjunction engenders the universe. The officiating master is to worship \(*prapūjayet*\) the god Mātr̥kābhairava with the vowels \(*avargeṇa*\), and his consort Bhairavī with the groups of consonants \(*kādinā*\): the tantra \(1.34–36\) enumerates eight goddesses, the eight Mothers, the *aṣtamātr̥kā*,23 that are to be worshipped each with each of the eight groups of phonemes \(the *vargas*\). The *pūjā* once performed, the tantra adds, the master is to extract the mantra in the proper order as prescribed. Kṣmarāja explains this injunction as follows: ‘At the end of this *mātr̥kāpūjā* \[the mantras are to be extracted\] in the proper order, that is successively beginning with the *āsanamantra*, \[then\] the *mūrtimantra*,24 etc. This is to be done as prescribed, fixing one’s attention very carefully on the deity expressed by each mantra.’25 This last prescription refers to the rule that the mantras of deities to be worshipped are to be enunciated beginning with the mantra of the throne \(the *āsana*\) on which the deity is to be placed \(or, before it, the root-mantra, the *mūlamantra*\), then the mantra of the form or body of the deity \(*mūrtimantra*\), then the other ones. These others are the mantras of the deity’s ‘limbs’ \(*aṅga*\) and ‘ancillary limbs’ \(*upāṅga*\) and, finally, those of other deities.26

The NT, a work from the same tradition as the SvT though probably slightly later, explains in its second chapter \(2.17–21\) that on a levelled, pure area, anointed with sandal and aloe and perfumed by different substances, the master, anointed, perfumed and bejewelled, with peaceful mind, must first draw the outline of a lotus whose eight petals point towards the four cardinal and the four intermediate directions of space. Having placed \(*nyasya*\) in the centre of the lotus the mantra *OṂ*, he writes or draws out \(*likhet*\) each of the eight groups \(*varga*\) of letters of the *mātr̥kā* on each of the eight petals, starting from the one pointing east. Then, ‘having worshipped with utmost devotion \(*pūjayet parayā bhaktyā*\) the goddess mother of all mantras, and having offered her flowers, incense, etc., he is to extract the *mantradevatā*’ the phonemes of which are then enumerated in a covert fashion.

Let us now look at a work from a different Tantric \(Vaiṣṇava\) tradition, the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(JayS\) of the Pañcarātra, whose sixth chapter describes the extraction of the main mantras \(*mukhyamantroddhāra*\) of that system. The description is very detailed. The ritual practice is more complex than the one we have just seen; it enters into more particulars, but the organising principle is the same. An area is first to be prepared – that is, flattened, cleaned, smeared with cow dung, sprinkled with the five products of the cow \(*pañcagavya*27\), anointed with sandal, perfumed with incense, etc. Then, having paid homage to this area with white flowers and a mantra, the yogin28 is to draw with clay a round or square throne for the *mātr̥kā* \(*mātr̥kāpīṭha*\) on which he spreads out \(*prastāra*\) the phonemes of the alphabet. While doing so he is to realise that the *mātr̥kā* is nothing else than the multiple aspects of the supreme deity as it manifests the cosmos. The phonemes he has written out are therefore no mere letters but forms of the divine energy. He is then to place by *nyāsa*29 the *mātr̥kā* on his body which is thus pervaded by her power as well as inhabited by the fifty *mātr̥kās* as deities. Now he is to draw a large eight-pronged figure \(*mahācakra*\) on whose centre he writes *OṂ*, and in the eight directions the eight *vargas*. There follows a ritual worship \(*pūjā*\), to be done with devotion \(*bhaktyā*30\) and with the usual ritual offerings, of the *mātr̥kā* written on the consecrated area and of the one placed on his body, a worship during which the officiant is to invoke by their name31 and worship separately all the fifty phonemes, ‘visualizing them as shining and blazing like the midday sun’. ‘These sounds \(*śabda*\)’, the saṃhitā \(6.58b–60a\) adds, ‘are fragments \(*aṃśā*\), shining aspects \(*bhāsvaravigrahā*\) of the Lord. Increased by the power of the Lord, they are the cause of all the mantras, whose birth \(*utpatti*\) they bring about by their mutual conjunctions. In this moving and unmoving world, there is nothing that is not brought about by them.’32 Then, the main mantras, beginning with the *mūlamantra* of Viṣṇu followed by the *mūrtimantra*, are to be extracted, these mantras being, of course, not spelled out directly: their constituent phonemes are designated by their names and their place in the *varṇasamāmnāya* order \(*śl*. 61–69\). This whole section \(*śl*. 5 to 69 of the chapter\), which I have very much summarized,33 is interesting in that, while following the general organizing ritual pattern previously outlined, it underlines the meaning of the process, namely the passage, through a process of progressive condensation and precision, from the undifferenciated energy of the deity, first to a more concentrated but still diffuse aspect, that of the *mātr̥kā*, then finally to the discrete form of the mantras. It also underlines the necessary identification of the Tantric performing adept with the power he both manipulates and worships.

A different process of *uddhāra* is shown in another Pāñcarātra text, the *Sanatkumārasaṃhitā* \(Indrarātra, 2.55ff.\). There, the mantra *Oṃ namo nārāyaṇāya* is given, but its eight syllables are to be placed in eight of the sixty-four compartments of a diagram where fifty-one letters34 and twice the mantra OṂ are displayed, the extraction of this mantra being followed by its resorption, together with that of all mantras, into the bosom of Viṣṇu.

A passage of the LT \(chapter 24\) is also worth quoting, not so much for its ritual details as for the way in which the *uddhāra* is presented which, putting it in its divine-cosmic context, underscores remarkably the meaning of the process. Here is, briefly, the content of the first thirty-two stanzas of the chapter:35 the supreme *brahman*, the absolute I, the omnipresent supreme soul, Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa, takes on, so as to help all living beings, the nature of the *mātr̥kā* made of *śabdabrahman*, and more specifically the nature of mantras. The master is to invoke the Supreme as the saviour mantra \(*tārakamantra*\), which here is *OṂ*. He is to take the three phonemes of *OṂ, A, U, M*, conjoin them, adding \(‘beautifying them with’\) *bindu* and then with the phonic resonance, the *nāda*, which dissolves eventually in the origin of sound. He is now to meditate on the Absolute as made up of these three letters which are identified with Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Saṃkarṣaṇa – the Vyūhas of Viṣṇu. Meditating this mantra, identifying with it, the adept unites with the eternal *brahman* and with the energies that emanate from it and which sustain and animate the universe. Mantra and the universe are then identified. Later on, the master will place ritually \(by *nyāsa*\) the mantra with its twelve *aṅgas* and *upāṅgas* on his body, which identifies him with the deity as master of the cosmos, then, continuing, he fuses mentally with the divine transcendent formless Absolute whence however he will come back to an ordinary state of consciousness so as to be able to transmit the *tāramantra* to his disciple. We have here therefore not merely the extraction of a mantra, but a fusion of the master with the Absolute which enables him to transmit this reality to his disciple. This explains the complexity and intensity of the meditative activity of the master who is both to identify with a mantra and then to transfer its power.

A number of other texts prescribing or describing different forms of *mantro-ddhāra* could still be cited: the *Kiraṇāgama* \(Kir\), 12, for instance, or the *Rauravāgama* \(RAU\), *kriyāpāda* 2b–4, or the *Pūrvakāmika*, 2, or the *Īśana*ś*ivaguru-devapaddhati* \(Īśgp\) II, *kriyāpāda* 6, etc. But this is not necessary since many texts are not very explicit, therefore not worth quoting, while in other texts we would find the same general method, or very similar ones, for extracting mantras.36

As regards the diagrammatic display of phonemes for the *mantroddhāra*, a practice found in some texts, notably in some Śaiva Kaula traditions, is worth mentioning. The diagrams used in such cases are called *prastāra* or *gahvara*, that is, display or cavern. The letters to be chosen are in effect spread out \(*pra*√*STR̥*\) in these diagrams, but this usually in such a way that only initiates can find them: they can therefore be considered as being hidden in the diagram as it were, as in a cave or a cavern \(*guha* or *gahvara*\).

We find such a *prastāra*, for instance, in chapter 1.83–85 of the *Vāmake*ś*varīmata* \(VM\), a tantra of the Tripurā \(or Śrīvidyā\) tradition, in a passage which gives the *uddhāra* of the *vidyā* of the goddess Karaśuddhikarī, *AIṂ KLĪṂ SAUḤ*. The tantra quotes the letters of the *vidyā* by referring to their place in a *prastāra* of a triangular shape divided into forty-nine triangular compartments, each with one of the forty-nine Sanskrit phonemes inscribed in it in their order from *A* to *HA* \(it is printed on p. 45 of the Kashmir Series edition of that text\). The *AIṂ*, in that case, is described in the tantra as ‘the *bīja* which is between *E* and *O*, the one which is alone and related to the word’: the phoneme *AI* is in effect placed between *E* and *O* on the first line of the *prastāra*, the commentary explaining that ‘the one which is alone’ is *bindu*. The same method is used for the seven other letters of the *vidyā*. Jayaratha, in his comment on this passage, quotes two texts, the *Nityākulatantra* and the *Rasamahodadhi*, which describe the same sort of *prastāra*. Those, as well as the *gahvaras*, can be of varied shapes with phonemes disposed in a variety of orders. The phonemes in the diagrams, too, can be those of the ‘normal’ alphabet, the *mātr̥kā* \(or the *śabdaraśi* which is another name for the same alphabetical order when it is considered as the phonemic form of Bhairava\), or that of the *mālinī*.37 The *prastāra-gahvara* system is likely to be found in different Tantric traditions since all insist on the secret nature of their teaching.

To be made use of, mantras are not only to be conferred on somebody or to be constituted by being extracted from the Sanskrit alphabet. It is also necessary for mantras to be adapted to the person to whom they are given and to the use they are to be put. This adaptation is checked through a process of examination or investigation \(*vicāra* or *parīkṣa*\) of the mantra. The idea on which such an adaptation is based is that for the mantra to be effectively used there should exist between it and its user a specific link or relationship: this is expressed by the composite term *mantrāṃśa, aṃśa* being taken in the sense of share or portion, the user being considered as a portion of, or as participating in, the mantra, as having a particular affinity with it. This commonality between the mantra and the mantrin permits the latter to use fully and effectively the former. This control of mantrin–mantra commonality is effectuated by diverse divinatory methods which vary according to traditions or circumstances, their diversity corresponding also to the wish to be able to use different methods in case the one first resorted to proves unsatisfactory, or to the possibility of chosing the method one prefers.38

Here too we shall limit ourselves to a few instances, quoting a few Śaiva and Vaisṇava texts, so as to show the general structure or the spirit of these *aṃśa* checking processes, rather than describing many particular practices. We shall first refer to such texts as the SvT and NT, adding a few other references. On the Vaiṣṇava side, instances will be taken from the LT and the *Kramadīpikā*.39 These processes are in fact to be found in all ritual manuals, ancient or modern, where mantric practices are expounded, and they are always very similar.

One of the best Śaiva description of the *amśa* practice is to be found in the eighth chapter of the SvT.40 It expounds the means with which to ascertain the participation, relationship or affinity \(*aṃśa*\) of an adept with a particular deity or supernatural entity and therefore with the mantra of that deity which that adept will be given by his master. Six different cases are enumerated.

There are, first, two simpler ones, where the disciple spontaneously feels devotion for a particular deity. This is called *bhāvāṃśa* if it is due to his natural \(*sahajam*\) feeling or emotion \(*bhāva*\) for a deity on which his mind dwells constantly \(*anusmaraṇa*\). If this is due, in a more or less similar fashion, to his innate disposition or impulse \(*svabhāva*\), if for instance he feels constantly impelled to worship a *liṅga*,41 the case will be that of the *svabhāvāṃśa* \(*śl*. 2 and 12\).42 If there is no such natural affinity, the disciple and his master will have to resort to divinatory means. The most usual one is for the disciple, blindfolded, to throw a flower \(*puṣpa*\) onto a maṇḋala on which are drawn or symbolically placed Bhairava or other forms of Śiva and of his retinue of deities: the mantra chosen will be that of the deity on which the flower falls. This is the *puṣpapātāṃśa*, it is mentioned in *śl*. 13, chapter 8, of the SvT.43 ‘This mantra’, the tantra adds, ‘will be effective if it is worshipped according to the prescriptions of the *śāstras*.’ The throwing of a flower on a ritual diagram is a fairly common ritual practice. It is described in several texts, ancient or modern. It is also used in other contexts, for instance in initiation, to decide the name of an initiand \(see SP, vol. 3, p. 103\).

It may happen that the above methods for choosing a mantra \(or those we shall see later\) do not satisfy the adept, who wishes to receive a particular mantra. He may then try to obtain the desired *aṃśa* by offerings of human flesh in the sacrificial fire, offerings to which the tantra \(14b–15a\) alludes indirectly, but which the commentary names clearly: *naramāṃsa*. Kṣemarāja uses also \(p. 9\) another, more frequent, conventional term, *vīradravya*, the heroic \[ritual\] ingredient,44 while explaining how this offering is to be made by the *sādhaka* or the *ācārya*.

If the preceeding methods to secure the *aṃśa* remain unsuccessful, the disciple can still obtain the desired *aṃśa* by worshipping the mantra and making oblations in the fire \(*yāgaṃ purā kr̥tvā agnau homaṃ kārayet –* 16a\), this having been done according to the prescribed rules, the disciple ‘being united, thanks to a full oblation, with the plane of the Eternal \(*pūrṇāhutiprayogena yojayec cchāśvate pade*\), setting his heart upon that plane, will succeed in what he wishes’ \(16b–17a\).

Now remain to be seen the more current ways for the adept to get or determine the *mantrāṃśaka* that are to be found in a number of Tantric texts as well as in ancient or modern manuals.

The SvT, chapter eight \(*śl*. 20ff.\) and the NT, mention only one method, consisting of writing on two lines, one under the other, the mantra to be checked and the name of the adept who is to receive it, then to count in the traditional Indian way, on the phalanxes of the right hand, the number of letters in the normal order of the Sanskrit alphabet \(never in reverse\) which separate the initial letter of the name of the disciple from the first one of the mantra. Four *aṃśas* may thus appear: *siddha* \(which one may translate as ‘obtained’, or ‘effective’\), *sādhya* \(‘attainable’\), *susiddha* \(‘very efficacious’ or ‘completely atttained’\), and *ari, śatru*, or *ripu* \(‘hostile’, ‘enemy’\), according to whether the counting stops on the three phalanxes of the ring-finger or on one of the four that follow, etc. Only those stopping on the first and third are favourable \(*siddha* and *susiddha*\) and allow the mantra to bear fruit – they are even \(ibid. *śl*. 24b\) *bhuktimuktiphalaprada*: their fruit is liberation and rewards. In the two other cases \(second phalanx, or the fourth – on the little finger\), the mantra is unfavourable or dangerous and one must strictly abstain from giving it to the adept or initiand. Kṣemarāja, whose commentary on *śl*. 20–24 explains how to proceed, adds \(perhaps needlessly\) that this *aṃśakaparīkṣa* does not apply to monosyllabic mantras nor to *mālāmantras*.45 This being done, the main deity \(Bhairava Kapālīśa in this case\) is to be worshipped with his retinue.

There are still other methods both to make sure that the mantra is perfectly adapted to its potential user and to distinguish more precisely \(notably by determining sub-categories of the four *aṃśas*\) between the effects of the mantra and the methods for using it. As a result, the adept is sure to get a mantra which will be perfectly adapted to him and which will respond to his needs, whilst he will also know beforehand what effects he can expect from its use, and on what conditions.

One will thus check if the adept and the mantra belong to the same ‘family’ \(*kula*\) by comparing the first letter of the mantra with the initial of the mantrin’s name, the phonemes of the alphabet being, for this purpose, displayed on a plate with four columns \(a *kulākulacakra*\) considered as being mutually either compatible or incompatible: for the *kula* to exist, the two initials must be in two compatible columns.

One can also, using a square or a round diagram, compare the *rāśi*, the lunar mansion or zodiacal sign conventionally attributed to the adept and to the mantra: according to the *rāśi* where they will be, one will know if the mantra would or would not be favourable, or what result one may expect from its use. The same process is made use of to compare the *nakṣatra*, the constellation or asterism, of the adept with the *nakṣatra* assigned to the first letter of the mantra, these being in two different sections of the diagram: some coincidences are deemed favourable \(*siddha, susiddha*\), others are bad \(*sādhya* or *ari*\).46

Another predictive method consists in using a diagram called *akaḋamacakra* because the four phonemes *A, KA, ḌA* and *MA* are placed in its upper central division. The letters of the alphabet are placed in it by groups of four forming twelve radiating columns in a circle or twelve lines along the sides of a rectangle.47 According to the distance between the first phoneme of the mantra and the initial letter of the adept’s name, the mantra will be considered as *siddha, sādhya susiddha*, or *ari*. There is also the *r̥ṇidhānicakra*, the diagram of the debtor and the creditor, with which – by a rather complicated calculation – one will see if the mantra is favourable \(for which it must be the adept’s debtor\), or else holds a debt claim against him and is thus unfavourable.48

The method most frequently used, I believe, consists in tracing an oriented square surface, divided into four quarters, each one being divided also into quarters: there are thus sixteen small squares in groups of four where the phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet are written either in the normal alphabetical order \(the *akṣarasamāmnāya*\) or in a different order corresponding to particular symbolical values given them \(in this case, it is often called *akathahacakra*, from the names of the letters placed in the first little square \(on the left\). The four squares divided into four are assigned, going clockwise, to each of the *aṃśa*: *siddha* on top left \(northeast\), *sādhya* on top right \(south-east\), *susiddha* down left \(north-west\), and *ari* down right \(south-west\). The *aṃśa* is determined, not by the distance separating the square containing the first letter of the name of the disciple from the square containing the first letter of the mantra, but by their juxtaposition, and it will be expressed by associating the categories assigned to the two squares. The *aṃśa* would thus be, say, *siddha-ari* or *sādhya-sādhya*, or *siddha-susiddha*, etc., therefore dangerous, useless or favourable, etc.: there are sixteen possibilities instead of four only.49 The validity of a mantra for an adept can also be checked using the *kūrmacakra*, a diagram in the shape of a tortoise \(*kūrma*\) which is to be drawn by the adept who is then to write the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, by groups, in nine different sections of the body of the tortoise \(the vowels in the central part, the consonants grouped by *vargas*, on top, bottom, sides, ‘hands’ and paws. According to the sections where the initial letters of the mantra and of the adept’s name will be, and by some calculations, the mantra will be found to be *siddha, susiddha, sādhya* or *ari*.50

One sees from the above that all possible guaranties are sought for the mantra to be perfectly adapted to its user. The need for such an adaptation is self-evident in the initiation – *dīkṣā* or *abhiṣeka –* of the *sādhaka*, since he is a *bubhukṣu*, a seeker of *bhukti*, of supernatural accomplishments, to be attained through the mantra which has been given him and which is to be mastered – it is a *sādhyamantra –* this mastery being the first thing he is to do, through the ritual of *mantrasādhana*,51 after been initiated. A mantra adapted to its user is also a necessity in the larger context of desire-oriented \(*kāmya*\) rites. These *kāmyakarmāṇi*, as they are called, are rites practised so as to obtain particular results, notably – but not necessarily – through the cult of particular deities \(especially of power-yielding goddesses such as the Yoginīs52\) who will bestow on their worshipper boons of different sorts.53 Among those cults are the so-called ‘six \[magical\] acts’, *ṣaṭkarmāṇi*, all of which are performed with mantras54 \(there are also the, less frequent because condemned, practices of sorcery, *abhicāra*\). But the field of *kāmyakarmāṇi* is infinitely larger than magical actions: it includes everything in religious life that is done to satisfy a human wish, be it for one’s mundane satisfaction or for one’s salvation – which is more than anything else something devoutly to be wished.

It is to be noted, too, that however important it may be in some contexts, *mantravicāra* or *mantraparīkṣa* is not always necessary. It is even sometimes prohibited. As already mentioned, monosyllabic mantras55 and the longer ones, the so-called *mālāmantras*, cannot be examined in such a way. There are also mantras which are not submitted to *aṃśavicāra* or to diagrammatic *parīkṣa* because of their high status: these mantras act directly everywhere and without limitation, such as the divine *śakti* whose phonic aspect they are. This is the case of the great Śaiva mantras such as the *para*-or *hr̥daya-mantra SAUḤ*, or of *HAUṂ*, the *prāsādamantra*, which many texts consider as the *mūlamantra* of Śiva; or of the *mūlamantra* of the goddess, or of that of Viṣṇu, for Vaiṣṇava traditions, and so forth.56 Such mantras are said to be common to all, universal \(*sāmānya* or *sādhāraṇa*\). There is, finally, what appears to be, as already mentioned, the most frequent case, that is, the cases where the *uddhāra* of a mantra is given without any ritual practice being mentioned, its constituent letters being simply given in a more or less covert manner or even overtly quoted. There are also, mainly, all the innumerable cases where mantras are to be uttered during a ritual, where, evidently, the performer cannot examine their adequacy before using them, which does not prevent them from being perfectly effective: they effect what they say, or make present the deities they ‘express’ \(being their *vācaka*\). There are, as is well known, ritual situations or processes which do not imply any outward action, where merely mantras are uttered \(for instance the *ātma*- or *āntara-pūja* which, in Tantric practice, always precedes the visible, material, ‘external’, *bāhya*, worship\). There is no rite without mantras, and these are effective without any previous ritual fuss being necessary.

To conclude, we can, I believe, confirm the principle mentioned at the beginning of this study, namely that the *mantroddhāra* or *mantravicāra* process is linked to the nature of mantras as it is described in Tantric texts, or, more generally, to the Tantric conception of the power of the word. Mantras being the efficient and utilisable form of this word-power, they must be adapted both to the aim pursued and to their user. This user, being himself animated by a power that is fundamentally of the same nature as that of the mantra, can put the mantra in effective use only by fusing his own energy with that of the mantra, which is posssible only if there is adequacy between them.

It appears therefore in all that has been seen here \(as in what is studied in other articles in this volume\) that one cannot examine particular aspects of mantras without touching directly or indirectly upon the problem of their nature, which is ambiguous. Though they are forms of the supreme Word, *vāc*, though they are deities, *devatās*, in their own right, though existing therefore on a transcendent plane, mantras exist also empirically when – as \(in principle at least\) utterable phonetic units – they are used by human practitioners. They are both divine in essence and forms of human speech. They can, or must, therefore, when being made use of on the human plane, be submitted to ritual control procedures. These technical mantric rites meant to ensure their adequacy are inseparable from the sacred or magical Word, *vāc*, while being the external social acts that, by guaranteeing the proper use in context of the forms of *vāc* that mantras are, ground and ensure their authority on the social plane. The efficacy of mantras, whether one believes it to be real or symbolic, cannot be dissociated from its ritual, social context.



## 3 Japa
**1**





Before studying *japa*, one must first see how this term is to be translated. In other words, what does it mean for us? An answer – if an answer is possible – must take into account the descriptions and definitions of *japa* given in Sanskrit texts as well as the nature of the ritual or religious uses of *japa*. But the uses and the definitions of *japa* have varied according to traditions, and, still more, have evolved in the course of centuries. A unique and generally valid translation of the term would be possible only if there were a unique and generally admitted conception and practice of *japa*, which is not the case. The only solution to our problem is thus not to translate the word whilst trying to show the various conceptions and practices of *japa* which have existed \(and still exist now\) in India.

*Japa*, is a masculine substantive, from the verbal root *JAP* which, according to Monier-Williams’ *Sanskrit–English Dictionary*, means ‘to utter in a low voice, whisper, mutter \(especially prayers & incantations\), to pray to anyone in a low voice; to invoke or call upon in a low voice’; *japa* itself being defined as ‘muttering, whispering … muttering prayers, repeating in a murmuring tone passages from scripture or charms or names of a deity, etc.; muttered prayer or spell’. Böhtlingk and Roth’s *Sanskrit Wörterbuch* gives for *JAP*: ‘halblaut, flüsternd hersagen, her-murmeln’ and for *japa*: ‘das flüsternde Aussagen eines Gebetes, Liedes, usw.; ein auf diese Weise hersagtes Gebet’. Hence the translation of *japa* by Murmelmeditation sometimes used in German \(by J.W. Hauer, in *Der Yoga*, for instance\), a translation which evokes rather well the double aspect – muttered recitation and mental concentration – of *japa*. The Sanskrit encyclopaedia *Śabdakalpadruma* describes *japa* as *vidhānena mantroccaraṇam*, ‘uttering a mantra according to rule or precept’, and then quotes several texts, especially from the Purāṇas, which set out the rules governing the ritual recitation of mantras.

These few indications – many others could be adduced – suffice to show *japa* as being a muttering or whispering of a text or of words of a religious or magical character, and particularly of mantras; a muttering or whispering \(a prayer perhaps\) to be accomplished according to certain rules – it is a ritual utterance to be delivered in a low voice. The main meaning of the word *japa* is indeed to mutter. \(We shall see that *japa* can also be done aloud as well as silently or mentally.\) *Japa*, finally, is never an isolated utterance. It is the repeated utterance of a formula which is, to quote the Sanskrit expression, repeated ‘again and again’ \(*bhūyo bhūyah*\), even sometimes, as we shall see, an enormous number of times.

The term *japa* is ancient. One finds it in the *Śrautasūtra* and *Gr̥hyasūtra* where it refers to a muttered prayer or, in a more technical sense, to the recitation of the *vyāhr̥tis bhur bhuvaḥ svar oṃ*. In that case *japa* is the muttered recitation of stanzas or ritual formulas by the officiating priests or by the *yajamāna* at specific moments of the Vedic cult. The most important form of *japa* in the Vedic domain is in the *svādhyāya*, the personal recitation of the Vedic text, which is, it is said, a *japayajña*, a sacrifice consisting of a reciting, an offering of the word. The *svādhyāya* is the *brahmayajña*, the sacrifice to the *brahman*, the highest of the five Great Sacrifices, the *mahāyajñas*, prescribed by the tradition.2 As *japa* is an utterance consisting of speech, it is performed with what is the most high, since the transcendent *brahman* is speech: *brahma vai vāk* \(AitBr 4.21,1\). We see here proclaimed an idea that we shall find later on, repeated in many ways all of which tend to underline the very high capacity for salvation of *japa* and its fundamental function in many rites. The paramount importance traditionally ascribed to *japa* appears also in the *Bhagavad* G*ītā* when Kr̥ṣṇa says \(BhG 10.25\) *yajñānāṃ japa- yajño ‘smi*, ‘Among the sacrifices, I am the sacrifice of the muttered word’. Manu also says \(2.85\) that ‘the sacrifice consisting in *japa* is ten times higher than the one consisting in performing a prescribed ritual action’, *vidhiyajñāj japayajño visiṣṭo daśabhir guṇaiḥ*. Manu adds: ‘the *japa* done in a low voice is a hundred times higher, and the one done mentally a thousand times’ \(*upāmśuḥ syācchataguṇaḥ sāhasro mānasaḥ smr̥taḥ*\). This hierarchy is ever present and will be especially made use of in various Tantric forms of *japa*, of which those considered as the highest are not vocal utterances but purely mental or spiritual practices. The higher value given to word over action and, among speech acts, to silent over audible utterance is, from the earliest period down to modern times, a generally admitted notion. The word, *vāc*, originally, insofar as identified with the *brahman*, with the \(non\)utterance of the Brahmin Vedic priest, is silence.3 The Absolute is silent. The word is manifested by issuing forth from this primal Silence – into which it is eventually to dissolve – a dissolution which is sometimes accomplished by some forms of *japa*. Of those, the general rule is that the lowest form is the vocal \(*vācika*\) one, which can be heard by somebody else. Then there is the *upāṃśu japa* where the performer articulates the words or sounds in such a way that they cannot be heard. This is the middling sort of *japa*. The highest and best one is mental, *mānasa* \(which does not exclude the articulation of the mantra, provided it is done mentally\).4

We are not concerned here by the history of *japa*, but only by its Tantric practice. We may, however, mention, among the older references to *japa*, a passage of the Mokṣadharmaparvan of the *Mahābhārata* \(12.189–193\) where *japa* is defined as the recitation of a useful Vedic text \(*japet vai saṃhitaṃ hitam*\), without explaining what sort of text. *Japa* appears there as a practice derived from the *svādhyāya* and thus considered like the latter as being of an exalted nature since it is an offering of the all-powerful and divine Vedic word. \(This reminds one of BhG 10.25.\) This practice \(*japavidhi*\) is meant for the man in the world as well as for the renunciant. It includes such observances as control of the senses, truthfulness and so forth, and either a sacrifice, or, on the contrary, the renunciation to all sacrifices and to the senses. This *japa* bestows supernatural powers to the man in the world, and it will lead the renunciant to *dhyāna*, then to *samādhi* and further to fusion with the *ātman*. The *jāpaka* is thus equal to the yogin \(and even superior\). *Japa* appears therefore as a way to salvation parallel to that of the Sāṃkhya and Yoga. It is possible that in this passage the MBh wanted to affirm the superiority of *japa*, as a tradition going back directly to the Veda, over that of the Yoga-Sāṃkhya, considered as somewhat inferior:5 two currents which will converge later in Tantric *japa*. Note that this *japa* can confer supernatural powers to the performer. \(We may note too in passing that to prove that the *jāpaka* is equal – even superior – to the yogin, the MBh tells the story of the *jāpaka* Kauśika Paippalada, that is, of a sage from an Avestan tradition which can be related to Kashmir.\)

We may note also, among the notions either explicit or underlying the Tantric *japa* practices or speculations, two ancient notions, namely the identification of the emission of words in *japa* with that of the semen and – connected with the notion of the superiority of silence over uttered word – the pre-eminence of the brief condensed utterance over the explicit, long one. AitBr 2.38 says thus: ‘the *hotar* mutters the *japa*: he emits there the semen. The *japa* is inaudibly uttered; inaudible too is the emission of semen.’6 The enunciation of the Vedic word is thus homologous with the emission of semen, and just as semen is not to be squandered, so the Vedic word must be kept, stored as it were, for retention generates strength, whilst squandering weakens.7 This persisting ideology which extols the brief over the long, the concentrated over the diffuse, the retained over the emitted, the silent over the audible and the unexpressed over the expressed, results inevitably in giving pride of place to the techniques for preserving \(notably sexual\) energy, but it also results in placing short or monosyllabic mantras \(the *bījas*, those concentrations of phonic energy\) over long ones and, for *japa*, in placing the mental, externally unexpressed one over the vocal audible one.

Let us underline, to conclude these few remarks, the extreme importance always given in *japa* to its phonetic aspect: all traditions underline the absolute necessity of an absolutely exact and precise utterance. This trait constantly insisted upon in *mantraśāstra* is probably to be traced back to the importance given in Vedic times to the exact pronunciation of the Veda and in particular of the *svādhyāya* which later became the *japa*, where what is important is the phonetic content, not the meaning: *mantravid evāsmi nātmavit*, says Nārada in CHU 7.1, 3\).

One naturally cannot review in an article all the cases where a *japa* is prescribed, nor can one even merely mention all categories of uses of *japa* that have existed. One can, however, consider the main cases where this meditated ritual, repetitive enunciation, is prescribed in tantras, āgamas, ritual manuals or other Tantric texts, and describe the forms it appears to have most often taken. The instances quoted here will come mainly from the Śaiva-śākta field, for it is the larger and richer Tantric domain. Some will come too from the Vaiṣṇaiva domain of the Pāñcarātra, but Pāñcarātra was very largely influenced by śaivism: the Tantric period was in fact a ‘Śaiva age’.8 A few Buddhist practices may be alluded to in passing. As has already been noted in chapter 2 and will be in chapter 4, practices and notions vary according to sects or traditions, and even within the same tradition. But within this diversity there still exists a unity of vision and theory and even in the pattern of the practices,9 so that such a general approach as our one is, I believe, possible. We shall thus see first the ritual practices, the technique as it were, of *japa*. Then will be seen the mental, or somato-psychic and spiritual aspect of *japa* as a way towards liberation as well as a devotional practice. We shall end by looking at a few popular forms of *japa*.

Admittedly, this threefold division of the subject made for clarity’s sake is artificial since, in actual practice, ritual technique and mental effort are both always present in *japa* \(it is a ‘Murmelmeditation’ to use the very evocative German expression\), being also often associated with devotion and the quest for liberation, as we shall see.



### japavidhi
Ritual practices, the japa techniques: japavidhi

*Japa* is currently used by Hindus as a common religious practice,10 a time of concentration, of devotion, of mental or vocal prayer. It is also – and, if one refers to texts, one could say that it is statistically mainly – an essential element of a large number of ritual practices. It is one of the domains where there appears most evidently the ritual minutia and superabundance or redundancy characteristic of Tantric Hinduism. It is, of course, a domain where *bhakti* plays a prominent role, but where it seems, for one who relies on normative works \(but perhaps we misread them?\), that the ritual manipulation of the power of the word – mantras being the efficiently usable form of the deity – has there the pride of place; devotion and ritualism being of course not incompatible – many rites are prescribed as having to be done ‘with devotion’, *bhaktyā*. There are, too, Tantric texts which extol the transcending of rites. Such is the case of the Kaulas, as appears for instance in Abhinavagupta’s TĀ, or in the KT, which says: ‘silence is the supreme *japa*’ \(*maunam eva paro japaḥ–* KT 9.38\). But in most cases *japa* is a ritual action.

A *japa*, the ritual formalised repetition of a mantra, is thus prescribed in the *mantrasādhana* where it is part of the *puraścaraṇa*; in the cult of deities which always include one or several *japas*; or in *kāmya* rites, especially for those of a ‘magical’ sort such as the so-called *ṣaṭkarmāṇi*, etc.; finally in daily rites, whether the private *sandhya* or the *pūjā*, a field where the prescription of *japa* is very ancient \(see Kane, *History of Dharmaśāstra*, vol. 5, p. 685\), in the initiation \(*dīkṣā*\) rituals, in those of atonement and reparation \(*prāyaścitta*\), for the installation of temples and images, etc., all occasions where a deity is invoked or where some formula of praise or homage is repeated so as to benefit from the deity’s grace or favour, or in view of some mundane or other-wordly benefit.11

*Japa* may consist in different utterances. We have seen that of *bhur bhuvaḥ svar*, which is Vedic. In Tantric practice, what is recited is usually the mantra of the deity \(or of an aspect of the deity\) that is aimed at by the rite, and, in such cases, all sorts of mantras may be used, going from a short or long formula to mere ritual syllables – *bījas* – either isolated \(*ḤRĪṂ, HSAUḤ, KLĪṂ*, etc.\) or in a group, as for instance the fifteen syllables of the *śrīvidyā* \(*HA SA KA LA HRĪṂ*, etc.\). Or, more often it is a \(often much longer\) enunciation where *bījas* and words are associated.12 Considering the extent of the Tantric pantheons and the quasi-infinite number of supernatural beings, powers or elements that can be invoked for a variety of ends, the number of ritual formulas that can be uttered in *japa* is enormous, this in spite of a great monotony of forms and pattern.

*Japa* may consist, too, of the mere repetition of the phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet. Many texts prescribe the *japa* of the ‘garland of letters’ \(*varṇamālā*\) from A to KṢA, which in that case appears more or less as a phonetic variant of the rosary \(*akṣamālā*\).13 Its fifty phonemes are sometimes to be enunciated with the *bindu*, that is from *AṂ ĀṂ*, etc. to *KṢAṂ*. I have not seen any case of *japa* of the other order of the alphabet, the *ṇādiphāntakrama* of the Mālinī. But the forty-two phonemes of the *bhūtalipi* \(the ‘writing of the elements’\), from *A* to *ŚA*, are sometimes used for *japa*, notably as an ‘encapsulation’ \(*saṃpuṭa*\) of a mantra so as to increase its power.14 In all these cases the aim is, for the *jāpaka*, to master or at least to invoke the power, the *śakti*, of these phonetic groupings. He also invokes this power when doing the *japa* of a mantra since all mantras are made up of phonemes.15

Whatever its phonetic substance, the *japa* must always be done following the very strict rules governing the utterance of mantras, these rules being usually specially stringent for *kāmya* rites. Such rules, however, vary according to traditions as well as to circumstances. They are, as is usually the case in India, numerous and very detailed – details into which we cannot enter here. We shall limit ourselves to those which are more frequent and usual, and to those that are more characteristic both of the usual form of *japa* and of the meaning and scope generally attributed to this practice in the Hindu world.

TIME. The prescriptions concerning the time when a *japa* is to be done will not detain us much since this is usually the time for the performance of the ritual ensemble of which *japa* is a part. The rules on time for *japa* are therefore those governing the daily, occasional or optional Hindu rites \(*sandhya, pūjā, puraścaraṇa*, etc.\). We may, however, note that some Tantric rites are to be performed during the night \(see, for instance, *Gandharvatantra* \(GT\) 29 on the *kulayāga* of the *vidyā* of Tripurasundarī\). On the matter of time, the observing Hindu will follow the rules of his social group.16 The proper time is also the one prescribed for the deity of the mantra to be particularly worshipped.17 The rules may vary according to the result one is looking for. The length of the *japa* is also prescribed. It depends upon the number of repetitions – we will come back to the subject later \(pp. 31–32\). There are also rules of a general sort to be followed in all cases where special rules do not apply; this happens in particular when *japa* is used as a prayer or a spiritual exercise, not as a portion of a particular rite – see on this, for instance, LT 28 where the daily obligations of the adept are prescribed: he is, the tantra says, to unite spiritually \(*yoga*\) with the supreme deity, then, ‘when tired with yoga, he must do a *japa*, when tired of this, he will again practice yoga’ \(ibid. p. 48\). *Japa*, as we shall see further on, is among the practices prescribed in the various forms of yoga.18

PLACE. The place to practise *japa* is the subject of meticulously detailed prescriptions, which take into account so many different possibilities that following the rules is made easier. Though varied, these rules always aim at determining a favourable place, that is, a peaceful one, pure, far from all natural and \(still more\) supernatural danger: the peace and mental concentration of the person who repeats a mantra must not be troubled, for it is only when at peace that he/she can hope to gain the merit, or obtain the favourable mundane or spiritual advantage he/she expects to result from the process. Such a place is often called a *puṇyakṣetra*, an auspicious place, a term that is also used to refer to a sacred spot or a pilgrimage site, generally to all places where one performs a pious action or where one acquires merit: all elements denoted by the word *puṇya*.

The choice of the *puṇyakṣetra* is specially important in the *mantrasādhana*, the ascetic practice which gives the *sādhaka* the mastery over his mantra \(a rite also called *puraścaraṇa*19\), for it is a long and complex process which can only be pursued in an appropriate and carefully chosen place.20 Once the mantra is mastered, its *japa* can be performed whenever the ritual during which it occurs is to take place. Here, for instance, is a quotation from the KT \(15.22–24\) on the subject: ‘The auspicious places \[can be\] a riverside, a cavern, a pilgrimage place, the meeting of two rivers, a sacred grove, solitary parks, the foot of a bilva tree, a mountainside, a temple, the seaside, one’s own house. Such are the places prescribed for the *sādhana* of mantras.’ The KT then adds: ‘Or \[the adept\] will stay where his spirit rejoices’: a remarkably generous prescription\! Thereafter the KT quotes some other favourable spots, as well as those to be avoided, among which are those where one may meet kings and their retinue.21 Rules evidently vary according to texts and traditions. For some Tantric systems, and especially for some rites where the officiant is possessed by a wrathful deity or where power results from impurity and transgression,22 the most impure and inauspicious places are, on the contrary, preferably chosen, these being usually cremation grounds \(*śmaśāna*\), where dark powers lurk and where the horror and impurity of death is often associated with the transgression of orthodox rules of conduct, those notably concerning sexual purity.23

Chosen according to the result wished for, the *puṇyakṣetra* must also \(except in such cases as just mentioned\) be cleaned and purified. Sometimes, a *maṇḋala* is to be drawn. It is, in particular, necessary to protect it from all possible bad and dangerous powers by mantras and mudrās, and/or by invoking and worshipping the guardians of the quarters of the sky \(*dikpāla*\) and by offering them a *bali*.24

In this context of choosing a stable, peaceful and auspicious spot, the texts also say on what the *jāpaka* is to sit \(the *āsana*\), what bodily attitude \(*karaṇa*\) he is to assume,25 and what direction he must face. The clothes to be worn are also sometimes mentioned, especially their colour, which is often to be the same as that of the deity being invoked.26 If a rosary is used, the texts say how to hold the hand, which is often wearing a *pavitra*27 \(*apavitrakaro … na japet*\); they say too in which direction one must look, etc.28 In addition to these external observances, mental composure, peace, silence, self-control, inner purity, and so forth are also prescribed, since they are necessary: there is no *japa* without mental concentration on the mantra and on the deity. All these rules evidently do not apply in the case of transgressive rites; the *Brahmayāmalatantra*, chapter 21, for instance, in a passage describing the *vidyāvrata* observance, says that the yogin, covered with ashes, contracting his brow \(*bhrūkuṭī*\), is to do *japa* while laughing boisterously \(*aṭṭahāsa*\).29 The *Siddhayogeśvarīmata*,30 27.23ff. contains analogous prescriptions for the *japa* of the Heart of Bhairava mantra: in a cremation ground, at night, among vampires, Yoginīs, etc.

Even when *japa* is merely a portion of a larger ritual ensemble – and some texts say that *japa* must necessarily be part of a cult: *saṃpūjyaiva japaṃ kuryān na mantra kevalaṃ japet* \(TBhS p. 323, in a passage on *puraścaraṇa*\) – it should nevertheless begin in principle by a preliminary rite consisting mainly of *nyāsas* on the body. First the *nyāsa* of the *r̥ṣi*, etc. and of the main mantra \(*mūlamantra*\) which is to be recited, then of its *aṇgas* \(*hr̥daya, śiras, śikhā*, etc.\) on the hand and on the body \(*karāṅganyāsa*\).31 Next, the reciter will place on his head a *vidyā* called *kullūkā*, which varies according to the mantra recited, then, on his heart and neck he places two other mantras, called *mahāsetu* and *setu*.32 The *japa* itself is then to be performed \(sometimes after other preliminary rites33\) according to prescription. For the daily domestic worship, the ritual can be very limited, but even then some ritual action is always to take place.34

Texts also describe cases when no *japa* is to be performed; or what is to be done in case it is interrupted or disturbed by some external element \(seeing certain animals, for instance\), or by a bodily incident, such as sneezing, yawning, etc., and then how to take it up again so that it does not lose its efficacy. Atonement rites \(*prāyaścitta*\) are prescribed for the purpose.35 There is no need to go into the details of such prescriptions. We mention some of them here because they underline the technical or the ritual manipulation aspect of *japa –* one might say its aspect of magical use of the power of the word – and also because such details underline the typically Hindu constant attention given to the rules protecting a ritual action from dangers and impurities.

All these preliminary conditions and prescribed rules being respected, the *japa* itself can now be performed.

We have already seen that, following an ancient rule, a *japa* can be of three sorts: it can be voiced \(*vācika*\), done audibly \(*nigadena*\) uttered in a very low voice \(*upāṃśu*\); or done mentally \(*mānasa*\). These different forms of *japa* are used for different ends: see thus LT 29.35, Mr̥g *Kp* 4, or *Cp* 1.67 and their commentary, or JS 14.3–4, etc. – *vācikaṃ kṣudrakarmabhya upāmśuṃ siddhikarmāṇī mānasaṃmokṣakarmārthaṃ* For the GT. 18.434, mental *japa* is prescribed only for Tripurā’s mantra, while other mantras can be repeated otherwise.36 Other works, especially modern ones, refine these distinctions by distinguishing between up to twelve \(and even more\) different sorts of *japa*, notably according to the way the utterance is associated to the movement of breath.37

Of a general and traditional sort is the rule, too, that the mantra recited is to be clearly uttered, neither too slowly nor too fast: *na drutaṃ nāpi vilambitaṃ japen **mantram*.38 This prescription also applies to the silent and the mental *japas* since, even when silently uttered or mentally evoked, words or syllables are to be articulated. The prescribed number of repetitions is also carefully to be taken care of: *na nyūnaṃ nātiriktaṃ va japaṃ huryāt dine dine* \(TBhS, p. 326 quoting the *Muṇḋamālātantra*\). This is an essential prescription in *kāmya* rites where the result wished for depends on the exact observance of the prescribed rules.

It goes without saying, finally, that *japa* presupposes not only the repetition of the mantra but also a careful attention paid to this recitation: on the phonic content and on the import of the formula being recited, which is to say to the deity that is thus invoked or worshipped. This implies, to various degrees, singleness of mind, mental concentration or spiritual effort \(*dhyāna, dhāraṇa, bhāvanā*\) – something already prescribed in *Yogasūtra* 28.39 *Japa* also presupposes devotion \(*bhakti*\). As we shall see later on, this mental/spiritual aspect of *japa* can in some cases be the most important one. It may even be, in the most complex and subtle *japa* practices, those in which the whole *japa* consists. But even in ‘ordinary’ cases it is always somehow there \(this bears out the German translation of *japa* by ‘Murmelmeditation’\): the mere mechanical repetition of a mantra without paying attention to it does not suffice. This agrees with the conception of mantras found in many Tantric works, which is that mantras, though deemed to act by their own power \(*mantravīrya*\), function only together with the mind of the mantrin \(or worshipper, as the SpK 2.11 says: *sahārādhakacittena*\). *Japa* is thus associated with *dhyāna* in the two meanings of that word: meditation and visualisation of the deity. Many texts clearly say that while doing *japa* one is to meditate and mentally evoke the aspect of the *devatā* as described in *dhyānaślokas*: *dhyānaṃ kurvan japet vidvān*, says the *Śeṣaṃhitā* 21 \(p. 111\). Bhaṭṭanārāyaṇakaṇṭha’s commentary on MR̥g *Cp* 7.70 on the calling to mind \(*smr̥ti*\) of the deity describes this act as a mental representation \(*anusmaraṇa*\), which is twofold: *dhyāna*, the visualisation of the aspect of the god, and *japa* \(ibid. p. 106, transl. p. 178\). The mantra being the phonic form of the deity, its recitation is a means for fastening on the deity the performer’s attention, a phonetic way to bring about a sensuously perceptible awareness of a real divine presence.40 This is what we shall see when describing complex forms of *japa*. It is implicit, for instance, in the prescriptions of LT 28 \(see above p. 28\) where the *japa* prolongs the yogic meditation. This is also what one finds – in a very different way – in the devotional, ‘popular’, ancient or modern forms of repetition of the deity’s Name \(*bhajan, nāmasaṃkīrtan*\), which are also ways not only to worship the deity, but also to strive towards a mystical union \(see *infra*, p. 45\).

Though being always a mental or spiritual activity, *japa* nevertheless remains, from another point of view, essentially a technique for using or manipulating to certain ends the power enclosed in the phonic substance of mantras. It is often performed in ways which remind us of the *vikr̥ti* of Vedic recitation where the order of words and even that of syllables is modified, inverted, so that the sound aspect only, the combination of words and sound, not the meaning, plays a role. \(This insofar, of course, as there is no human utterance without a meaning or value; insofar too that all ritual actions since the Veda imply an intention, *saṃkalpa*, explicit or implicit, which orientates and gives a meaning to that ritual act, which cannot be purely automatic and without meaning for the performer.41\) These technical manipulations of the phonetic substance of mantras are named *yoga, pallava, saṃpuṭa*, and so forth: we need not expatiate on them here since they are described in this volume in chapter 7. They are also to be found in Buddhism, in the *Sādhanamālā*, for instance.

Since it consists in repeating a formula, *japa* always lasts for some time, the length of which varies greatly. When it is a mantrayoga practice associated with the ascent of *kuṇḋalinī*, there may be no repetition at all. The act may even be, at least in theory, of the most extreme brevity, less than a second, and still be considered as a *japa*.42 It can also be limited, in the course of a ritual, to very few utterances, or to one utterance only: the case is frequent. When repetitions are prescribed, their number is often 108, a number of religious symbolic value, or, still better, 1008. But tens or hundreds of thousands, even millions of repetitions are also prescribed. Such prescriptions seem, in fact, often to be rather theoretical, their raison d’être seeming to be more to set a correspondence between, on the one hand, the number of repetitions and, on the other, the cosmic and human context of the utterance and the result aimed at, this without much regard for practical feasibility. Of course, the texts, prescribing these *japas* being revealed and considered as instructions given by a deity to another deity, express themselves *sub specie aeternitatis*, leaving it to others \(the human master who teaches and the ritual manuals which comment the texts\) to see to it that divine principles agree somehow with practical human necessities. Hinduism, one well knows, is as precise in its principles as it is flexible in their application. In temple rituals, on important festival days, the number of *japa* repetitions voiced by a number of officiants, may, adding all those who recite, reach incredibly large numbers.43 In private practice, a complete *japa* may last months and even years.

A relationship is sometimes postulated between the length of the *japa* and the cosmic cycles \(*yuga*\), or the four *varṇas* \(or the different types of adepts\). Thus the *Tārārṇavatantra* quoted in the TBhS \(pp. 315–316\), says that the *japa* is to last twice longer in the Tretayuga than in the Satyayuga, thrice more in the Dvāpara, and four times more in the Kaliyuga; and in those four cases \(three of which are purely theoretical\), *japa* will go from one *lakh* for the *vīras* to four for the *paśus*, in Satyayuga; then from four for the first category and sixteen for the second one in the present cosmic age. It appears too – this is a more useful point – that the number of repetitions is smaller for obligatory \(*nitya*\) rites than for *kāmya* ones, which is reasonable since the efficacy \(or the belief in the efficacy, which comes to the same\) of a *japa* increases with the number of repetitions, and since *kāmya* rites are those done for a specific and specially wished for end. The harder the aim is to reach, the greater the number of repetitions will be. In the *puraścaraṇa* of a mantra, the *japa* will also be very long since the aim is to master the power of the mantra. In the *prāyaścittas*, the duration of the *japa* will naturally depend on the seriousness of the fault, mistake or omission to be atoned for \(or on the importance of the event or circumstance to be prevented or ‘appeased’\). We may mention here the case of the *ajapājapa*, the *japa* of *haṃsa*. The number of repetitions, in this case, cannot to be counted; but since it is associated with breathing it is supposed to be repeated 21,600 times in twenty-four hours; if it is performed during several months \(as can well be the case\), repetitions can easily run into millions. We will come back to this practice later \(see pp. 43–44\). It seems also that *japa* can sometimes be done without counting. The texts I have seen seem, however, to condemn this practice. The *Br̥hatkalottarāgama* quoted in the Īśp, vol. 3, p. 122, says that an uncounted \(*asaṃkhyātam*\) *japa* or *homa* will be seized by demons \(*gr̥nantyāsurarākṣasāh*. – information H. Brunner\).

There are of course many prescriptions concerning the bodily postures, the clothes to be worn, the mental attitude, etc., necessary during *japa*. Normally it is to be done seated in a particular posture \(*padmāsana, siddhāsana*, etc.\). Sometimes one must remain motionless, without even moving the head or neck.44 *Japa* can also be practised while walking, lying or during some activity, provided it is pure \(except in transgressive rites\). Cases where rules are relaxed are to be found more in the context of devotion \(*bhakti*\), where feeling and emotion is more important than ritual. On the contrary, the minute ritual precisions aim at ensuring the rigorous respect of the bodily or mental attitudes deemed necessary for securing the result aimed at.45 Beyond \(or rather below\) the, one could say, technical necessity of the scrupulous respect of ritual rules, all the prescriptions we have seen are there to make sure that all conditions exist that permit the reciter to concentrate on the *japa* without any distraction or disturbance.

It also happens, especially when *japa* is part of a *pūjā*, that *mudrās* are to be shown whilst reciting, the gesture underlining or reinforcing in some way the inner attitude of the performer, or expressing respect to the deity. The main hand gesture in *japa* is, first of all, that of the hand counting the number of repetitions. Here, too, prescriptions are meticulous. We cannot describe them all. Here are merely a few indications.

To count the number of repetitions of the mantra one uses either one’s fingers or a rosary \(*akṣamālā*\). In the first case, the hand is considered as a rosary whose grains would be made up by the phalanxes, hence the term *karamālā*. We know that Indians currently count on their fingers, touching each phalanx with the thumb. For *japa* one does this going from the ring-finger to the little finger, ending on the index, thus counting ten; this of course on the right hand. \(The left hand may also be used in the same way to count each ten repetition, cowries, etc, being used for counting hundreds.46\)

More important than the *karamālā* is the *akṣamālā* or *aksasūtra*, the rosary. Its use and all related ritual details, from its preparation to its destruction, as they are described in the fourteenth chapter of the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* of the Pāñcarātra, are the subject of chapter 5 of this book. We therefore need not expatiate on the subject here. Suffice it to say that the rules set down by the JayS apply generally in all Tantric traditions, with naturally a number of variants. Rules concerning the material of the beads, the number of their ‘faces’, how to use the rosary, and so forth, are to be found in several āgamas or tantras, such as the SvT, the GT, the Kir, the MatP, etc., or in the TBhS, the Īśp, etc. The rules all aim at giving the greatest possible efficiency to the *japa* when done with a rosary – which is never considered as a mere material help but as a ritual instrument used to invoke or coerce supernatural forces. Thus, the rosary can be used only after it has been purified, consecrated, ritually impregnated with divine power \(*śakti* or *prāṇa*\) which has been placed in it by a particular ritual process. Most rosaries have 108 beads. They include one more additional bead placed on the knot joining the ends of the string, named Meru, which is not only used for counting the repetitions but also must never be ‘overstepped’.47 The rosary therefore is used by counting the grains, not round, but back and forth. This is done holding it in the right hand on which it rests on the middle, the ring and the little fingers,48 the thumb being used for moving it. The general rule is that no one is to see the *japa* being thus practised, the hand is usually hidden under a cloth, or, better, is kept in a small bag called *gaumukhi*.49 Sometimes, the place where to hold one’s hand whilst doing *japa* is also prescribed; this varies according to the aim for which, or to the time when, the *japa* is performed.

Except for the longest *japas*, the repetition must be done continuously, without any interruption. If it is interrupted, it must be taken up again, or an atonement rite \(*prāyaścitta*\) is to be performed. One must be careful not to release, or, worse, to let drop the rosary during *japa* – nor, in fact, at any other time: ‘a rosary one has let fall must be washed with perfumed water and \[purified\] by reciting a hundred *gāyatrīs*’, says the SP, *prāyaścittavidhiḥ, śl*. 49 \(SP2, p. 262\).

The *japa* must end ritually by paying homage to the rosary, to which one will pay respect by joining hands or by holding it to one’s head. It will then be carefully put away while uttering *Oṃ* or some other mantra. When the *japa* is to be done in the course of a *pūjā*, it must, when finished, be offered to the deity that is being worshipped.50 There are also rules concerning how to dispose of a worn rosary \(which must not be used since it could break during *japa*, which would be very inauspicious\):51 one must not leave it aside, but throw it ritually in water after having knotted it together with a stone while uttering the Viśvakṣena mantra,52 doing a libation and invoking Hari by reciting seven times the *mūlamantra* \(so the JS 14.34–35\). One can also \(this is better\) cut it and unwind the string which is then thrown in deep water, the beads being used again for the new rosary that is to replace the old one.

The rules we have just seen are those generally to be followed when *japa* is performed as a devotional act, or for some other reason, or as part of a ritual action: *pūjā, puraścaraṇa*, and so forth. It is in those last cases that the prescriptions are most complex and are to be most carefully followed since these are the cases when *japa* is most clearly a manipulation of the power of the word, this being more specially the case in rites aiming at mastering the power of a mantra or in *kāmya* rites, in initiation, etc. But even in the daily mandatory \(*nitya*\) cult, *japa* is part of the ritual and must be performed according to rules.

*Puraścaraṇa. Japa* is a part of the *puraścaraṇa* ritual \(also called *pūrvasevā*\), a preliminary ritual action \(*puraśkriyā*\) to be performed before the cult of every deity so as to master this deity’s mantra, a ritual specially important in *kāmya* rites. It is generally considered as being made up of ‘five members’ \(*pañcāṅga*\) usually mentioned in the order: *japa, tarpana, abhiṣeka, homa, brahmabhukti*: recitation of the mantra, ‘satisfaction’ of the deity, consecration, oblation in the fire, offerings to the Brahmins,53 *japa* being naturally mentioned first since the aim of the rite is to master a form of the power of the word. The *puraścaraṇa* is sometimes described somewhat differently. Thus, for the KT, it comprises *pūjā, japa, tarpana, homa* and *brahmabhukti*;54 but it always includes a *japa*, and may even consist merely of it, either alone, or accompanied by oblations in the fire \(*homa*\). Thus Mr̥g *Cp*. 76: ‘\[Every day,\] after having ritually worshipped Śiva, he will worship the mantra to be propitiated and perform the *japa*. Then, he shall perform a *homa*.’55 In such cases the number of repetitions is usually very great,56 the *japa* then lasts a long time. Thus, for the TĀ 23.31ff., after his consecration \(*abhiṣeka*\), the *ācārya* is to meditate and recite \(*dhyāyej japet*\) during six months all the mantras that have been revealed to him, and is to identify himself with them and thus participate in their power \(*yadaiva tanmayībhūtas tadā vīryam upāgataḥ*\). That a *japa* can bestow such mastery is explained by the pervasion of the consciousness of the reciter resulting from the very duration of the repetition. This is an opportunity to say again here that, for Tantric texts, nothing is higher than mantras, and therefore nothing surpasses the value, the merit and the efficacy of *japa*. The KT says thus that in comparison with the sacrifice of *japa*, no other rite can be greater, nor superior, for by *japa* one can attain all the four aims of mankind:


*japayajñāt paro yajño ‘stīha kaścana* /

*tasmāj japena dharmārthakāmamohṣāṃśca sādhayet* //


The *japa* done during *puraścaraṇa* is among those where the prescriptions we have seen \(place, time, clothing, etc.\) are especially important since this is a very strictly organised ritual aiming at harnessing the powers of the word, a harnessing which may have all kinds of results, saving as well as ‘magical’, since in the Tantric context it is possible for any ritual action to aim at conferring supernatural powers as well as liberation.57

Normally the *japa* is followed by oblations in the fire \(*homa*\) which appear thus as a complement or achievement of the *japa* since the fire carries upward the whole sacrifice as an offering to the deity.58 The number of oblations is always less than the number of repetitions and proportionate to it, the usual ratio is one *homa* to ten *japas*, but it can be different; this rule applies notably in the case of the *pūjā*. Like all rites, the *puraścaraṇa* ritual varies according to traditions. It can be part of the most extreme Tantric practices.59 Its role remains, however, always the same, and it is an essential one for, in theory, it is the ritual which gives the adept the mastery over a mantra which will be used in all the rites he will accomplish to all possible ends – rewards \(mundane or celestial\) as well as liberation.

*Sandhyā pūjā. Japa* is also to be performed as part of the daily cult of the deity, be it private or public \(in a temple\), done for oneself or for others, obligatory \(*nitya*\) or optional \(*kāmya*\).

In the daily brahmanical *sandhyā*, to be performed theoretically three times a day \(morning, midday, evening\), the essential element of the ritual is the recitation of the *gāyatrī*: ‘This is the absolutely necessary portion of a Hindu prayer and this silent muttering is called *japa*’, ‘*japa* or prayer has been said to be the principal part of *gāyatrī*’, says the author of the classical *Daily Practice of the Hindus* \(pp. 33, 39\). This *gāyatrī*, with *OṂ* and the *vyāhr̥tis*, is to be repeated ten, twentyeight or 108 times, say the texts, which underline the social and cosmic import of this act, which not only confirms the caste status of the performer but also ensures the cosmic movement of the sun.

This is for Brahmanism. But in the ritual Hindu worship of deities, the *pūjā japa* is equally mandatory. It is usually one of the last items of the *pūjā*. In the daily domestic Tantric cult as described, for instance, in the SP \(SP 1, sect. III, 93–100, pp. 216–225\), Śiva’s cult ends with the *japa* of the god’s *mūlamantra*, repeated 108 times \(*śl*. 93\) using a rosary. According to the SP, the *japa* is ‘consecrated by the \[mantra\] *HR̥D*, enveloped by the cuirass \[mantra\] and protected by the sword \[mantra\]’ \(*hr̥dabhimantritaṃ varma veṣitaṃ khaḋgarakṣitam*\), then it is offered to Śiva with a *mudrā*.60 This means, as H. Brunner explains, that one recites the *mūlamantra* 108 times with a rosary on which one has recited the mantra *HR̥D* while holding in the other hand a flower which one ‘envelopes and protects’ with the two other mantras. These are then considered to be the receptacle for the *japa* which along with the flower and consecrated water \(*arghya*\) will be offered to Śiva. For this offering, the officiant puts it in the hand of the god asking him to accept it and to grant him full success \(*siddhir me bhavatu – śl*. 95\), that is, obtaining the spiritual or mundane advantages he is looking for. This is an interesting ritual whether one takes it as being essentially a symbolic \(self-interested\) gift to the deity of the prayer \(considered as something one can theoretically either give or keep after it has been uttered\), or as an inflow of power transmitted by an object61 \(with the transfer of the *japa* to the image of the deity by means of a flower\). These are two conceptions of the word and its powers of which other instances are found in the *mantraśāstra*.

On the same rite, this is what the Mr̥g, *Kp*. 3.29–30, says:


Who wishes liberation must offer his *japa* while uttering the Heart \[mantra\] at its beginning and at the end; this he does bowing down without wishing for anything \[in counterpart\] and by using the dative case: “To You I offer \[this *japa*\].” The *sādhaka* offers it while keeping in mind what he wishes \[to obtain\], and declaring the number \[of *japas* he has done\]: “O Bhagavan \! keep \[this *japa* for me.\]” This is to be done everyday.


Bhaṭṭanārāyaṇakaṇṭha, in his *Vr̥tti*, adds that the *mumukṣu* offers the *japa* ‘bowing down without any desire’ and the *bubhukṣu* ‘keeping in mind what he desires’ \(ibid. p. 55, note 2\). Here again are two uses of *japa*.

Other ritual treatises, in a non-dualistic context, underline the unity of the mantra and of the deity \(of which it is the *vācaka*, ‘what expresses’ it, its phonic aspect\) and the fact that the repeated utterance of the mantra identifies the officiant with the deity \(this in spite of the fact that this identification is already acquired from the start according to the rule *nādevo devam arcayet*\).62 This identification will be reinforced before the *japa* begins by the placing \(*nyāsa*\) on the body of the ritual actor of the mantra, of its *kullūkā, setu, mahāsetu*, of its *r̥ṣi, chandas*, etc., of its *aṇgas* and other parts \(*avayava*\).63 In the same non-dualistic perspective, the giving over of the *japa* in the hand of the deity can also be felt as symbolising the fusion in the deity. The GT \(18. 51\), for instance, explains that by offering his *japa*, the officiant \(of the *puraścaraṇa*, in this case\) is to consider that the ‘luminous fruit’ resulting from it is absorbed by the god: *tejorūpaṃ japaphalaṃ śivayā svīktaṃ smaret*. In a similar fashion, Āmr̥tānanda, in his commentary on YH 3.192 which prescribes this offering in the left hand of the goddess64 \(this being done symbolically since the cult is made on a *śrīcakra* without any icon\), interprets this mental rite as a symbolic fusion of the mind of the officiant with the divine Consciousness.65 We may note that the offering of the mantra to the deity \(*japanivedana* or *japasamarpana*\) is not specially Tantric: it is a prescribed item of the daily obligatory cult, the *sandhyā*, the process of which remains very largely Brahmanic-Vedic. The Hindu domestic *sandhyā*, however, is more or less Tantric according to traditions: more Tantric when Śaiva, less when Vaiśnava.66 The cult in the temples, when described in the āgamas or tantras, however, is Tantric. It includes *japa*, since it does not differ in principle from the domestic ritual; one nevertheless feels, when reading the texts, that *japa* is less important in temple than in domestic cults.

The way according to which *japa* is done when it is a part of the *pūjā* varies according to each tradition, the rules being generally those we have seen before.67

*Ṣaṭkarmāṇi Japa* plays evidently a fundamental role in all magical rites, for in all such rites the expected mundane effect is always to be achieved by mantras, which are usually to be repeated. The magical act consists in a manipulation of the powers of the word. If *kāmya* rites are performed in view of a mundane or supramundane \(but interested\) result, this aspect can also be found in Tantric obligatory \(*nitya*\) rites. For instance, in the *śrīcakra* cult as described in the YH, which is mandatory for all adepts, the *pūjā* accomplished in each of the constituent parts of this diagram gives a particular supernatural ‘great power’ \(*mahāsiddhi*\).68 One knows, of course, that the *sādhaka* who performs this ritual is more often a *bubhukṣu* than a *mumukṣu*, and that in a Tantric context liberation-oriented practices also give supernatural powers. More specifically magical appear to be the ritual actions done exclusively for mundane ends, and especially those aiming at sending evil harmful spells \(*abhicāra*\), rites sometimes called ‘cruel’ \(*krūra*\). Such is the case of the so-called ‘six \[magical\] actions’ \(*ṣaṭkarmāṇi*\) described in a number of Tantric texts. These are generally given as being: *śānti, vaśikaraṇa, stambhana, vidveṣaṇa, uccāṭana* and *māraṇa*, that is, appeasing, dominating, enchanting, immobilisation, hostility and killing.69 To these are sometimes added fascination \(*mohana*\), attraction \(*ākarṣaṇa*\) and *puṣṭi*, which gives prosperity, thus a total of nine actions.

During these rituals \(which we will not describe here\), there is always a moment when the *japa* of a mantra is prescribed, be it to invoke a deity, to ask for help, or for some other reason, the mantra being usually made up of several *bījas* and some other words, together with the name of the person or of the entity aimed at by the rite. It is mostly in such cases that the interpolations or ‘encapsulations’ of syllables named *yoga, pallava, saṃpuṭa* \(which we shall see in chapter 7\) usually occur, each being used for aiming at a particular result. Thus the TBhS \(p. 369\) prescribes the use of *pallava* for *maraṇa, uccāṭana* and *vidveśana*, for expelling poisons and fighting against evil spirits and *bhūtas*, the *yoga* practice being used for *puṣṭi, śānti* and *vaśyakaraṇa* rites, and so forth. The strictest respect of all rules of utterance is evidently necessary in such cases since they are manipulations of the power of the word.70 Particular mantras are to be used in such rites, where the same text prescribes the audible form of utterance, this being explained by the lower nature of such practices \(see above, p. 25\). The inflection \(*jāti*\) placed at the end of the mantra varies according to the rite.71 Sometimes where to look is also prescribed: in different directions for different rites; or different substances for the beads of the rosary \(*rudrākṣa* for *vaśya*, shell for *śānti*, etc.\). The number of repetitions is also prescribed, as well as how to hold the hand or which fingers to use to count the beads – for instance, thumb and index for *vidveṣa* and *uccāṭana* etc.72 All such rules do not apply merely to the *ṣaṭkarmāṇi*: in all *kāmya* rites, the *japa* is long and plays an essential role.73

*Prāyaścitta*. In the rites of appeasement, protection and atonement \(*śānti* and *prāyaścitta*\) – rites analogous in some respects to those we have just seen – *japa* also often plays an important role. The rites of appeasement and atonement for faults in personal conduct or in the performance of domestic private rites consist mostly in a *japa*, sometimes brief \(108 *gāyatrīs*, for instance\), sometimes very long – thus, for instance, 100,000 Aghoramantras \(according to the SP2, pp. 240–241\) for the Śaiva initiate whose personal *liṅga* has been lost, burnt or taken away. Such recitations are sometimes accompanied by other acts or rites of atonement. In temple rituals, on the contrary, *japa* does not appear essential: *homa* and *snapana* are more important.

It is, however, present, and necessary if only because there is no rite without the utterance of mantras. In *prāyaścitta* as in other rites, the phonic content and the accompanying rites are strictly codified \(in SP, for instance, 117 *ślokas* are on this subject: SP2 pp. 224–329\). They are to be most carefully executed. The spirit of these rites – which aim at repairing/compensating the dire effects of errors or omissions – is in effect not one of devotion, regret or penance: they are technical actions74 – this even though creative mental concentration \(*bhāvanā*\) plays a noticeable role, especially when deities are invoked \(but *bhāvana* too is a technique\). *Japa* intervenes in *prāyaścitta* because this ritual, like most others, brings into play the efficacy of the ritual word.

*Dīkṣā. Japa* intervenes also in initiation – *dīkṣā –* the rite through which the disciple receives a mantra from his guru. It also takes place in the consecration \(*abhiṣeka*\) of the *ācārya* and of the *sādhaka*. However, it appears there more as part of the cult that accompanies the *dīkṣā* than of the initiatory rite itself. It may thus take place only towards the end of the ritual: the mantra, once bestowed to the initiand and thereafter ‘satisfied’ by oblations in the fire, is then to be repeated by the newly initiated in a first *japa* which prefaces, as it were, the longer one he will have to perform during his *mantrasādhana*.75 The initiating master, too, according to the SP \(SP3, p. 496–497\), must everyday do some *japa* \(*svalpam ahni japaṃ kuryāt*\). The TĀ \(23. 31–40\) says that the *ācārya* who has been consecrated must, during six months, identify himself by *bhāvanā* with the mantra. But there are many different initiations, their ritual varying considerably.

The *japa* may sometimes take place as a preliminary purifying or perfecting action for the candidate to initiation. Thus, the ṢāṭS, chapter 16, prescribes 400 recitations of the Vasudevamantra during four days so as to be purified \(see too JRY, 2.10 – ref. Sanderson\). In chapter 17 of this saṃhitā, a mantra is to be repeated 700,000 times as a preliminary to the *nārasiṃhadīkṣā*,76 but this has probably more to do with appeasement or atonement rites than properly speaking with initiation. During the initiation ritual mantras are continuously to be uttered and especially placed by *nyāsa* on the body of the initiand. They may be recited to him by the initiating master,77 who is also to do *japas* for other reasons.78 Often the repetition is accompanied by oblations in the fire, so that the ritual is more a *homa* than a *japa*, which appears here as of limited importance in the initiation process since this repetition is nothing more than making use of a mantra already given, taking place therefore after the *dīkṣā* rather than being part of it.

There are many other rites where a *japa* takes place, but which we shall not see here.79 We mentioned earlier the role of *japa* in yoga, where it is a means for focusing the attention on the *praṇava OṂ*. It can also be prescribed in other very different contexts where the repeated word can be considered as effective or where it may have a psychological usefulness. This is the case when *japa* is used in medicine or in alchemy for preparing drugs or for curing a disease. Caraka, for instance, prescribes *japa* for a rejuvenation cure where it is supposed to have the highest purificatory efficiency \(*japasaucaparam*\). As we have seen, *japa* may also have curative effects in non-medical contexts of all sorts \(*puraṣcaraṇa*, etc.\).



### Mental, somato-psychic or spiritual practices

All the ritual meticulousness we have just seen \(albeit not exhaustively\) is essential to *japa*. It is not merely its outer aspect. It expresses its nature and spirit. *Japa*, indeed, is a practice both vocal \(or at least linked to a particular plane of the word\) and ritual. It is a highly ritualised way of putting into action the powers of the word. But, as we have already noted in passing, this vocal practice is also a mental one. It always implies and requires the full attention of the practitioner. This mental aspect is essential. Moreover, in *japa* as in all rites, the mere respect of formal rules, the mere mental and bodily conduct of the practitioner does not cover all the possibilities of this ritual action – and still less its meaning. This meaning, too, is a constitutive element of *japa* as it is of all word-action, for there is no word or speech, ritual or otherwise, without an intention to say – *vivakṣa* – without intentionality, without an orientation towards a goal one wishes to reach through what is being uttered, murmured or mentally formulated. This is the aspect of *japa *we will now address while looking at practices that are very largely interiorised, where *japa* is not really the repetition of a mantra, nor even a murmured meditation – ‘Murmelmeditation’ – but a spiritual and yogic practice.

*Japa*, of course, is always in some respect a religious action and may even be a spiritual exercise. Insofar, too, as *japa* can be a request or an invocation, it necessarily implies an attention focused on a deity: the creative form of meditation called *bhāvanā*, or the loving, devotional, participation in the deity of *bhakti*. This is seen in many texts. The religious aspect of *japa* is banal, and can be seen everyday in the life of Hindus. In such cases, *japa is* a prayer and may justly be so called. It is very likely that this devotional aspect increased in the course of centuries. Perhaps was it always there. Nowadays it is certainly the most visible aspect, its formal ritual aspect diminishing, without disappearing.80

What, on the other hand, has always been there, much before the first traces of *bhakti*, is yoga, with all the somato-psychic practices it implies, that have been especially developed in Tantric Hinduism and Buddhism. In the Tantric world, the utterance or recitation of mantras is nearly always associated with such practices. *Japa* becomes thus not a mere ritual repetition, but a mantrayoga practice where the utterance \(*uccāra*\) of the mantra is associated with the movement of *prāṇa*, that is to say with the bodily and cosmic energy, *kuṇḋalinī*, and becomes thus a corporal–mental, even spiritual, exercise, often very intense and complex. We shall look at such practices now. For clarity’s sake, I will distinguish \(somewhat artificially\) between *japas* of a more yogic type, where the techniques of mental concentration, or the visualisations play a greater role, and others, which one may call more spiritual or metaphysical, where mystical experience, fusion in the Absolute, the experience of *brahman* are in the foreground, with often a minimal technical aspect; *japas*, therefore, where sometimes metaphysical gnosis \(*jñāna*\) dominate, sometimes *bhakti*. Of these different sorts of *japas* we shall see only a very few typical instances, briefly described without entering into details.

One of the most complex forms of *japa* and furthest from the mere murmured repetition of a mantra is probably the one described in the third *paṭala, śl*. 171–192, of the YH. One can find it \(with the Sanskrit text\) described and explained in its French translation with Amr̥tānanda’s commentary.81 I need not therefore describe it here. Suffice it to say that it comprises four different practices: the *japa* of the three parts of the *śrīvidyā*, then of six ‘voids’ \(*śūnyaṣaṭkam*\), of five conditions or states of consciousness \(*avasthā*\), wakefulness \(*jāgrat*\), etc., then of seven ‘equalisations’ \(*viṣuvat*\).82 In this *japa*, one is not to repeat \(even mentally\) a mantra or a *bīja*, but to create and to follow mentally a complex ensemble of imagined inner-bodily representations through which the constituent elements of the *śrīvidyā* are perceived as abiding in certain points of the yogic body seen as present in the physical body, and to move therein upwards together with the ascent of *kunḋalinī*. This ascending visionary intra-corporal thrust of the mantra is at the same time an ascent towards ever higher planes of consciousness: the phonic plane of the utterance of the mantra being ever more subtle as it goes from the constituting phonemes of the *vidyā* to the also ever subtler phonic subdivisions of the utterance, the *kalās*, from *nāda* to *unmanā*, the ‘non-mental’ phonic energy identical with the pure divine Consciousness, the *Brahman*, with which the yogin is finally identified.

It is to be noted that in such a *japa*, the adept is to visualise mentally as present in his body not only the pattern of centres and *nāḋīs* of his yogic body, in all their details, but also, in the centres, he is to ‘see’ the phonemes of the *vidyā* and especially the *kalās* from *bindu* to *unmanā*, which crown each of the three *HRĪṂ*, visualising also the ascending movement that animates them. He also visualises the nine constituent sections of the *śrīcakra* which he is to perceive mentally as being tiered in his body, and which the *kuṇḋakinī*, raising together with the subtle vibration of the three *HRĪṂ*, will pierce, going from the outer square \(in the *mūlādhāra*\) to the central *bindu* where Śiva and Śakti unite \(in the *dvādaśānta cakra*, twelve fingerbreadths over his head\).

For the adept who follows with his mind’s eye the ascent of the subtle vibration of the *nāda* which is, as it were, the ‘fine pointe’ – the subtle summit – of the mantra, but which is also its essence and substrate, this practice is a *japa* in that it presupposes the continuous and pregnant presence, in the mind of the performer of this *nāda*, of this quintessence of the mantra which continuously vibrates inside his mind–body. He is to recite \(*japet*\) it, not in repeating and uttering it, but by fastening and focusing on it \(and of course on the whole imagined inner pattern of the yogic body, which is the stage where the whole inner play takes place\) an intense and unwavering attention. This really is an extreme form of mental practice, but still a *japa*. Indeed as we shall see,83 some Tantric texts say that an attention intensely focused inwardly on the *nāda* is the real and most eminent form of *japa*.

Such a *japa* is, in fact, a *bhāvanā*,84 an intense meditation which creates in the mind of the adept and superimposes on his body image the imaginary structure of the yogic body with the ascent of *kuṇḋalinī* which takes place in it, with the *kalās* of the mantra and/or the coalescence of these *kalās* and of the *śūnyas* and *viṣuvats*, which are also levels or aspects of the yogic body. The power of the *bhāvanā* both creates this mental representation and identifies the adept with it and with the *nāda*. Thus, following the *nāda* till it disappears in the silence of the ‘transmental’, the adept fuses also with the supreme level of the word, which is Śiva. All such mental practices in their highest aspect always bring the performer to transcend all forms of word and fuse into the silence the Absolute – we shall come back to this later.85

Instances of *japas* consisting in the upward movement of a mantra together with *kuṇḋalinī* are found in a number of Śaiva texts. Thus, in JRY 2.10, where the *japa* of the Siṃhavāhanakālasaṃkarṣiṇī mantra, preliminary to the *dīkṣā*, consists in having the mantra passing the sixteen *ādhāras*.86 There are similar practices in Tantric Buddhism. For instance, in the *japa* made ‘while dwelling on the shape of syllables’ as described by Mkas Grub Rje87 when the adept creates mentally in front of him the form of a deity and, while reciting the mantra, imagines that its syllables, seen as a garland of letters, are on a moon-shaped disk placed in the heart of the deity. With his inhaling breath, he then transfers the disk and the syllables into his own heart where he keeps, repeats and contemplates them whilst retaining his breath. Then, breathing out, he places the disk and the mantra in the heart of the deity. The process is to be repeated several times. We see thus that visualisations of divine entities felt as present in the body, and the association of the recitation with the movement of breath \(that is, with *prāṇāyāma*, therefore with the mastering of the cosmic energy of *prāṇa*\) are Buddhist as well as Hindu Tantric practices.

The link between breath \(*prāṇa*\) as both respiratory breath and the bodily aspect of cosmic energy is underlined in many Tantric works, especially Śaiva ones. Breathing and speech are, of course, associated by their very nature and, in India, as is well known, the subject has been abundantly tackled.88 *Japa* is shown in many cases as linked to *prāṇa* as the power circulating in the human body and linking it to the cosmos and to the godhead. Thus, when SvT 2.139–140 says: *japaḥ prāṇasamaḥ kuryāt, ‘japa* is to be done in harmony with breath’, Kṣemarāja explains in his commentary \(vol. 1\(2\), p. 78\) that this is ‘the breath moving in the centre’ \(*madhyavāhi prāṇaḥ*\), that is to say the *suṣumnā*, the *japa* being performed by conjoining one by one the elements of the mantra with the energy of breath \(*prāṇaśaktau*\), this going on together with a peaceful fusion of the consciousness of the adept into that energy of the mantra \(*mantraparāmarśa*\). Similarly, Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha, commenting Mr̥g *CP*. 7.70, describes *japa* as a ‘repetition directed by the energy of breath’ \(*prāṇaśaktyanusāreṇāvartanam*\).

In the seventh *āhnika* of the TĀ, which deals notably with the devouring of time \(*kālagrāsa*\), that is, its domination by the yogin, Abhinavagupta says that the rule of *japa* is that it is to be performed in harmony with breath \(*prāṇasāmya*\). Referring to two ancient tantras, the *Yogiśvarīmata* and the *Yoginīkaula*,89 Jayaratha, explains in his commentary that this only ensures success,90 and it is so because mantras are external manifestations of the energy of the supreme goddess Varṇakuṇḋalī, that is, of the energy of the phonemes constituting the mantra, as it goes up along the *suṣumnā* with the *uccāra*, being thus none other than *kuṇḋalinī*.91 This energy, awakened by the harmony of *japa* and *prāṇa*, rises up and, on the transmental plane of *unmanā*, unites, blazing, with Śiva. One finds here what we have already seen for the *japa* of YH: the same mental visions are active there, identifying word and energy, showing that the utterance of the mantra and the ascent of *kuṇḋalinī* are the same, leading the yogin to mystically fuse with the Supreme.

In Vaiṣṇava texts, we also see *japa* being used to fuse with the divine energy or with some aspects of the deity. Thus, in a passage of the *Sātvatasaṃhitā* \(6.204ff.\) where the yogin, meditating in his heart through the *japa* the four Vyūha, Aniruddha, etc. issuing from Viṣṇu, fuses them mentally into one another \(and at the same time fuses together the states of consciousness, waking, etc.\) and thus attains *samādhi* and unites with the *brahman* \(ibid., pp. 119ff.\).

This spiritual aspect of *japa* and its use to realise intuitively the supreme Reality is underlined in the passage quoted previously of Kṣemarāja’s commentary on SvT. In it he explains *japam ārabhet* by *bhūyo bhūyaḥ mantram. vimr̥ṣet*, ‘one becomes conscious repeatedly of the \[essential nature\] of the mantra’, and quotes *śl*. 145 of the VBh which describes *japa* as a *bhāvanā*, an identifying meditation of the Supreme. I shall come back later to this last aspect of *japa*. With regard to the link between *japa* and *prāṇa*, I would first like to mention here the very often prescribed practice of the *ajapājapa*, ‘the recitation of the not-recited’ \(if it may be translated thus\), and describe it briefly, for it is an interesting form of *japa*, specially in that it underlines one of its main aspects – that of the respiratory breath.

In this practice, in effect, the breath is what is actually ‘recited’ or rather ‘not recited’ since there is no word to be uttered. This does not mean that there is no mantra, for if there were none, there would be no *japa*. One considers in fact that, with the breath, the *haṃsa* \(*ha* when inhaling, *sa* when breathing out, or conversely, according to some texts, the *Dhyānabindu Up*. 61 for instance\) is being enunciated; there is therefore actually a mantric utterance.

*Haṃsa* is the swan,92 the symbol since Vedic times of the supreme Reality as well as of the transmigrating soul identical in essence with this Reality. Practising the *japa* of *haṃsa* is therefore uttering the Name of the Supreme and, due to the cosmic nature of the word, it is also identifying oneself with the world play of the Deity and thus tending towards a fusion with its divine Origin. *Ajapājapa* being in fact the movement of breath, it is, like it, uninterrupted: it is deemed to be repeated 21,000 times in twenty-four hours, this being traditionally the number of breath cycles during that time.93 Despite its physiological basis, *ajapājapa* is not devoid of the usual ritual strappings of all *japas*: it is in fact this very ritual, together with the will to perform and with the utterance of *ham* and of *sa*, that makes it a *japa*. Mere breathing is not a *japa* – except \(if one is to believe the ŚS 3.27 and Ksemaraja\) in the particular case of an advanced yogin fused with the deity, whose every act is a worship of, or a participation in, the Supreme \(see below, pp. 46–47\).

A number of texts, notably Śaiva ones, prescribe *ajapājapa*.94 Here is how it is described in the *Dakṣiṇamūrtisaṃhitā*, a Śākta work on the cult of goddesses:


I will tell you the *ajapājapa* the knowledge of which suffices for the adept to be identified with the supreme *brahman*. Who performs everyday the *pūjā* of the word *haṃsa* will be freed of illusion and will gain liberation. Having learnt it through the grace of a master, he will then recite it and, by this movement of in and out-breathing, he will be freed from all fetters. The two syllables of *haṃsa* are \[respectively\] in the in-breathing and in the out-breathing. This is why breath is called *haṃsa* \[the Swan\], o Goddess\! that moves in the body as the self 21,600 times in a day and night. This is how this supreme \[not-recited\], made of the bliss of the vibration of *prāṇa*, is to be recited every day. Birth is the beginning of the *japa*, death is its offering. The recitation is thus there in the mantrin, o Goddess, though there is nothing to be recited.


The DMS seems here to identify the natural movement of breath and *japa*. This, however, is not so. It prescribes in effect how \(*śl*. 8\) to evoke \(*saṃsmaret*\) the visualisation of phonemes which the adept is to see mentally with their different colours in each of the *cakras* \(*mūlādhāra*, etc.\) of his body. This *japa* is therefore a yogic practice. In addition, *nyāsas* are to be done aiming at perfecting the body \(*dehasya siddhaye*\); then, the mantrin is to meditate the Lord and to utter the *haṃsagāyatrī*.95 Thereafter, the DMS adds:


the mantrin will do a *prāṇāyāma* carefully and completely, as prescribed, with the *mūlamantra* \[the *hamsa*, that is\], o Goddess\! filling his body \[with air\] by the left nostril, keeping it during three times \[the time of aspiration\], and rejecting it by the right nostril, closing alternatively each nostril with his little finger and his ring finger, without ever using the index nor the middle finger. The two wings of this *hamsa*, o Goddess, are the twofold movement \[of breath\]. Agni and Soma are these two wings, the Tāra \[mantra *OṂ* \] is its head, the threefold *bindu* his crest and his eyes; in its mouth is the *nāda*. Śiva and Śakti are its two legs, Kāla and Agni its two sides. This supreme swan, omnipresent, dazzling like ten million suns, shines by itself. It is cosmic resorption, this *haṃsa*, which gives discrimination \(*viveka*\): whoever practises ceaselessly the *ajapājapa* will not know any new birth.

\(DMS 7.24–30\)


Concerning *ajapājapa*, we may quote also a stanza from another Śaiva text, the *Śivayogaratna* of Jayaprakāśa96 according to which among the elements which can stop the movement of the mind during *ajapājapa* is ‘the immobilisation of the breath due to the *bindu*, which is in the centre of the *ajapāmantra*’ \(*ajapāmantra-madhyasthabinduna kr̥takumbhaka*\). This *bindu* is the *ṃ* of the syllable *haṃ* of the *haṃsa*. It is the *japa*’s central point in the sense that it is the last phoneme of the *haṃ* \(of the in-breathing or out-breathing, that is\), after which, with *sa*, begins the other respiratory movement. The *bindu* is thus, as it were, in the interstitial time between these two moments of the respiration: at the junction of the breaths, thus metaphysically at their central point \(*madhye*\) in the interstitial void where breath stops imperceptibly and where the Absolute may be experienced. Such a notion can be found in other texts, notably those of the Kashmirian non-dualist Śaiva systems. Reaching this central point would thus be the ultimate highest goal of the utterance of the *haṃsa* in the *ajapājapa*. This is underlined by Kṣemarāja in his *Uddyota* on SvT 56–59, where he quotes VBh 155–156.97 But, in the present case, *haṃsa* is understood as the essence of the phonemes, as a symbol of the Absolute, as the sound ‘that nobody emits and to which there is no obstacle, the Swan which arises spontaneously, present in the breast of all living creatures’, to quote the well-known formula applied to the ‘unstruck’ \(*anāhata*\) sound which is the very essence of the word, the animating power of the mantras, and therefore a divine cosmic entity, not a mere respiratory breath, even if controlled by yoga. The case is therefore that of a mystical experience of the Word-absolute, very far from the usual ritual context of *japa*. But this is also one of the possible aspects of this ritual practice, as we shall see later.

Let us note too, concerning the ritual recitation of mantras, that *ajapājapa* is also mentioned in the works of \(or attributed to\) Gorakṣanātha, a practice still found nowadays among Nāthas and Gorakhnāthi yogins.98

In Vajrāyāna Buddhism, such practices are also to be found, linked with breath, not done with *haṃsa* but with the word *evam*, the first word of all the Sermons of the Buddha: ‘So I have heard’ \(*evaṃ mayā śrutam*\). These two syllables, sometimes taken as symbols of *prajñā* and *upāya*, are generally considered as associated with the ascending \(*prāṇa*\) and the descending \(*apāna*\) breaths which circulate in the *iḋa* and *piṅgala* \(or *lalana* and *rasaṇa*\) canals, the process being deemed to result, with the suspension of breath, in the junction and immobilisation of these two breaths in the *suṣumnā* \(or *avadhūti*\), and thus, in the realisation of the highest bliss, *mahāsukha*. Such a practice, though not an *ajapājapa*, is very near to it since it brings into play the same mental representations.99

With or without such yogic aspects, *ajapājapa* appears in other cases as being chiefly a spiritual and mystical practice aiming at the union of the practitioner \(or rather the devotee\) with the deity he/she worships. Of course, all *japas* aim to a certain extent at some fusion with a deity. This appears in the passage from the TRT quoted above, apropos of the Yoginī cult. But there are also more particular cases where *japa* is not a *japa* in the normal sense of the word since there is no mantra repetition. It even happens, as we shall see, that the very mental or spiritual state of the adept, without any mantric practice, is considered as being a *japa*.

The YH 3.6–7, about what it calls the supreme worship \(*parā pūjā*\), prescribes the adept to concentrate in his heart on the Supreme, turning away from differentiated murmuring connected with dualistic notions \(*vikalparūpasaṃjal-pavimukhaḥ*\). Amr̥tānanda explains in his commentary \(Dī, p. 195–196\) that this is not an ‘external’ *japa* \(*bāhyajapa*\) when one whispers \(actually or mentally\) the syllables of the mantra with all the particularities inherent to the linguistic activity of speech and therefore of discursive thought, but an ‘inner’ \(*āntaram*\) *japa*. This consists in fixing one’s attention on the *nāda*, the subtle phonic vibration \(*āntaraṃnādānusaṃdhānalakṣanaṃ japam*\) which is perceived in the heart, the mystical centre of the human creature. Amr̥tānanda then quotes two stanzas, the first of which describes this *nāda* as the aspect assumed by the deity on the inner plane of the ‘unstruck’ \(*anāhata*\) sound. The other stanza says ‘One must, mastering the movement of the senses, enunciate the inner *nāda*. This indeed is what is called *japa*: the external *japa* is not a \[real\] *japa*.’100 In this case, therefore, *japa* is not in anyway the repetition of a mantra, but the mystical realisation, in the ‘heart’, of the immaterial phonic vibration of *nāda*.101 So as to make his meaning clearer, Amr̥tānanda ends by quoting *sūtra* 145 of the VBh which can be translated approximately as follows: ‘This creative meditation which is meditated again and again on the supreme Reality, this, here, is a *japa*. In this way, what is recited is the spontaneous *nāda* consisting of a mantra.’102 For the VBh, what is really a *japa* \(*japaḥ so’tra*\), what is deemed to be ‘recited’ and which in this case is considered as being a mantra \(*mantrātmā*\), is the spontaneous subtle phonic \(*svayaṃ nādaḥ*\) aspect of the deity.

In his short commentary of this *śloka*, Śivopādhyāya quotes the SvT 4.399, *aham eva paro śivaḥ*, which would make this practice close to *ajapājapa. Aham*, however, in the Kashmirian Śaiva schools, is the absolute I, the supreme transcendent Śiva as holding in Himself the whole cosmos.103 As Ksemarāja says in a well-known formula: ‘What is called the condition of the absolute I is the resting of the Light’ *– prakāśasyātmaviśrāntir ahambhāvo hi kīrtitaḥ*. For the VBh, *japa* appears as consisting of repeated \(*bhuyo bhūhaḥ*\) plunges or immersions in this luminous phonic essence of the Self. According to Śivopadhyāya, these immersions could be related to the play of *haṃsa* understood as the subtle ‘breath’, not different from *nāda*, of the absolute, which the yogin can mystically feel within himself as an infinitely subtle resonance perceived in the heart.

The same interpretation of *japa* as a spiritual practice is also to be found in Kṣemarāja \(whose interpretation of the Pratyabhijñā has certainly influenced Amr̥tānanda\) and in Abhinavagupta. Commenting on *sūtra* 1.27 of ŚS, Kṣemarāja also quotes SvT 4. 399 as well as *sūtras* 145 and 155–156 of VBh. Abhinavagupta, in TĀ 1.89–90, has the same position, quoting the *Triśirobhairavatantra*104 which, describing the behaviour of the yogin who has attained fusion \(*aikātmya*\) with Śiva, says:


One whose spirit is free from all impurity, and who, stopping his memory, meditates the Supremely Meditable, present in all that moves or does not move, reaches also by means of *japa* the supreme Śiva named Bhairava. One says indeed that *japa* is the very nature of this \[God\] which is above the planes of being and non-being.105


For Abhinavagupta, thus, it is not merely meditation of Śiva, the ‘supremely Meditable’, that leads to fusion with him, but also the *japa*, if it is practised in complete purity of spirit, forgetting everything that has to do with ordinary life. This *japa*, he adds, is an intense and repeated synthetic awareness \(*bhūyo bhūyaḥ parāmarśanaṃ japaḥ*\)106 of the essential nature of Śiva, of the Self which is the supreme Word \(*tasya śivasya svarūpaṃ paravāksvabhāvaṃ ātmarūpam*\). In essence, this *japa* is nothing else than the direct intense total awareness of the consciousness that shines in the very centre of being and non-being, or, to render *madhya* otherwise, in the interstitial \[void\] between being and non-being \(*tanmadh-yasphuratsaṃvitparāmarśamātrasāraḥ*\). The direct intuitive apprehension of the absolute that underlies the manifested world in the interval between two moments of consciousness is, as one knows, an important notion of that school. The conception of *japa* as a way towards union with the deity is, however, not proper to Abhinavagupta’s Trika, or to the Pratyabhijñā. Thus Maheśvarānanda in the *Parimala* on his *Mahārthamañjarī*, a Krama work, writes that what one calls *japa* is nothing else than the intense awareness of the essence of the mantra given by the spiritual master \(*kevalam upapāditamantrasvarūpa-parāmarśo japa ityucyate*\). This notion is much earlier than these texts since it is found in such tantras as the *Triśirobhairava*, or in the VBh.

A cosmic and metaphysical dimension is given to *japa* in the *Paramārthasāra*, 78 and its commentary by Abhinavagupta: the *japa*, associated with the vibration of the *prāṇa*, is an inner vision by the yogin of the expansion of the cosmos, the constituent elements of which are seen by him as revolving in eternal succession like the beads of a rosary used by a devotee. An analogous conception is in the PTV, p. 75, commenting sūtra 35 of the PT.

A most mystic and metaphysical conception of *japa* is found in the nineth \(perhaps even eighth\) century ŚS of Vasugupta, a basic text of the non-dualistic śaivism of Kashmir. Describing the condition of the liberated in life who lives in constant union with Śiva since he is identified with Him. *Sūtra* 3.27 of the ŚS states: *kathā japaḥ*, ‘\[His\] conversation is a *japa*.’ The whole being of such a yogin, Kṣemarāja explains in his *Vimarśinī*, is nothing else than an intense identifying meditation of the supreme I \(*aham*\). Referring to a passage of the SvT \(4.399\) already mentioned \(p. 46\), Kṣemarāja quotes the *Kālīkrama*:107 ‘The consciousness that this God – who transcends all the gods and whose nature is the highest awakening – has of Himself is the supreme Śakti, totally omniscient.’ He adds: ‘whoever, therefore, remains in the awareness of the absolute unborn I, whose essence is the great Mantra, his conversation, etc. becomes a *japa –* a ceaseless repetition of the intuitive consciousness he has of the godhead who is his own self.’108

In this perspective, *japa* not only ceases completely to be a ritual repetition: it is not even the utterance of a mantra, insofar at least as a mantra is a particular formal ritual utterance. The texts we have seen speak of mantras in such a context – which permits them to say that it is a *japa* – merely because, in the metaphysical conception of the word, of *vāc*, developed in non-dualist śaivism, the four planes of the word – *parā, paśyantī, madhyamā* and *vaikharī* – are always present in the cosmos as in the human being. But also because, in this metaphysical perspective, the supreme word, insofar as it enunciates the cosmos, as it is the godhead ever present in the cosmos, is the absolute I, which is the great Mantra \(*paramahāmantra*\). This is the mantra that the liberated in life, identified with the supreme Śiva, necessarily enunciates as does the godhead. Whatever he says, being on the level of *paravāc*, is the great Mantra. This means that in practice his speech will always say the truth, will be completely efficacious and entirely liberating – not enslaving as the ordinary speech of human beings.

It is worth remarking that Kṣemarāja concludes his commentary on ŚS 3.27 by quoting *sūtras* 155b–156 of VBh on the *japa* of *haṃsa*109 which may appear as being somehow a transposition of ŚS 3.27 onto a more ordinary plane. In fact, these two conceptions are complementary ones in the sense that just as all that the liberated in this life says is a mantra and therefore a *japa*, all breathing, being identified with the godhead, is *haṃsa*, which is the affirmation of the oneness of the yogin’s self with the absolute – *so’ham* – or with the absolute I – *aham*. Such a yogin, therefore performs a *japa* even when he does not speak, which is all the more true since the *japa*, here, is a direct and repeated awareness of the divine, a fusion which, for this yogin, is always present.110

One finds the concept of *japa* of the ŚS in the fourth *āhnika* of the TĀ which deals with the ‘means of power’, *śāktopāya*, that is, the way to liberation by mystical fusion with the divine Energy. ‘Who is immersed in this uncreated Heart, Abhinavagupta says, whatever he does, breathes, or thinks, one considers that it is for him a *japa*.’111 Indeed, Jayaratha explains, in all mundane activity, such as talking and so forth, the spirit of the yogin never stops being immersed in the intense consciousness of the absolute uncreated I \(*akr̥takāhaṃparāmarśaviśrānto hi yogi*\), and therefore all this for him is *japa* \(*yat kiṃcid bāhyavyavahārayogaṃ vyāharet so’sya sarvo japaḥ*\); which means that for this yogin everything shines \(= appears\) as mantra: as what is by nature a return to the awareness of the godhead which is his own self \(*svātmadevatā*\). As Jayaratha notes, this can be related to Abhinavagupta’s conception of the efficacy of mantras \(*mantravīrya*\), which he considers to be the efficacy of the supreme Word. Jayaratha notes too that others, of different traditions, have also said that ‘conversation is *japa*’ \(*bāhyair api yo jalpaḥ sa japah. ity uktam*\).112

In a different, mystical perspective, Utpaladeva, the author of the ĪPK, says in his *Śivastrotrāvalī* 3.17: ‘Nothing is higher than Me, yet I practice *japa*. This is why, verily, *japa* \[is being done\] in unity \[with myself\] whichever rosary \[is being used\]. This is what You teach.’113 Here it is because the yogin conforms with a divine model, with what Śiva does \(and perhaps we may here refer to the notion of the absolute I – *aham* – that Śiva enounces and that is shown to the devotee as a model for identification with the divine plenitude\), that his *japa* is taken in its highest dimension: identity with the deity, a mystical union which the devotee who recites his rosary with the usual ritual would \(or try to\) experience.114 This stanza is especially interesting in that it gives *japa* a divine model. It is, however, not unique in doing so, for, in an emanative vision of the cosmos such as that of the Pratyabhijñā or of other systems where the whole universe appears through the descent of a divine archetype, or by the luminous appearance \(*ābhāsa*\) and reflection \(*pratibimba*\) of an archetype, everything that exists empirically must need have its original model, its archetype in the godhead.115



### The devotional japa: popular aspects of japa

We have given until now the pride of place to the yogic, metaphysical or mystical aspects of *japa* because one finds there some of its most interesting aspects. They show indeed the extension that Tantric yoga can give to this ritual action, all the philosophical developments that accompany it and, related to it, the interpretations, meanings and range that can be given to it within the metaphysics of the word developed mainly in the Śaiva/Ṣākta non-dualistic traditions of Kashmirian origin. But such cases, which are interesting because they are very subtle or imaginative, are, for this very reason, comparatively rare. Like many things Tantric, they were probably always more present in texts than in actual practice – this is merely because many practices – the most complex ones especially – were meant for a small group of initiates, not for a larger social group. In the majority of cases, *japa* has probably always been, and it continues to be, the ritual recitation of mantras that we have seen in the first part of this study, a practice whose spirit is quite different from the other one, without, however, there being a clear cut distinction: we have seen thus that the *Śivastotrāvalī*, a mystical work if there ever was one, mentions the use of the rosary. A ritual recitation, too, can lead the practitioner to a mystical experience.

*Japa*, indeed, the repeated invocation of a deity, when not used for a specific, often a magical end,116 is a prayer, invocation, call for supernatural help; it can, like any prayer, lead to contemplation. We must note that in these last cases the metaphysical perspective usually differs from that of the non-dualistic Kashmirian Śaiva systems, their context being usually a dualistic or semi-dualistic \(*viśiṣṭadvaita*\) one, that of Rāmānuja, for instance, and of other *śrīvaiṣṇava* masters, or that of the Pañcarātra. One can hardly wish to take refuge in a deity, ask for its help, without there existing at least a measure of difference between the devotee and the deity being worshipped.117 In fact, the *japa* practices we shall see now are mostly Vaiṣṇava ones. They may have developed especially from a time – the thirteenth century perhaps – when *bhakti*, often in its most emotional forms, permeated more and more Hinduism. They went on developing down to our days where they are part of the everyday religious life of Hindus. Such practices are not those of the \(so-called\) *mantraśāstra* \(especially when it is identified with *tantraśāstra*\), but they often appeared first in Tantric milieus, or milieus influenced by tantricism, and they have kept, even in their present forms, Tantric traits. This is why one may mention them as a last part of this study. More than before, I shall limit myself to a few instances.

Going back first to what we saw previously about the *japa* of *gāyatrī* during *sandhyā*, where I referred to Ś. Ch. Vidyārṇava’s *The Daily Practice of the Hindus*, I will quote here K.C. Pandey’s definition of *japa* as ‘the constant repetition of a word or sentence’, to which he adds that this repetition ‘produces a state of consciousness bordering upon ecstasy’ through which ‘one enters in the fourth *kośa* or sheath called *vijñānakośa* or sheath of Buddhi or intuition’. He then illustrates his point by quoting the case of Tennyson, the poet, who could enter in a manner of hypnotic trance by merely repeating for a long time his Christian name.118 One may indeed consider that *japa*, like all repeated actions, lulls the attention and creates a manner of altered state of consciousness where thought looses contact, as it were, with recitation and shifts to something else. But we must not go too far in this direction: my point here concerns only the repetition of the name.119

For indeed *japa*, as a devotional repetition, as a form of contemplative or repetitive prayer, appears often – especially from a certain period onward – as the repetition of the name of the deity: *nāmajapa* \(or its chanted repetition, *nāmasaṃkīrtana*\) practices which, with the *bhajans* of our days, are the most frequent expressions of Hindu devotion. In these cases, even more than in those we saw previously, the origins of the practice is very ancient: its conceptual basis is the ever-present Indian belief in the power of the word. This goes back to the Veda, where the name is considered as embodying, comprising the essence \(and the power\) of what is being named: to utter it is to act upon it, make it present, favourable.120 Hence all the invocations, so frequent in ancient texts; hence notably the *nāmastotras*, the praises made up of names and attributes of a deity that are recited as a litany in that deity’s honour, or the very long repetitions of a divine Name.

The most ancient *nāmastotra* is probably the *Śatarudriya* of the *Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā*, a hymn still being recited by Śiva’s devotees notably during the Mahāśivarātri night, a hymn that the *Mānavaśrautasūtra* names *rudrajapa*. ‘By means of which *japa* does one gain immortality?” the novices ask in the *Jābālopaniṣad* \(3\), ‘By that of the Śatarudriya,’ Yājñāvalkya answers.121 The MBh \(*Mokṣadharmaparvan*\) mentions lists of nouns – ‘hymns of thousand names’ \(*sahasranāmastotra/stava*\) recited in praise of Śiva, Viṣṇu or Durgā so as to worship them and make them favourable. It is mainly in the Purāṇas that such *stotras* are to be found – for instance, the *Devīmāhātmya* \(or *Durgāsaptaśatī*\). Those, however, are all series of *different* names or attributes of the same deity, whose mere recitation is therefore not strictly speaking a *japa*, but it becomes one if it is repeated, the repetition numerous times of the same name being a *nāmajapa*. This last – the repetition of the divine Name to devotional ends – seems to be found for the first time in the *Bhāgavatapurāṇa* \(6.2,7–12\), the great text of Vaiṣṇava *bhakti*, the *Āgastyasaṃhitā* \(7–71\) of the *Skanda Purāṇa* doing the same for the Śaivas.122 These two are not ancient evidences of the practice: did it exist earlier? We do not know. It is certain, however, that it developed from that time \(twelfth to thirteenth century\) onwards in Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava milieus among devotees of various forms of the goddess;123 more recent periods show cases where the *japa* of a deity over-steps the limits of its ‘sect’. Thus the Nāthas, who are Śaivas and who practice mainly the *ajapājapa*, perform also the *japa* of Rāma’s name.124 One can also hear nowadays, in South India, *bhajans* of Radha-Krishna organised by Smārta Brahmins, who are Vedānta non-dualists, disciples of the Śaṅkarācāryas.125

In fact, even though the name of any deity may, in principle, be repeated in *japa*, in actual practice the name of Rāma is the one mostly used in this way, Rāma \(or rather Rām\), the name of one of Viṣṇu’s *avatāras*, coming to be considered, especially in the northern part of India, as the name of God. For Kabir, for instance, and for the Sants, *rāmsumiran* \(*rāmasmaraṇa*\) is synonymous with *nāmsumiran*, this being a consequence of the popularity in India of the Ramāyāna epic. The solitary or group, murmured or chanted, repetition of Rāma’s name is thus recommended as one of the best devotional practices by the *Adhyātmarāmāyana* \(fourteenth to fifteenth century\), the sacred Book of the Rāmānandins, highly valued in Rāmaist sects whose influence in north India has been very important. Those, this text says, who chant everyday ‘Rāma Rāma’ do not fear death; they will be saved even if they kill a Brahmin; the gods themselves seek happiness by chanting Rāma’s name.126 It may even suffice simply to remember this Name to be saved. Tulsidas, in the *Ramcaritmanas*, the Hindi Rāmāyāna, goes even further: for him, Rama’s Name is infinite \(*ananta*\), without equal \(*apara*\), revealed in the *kali* Age, it is in reality ever present, eternal; revealing Rāma under his two aspects, with and without qualities \(*saguṇa* and *nirguṇa*\), it transcends both. But the Name is also near, for it only transmits to the devotee the essence of the god he worships. To repeat the Name is therefore one of the ways to salvation.127

Another very popular practice, developed from the sixteenth century, is that of the *nāmasaṃkīrtan*, the repetition of the name of Kr̥ṣṇa associated with either Rādhā’s or with Hari’s \(Viṣṇu’s\) name. Akin to *japa*, it nevertheless differs from it since being a collective and sung, sometimes danced, repetition; its sequence and atmosphere are quite alien to that of *japa* which, in essence, is a solitary whispered repetition. It is mentioned here because there are cases – that of the Haripāṭh, for instance – where *Harināmasaṃkīrtan* and *Harismaraṇa* \(with the *ajapājapa*\) meet in some respects. *Namasaṃkīrtan* is practiced mainly in Krishna religious groups and especially in the Bengali *gauḋīya* tradition which goes back to Caitanya \(1486–1532\), for whom *śravaṇa* and *kīrtana*, the remembering and the chanting of the divine Name, are the two primary elements of *bhakti*. For Caitanya, the mere \(even involuntary\) utterance of the name of Kr̥ṣṇa can bestow liberation.128 Of all possible ways of worshipping Kr̥ṣṇa, he used to say, the best is *nāmasaṃkīrtan*, a perfect worship which fosters divine love.129 It is a collective very emotional action, very far from the ritual practices and speculations we have seen previously. Such devotional behaviour is to be found with Surdas and most of the Sants, the saint-poets of the Indian Middle Age. The Sikhs, too, recommend and practise the ‘proximity of the saints’, the *satsang*, which is often a form of *saṃkīrtan*, of common devotional singing of the name or names of the Lord, Rāma usually.

An interesting form of *japa* – a popular but also refined one – is that of the *Haripāth*, the ‘Invocation of Hari’, of Jñāndev/Dñyandev, the saint-poet of Maharashtra \(end of thirteenth century\). A devoted Vaiṣṇava, he nevertheless had links, through his master Nivr̥ttināth \(or Nivr̥ttidev\), with the Tantric tradition of the Nāthas, theoretically founded by Gorakhnāth, where, as we have seen \(above, p. 44\) *ajapājapa* was practised.130 The Haripāth is a short text which is to be rhythmically chanted with intervals and followed by the singing of devotional hymns. It is therefore not a *japa* properly so called. But the *Haripāth* prescribes several times to repeat ceaselessly the Name of Hari: ‘Repeat the Name of Hari, and all fetters are destroyed.’ The very name Haripāth designates such an invocation, *pāth* being understood in the traditional sense of recitation or study of a sacred text and having therefore the meaning of *harināmakīrtana*. Haripāth and *harijapa* appear thus as synonymous.131 In another, analogous, case, that of Jñāneśvar’s *Jñāneśvarī*, the Name is not to be merely uttered, it must be interiorised, for the *japa* must not be a mere mechanical repetition; it must become an ‘inner audition’ \(*śravana – hariśravana*\) of Hari’s Name, that is, a devotional meditation which unites the devotee with the deity. On this subject, the *Jñāneśvarī* says: ‘All that my devotee does is none other than the worship \[of me\]; all that he thinks is my *japa*; all that he is, is but absorption in me’.132 Such expressions of the greatest devotion, of a ‘participation’ in the deity, remind one of the *Śivasūtras* \(3.27\) and of Kṣemarāja’s *Vimarśinī* which we have seen before. It is likely that Śaiva non-dualistic notions transmitted by the Nāthas have played a role here – the yoga tradition of the Nāthas \(and Tantric notions\) being taken over in a *bhakti* context.

A similar influence of the Nāthayogins might probably also explain the presence of the *ajapājapa* in Kabir, who mixes or confuses it with the remembrance of the divine Name \(*smaran, sumiran*\), and the fact that he mentions the *so’ham* as well as the two letters *Ra* and *Ma* of Rāma.133 Probably another larger and more ancient tradition plays a role, insofar as for Kabir \(as well as for other Sants of northern India\) only the ‘sound’ \(*śabda*\), the word received from the mouth of the Master, or revealed by the *satguru* to the pious disciple, can bring to the latter a divine revelation;134 the *satguru* being the Supreme Being ‘without characteristics’ \(*alakṣaṇa*\), ‘without colour’ \(*nirañjana*\). For them, the name of Rāma \(*rāma rāma – Rām Rām*\) is the basic mantra, the *mūlamantra* of the godhead, which holds within itself the supreme Reality, the two syllables of Rāma \(or the monosyllabic Rām\) being sometimes conceived as equal to *OṂ*, the symbol of the Absolute.135 The infinite power of a revealed word or of the name of a deity, the harnessing for reaching salvation of this power by the utterance and repetition, are ancient Indian notions pervading *mantraśāstra*: they evolve, take on different aspects in the course of time, but, perhaps underlying, they are always there, solidly rooted.136

As most of the practices mentioned developed after the eleventh century \(and especially since the fifteenth to sixteenth centuries\), it is possible to speculate whether their development was influenced by the presence of Islam in India. One may indeed consider that such interiorised devotions were more easily practised out of the temples \(which, in addition, were often destroyed by Muslim rulers\) than those involving visible ritual action. On the other hand, it has also sometimes been thought that the *nāmajapa*, where the name of the deity is often to be repeated, associated with the control of the respiratory breath, and often in a group, which is contrary to the traditional conception of *japa*, may be due to an Islamic influence. In effect, the *japa* of the Name, insofar as it is a remembrance \(*smarana, sumiran*\) of the deity, and follows the rhythm of the breath, it is very reminiscent of the *dhikr* \(a term that Henri Corbin used precisely to translate by ‘mémoration’ – remembrance – and which, like *sumiran*, is both remembering God and mentioning this remembrance\). In both cases, starting with a repeated utterance, the pronunciation tends to fade, leaving only a presence felt in the heart.137 But likeness or similarity does not prove influence, and if there was actually influence, it could well have been that of *japa* on *dhikr*,138 if only because the existence of *japa* is proved long before that of *dhikr*. Contacts between Hindu and Muslim mystique in India were numerous and important. Many circumstances, translations and a number of texts testify to the fact. It seems, in fact, that Hinduism has more frequently marked Islam than the other way round. One could easily quote in this respect the names of many ‘saints’, mystics, or poets of different sects. The case of the Baùls is well known.139 The Nāthas, too, whom we have mentioned previously, seem to have played \(especially in the case of *japa*\) an important role in this exchange of ideas and practices.140 On the subject of the devotional repetition of the name of God, instances from the Western world could also be quoted. But this is not our subject here.141

To come back to the Indian domain or to neighbouring fields, we can mention before ending some Buddhist practices akin to the *nāmajapa* such as those found in Mantrāyāna texts, especially in the ones concerning the cult of the Amitābha and Bhaiṣajyaguru Buddhas. Amitābha’s cult spread in China where the invocation of his name \(Amita\) was recommended by the Pure Land School as the surest means to gain salvation. Repeating ‘Homage to Amita Buddha’ sufficed to ensure a good rebirth, by the sole effect of this buddha’s grace, without any necessity of any personal effort. Like the Hindu *nāmajapa*, this prayer could be practised alone or in common, be mentally repeated, chanted or sung. The method became quickly popular. In Japan can also be found Amidism which prescribes the repetition of the *nembutsu* ‘*namo amida butsu*’, a copy of the Sanskrit corresponding formula. This doctrine and practice appeared in Japan in the seventh century. They were popularised in the twelfth century by Honen. ‘So as to gain birth in the Pure Land, nothing is as effective as the repetition of the Name of the Buddha’, he used to say. \(In that sect there is even a danced *nembutsu, adori nembutsu*, which is reminiscent of the Krishna *saṃkīrtan*.\)

We will conclude these few observations on those trivialised, popular forms of the Buddhist *japa*, by referring to what is probably its most well-known form, namely the repetition of *Oṃ mani padme huṃ*, a mantra in devotional homage to Avalokiteśvara, which one meets everywhere in Tibetan Himalayan Buddhism, the human repetition of mantras being taken over by writing or engraving: it suffices then to look at such formulas piled up so as to form ‘maṇi walls’, or those which, written on banners, scatter their beneficial messages in space, or else those, inscribed by thousands on strips of some material, who are multiplied by the whirling of the prayer-wheels. All this is very far from the metaphysical speculations on the power of the word, or from the difficult practice of *bhāvanā*, which we have seen here. But in all these cases, popular or erudite, one remains in the domain of the belief in the power of the word and in the efficacy of ritual, both to be found in India from the most ancient times but also ever present elsewhere, since humans believe everywhere in this efficacy. This belief underlies all the mental constructions and actions we have seen in this chapter, even those where devotion dominates. This is why *japa* is not strictly speaking a prayer:142 it is also and mainly something else; this is why one cannot translate the term, why, too, *japa* is such a diverse, rich and interesting practice.



## 4 Nyāsa

The ritual placing of mantras*1*





In practice, mantras are nearly always used in the context of ritual, indispensable, as we have seen, to their extraction or selection, to their transmission, or to their efficacy in action. We intend here to inquire into one ritual practice, that of *nyāsa*.

The word *nyāsa* is formed from the prefix *ni* \(‘below’, ‘under’\) and the verbal root *AS* \(‘to throw’, ‘to project’\) – from which the verb *NYAS, nyāsati*, to throw, to project, is derived along with the masculine substantive *nyāsa*, translated in Monier-Williams *Sanskrit–English Dictionary* as ‘putting down or in, placing, fixing, inserting, applying … drawing, painting, writing down … depositing, intrusting, delivering … mental appropriation or assignment of various parts of the body to tutelary deities’ – a diversity of definitions one also finds in the St Petersburg Dictionary: ‘niedersetzen, hinsetzen, aufsetzen … das Auftragen mysticher Zeichen auf verschiedene Teile des Körpers’. P.V. Kane \(*History of Dharmaśāstra*, vol. V.2, p. 1120\) writes: ‘*nyāsa* … means mentally invoking a god or gods, mantras and holy texts to come to occupy certain parts of the body in order to render the body a pure and fit receptacle for worship and meditation’. He adds a little further on: ‘The *Kulārṇava* explains it as follows: “*nyāsa* is so called because therein riches that are acquired in a righteous way are deposited or placed with persons, whereby all-round protection is got”’ \(*nyayoparjitavittanām aṅgeṣu viniveśanāt/sarvarakṣakarād devi nyāsa ityabhidhīyate*\) \(KT 18.56, p. 352\).

We can also cite Bhāskararāya who, in his commentary on the *Lalitasahasranāma* \(*śl*. 4\) defines *nyāsa* as the placing of divinities on different parts of the body, this placing being made through mental concentration \(*bhāvanā*\): *nyāso nāma tattaddevatānāṃ tattadavayaveṣvavasthāpanam, avasthitvena bhāvaneti yāvat*.2

We can see emerging in these definitions – apart from the ordinary, banal sense of the word ‘to place’, ‘to deposit’ – different meanings or nuances which appear in the *mantraśāstra* and which we shall meet here later, meanings that are all around the notion of placing or depositing on the body or on an object a mantra or some other sign that brings the presence of a deity, the transmission of a subtle or ritual entity, of an energy or spiritual power. This transference is accomplished by placing – generally but not necessarily – the fingers, hand, or hands on the part of the body, or on the object or substance, where the entity must penetrate and by which placing it is transformed. The operation is thus both mental and corporeal.

*Nyāsa* is usually considered to be a rite typical of Tantric Hinduism and Buddhism, since it is used for the manipulations and assimilations into the body of the sacred that are characteristically tantric. We find indeed a considerable variety of such practices in all ritual texts, in the tantras, āgamas and so on, as in the treatises on yoga and spiritual practices \(see the *Tantrāloka* \(TĀ\) by Abhinavagupta for example\). The word itself in this technical sense, however, hardly ever occurs before the āgamic and purānic works \(which are already ‘tantricised’\), nor does it occur in ancient Buddhist texts. Some placings are prescribed in relatively ancient ritual works whose spirit is not Tantric. One thinks here of the Gṛhyasūtras and above all their *pariśiṣṭa* \(thus, for example, the *Baudhayānagṛhyasūtra* II, 18 or IV, 7 which does not use the word *nyāsa* but *sam-spṛś*\), or a number of *stotras*. Moreover, as is the case for other practices and words, we can hardly base an argument about their origins on the silence of the texts: these practices could well have existed before being textually attested. We are therefore permitted to think that these are elements from very ancient times that certainly existed in one form or another in a non-Tantric context well before the tantras and āgamas.3

The practice of transmitting a spiritual or magical force by touching not only exists in Hinduism and Buddhism \(Tantric or not\) but also in other Indian religions. It is almost universal.4 We find a number of examples in the Judeo-Christian tradition where we have the transference of the sins of Israel to a scapegoat \(Lv., XVI, 21\), the transmitting of the spirit of wisdom \(Deut., XXXIV, 18\), or the bestowing of the holy spirit on the apostles through the laying on of hands \(Acts, VIII, 18–19\), etc. We find analogous acts in other traditions along with speculation on magical power or the symbolism of the hands and the symbolic value of gesture.5 *Nyāsa* is one case among others, however with the particular association of belief in the power of gesture and in the efficacy of speech such as developed in India.6

The *nyāsa*, then, can appear as a gesture in support of speech, as a gestural and corporeal participation in speech. The act of placing carries and posits on a point of the body – or on an object, although this is less frequent and the object is usually an image of the corporeal aspect of a deity – a mantra which will impregnate this body or object with its energy thereby transforming or divinising it.

We have already noted in this regard, and we will return to this later, first that the hand which performs the *nyāsa* is itself often the object of a preliminary *nyāsa* \(*karanyāsa*\) which purifies it and charges it with a force that it can transmit.7 This hand must make a particular gesture – a *mudrā* – when it imposes a mantra, ‘sealing’ it thus as it were on the proper place. We could here raise the question of the origin of the *mudrās* which, like mantra and *nyāsa*, are both typical of Tantric ritual and probably as old as the religions of India. But there is also the problem of the deep connection between mantra and *mudrā*, between gesture and speech.8 Finally, if one is interested in the archaeology of signs, there is the problem of the first origins of the link and that of the precedence of one element over the other: in the beginning was there word or action …? Many questions we cannot tackle here; we simply note that they exist.

But the problem of *nyāsa* – we repeat – must not be limited to ritual touching, which is an important aspect, certainly, but not the only one. In so far as *nyāsa* consists in placing divine entities on \(or in\) the body, in divinising or cosmising it, and, by transforming it, in giving it a role in the cosmic and/or9 divine dimension of such acts as the *pūjā*, yoga or Tantric meditation, we find ourselves in the complex Indian problematic of the relationship or connections of body– universe–divinities–God. We know that this universal, total vision of the whole mass of cosmic manifestation, is very ancient. Tantrism insofar as it underlines and organises – or re-organises – these correspondences, refers back to a vedic conception: ‘All the gods reside in the human body as the cows in a cowshed’ says the *Atharvaveda* \(AV XI, 8, 32\). We can add that in this ancient and always persistent Indian conception, if the body reproduces the structure of the cosmos, the cosmos in turn is modelled on the human body,10 both being governed by a principle, at the human \(*ātman*\) or cosmic \(*puruṣa*\) level, which is, in essence, identified with the Brahman to which one is eventually to achieve identification through asceticism without leaping over the intermediate stages, notably that of the gods. Hence the usefulness of *nyāsa*11 as a means to achieve this identification.

The *nyāsa*, as all the practices of Tantric yoga focused on the body, underlines its importance in achieving liberation. In a system of thought in which there is no total distinction between the human condition and other states of existence \(animal, notably, but also divine\), it is often underlined that only in the human body can liberation be attained: this is one more justification of corporeal ritual practices – practices which must be understood in the context of another basic Indian conception of humankind: the absence, namely, of a division between the bodily and the mental, or between gross \(*sthūla*\) and subtle \(*sūkṣma*\); the difference between them being one of level rather than one of nature. Man is thus not separated from the cosmos, which itself emanates from a divinity that operates in the fashion of a yogin, the whole being founded on an absolute without form, at the same time transcendent and immanent. Such a man, too, from the highest level of his individual consciousness to his physical body, is constituted by more or less subtle ‘bodies’, namely causal, gross, subtle bodies \(*kārana, sūkṣma* and *sthūla śarīra*\) whose structures correspond. Thus, if *nyāsa* is made by human hands on the body’s surface, the effect of this action which is mainly mental or spiritual bears as much, or even more, on the subtle body than on the gross body. This appears clearly in the case of placings \(*antarmātṛkanyāsa*, for example\) done on the *cakra*s, which do not have a physical reality but are ‘localisations’ in the gross body of elements of the \(so-called\) ‘subtle body’,12 as we shall see later.

We shall also see *nyāsas* associated with Tantric yoga, which, while using physical methods, rests theoretically as in its practical application on the ‘mystical physiology’ of the *cakra*s and *nāḋis* where circulate the various currents of *prāṇa*, the ‘breaths’, whose nature is both bodily and subtle, and also cosmic insofar as *prāṇa* is a form of divine energy \(*śakti*\).13 We could say that we are here in a psychosomatic domain, were it not that this term implies a dichotomy between *psyche* and *soma* which India ignores and always adds a cosmic dimension.

But if the *nyāsa* is in practice, and most often in the *mantraśāstra*, the placing of phonic elements on the body, we must not lose sight of the fact that in ritual, where their usage is so frequent, *nyāsas* serve also to place divinities or entities on the instruments of worship or on various points of the ritual area. That is, they also appear as a way of placing materially \(if one can say this in spite of the fact that the mental and linguistic aspect is present\) something, without reference to the body of the officiant.

Finally, an essential element of *nyāsa* is the form of speech which it serves to place on a body or an object which it penetrates and impregnates by its energy. One must therefore recall the importance of speech \(*vāc*\) in Tantra and how it is conceived. Speech, which is the divine energy itself or the energy aspect of the deity which is supreme Being and supreme Consciousness, emits the universe, animates it and reabsorbs it. It is difficult to be precise about the essential and ultimate nature of this speech – is it sound or consciousness? Explanations vary according to the different schools. Perhaps it is possible to say – if one may adopt a non-dualist Śaiva perspective – that there is on the highest level an ultimate Reality, pure consciousness, where speech is in seed, being co-essential with it and being its aspect as energy. This speech, which is at the same time consciousness and energy, evolves becoming more explicitly sound, then discourse, manifesting thus the universe, bringing it into existence by saying or naming it. Speech is ‘that which says or expresses’ \(*vācaka*\) all things, which are ‘that which is to be said, or expressed’ \(*vācya*\). Such is the correspondence between mantras, or phonic seeds \(*bīja*\) and the divinities which they represent \(or rather of which they are the subtle and essential form\).14 In *nyāsa*, it is this phonic or consciousness element – we can say this spiritual force – having a sonorous form for support \(itself the essential form of the deity\), that is transported and deposited by the hand with the ritual gesture of placing \(or through the mental concentration which accompanies, or replaces, this gesture\).

If there is a gesture in *nyāsa*, how is one to understand the link between this purely physical act and the transfer of spiritual energy? Of course, seen objectively, this is merely one form among others of the manipulations of symbols or of organs which many cultures use to transform the body \(or to modify its image\), or to act upon objects, practices which are cases of symbolic effectiveness. But if this is for us a clear and simple explanation of the functioning of *nyāsa*, it was felt as an important problem within Indian thought for the practitioners of *nyāsa*, in terms of their problematic: there was for them an effective – one could say material – transfer of the phonic and spiritual force of the mantra and a ‘sealing’ of it through a gesture on the chosen place; not simply an accompanying gesture and still less a symbolic operation. The question, in fact, is hardly discussed, the practitioners not being accustomed to putting in doubt the received tradition. Some of them, however, did ask themselves what is really the nature of *nyāsa*: is it a mental or spiritual operation, or a material one? Or rather, what is the part of each of these two elements? This is done, for instance, at the beginning of chapter 4 of the *Pārameśvarasaṃhitā*, entitled ‘Rules concerning the placing of mantras’ \(*mantranyāsavidhi*\)15 where we read:


The mantrin, his body purified, is to perform the placing of mantras which identifies him with the god of gods \(*devadevasamo bhavet*\) and makes him qualified to accomplish all ritual action such as *pūjā* and so on, \[placing\] thanks to which he will appear \[in or for himsef\] all perfections or supernatul powers \(*siddhi*\). Having accomplished this, he will be without fear among wicked people and will be able to triumph over all dangers. Although what is called *nyāsa* must be considered a mental operation, it does not create a \[new\] situation immediately and outside of the \[material\] action \[which constitutes it\].16


This last sentence is very explicit. The intellectual, ‘mental’ \(*mānasa*\) component of *nyāsa* is what the tradition considers essential. It is the concentration of the practitioner’s spirit that is effective: it is the concentration of his mind on what he is doing, that is, his one-pointed mental concentration on the phonic and spiritual assemblage comprising the mantra \(or the *bīja*\) that he places, or the mental representation, the visualisation \(*dhyāna* or *bhāvanā*\) of the entity to be imposed, or the inner experience or feeling in the self of the transformation effected by the *nyāsa*.17 Since the placing acts on the plane of the so-called ‘subtle body’,18 or that of consciousness, and due to the element of speech \(the imposed mantra\) whose nature is divine energy, there is a natural pre-eminence of the mental or spiritual element. Parallel to this, there are actions \(*kriyā*\) described in the manuals, that is, the gestures of the placing of which there can be many \(for example, if one must impose all the *mātṛkā*\), gestures which are equally indispensable as nothing is effective without their being performed.19 But these actions are subordinated to the most important element which is spiritual or mental, and without which they would remain without effect: what is mental is always superior, in India, to that which is material or perceptible to the senses. This, however, without losing sight of the fact that there is no difference in nature between the bodily and the mental, but rather a difference of level. Without forgetting too that the *nyāsa* is generally carried out by the adept after a ritual or spiritual exercises which purify his body20 or which purify and divinise the hand which performs the *nyāsa* so as to render it capable of serving this spiritual manipulation.21

This nature of *nyāsa*, without being clearly explicated, is clearly implicit in many texts. All, for example, which prescribe before the *nyāsa* to concentrate on the divine or otherwise entity to be placed, or which say that one must first reabsorb and assimilate the mantras in oneself \(that is to say, what they symbolise\) before imposing them. Thus in the ŚT \(chapter 5, śl. 118–120, in relation to the *varṇamāyī dīkṣā*\), the master first identifies with the divinity, uniting himself with the supreme self, and then imposes the phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet on his disciple, impregnating him with their spiritual force and identifying him with the divinity: he transmits through *nyāsa* the condition which he had previously brought about in himself.22 In all cases, too, where what is imposed is not a *mantra* or *bījā* but a figure \(the *śrīcakra* for example – thus in YH, chapter 3\), or when a mantra is made of a group of unpronounceable letters such as the *navātmamantra RHRKSMLVYUM* \(TĀ 15, 239f. see also here, p. 60\), the essentially mental or spiritual character of the operation of *nyāsa* is evident.

There exists, finally, complex *nyāsas* which are more tantric meditations than placing properly so called, where the adept must first visualise \(and feel\) that all or part of his body is transformed by the imposed mantras and becomes identified with energies, cosmic divisions, etc. There is also the case where the *nyāsa* of various energies is done in the ‘breath’ \(*prāṇa*\) of a yogi whose body has first been divinised by other *nyāsas*,23 etc. In cases of this sort we can ask whether we are still in *nyāsa*, but this would be to forget that *nyāsa* always has a mental or spiritual aspect which is often \(notably in more complex cases\) an operation almost uniquely intellectual. This explains why the texts prescribing the placings, in place of *nyaset* or *vinyaset*, use the verbal forms *smaret, cintayet, dhyayet, bhāvayet* or *kalpayet*.24

Let us finally note that alongside such terms as underline the mental aspect of *nyāsa*, we also encounter in ritual texts, so as to underline the act of placing, other words for *nyāsa*. Thus the verb *KṢIP* \(to project, to place, to pour\) can serve to indicate the placing of certain entities on the body or on an object \(for example, TĀ, 16, 231, for the imposition on previously imposed *tattvas*; or TĀ 17, 2–3, the projection of the three *malas* on the body of the disciple after the placing on him of the *adhvans*\): in effect these are *nyāsas*. The Indian lexicographers often gloss *nyāsa* with *kṣepa* or *nikṣepa*: thus Kṣirasvāmin in *Amarakośa* II, 9, 81, *nyasyatenikṣepyate nyāsaḥ*. One also finds *niveśa* and *viniveśa, viniyoga, samarpaṇa* \(or *YUJ: yojayet*, or *ni-DHĀ*: *nidhāpayet* etc.\). All these terms have near meanings: the sense of to deposit, to place, to install, to apply, to put, or to consign to a place, or else, to join, to conjoin – the words differ but refer to the same thing.

There are also texts using the verb *LIKH*, to write, when prescribing or describing *nyāsa*. This is very natural when it refers to placing *mantras* or *bījas* on a diagram: one places and traces them there according to precise rules.25 Or, in certain rites where one must draw a *yantra* and *bījas* on a liquid while reciting the *bījas* in order to consecrate the liquid, thus for the preparation of the *arghya* for the *pūjā*. But there are cases where the texts are more ambiguous. For example, in chapter 293 \(*mantra-paribhāṣa*\) of the AgPur \(*śl*. 39–47\), the ‘Lords of the letters’ \(*lipīśvara*\) and the energies of Rudra \(represented by phonemes\) must be written then imposed \(*likhyā … vinyaset*\), without the text indicating how or where the phonemes are to be written before being imposed. We do not have, it is true, an entirely reliable text of this purāṇa: the passage in question is perhaps corrupt or incomplete: the uncertainty remains.26

To gain a complete sense of what *nyāsas* are, their nature and role, we must examine several types and different usages \(their range and diverse effects\). In effect, as in nearly all Tantric ritual, Hindu or Buddhist, the *nyāsas* are used in a wide variety of circumstances and conditions, from the highest spiritual practice to the most vulgar magic \(including an important zone where it is difficult to know if one is in the religious or the magical, the two domains being difficult to separate, especially in India: ‘There is no religion without magic and no magic that does not contain a grain of religion’\).

As the more complex *nyāsas* are those which best show the sense and scope of this practice, we will first consider this type of procedure. We will then examine more rapidly diverse sorts of simpler *nyāsas* which we find in ritual worship \(*pūjā*\), in spiritual practices or magic, as well as in the ritual acts of daily life. Not that the sense of these diverse types of *nyāsa* differs: it is always the same, the impregnation of the body or of an object touched by a divine or cosmic entity or a spiritual force. But this ‘metaphysical’ dimension is more or less noticeable and in particular more or less explained in the prescriptive texts: it is only for this reason that I distinguish them.

Let us now look at the texts rich in ritual developments and in religious and cosmic implications. I will resort mainly to two works which are easy to have access to, both of them Śaivite: the one Kashmirian, Abhinavagupta’s TĀ, the other also connected to Kashmir and commented upon in the spirit of the Pratyabhijñâ by Amṛtānanda, the *Yoginīhṛdaya* \(YH\).27 For the TĀ we will look at passages from chapters 15 and 16, the former dealing with the so-called regular initiation \(*samayadīkṣ ā*\), the latter with the *putradīkṣā*, the initiation of a ‘spiritual son’.28 It may be useful to recall in this connection that, in the TĀ, initiation is not limited to the transmission of a mantra by a master to his disciple, a type of rite of passage giving access to a particular form of spiritual life, but is a procedure enabling the initiated disciple to realise, from the particular point where he finds himself \(hence the diversity of *dīkṣās*29\), his identity with Śiva. These rites being all the more complex as the disciple has a longer road to travel and more elements to transform and purify. Moreover, the goal aimed at being usually liberation in life \(*jīvanmukti*\), being in all cases the liberation of an incarnate being, the body \(or rather, the bodies, gross and subtle\) of the initiand, as well as his thought must be transformed and divinized. Hence the important role, in this process of that fundamental means of corporeal transformation, and of interiorised action, that is *nyāsa*.

The ritual of the *samayadīkṣā* as described in chapter 15 of the TĀ is particularly long and complex. *Nyāsas* are used there in nearly all the rites and there are moments when they are the essential part of the rite. To begin with, we find a general placing \(*sāmānya nyāsa*\) of the fifty phonemes of the *mātṛkā* and of the *mālinī*,30 after which the disciple to be initiated purifies his body and his ‘breath’ \(*prāṇa*\) \(that is, destroys in himself all that binds him to empirical life and duality\) through meditating on the flaming image of the *astramantra PHA:Ṭ*31 \(*śl*. 232–36\). He thus finds himself in the pure, divine Self \(*tiṣṭhecchuddhātmani*\), immobile and without waves, but where there nevertheless appears as a primordial wave the image \(*mūrti*\) of Śiva formed by the *mūrtimantra OṂ HAṂ*.32 It is in this state, the adept being already very purified and detached from empirical life, that the ‘special placings’ \(*viśeṣa nyāsa*\) that interest us here will be performed.

These comprise, first, a ‘great sixfold *nyāsa*’33 of the ‘god Navātman’,34 that is to say of the *navātmamantra* formed from nine letters *RHRKṢMLVYUṂ*. These are imposed on nine points of the body; followed by *nyāsa* on fifty points of the body of the *mātṛkā*; then of the *śiva*-, *vidyā*- and *ātma-tattvas* \(which cover the whole manifestation\) on the tuft, the heart, and the feet; then of the eight gods or mantras Aghora etc. on the head, face, neck, heart, navel, generative organs, thighs and feet; of the mantra god Bhairavasadbhāva, with his ‘limbs’ \(*aṇga*\) on the usual places for *nyāsa* of the *aṅgamantras* \(heart, head, tuft of hair, chest, eyes – sometimes also the ‘weapon’\); and finally, on the same places, of the mantra god Ratikśekhara, *RYLVUṂ*, which must be specially worshipped at this moment in the rite.

This first *mahānyāsa* is that of the various aspects of Śiva. It is followed by a second series of six placings: of aspects of the Energy \(*śāktaṃ nyāsam śl*. 248\) which must be made ‘on the preceding ones’, that is, on the same places. This is important: it is necessary to exactly superimpose the two series of *nyāsas* in order to make the two categories \(male and female\) of cosmic or divine entities coincide and so to unite Śiva and Śakti \(and thus have the divinity in its totality\) in the body of the adept. One therefore imposes on the *navātmamantra* the energy Parāparā with her ‘limbs’ and ‘faces’ \(*sāṅgavaktra*\); on the *mātṛkā*, the *mālinī*,35 on the three *tattvas* of Śiva etc., the three aspects of divine energy \(or, more exactly, the three goddesses\) Parā, Parāparā and Aparā; on Aghora etc., the eight energies Aghorī etc.; on Bhairavasadbhāva and his *aṅga*, the five Vidyāṅga; finally one must place on the same spots the Energy as Mātṛsadbhāva, Mistress of Yoga, in her plenitude, supreme and unwavering, destroyer of time, the initiating master having at the same time \(as for Ratiśekhara\) to worship her specially, mentally evoking her ‘limbs’ and ‘faces’ and her retinue of twelve energies. For this is, in fact, the energy at her most high and pure level, the supreme Consciousness, present without any division in all other deities or entities previously imposed. It is this supreme Śakti united with Śiva that the double *mahânyāsa* infuses in the body and spirit of the disciple.

Abhinavagupta \(*śl* 259–61\) makes clear the scope of this operation in putting in parallel the six parts of the double *nyāsa* and the five modalities of consciousness \(from *jāgrat* to *turyātīta*\) to which he adds *anuttara*, the first principle, ‘without second’, each of these six states being considered as being formed by itself along with the five others. This makes 6 × 6, that is 36: the number of *tattvas* from Śiva to earth. The *nyāsa* therefore has the effect of imposing on the body of the adept all the modalities of consciousness \(from the ordinary waking state to supreme consciousness\) along with the group of thirty six principles that constitute the cosmos. He thus is identified with the totality of consciousness and the pure, cosmic emanation paradigmatically present in Śiva. The adept is thus identified with the Supreme Śiva united with Śakti, pure,36 total Consciousness, dazzling, where appears in all its diversity; but archetypally and without duality, the totality of the cosmic manifestation \(*śl*. 262–68\).

It is interesting to note that at this point Abhinavagupta thought it useful to approach the problematic of *nyāsa*. He notes in effect \(*śl*. 268–269\) that it is paradoxical that an empirical method such as the placings can produce a result of a transcendent order: the transformation of a man into a god. But this is, he says, because *nyāsas* are operations of an interior, spiritual order: that which one thinks, for good or bad, that one becomes. Whoever therefore thinks intensely \(*bhāvayati*\) ‘I am Śiva and nothing other’ becomes Him \(*śl*. 269–270\). ‘He creates for himself there an unwavering certainty, an awareness in the depth of the heart, associated with a thought without duality which, itself, generates a flood of thoughts bound to duality \[but all\] orientated toward the identity \[of the empirical subject\] with Śiva’.37 One thus comes to destroy all belief of another \(mundane\) kind and to have only the unshakeable conviction that our nature is pure, eternal and divine. The spiritual character of the activity of *nyāsa* cannot be better underlined.


Having by this sacrifice thus transformed his body, full of bliss, entirely away from the world, the adept should meditate on the body as identical with Śiva. Any connection with the world once destroyed and the limited condition being dissolved, what remains in his body other than the essence of the bliss of Śiva? Worshipping his body day and night and carrying in himself the thirty six *tattvas*, the adept is identified with Śiva. Perfectly content he lives in peace in this cosmic body.

\(*śl*. 238–236\)


Thus Abhinavagupta sums up the condition of the person who has received the double *mahānyāsa*. What else, indeed, could he want?

This is not, however, the end of the rite of initiation, but only a necessary condition for its complete accomplishment. The process therefore continues, first, with a new group of *nyāsas* which is also worth summarising.38 There again the initiand is to identify himself with Śiva. One could believe that this condition has already been attained through the previous *nyāsa*. But it is completed here through an ‘interiorisation’ by the adept of a group of aspects of the divinity or, more precisely, of an ascending movement of energy which he will integrate with his ‘breath’ \(*prāṇa*\). He imposes, in effect, on his ‘breath’ a series of entities representing the rise of energy from its lower base to the supreme level, a series visualised as a trident extending from the point of departure of the breath in the area of the navel, to a point twelve fingers above the head. This ‘breath’, conceived as present in the physical body, is an element of the yogic structure of centres and veins imagined as present \(‘intraposed’ to use T. Goudriaan’s term\) in the physical body. The *nyāsa* thus, even if accompanied by hand gestures which impose the entities, is essentially internal, mentally visualised. It completes the preparation of the adept to the mental and material acts of worship that are to follow by making his ‘breath’ and his consciousness – and not only his body – the seat \(*āsana*\) of the deity.39

He first places the Power that supports \(*ādhāraśakti*\) four fingers below the navel, then on top of that the four elements: earth, water, fire and air together with the fifth one, ether, the whole occupying four fingers and being imagined as forming the swelling \(*āmalaka*\) near the base of the trident. The latter, called *ananta*, rises above the swelling through twenty-four finger-spaces from his navel to the uvula \(the *cakra* of the palate\), being made up of the twenty-four *tattvas* from *tanmātra* to *kalā*. Then, on the knot formed by the *māyā tattva*, one finds the eight qualities of consciousness \(*dharma*, etc.\) placed on a square *maṇḋala* in the four directions of space and their intermediaries. Just above this knot \(between the uvula and the *brahmarandhra*\), the initiand is to meditate on \(*dhyāyet* – not *nyaset*\) the *śuddhavidyā tattva* in the form of a lotus with eight petals: on these and in the calyx one places and worships the nine energies Vāma, and so forth, from right to left \(*pradakṣina*\), then the nine energies Vibhvī, etc. in the reverse order. After this the adept is to evoke \(*smaret*\) the sun, moon and fire with the gods Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Hara placed respectively on the petals, the stamen and the calyx of the lotus. Above these he places Īśvara, then above him \(at the level of the top of his skull\) Sadāśiva, the *mahāpreta*, lying as a blazing corpse, emaciated but filled by the laugh of destruction.40 He should then evoke \(*smaret*\) three shafts of light which, rising up from the navel of Sadāśiva, go up from the *brahmarandhra* – these are the three energies *śakti, vyāpinī* and *samanā –* forming the trident \(*trisūla*\), they spread out and up to the plane of the *dvādaśānta*, twelve finger-spaces above the head, reaching the level of *unmanā*.41 where the three supreme goddesses of the Trika are seated each on a Bhairava lying on, a white lotus. The initiation ritual goes on, a cult being then to be performed on the lotuses to this supreme plane of the deity.42

We have here, then, a *nyāsa* where cosmic and divine entities are imposed \(placed, seen, and felt\) and the image to be visualised of a trident. This implies a double identification with the one and with the others and implies that the visualisations and meditation occupy the main place, with physical touching, insofar as there is any, having only a secondary role. This passage well illustrates the role that *nyāsa* has in a spiritual practice that rests on mental representations; and how the hand gestures on the body \(when there are such gestures\) bring about, through the representations and mental effort which accompany them, a transformation of the body image, the ‘cosmicisation’ of the performer and his assimilation to the divine.

In chapter 16 of the TĀ, on *putrakadīkṣā*, there are interesting passages \(*śl*. 77–163 and 207–247\) where the cosmic sixfold division of the ‘ways’ \(*adhvan*\) and the mantras which express and are used to purify them are imposed on the body of the adept. There is here again a complex *nyāsa* in which mental representations play a crucial role. It would merit being examined, but to do this here would give too much space to this kind of operation.43 On the subject of complex *nyāsas*, it will be better to look at those which are more directly linked with the cult and use of a *maṇḋala* \(or *cakra*\).

There is a good example of this in chapter 3 of the YH \(*śl*. 8 to 92\), which describes the cult of the goddess Tripurasundarī which, as with the rites we have seen, has as a goal not only her worship but also the identification of the performer with the deity. The ‘external’ cult allows – thanks to the ritual and above all thanks to the *nyāsas* – the adept to attain this identification that those more talented or more favoured by divine grace would attain merely by contemplation \(*bhāvanā: śl*. 5–6\).

The adept must first make a sixfold *nyāsa* \(*ṣoḋhānyāsa*\)44 of: 1\) the fifty Gaṇeśa, placed where one normally imposes the *mātṛkā*; 2\) the nine planets, imposed on various points of the body with each of the eight series of phonemes plus *kṣa*; then 3\) the *nakṣatra*, associated with phonemes; 4\) the six groups of Yoginīs on the six *cakra*s from *mūlādhāra* to *ājñā*, with syllabic *bījas*; 5\) the twelve signs of the zodiac with groups of phonemes; 6\) finally the fifty *pīṭhās* associated with the fifty *mātṛkās*.45 One thereby achieves a first ‘cosmicisation’ of the body of the officiant since one finds there the stars, places of sacred geography, together with such forms of divine energy as are the *mātṛkā* and the *bījas*. The officiant thus already transcends his human condition.

He must, however, still identify with the Goddess and, to this end, he will become assimilated to her as she resides, surrounded by secondary deities, in the *śrīcakra* used to worship her \(since she abides at its centre\), but which also, and mainly, symbolises her cosmic dynamism as she eternally emits and reabsorbs the universe. The adept therefore imposes the *cakra* on his body, the *nyāsa* bringing him to merge with the deity in total non-duality \(therefore going back to the origin\). The ritual process unfolds going from the outer part of the *cakra* to its centre.

First, the process requires the outside line of the square surrounding the *cakra* to be placed on ten points of the body with the mantra ‘homage to the outside line of *bhūpura*’. Then, invoking in the same way the two other lines of the square, he imposes on the same points of the body these lines as well as ten *siddhis*, then the ten *mudrās* which also reside there. In the same way he imposes the other parts of the *cakra* \(the two lotuses with sixteen and eight petals, then the four concentric series of small triangles formed by the intersections of the nine triangles that are within the *cakra*\) on various points of the body, with a mantra of homage to each of these parts. He then imposes on the same points the divine entities residing in each part of the *cakra*. This is thus a double operation, identifying the body with the *cakra* by the placing of its nine parts, then achieving the divinisation by placing all the aspects of the goddess associated with the *cakra*.

Then the adept imposes in his heart, with the mantra ‘homage to the triangle’,46 the central triangle of the *cakra* on the outside of which are the three goddesses Kāmeśvarī, Vajreśvarī, and Bhagamālinī and in the centre the goddess Tripurasundarī.

But the process does not stop there; another series of impositions must still be made on the body, this time going from the centre to the exterior, from the *mūladevī* to the secondary divinities and to the *siddhis*, from the central *bindu* to the outer square. This being done, the adept comes to realise that the goddess, Mistress of the gods – says the commentator – and his own self are identified, inseparably united, the supreme reality, dazzling and vibrant, ‘the unifying fusion of light and consciousness’ \(*prakāśavimarśasāmarasyarūpa*\). Being the cause and foundation of the process of *nyāsa*, the goddess brings the adept to unity with the divine self \(*śl*. 83\); it is therefore with her that the *nyāsa* reaches its ultimate aim.47 The process, in fact, does not end there, but it is not necessary to follow it further.48

If *nyāsa* is essentially a mental or spiritual practice – especially in cases where its scope and aim are the most profound – it is nonetheless, as a general rule, accompanied by a gesture and consists, in the most common practice, in the manual act of placing a mantra – hence the importance, already mentioned above \(pp. 55–56\), of everything relating to the hand; though, probably, as we have already seen with the theory of *nyāsa*, the role of the hand appears as subordinate to the mental operation. One can say that above all it is a symbolic act \(which would not be disparaging, for anything related to *mantra* is precisely of symbolic effectiveness\). It is, on the other hand, in more elaborate philosophical texts \(not very frequent in a Tantric milieu – except, of course, in the Saiva exegesis\) that the spiritual foundation of *nyāsa* is expressed. A less intellectual thinking will naturally give the hand a directly effective role. It goes without saying that, for most adepts of yore or of today – be they devotees, *mantrins*, or magicians \(very numerous, those\!\) – the hand is really charged with the influx that it places. But in Tantric texts too \(the TĀ, for instance\) one often finds side by side these two levels of practice or of religious discourse. These works thus prescribe nearly all the rites for purifying the hand which performs the *nyāsa* and for charging it with the effective force it must transmit. This is in particular what justifies the rite of *karanyāsa* or of *karāṅganyāsa* \(placing on the hands, or placing of the *aṅgamantra* on the hands\) often prescribed first when a series of placings is required.49 One thus finds at the beginning of the Śaiva *samdhya* the *sakalīkaraṇa*50 rite, whose goal, according to Aghoraśiva, is first to penetrate the hand with divine energy \(*sakalahastavy āptaśaktitvena*\), then with this transformed hand, to identify different parts of the body of the officiant with the ‘parts’ \(*kalā*51\) of Śiva.

The fourth chapter of the *Pārameśvara-saṃhitā* \(after the fourth *śloka*, which we have seen given a definition of *nyāsa* as a mental process\) describes a *karanyāsa* \(or *hastanyāsa*\) characteristic enough to merit being reproduced here:


Given the role of the hands in the placings, one should begin with their *nyāsa*. Thus ‘imposed’, the hands are charged with a luminous force. One places there, indeed, twelve phonemes52 from wrists to fingertips, that are thereby as full of light and heat as the sun \(*ādityatapavat*\). The rule is that *nyāsa* is done three times: according to emanation, conservation and resorption. In the *sṛṣṭinyāsa* \(emanation\), one imposes the *tāra* \(*mantra*\) on the palm of the right hand, then on the thumb, etc.: the ten fingers, in order, up to the left little finger, thus receive ten phonemes, the twelfth being placed on the left palm. In the *nyāsa* of conservation \(*sthiti*\), one begins with the left thumb, then the four other fingers, and ends with the palm, imposing six phonemes beginning with the *tāramantra*. Then follows in due order the six other *akṣara* on the left hand, from the thumb to the palm. \(The *saṃhāra* – resorption – *nyāsa* is made from the left palm to the right.\) After this, one must impose the rest of the phonemes ending with the *praṇava*. The *nyāsa* must be made with the index finger on the thumb of the same hand, then with the thumb on the index and the other fingers, going from the right thumb to the left little finger, then the two palms, right and left. One must then impose the *mantras hṛdaya* etc., the twelve luminous members \(*aṅga*\) \(of Viṣṇu\) right in the middle, the lotus with shining rays, the club shining with its own brilliance on the left palm, in the right the luminous disc, the conch in the left palm, the *kiriṭa* on the right hand, the *śrīvatsa* in the middle of the left, the *kaustubha* on the right palm and the rosary on the left, Śrī on the right hand and Puṣṭi on the palm. He must then impose the *garuḋamantra* on the ten fingers, going from the right thumb to the left little finger. This is the rule of the *hastanyāsa*. By this the supreme energy of the Lord will penetrate to the centre of the lotus of the heart where it is transformed into vital breath; then, dividing itself into ten, it extends up to the hands \(*pāṇimārgena nirgatā*\), where it fills the ten channels \(*nāḋī*\) which reach to the fingers.53


In the Śaiva context one finds, as well as the *karanyāsa* already mentioned, a particular rite of the ‘hand of Śiva’ \(*śivahasta*\) used, above all, for initiation \(and sometimes in worship\): it transforms the right hand of the master into a divine hand. Abhinavagupta mentions it in relation to the *samayadīkṣā* in the fifteenth chapter of the TĀ:


The master should, with the left hand, worship on the right hand the luminous wheel of mantras, containing all the ‘ways’ \(*adhvan*\) and destroying all the bonds. He places it on the head of the disciple, on which the ‘ways’ have been first imposed, then touching his whole body, this hand shall destroy all bonds which bind him, and \[the disciple\] will then be an initiated *samayin*, shining, united in his lifetime to the Supreme Lord.54


In the offering of the *pavitras*, described in the SP, the master transforms his hand by means of various anointments and imposes there the *aṅgamantras*.55 This ritual of *śivahasta* can appear as outside the domain of *nyāsa*, but it is not. One is still within the problematic of placings, mental or manual, and of the transmission through thought or hand of a transforming power.

The hand, as we have seen, is generally the right hand but it can be the left or both. A *nyāsa* can also be made in a different way, with a flower for example. Being a beneficial ritual, the *nyāsa* should normally be made with the right hand. The texts sometimes make it clear. They especially mention the cases, rather rare, in which the left hand is to be used. Thus the fourteenth chapter of the TĀ, in a passage previously summarised, indicates the practice expounded being ‘of the left’ \(*vāmācāra*\),56 all the rites prescribed there are to be performed with the left hand \(except where both hands are prescribed\) using the thumb and ring finger.57 The left hand, hand of impure activities, is also to serve in harmful magical practices \(*abhicāra*\). Finally, there are several cases of using both hands together or separately. Such is the case \(cf. p. 76\) of the *vyāpakanyāsa*. There are others cases, those notably of *nyāsa* on symmetrical parts of the body, or when \(in the *karanyāsa*\) the placings are made separately on each hand.

Whatever hand is used, the *nyāsa* is done with a particular gesture of the fingers, a *mudrā*: usually \(as said above\) the thumb and ring finger joined, which is often called *mahāmudrā*. The TBhS says:


The sage must perform the placing with flowers, with the ring finger, or mentally, says another text on *mantra*. \[‘ring finger’ being understood as:\] with the ring finger united to the thumb. The *Padyavāhinī* says in effect: it is everywhere understood that *nyāsa* is made with the thumb and ring finger joined. It explains further: with flowers on the image,58 with the ring finger and thumb on his own body and mentally on the *mūlādhāra* and other *cakras*. This is excepting the *nyāsa* of the *ṛṣi* etc., of the *karāṅganyāsa* and of the external *nyāsa* of the *mātṛkā* for which other *mudrās* are prescribed.


These *mudrās* are enumerated in the same work \(p. 163\): they vary not only with regard to the phonemes imposed but according to the place where the placings are made: ring finger and middle finger on the forehead and the mouth, index, middle finger and ring finger on the eyes, etc. Other texts give different prescriptions – and there are evidently other prescriptions in Buddhist texts \(or in Jain ones\).59

*Mudrās* are continually used in Tantric ritual; they have coded meanings and accompany or support speech – above all mantras – uttered in *pūjā* as well as during other ritual or magical actions. There are lists or descriptions in a number of works.60 As noted above, *mudrās* like mantras surely go back a long way: they are archaic quasi-universal forms of behaviour that India has particularly developed and codified. As previously mentioned, the relationship existing between mantra and *mudrā* does in several respects pose problems that go beyond the scope of this brief study. Remaining in its frame, we have already seen that the Indians did ask themselves the question of the relationship between the effect of *nyāsa* and its material performance. On the subject of *mantras* and *mudrās* in general, the following formulas, usually ascribed to the *Mahānayaprakāśa*,61 are sometimes quoted: *svarūpajñānapanarūpaṃ mudrā-samsthānam* and *svavimarśātmanā trānam īṣyate mantralakṣanam*; the mantra would thus bring liberation by reflexive awareness of the self, whereas the role of the *mudrā* would make known the nature of reality. We may consider these formulas as largely arbitrary since they are based in part on a play of words; we must, however, retain the distinction they set between, on the one hand, the awareness and, on the other, the visible expression or sign of the essential nature, for this is certainly the manner in which mantras and *mudrās* are understood and experienced by those who use them. We may note too that among other meanings the term *mudrā* means ‘seal’ \(or ‘imprint’ made with a seal\) and that, in the case of *nyāsa*, the hand gesture appears precisely to seal in the prescribed place the entity or mantra being imposed \(*mudrā* is also translated into Chinese as *yin* which designates an official seal\).62

As a gesture, *mudrā* is an essential element in the bodily participation of the adept in the transformation of his body that *nyāsa* is to bring about: the movement reinforcing and concretising in a visible manner the action accomplished by mantra and mental concentration.63

But although corporeal by nature, the *mudrā*, too, can be done internally. Thus the LT 35.74, in a chapter describing the rites to be performed for the internal worship \(*antaryāga*\) of the deity, says: ‘The *sādhaka* should meditate on the *mudrās* in spirit’ \(*manasā bhāvayen mudrāḥ*\). The *mudrās*, in this case, are mentally performed or, more exactly, intensely meditated upon and ‘realised’.64 Cases of this sort, of mental or interiorised ritual worship, where no gesture is made, are not exceptional and they are always considered as of a higher nature than materially performed rites. The *mudrā*, too, in such cases, acquires a higher value.

*Mudrās*, in fact, necessarily have a mental aspect since they are not merely performed, but also thought, held in mind, mentally imagined by the adept at the same time as he performs them bodily.65 But there may also be something more: they can be ‘lived’, experienced, by him on a metaphysical plane. When, for example, the YH 1.57–71 describes the divine energy as taking the form of nine *mudrās*, the *sādhaka* must at that time make the prescribed, symbolic gestures, the *mudrās*, with his hands, and realise them as being forms of the Energy \(*kriyāśakti*\) – deities also – thus closely associating the bodily, theological and metaphysical planes.66

We can cite on the same subject another work of the Krama tradition of Kashmir, but by an author of South India, Maheśvarānanda \(tenth century\), who put forward an interesting metaphysical interpretation of *nyāsa* in stanza 45 of his *Mahārthamañjarī*. Here is an approximate rendering of this text: ‘The network of gestures pertaining to the domain of dualistic thought brings about a contact with non-duality. The water of the offering is the play of the knowable; the flowers are the nourishing states of our own essence.’67 Maheśvarānanda, in his own commentary, the *Parimala*, explains that this ‘network of gestures’ is the *aṅganyāsa* effected by the adept who, when making these placings on his body, becomes aware of the Self, which destroys all duality. In effect he unites the awareness of the absolute with the parts of his body touched by the *nyāsa* which are thus understood in spirit through a synthetic, undifferentiated intuition whose nature is the realisation of the total plenitude of the absolute ‘I’. Maheśvarānanda cites then a verse from his *paramaguru* Śivānanda:


I accomplish the purification – the total purification of the two hands – which is pure consciousness expanding to the fingers and where the action being done coincides exactly with its Cause. I realize and make present by the practice of the *ṣaḋaṅga \[nyāsa\]* the surging of the noble energies, the Omniscient and the others, which abide in the Self of the Lord.


Neither these stanzas, nor their gloss, are easy to grasp; the terminology, the metaphysics, are those of the Krama of Kashmirian Śaivism. But the interpretation of *nyāsa* as an operation of a metaphysical order where gesture is subordinated to consciousness, itself dominated by the non-dual awareness of divinity, is clear: the scope and field of action of *nyāsa* is transcendent, its nature is spiritual. The formula of the *Pārameśvara-saṃhitā* – *vyāparo mānaso hyeṣa nyāsaḥ* – appears in comparison to be modest; but all the formulations encountered – and I think I have made an impartial choice – put the placings on the same side, that of consciousness.

It remains, to complete this study, to review briefly some examples of *nyāsa* prescribed in the texts and the manuals \(examples, of course, that we have not already seen\).



### Ṛṣyādinyāsa
– the placing of ***ṛṣi*** etc.

When a text prescribes the use of a mantra for certain ends, the announcement is almost always followed by an indication of the sage \(*ṛṣi*\) to whom it was revealed, by its meter \(*chandas*\), the *devatā* it ‘expresses’, the syllable or word which is its seed \(*bīja*\), that is, its abbreviated form or essence. Sometimes, too, its energy \(*śakti*\) is indicated along with its pointed end \(*kīlaka*\) and, finally, its use \(*viniyoga*\).68 Now, the first thing to do, if one wants to use the mantra, is to impose on oneself those of these elements that are quoted: an obligatory rule to be followed even when it is not expressly prescribed. This may take place at the beginning of the ritual, if only one mantra is concerned \(as in most cases cited in the *Mantramahārṇava*\); but if a longer rite requires the use of several mantras, the *ṛṣyādinyāsa* can be prescribed each time – thus the placing of the *mātṛkā*, which very often must follow the *ṛṣyādinyāsa* and the *ṣaḋaṅganyāsa* of the principal mantra, begins with the placing of the *ṛṣi* etc. \(see below p. 79\). \(This is so much so that even the *hamṣa* mantra of the *ajapājapa*, which in many regards is only the natural movement of the breath accompanied by the two syllables *ham* and *sa*, is supposed to have its *ṛṣi* etc. that it is necessary to place initially: at most it is sometimes admitted that there is a spontaneous placing–*sahajam nyāsam*, cf. *Dakṣinamūrtisaṃhitā* 7.17–20\). The raison d’être of this rite is that the practitioner thus begins his assimilation of the mantra by effecting a first general identification with it through taking into himself its principal elements, after which comes the rest of the ritual \(of which we have seen examples\), at the end of which the adept will attain a perfect identification with the supernatural entity of which the mantra is the phonic form and through which the sought after goal is reached. But to be able to effect a complete transformation, a veritable ‘change of ontological status’ \(to speak like Mircea Eliade\), since it is a question of passing from ordinary life to a state of liberation in life, of identification with the absolute69 – or even, more modestly and more usually, when the aim of the rite is merely to become able to use the mantra for utilitarian ends – it is necessary for the adept to have from the outset a body and mind prepared and already somewhat modified and purified by assimilating something of the mantra. This is why this preliminary *nyāsa* is useful.70 ‘Without the placing of the *ṛṣi*, the metre and the *devatā*, the recitation of a mantra, even indefinitely multiplied, would remain fruitless’ \(a tantra cited in the TBhS, p. 189\).

This *nyāsa* is always done in the order given above and on the same points of the body, successively: the head, the mouth, the heart \(which are the three obligatory points corresponding to *ṛṣi, chandas* and *devatā*\), then genitals \(or *mūlādhāra*\), feet and/or navel and on the entire body \(*sarvāṅga*\). The formula used is of the type: \(*Om*\) \+ the utterance of the *ṛṣi* etc. in the dative \+ *namaḥ* \(the part of the body touched being sometimes also stated in the locative\). Thus, for the mantra *Om namaḥ śivāya*, the *ṛṣi* etc. are presented as follows:


*ṛṣī Vāmadeva, paṇktichandas Īśānadevatā oṃ bījam, namah. śakti, śivāya kīlakam, caturvidhapuruṣārthasiddhyarthe nyāse viniyogaḥ.*


We have thus:


*om vāmadevārṣaye namaḥ*, on the head

*paṅktichandase namaḥ*, on the mouth

*Īśānadevatayai namaḥ*, on the heart

*om bījāya namaḥ* on the genitals

*namaḥ śaktaye namaḥ* on the feet

*śivāyeti kīlakāya namaḥ* on the navel

*caturvidha … viniyogāya namaḥ* on the body.71


One might ask what motivates the choice of one or another part of the body for the *nyāsa*. Perhaps comparing *nyāsas* in several different traditions would make it possible to discover permanent elements and to reach conclusions: such an enquiry \(if it is worth the trouble\) remains to be carried out. For the present case, the selection of the places where to impose mantras seems to be that of important points of the image of the body as it is mentally experienced in ritual worship, in yoga, and in mantric practice.72

Sometimes this series of placings is to take place after the *karanyāsa*, but it normally precedes another series, also a general occurrence: the *aṅganyāsa* or *karāṅganyāsa*.



### Aṅganyāsa or karāṅganyāsa

The placing on the body – or on the hands, then on the body – of the *aṅgamantras* is also one of those somehow preliminary operations which, taking place at the beginning of a rite, serve to impregnate the body and the mind of the officiant with the energy and powers of the mantra or of the deity of whom the *aṅgas* represent qualities or fundamental aspects. Necessary at the beginning of all mantric practice, included therefore in the obligatory rites, it is part – as the *nyāsa* of the *riṣyādi* and that of the *mātṛkā* – of the everyday practices of Hinduism.

This rite is also called *sakalīkaraṇa*. The SP defines it thus: ‘One must understand by *sakalīkaraṇa* the placing on the body, beginning with the heart and ending with the hands, and on the fingers beginning with the little finger, of the mantras of which the first is *HṚD*’.73

The six *aṅgamantras* \(with which are associated, in Śaivism, the five *vaktras*, faces or mouths of Śiva, to form the eleven *samhitāmantra*\) are perhaps originally a Śaiva conception, but one finds it in all of purānic or tantric Hinduism and also with the Jains. In spite of their name, the *aṅgas* are not limbs or parts of the body, but elements with symbolic value, corresponding to parts of the mental \(visualised\) image of a divinity or a mantra – or else to the powers which emanate from deity or mantra, such as the rays from the sun74 – and which are placed by *nyāsa* on different points of the human body which is thus put in correspondence with them. These elements are ‘lived’ by the adept and experienced as such and as pervaded by divine powers.75 ‘One must perform the *ṣaḋaṅganyāsa* to acquire perfection of body \(*dehasya siddhaye*\),’ says the *Pārameśvara-saṃhitā* \(7.21\). \(This is apropos the *ajapājapa* of the *hamsamantra* which has no limbs nor body, since it is nothing else than the breath assimilated to the divine energy: besides, the placing of the *aṅgas* of this mantra is in fact done with luminous entities: the sun, moon etc. – the *Hamsopaniṣad*, 12, gives a similar prescription\). The *aṅgas* are the heart \(*hṛdaya*\), the head \(*śiras*\), the tuft of hair \(*śikhā*\), the ‘cuirass’ \(*kavaca*\), the eye \(*netra*\)76 and the weapon \(*astra*\). They are placed respectively on the heart, the head, the place of the tuft, the upper part of the arms close to the shoulders, the eyes or the forehead, and the hands; or, in the case of placings upon the hands, on the fingers and the palm. They are always enumerated and placed in the same order and the way they are formed obeys precise rules, the same, apparently, in all traditions. These mantras are uttered in the following manner: one first utters \(although not always\) *Om* which is followed by one or several monosyllabic *bīja*s77 and sometimes by another element78 – these varying according to the principal mantra. After which comes the enunciation of the *aṅga* in the dative, then the final exclamation, which is, according to the *aṅga* and in order: *namaḥ, svāhā, vaṣaṭ, huṃ, vauṣaṭ* and *phaṭ*.79 This order being fixed, the placings are made sometimes with only this part of the mantra – called *jāti*, that is, species or category – which suffices to represent and identify the *aṅga*.80

Here is, by way of example, the *aṅgamantra* of the triple *vidyā Parā, Parāparā* and *Aparā* according to the MNT, a modern fabrication, to be sure, but propounding many traditional notions:



*Oṃ sāṃ hṛdayāya namaḥ, oṃ sīṃ śirase svāhā*,

*Oṃ sūṃ śikayai vauṣat, oṃ saiṃ kavacāya hum*,

*Oṃ sauṃ netrebhyaḥ vaṣaṭ, oṃ saḥ astrāya phaṭ*


\(ibid., III, 60–61\)


According to certain texts \(as in a tantra cited in the TBhS p. 170\), the hand forms different *mudrā* according to the *aṅgamantra* being placed.

This sixfold placing is sometimes made on the hands before being made on the body: the hand, naturally, receives the *aṅgas* before it places them elsewhere. One has then a variant of the *karanyāsa* mentioned previously – where sometimes \(in the *sakalīkaraṇa* for example\) the *aṅgas* are also placed.

The formula used is a little different from that of the *aṅganyāsa*. It is either a short formula, of the type *anguṣṭhabhyāṃ namaḥ, tarjanibhyām svāhā*, etc.,81 or a more complex one, of the pattern: *bīja* \+ divinity and *aṅga* with the dative, \+ finger or palm with the locative, \+ final exclamation, as, for instance, *hrīṃ śrīmadekajaṭayai hṛdayāya aṅguṣṭhabhyāṃ namaḥ*. The placing is normally made from the thumb to the little finger, then on the two palms. As with other *nyāsas*, it must sometimes be done three times: according to emanation, from the thumb to little finger; according to resorption in reverse; or according to maintenance, going from the base of the middle finger to the index finger.82 Certain texts prescribe different *mudrās* for different placings \(TBhS, p. 170\). The formulas use the locative dual for the fingers and palms because the *nyāsa* must be made simultaneously and separately on the two hands: with the thumb on the fingers of the same hand, with the index finger on the thumb, then with the four fingers of the right hand on the left palm and vice versa.83



### Mātṛkānyāsa

We remain, with the *mātṛkānyāsa*, in the placings which ensure the preliminary divinisation of the officiant, essential for effectively worshipping a deity or a mantra. One thus finds it almost always in the first part of the *pūjā*, although in principle not in the worship of a mantra where, on the contrary, the *nyāsa* of the *ṛṣi* etc. and of the *aṅgas* is always present. This last, however, is usually associated with the placing of all letters of the mantra \(*mantramātṛkānyāsa*\), an operation which one can be all the more tempted to parallel with the *nyāsa* of the *mātṛkā* since the latter, when imposed, is treated as a mantra \(one sometimes says *mātṛkāmantranyāsa*\) with its *ṛṣi, aṅga* etc: all these procedures are repetitive and tend to interpenetrate. The TBhS underlines this when it begins the section of the *mātṛikānyāsa* by citing the *Pheṭkāriṇītantra*: ‘without the placing of their letters, the mantras are dumb. To ensure the success of all the mantras, one must therefore first place the letters’.84 In many cults, we find series of *mātṛkānyāsas* added to the *antar*- and *bahir-nyāsa* which form the *mātṛkānyāsa* in the strict sense, which we describe here, the imposition of the same fifty or fifty-one phonemes associated to cosmic elements \(for example, the *kalās –* see the *kalāmātṛkānyāsa* cited below p. 77\) or the *nyāsa* of the letters of a mantra itself sometimes associated with that of the *mātṛkā*. One obtains in this way series of *mātṛkānyāsas*: nine are enumerated later \(p. 78\) and many other examples could be given.

The *mātṛkā* – or the *mātṛkās*: the ‘little mothers’ – are the phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet regarded as discrete aspects of divine energy or, taken all together, as the totality of this energy under the form of speech \(the ŚT 6.2, calls this the phonetic body, *varṇatanu*, of the goddess\) which ‘expresses’ the cosmic manifestation, bringing it into existence by enunciating it. They are the basic phonic elements being used to form the mantras as well as to create, support, animate \(and to reabsorb\) the universe.85 Their placing can therefore appear as an essential factor in the divinisation of the officiant, this they may be in theory if not in practice. The *mātṛkānyāsa* may seem to have a more important role in the traditions where – as in the Śaiva non-dualistic systems of Kashmir – speculations on the cosmic role of the phonemes were particularly developed. The importance and role of the *mātṛkā* is, however, part of a shared Tantric fund, it is therefore not surprising that this *nyāsa* is also found in one form or another in all traditions. It is, however, especially in the Śaiva and Śākta texts that one finds the *mātṛkānyāsa* in the complete form that we will describe now.

The placing of the *mātṛkā* usually follows the *ṛṣyādi*- and *karāṅga-nyāsa*. It is normally divided into three parts. First, since the *mātṛkā* is considered as a mantra, the *ṛṣi* etc., then the *aṅga*, will have first to be imposed. This is arbitrary and is due only to the idea that the *mātṛkā* is, in this context \(insofar as one imposes it?\), to be treated exactly as a mantra. Of course, *ṛṣi*, metre, etc. vary according to the texts and the schools. The *nyāsa* is done in the usual way. It is followed by *karanyāsa* and *aṅga*;- or *karāṅganyāsa* on the hands and/or on the body.86

Then the internal placing, *antarmātṛkānyāsa*, takes place in general a process entirely mental, consisting of concentrating mentally on the six *cakras* \(or *ādhāras*, of the yogic body\) which are tiered from the base of the spinal column to the summit of the head and which must be visualized as lotuses, each with a different colour and a particular number of petals from two to sixteen, on each of which one places mentally one of the fifty phonemes: ‘That which is called the internal *nyāsa* consists of placing and \[mentally\] uttering \(*uccārya*\) each phoneme followed by the word *namaḥ*, going from the *mūlādhāra* to the *brahmarandhra*’.87 The texts in general underline the importance of mental concentration, of the image mentally evoked, of the centres of the yogic body and of the phonemes. The adept must – at least in theory – clearly visualise the *cakras* of his body and ‘see’ there the phonemes he has placed as brilliant letters forming drops of energy whose presence transforms him by awakening these centres of vital and cosmic energy. This mental representation can be accompanied by the recitation, audible or murmured, of the phonemes placed. To this is sometimes added a visualisation of a divinity also mentally perceived in the body.88 ‘This *nyāsa* must be made in meditation, the mind well concentrated. One must visualize Viṣṇu, pure Consciousness, extending from the *mūlādhāra* to the *brahmarandhra* and place the *mātṛkā* with the essence of nectar flowing from the supreme *bindu*, while separately uttering each of the letters’.89 Some texts prescribe, to accompany the placing \(or to precede it\), a *prāṇayāma* where the breath is imagined as associated with different categories of phonemes, then as circulating with them in the entire body which they impregnate with their energy.90 The *antarmātṛkānyāsa* reflects, in this regard, the same spirit as the complex *nyāsas* that we have seen above \(p. 59f.\) where the image of the body mentally evoked plays an essential part.

Finally comes the external placing \(*bahirmātṛkānyāsa*\) of the fifty phonemes in grammatical order from *A* to *KṢA*, on fifty points of the ‘gross’ body, made with the hand – generally with a different *mudrā* according to the part of the body and by enunciating either only the phoneme ‘decorated’ with the *bindu* and followed by *namaḥ*, or these elements preceded by a *bīja* variable according to different schools.91 The external *nyāsa* is often made three times in a different order, according to whether the phonemes are placed emanationwise, from *A* to *KṢA* \(since that is the order which manifests the universe\), or according to conservation, or from *KṢA* to *A*, and in this case it is the process of phonetic resorption which is imposed. We have already seen the triple *sṛṣṭi-stithi* and *saṃhāra-nyāsa* and explained its meaning \(see above p. 65\). The rules of external *nyāsa* vary also according to the texts: the *Tārābhaktisuddhārnava* quotes several.92

There is another placing of the fifty phonemes which is less frequent: the *mālinīnyāsa*, that we have already seen \(above p. 60\) as part of a complex *nyāsa* described in the TĀ. The *mālinī* is a particular order of phonemes, the first being *NA* and the last *PHA* \(it is therefore called *nādiphāntakrama*\): it is the alphabetical form of the goddess Mâlinî, an ‘alphabet deity’ \(see above p. 60 and note 30\). It is found especially in the non-dualist Kashmirian Śaiva system of the Trika \(being described in particular in the third chapter of the MVT, quoted and paraphrased by Abhinavagupta in his PTV\), and also in the Kubjikā tradition. The *mālinī* is considered as an especially effective and energetic form of the phonemes in, the passage that I have just recalled \(TĀ 15.121–142\), its *nyāsa* is prescribed to charge the body with energy \(*nyasecchāktaśarīrārthaṃ bhinnayoniṃ tu mālinīm*\), which is a citation from MVT 3.36. We also meet it in chapter 145 of the *Agni-Purāṇa* \(which is a sign, among others, of the influence of the *kulāmnaya* on this text\). In these cases, the *nyāsa* is not described as part of a complete rite of *mātṛkānyāsa* that we have just seen, and does not take place necessarily at the beginning of the rite. A particular aspect of those *nyāsas* is that the letters of this alphabet are conceived as being disposed vertically from head to feet in the shape of a human body – that of the goddess Mâlinî, and thus, if imposed on the body of an adept, the phonemes are placed in the same way on his body. The operation is therefore somewhat different, but its meaning and effect – a transfer of power embodied in an alphabet – remains the same.93

The three *nyāsas* that we have seen are probably the most frequently and most generally used in Hinduism \(they even appear to some measure in Jainism\). They help us to underline some traits of the theory or practice of the placings. There are, however, other *nyāsas*, probably less common but not uninteresting. We will therefore mention some of them chosen among the most characteristic.

We have already encountered the *pīṭhanyāsa* when dealing with the *ṣoḋhānyāsa*, of which it usually forms a sixth part, having the effect of placing in the body of the adept the fifty-one sanctuaries of the goddess, thereby identifying the body with a sacred world where, on pilgrimage, one goes from one sanctuary to another. One could say in this regard that the pilgrimage is internalised together with the fifty or fifty-one divine places, or centres of divine energy, distributed at different points of Indian territory. This *nyāsa* is both Śaiva and Śākta since it refers to the myth of the dismemberment of the body of Satī.94 There are variants corresponding with variants in the numbers of *pīṭha* being invoked which goes from four to fifty-one \(and according to a later tradition up to 108\). It may be found also in other traditions.95 In fact, the expression *pīṭhanyāsa*, in its most current sense, designates the placing of entities serving as seat or throne \(*pīṭha*\) of the divinity on the lower part of the icon being used for worship. This is well attested in ritual texts \(for example, for the Pāñcarātra in the JayS, chapter 20, pp. 223–227\).96

We have previously seen other placings which divinise or ‘cosmicise’ the adept, as with the placing of the *tattvas* or the *adhvans*. There is also the *nyāsa* of the *kalās*, etc. We can also mention, among such notions, the *mūrtinyāsa* prescribed in the SvT \(1.59–60, vol. 1, p. 50\), where the adept must place on his entire body \(*sarvaṅgeṣu*\) the nine *tattvas* from *kalā* to *śiva*,97 then the *tritattva* \(*ātma, vidyā* and *śiva-tattva*\) covering the thirty-six *tattvas*. He thus places in himself the divinity as it manifests the universe: this is a process of deification.

The *nyāsas* examined so far are essentially those that the adept makes on his own body to purify or transform it. But placings are very often made on objects to which they transmit the power of a deity or mantra; a power that the adept must in theory first assimilate by an initial and more or less complex *nyāsa*.98 This is continually met in the ritual: the placing of a mantra on water used for worship \(*arghya*\) and which, when thus ‘sacralised’, becomes the nectar of Śiva, etc. But there are several more curious ways of proceeding. One could thus mention the ritual for the invocation of Śiva \(*śivāvāhana*\) of the SP1 \(III, 61–64, vol. 1, pp. 184–91\), where the officiant, meditating on the supreme Śiva, utters internally the *bīja Hauṃ*, making it go up from the *mūlādhara* to the *brahmarandhra* and, from his face where it shines like the moon, he visualises it descending in a flower kept in the cup of his hands \(*puṣpāñjaligataṃ dhyatvā*\); he then unites it to the icon \(*mūrti*\) which is used as support for the worship, where the divinity itself will consequently reside: a process which is made entirely mentally \(*dhyāna* or *bhāvanā*\), then by *mudrās*, without there being, strictly speaking, *nyāsa*. We can ask, here, again if we are still in the domain of the placings. In fact, the ritual seems to provide instances where mantras produce an effect without any *nyāsa* being really performed: sometimes a *mudrā* or a gesture accompanies them, sometimes touching with a flower.99 There are also some cases where the *mudrās* seem to be active by themselves.100 It would probably be too much to consider these practices as being strictly speaking placings. They are, however, very near, be it only because they fall within the same problematic: that of the transfer of energy by mental concentration and/or gesture. Or, from a more general point of view, partake of the problem of the efficacy of gesture which in fact lies at the centre \(or in the background\) of the practice of *nyāsa*.

It should be noted also that, in a ritual close in spirit and in its effect, the *jīvanyāsa* \(a term that could be translated as ‘the placing of life’\), such as described in the AgPur \(chapter 96, *śl* 90–93\), the master enunciates the mantras, making them go up from the navel *cakra* to the *dvādaśānta* where they dissolve in the effulgence of the supreme Śiva, who is carried by mental concentration and placed on the *liṅga* being used for the worship, where from now on the god will abide. This purely mental ritual process \(*manasā … dhyatvā*\) is called *nyāsa* \(*jīvanyāso bhaved evam*\). It is followed by other placings on the base of the *liṅga*. Chapter 59 \(this one Vaiṣṇava\) of the same purāṇa, describing the rite of the *adhivāsana* of Viṣṇu, says in a similar way that the deity is installed \(*sthapana*\) in the image which is vitalised \(*sajīvakaraṇa*\) by placing on it the *mūrtimantra*.

The *jīvanyāsa* is normally used for infusing the icon used in worship with life. It can, however, also be used for the adept after the rite of *bhūtaśuddhi* or *dehaśuddhi* \(purification of the elements of the body\), by which the adept reabsorbs the elements of which his body is composed one in the other \(a resorption that makes the gross body disappear\). His vital principle \(*jīva*\) finds itself thus outside of him because it resides, for a moment, in the *dvādaśānta* or in the *bindu*. To this ancient body it is necessary to substitute a new body, pure, subtle, into which one will bring back the principle of life previously displaced. This is done through the rite of *jīvana*, or *sakalīkaraṇa*, where some *nyāsas* are used.101

When a *pūjā* is made to a deity using a diagram, it is by *nyāsas* – normally done using blades of *darbha* grass – that the deity, then his/her *aṅgas*, attributes, and the secondary deities who surround him/her, and so on, are placed in the *cakra* or *maṇḋala* \(see for example, LT chapter 38 or SP3\). It is the same for any rite where a *maṇḋala* is used in which deities are placed \(cf. SP2, vol. 2 p. 320 with regard to *prayaścitta*; or various passages of SP3, etc.\).

In more current use, mantras are put on objects to make them sacred, to purify and protect them etc. Thus the *astramantra* is placed on the doorframe of the door to the sanctuary or on the threshold to protect the place of worship \(SP2, vol. 2, pp. 48 and 356\); or nine deities are placed on the blades of grass used to make a *pavitra* \(ibid. p. 102\); or the mantras *astra, kavaca* and *hṛdaya* are deposited on a receptacle where they constitute a phonic and spiritual ‘casket’ so as to protect these same *pavitras* \(ibid., pp. 130–131\). Examples could be multiplied indefinitely.

But rather than pursue this enumeration, it would now be better, after having seen separately different *nyāsas*, to try to follow – briefly – a whole ritual where placings play a role, whether the ritual is centred on a mantra or is the *pūjā* of a deity.

In the cult of a mantra, the *mantrasādhana* or *puraścaraṇa*, the adept, who has received a mantra from his master through initiation, is to perform rites and follow observances which will give him, in the end, control of the mantra from which he will be able to draw all possible spiritual \(or material\) benefit. Hélène Brunner, in her study already cited \(above, note 29\) on the *sādhaka*, has summarised this ascesis according to the *Mṛgendrāgama* and several other āgamas. There are very similar prescriptions in other Śaiva, Śākta and Vaiṣṇava texts. The schema is generally the same, comprising a certain number of *nyāsas* placed especially at the beginning of the practice in order to communicate to the adept, by several series of placings, the energy of the mantra which will serve him as instrument of action and/or of salvation. As it is usually necessary, during the *sādhana*, to perform a worship to the mantra, this is done using a diagram, on which *nyāsas* will also be made.

The placings are in general in the following order. The *ṛṣyādinyāsa*, a *vyāpaka-nyāsa*102 on the entire body, the *kara*- or *karāṅganyāsa* on the hands, the *hṛdayādiṣaḋaṅganyāsa* \(sometimes also the placing of the five *brahma*- or *vaktra-mantra, sadyojāta* etc.\); then the placing on the body of the letters and/or the words of the *mūla-mantra* \(*mantravarṇa* and *mantrapada-nyāsa*\) follow from those of the *aṅga, upāṅga* and secondary elements.

After this comes the *pūjā* of the mantra, normally done with a *maṇḋala* where the *mūrtimantra* must be placed in the centre by *nyāsa*, which installs there the image of the *mantradevatā*, then, of course, around it, the *aṅga, upāṅga, āvaraṇa*-, or *parivara-mantras* etc.103 The *pūjā* itself and all that follows it then remain to be performed, during which rites other *nyāsas* will take place and where, in particular, it might happen that the *sādhaka* must place the *cakra* on his own body \(cf. YH 3 cited above p. 64\): the succession of the *nyāsas* is considerable, and even quasi-infinite if one thinks that the operations are repeated hundreds or thousands of times.

It is, however, in the *pūjā* of the divinities that the series of *nyāsas* are longest and where they take place most often. This is quite natural considering the number of elements playing a role in the worship at the same time which it is necessary to purify or consecrate, and all the more in the context of manipulation of divine energy and of internalisation or ritual identification which is that of the Tantric *pūjā*. Evidently, we do not meet here as complex *nyāsas* those which took place in initiations: those which are supposed to involve a total spiritual and bodily transformation of the disciple and which, quite naturally, require the most complex and effective procedure for the transfer of energy. The case of the *pūjā* is different and, one could say, simpler. But even here the number and the diversity of the placings are considerable because the worship is often a long process, sometimes involving a number of deities. Now, rites as well as divinities vary according to traditions and sects and even according to worshippers; it would therefore be vain to try to draw up a complete list. It will suffice to end this overview of *nyāsa* by giving a few brief elements concerning the usual succession and function of some of the placings made during the *pūjā*.

There is a brief exposition of *nyāsa* in the cult of Kṛṣṇa, pp. 90–92 of the thesis of R.V. Joshi, *Le rituel de la dévotion kṛṣṇaïte*.104 They are part of the worship of the already consecrated image \(without *nyāsa* apparently\) and are done on the image itself. They are limited to very few elements: *antarmātṛkanyāsa* on six parts of the image which correspond to the six *cakras* of the body; *keśavanyāsa*: the placing of fifty-one phonemes with fifty-one different names of Kṛṣṇa and his Śakti \(*am Keśavāya Kīrtyai namaḥ* etc.\); and lastly a *tattvanyāsa* considered to be particularly important. Mantras accompanied by *mudrās* are used during the rest of the ritual but they are not strictly speaking *nyāsas*, which appear to be remarkably few in number.

Appreciably longer are the following lists which seem much more characteristic. These are drawn from manuals of different epochs. The *Pūjāvidhinirūpaṇa* of Trimalla105 first enumerates only eleven placings, performed at the beginning of the *pūjā*:


1.*ṛṣyādinyāsa;*

2.*ṣaḋaṅganyāsa;*

3.*antarmātṛkānyāsa;*

4.*bahirmātṛkā- \(saṃhāra-sṛṣṭi* and *sthiti*\);

5.*mūlavidyāsaṃpuṭitamātṛkānyāsa*;

6.*nyāsa* of six goddesses;

7.*nyāsa* of five *vaktras* of Śiva, followed by:

8.*ṣaḋaṅganyāsa*;

9.*yoni-nyāsa*: two placings of nine divinities;

10.*nyāsa* of the eight mothers Brahmī etc.

11.lastly, we have the *vyāpakanyāsa* of the *mūlamantra* of Bhuvaneśvarī; followed by various offerings, the *dvārapūjā*, the *pīṭhapūjā*, then the cult of the divinity.


If we look at the *Tāriṇīpārijāta* \(which quotes several Tantras\), we find, in the *pūjā*, after the preliminary libations, the construction and offering of the throne, *prāṇāyāma* and *bhūtaśuddhi*, a series of eleven *nyāsas*:


1.*jīvanyāsa* comprising several elements \(see above note 101\);

2.*antarmātṛkānyāsa* comprising first several placings on the body, then *ṛṣyādi*- and *aṅganyāsa, dhyāna* of the goddess, ending with placings of fifty phonemes in the *cakra*;

3.a triple *bahirmātṛkānyāsa* \(*sṛṣṭi sthiti* and *saṃhāra*\), each comprising *ṛṣyādinyāsa* and *dhyāna* of a *devatā* with the placing of the *mātṛkā*;

4.*kalāmātṛkānyāsa*: the placing of the *mātṛkā* associated with fifty-one *kalās*, preceded by the *ṛṣyādi* and *aṅganyāsa* and a *dhyāna*;

5–10.*ṣoḋānyāsa* \(described according to the *Tantracūḋamaṇi*\) comprising the placing of fifty Rudras, nine *graha*, eight *lokapāla*, Śiva and Śakti on the six *cakras*, Tārā \(*nyāsa* of fifty phonemes on the six *cakra*\), and lastly ten *pīṭhas* with groups of phonemes on ten points of the body;

11.*nyāsa* on the body of the *ṛṣi* etc., then of the *aṅga* \(*karāṅganyāsa*\) *mantra* of Tāriṇi on the hands. After this the adept must trace the *yantra* used for the worship, followed by *nyāsa* of fifty *pīṭha* \(seen previously, p. 74, lastly the rest of the *pūjā*.


The two series do not differ much except by the presence in the second one of the *jīvanyāsa* and of the sixfold *ṣoḋaśanyāsa*. These are simple models. An example of a longer series can be found in the *Balārcanapaddhati*, a Śākta ritual manual published in 1933 in Surat.106 This work is taken simply as an example among others of contemporary prescriptions where the placings are multiplied one could say for pleasure’s sake, without this abundance adding anything to the significance or interest of the operation; it is typical of the Tantric tendency to ritual multiplication and redundancy.

The part of the text concerning *nyāsas* begins with the *bhūtaśuddhi* which is made by placing the fifty phonemes from *A* to *KṢA* on different parts of the body \(ending with the thousand petal lotus at the top of the cranium\). This purification is followed \(as already seen, p. 75: *jīvanyāsa*\) by the ‘infusion of breath’ *prāṇapratiṣṭhā*, realised by *ṛṣyādi-, karāṅga*-, then *vyāpakanyāsa*, followed by a *dhyāna* of the *devatā*, after which the placing of the vital breath itself is made on the body of the adept with the *prāṇapratiṣṭhāmantra*. Then come the following *nyāsas*:


1.*antarmātṛkānyāsa*: first a *prāṇāyāma* – inhaling with the vowels, retaining the breath with the *pavarga* \(the occlusives from *pa* to *ma*\) and expiration with *ya* etc.; *ṛṣyādinyāsa*, then *karanyāsa* with the vowels and the *vargas* of the consonants followed by their *hṛdayādiṣaḋaṅganyāsa. Dhyāna* of the *kuṇḋalinī* coiled up in the *mūlādhāra* with all the phonemes, then mounting with them along the *suṣumnā* – one must visualise the six *cakras* and mentally place there the vowels and the groups \(*varga*\) of consonants.

2.*bahirmātṛkānyāsa*: first, as previously, the *ṛṣyādi-, kara*, and *ṣaḋ aṅganyāsa, then placings of the sixteen vowels \(oṃ aṃ namaḥ to oṃ aḥ namaḥ*\) and of the eight groups of consonants to which one adds two supplementary ‘groups’: *ham-ḥam* and *kṣam* placed on the two hands.

3.*śuddhamātṛkānyāsa*: *ṛṣyādi-, kara* and *aṅganyāsa. Dhyāna* of the goddess associated with fifty phonemes, then *nyāsa* of them on fifty points of the body.

4–5–6.*mātṛkānyāsa* according to *saṃhāra, sṛṣṭi* and *sthiti*.

First, the *ṛṣyādikaraṣaḋaṅganyāsa*. Then a *dhyāna*, different in each of the three cases. Then *nyāsa* of the phonemes ‘decorated’ with *bindu* \(*oṃ kṣaṃ namaḥ* to *om aṃ namaḥ*\) on different points of the body for the *saṃhāranyāsa*; or the phonemes with the *visarga* \(*oṃ aḥ namaḥ* etc.\) for *sṛṣṭi*, or, for *sthitinyāsa*, the phonemes with *bindu* and *visarga*, going from *ḋa* to *ṭha* \(the three placings are to be done in a different order according to whether one is a brahmacārin, a householder or a renouncer\).

7.*śaktimātṛkānyāsa*: *ṛṣyādinyāsa, ṣaḋaṅga*- then *karanyāsa. Dhyāna* of the Śakti, then *mātṛkānyāsa* \(*oṃ aṃ hrīṃ namaḥ* on the head, *oṃ āṃ hrīṃ namaḥ* on the mouth etc.\).

8.*śrīpraṇavakalāmātṛkānyāsa: ṛṣyādi*, then *hṛdayādinyāsa. Dhyāna* of Praṇavakalāmātṛkāsarasvatī, to whom homage is to be paid; then invocation of the fifty *kalās* and their placing with fifty phonemes from *A* to *KṢA*.

9.*Śrīkaṇṭhādimātṛkānyāsa*: *ṛṣādi*, then *hṛdayādinyāsa* of a rather long formula: ‘*oṃ hrīṃ śrīṃ namaḥ śivāya aṃ brahmāṇi māṃ rakṣa rakṣa haṃsavahane mām rakṣa rakṣa padmahaste māṃ rakṣarakṣa hāṃ hrīṃ hrūṃ. aṃ kaṃ aṃ aṃ aṃ aṃ hrāṃ hrīṃ hrūṃ hsauḥ saṃjīvāni hṛdayāya namaḥ’* etc. Next *dhyāna*, then placing of the fifty phonemes according to the pattern: *oṃ hsauḥ aṃ śrīkaṇṭheśa pūrnendarībhyāṃ namaḥ* \(on the head\) etc.

10.*Keśavādinyāsa*: *ṛṣyādinyāsa, dhyāna*, then the placing, after having made mentally the offerings, of the *pūjā* \(*mānasopacaraiḥ saṃpūjyanyaset*\). *Nyāsa* of the fifty phonemes as: *oṃ klīṃ aṃ* etc.; next a *prapañcayāgamātṛkānyāsa* with *ṛṣyādi* and *karanyāsa*, and then an ‘oblation’ \(*homa*\) of phonemes \(*varṇamayam homam*\) with the formula *oṃ hrīṃ kṣam hamasaḥ so’haṃ svāhā* \(for *KṢA*\) up to *oṃ hrīṃ aṃ haṃsaḥ so’haṃ svāhā* \(for *A*\) on different parts of the body.

11.*mūlamantranyāsa*, that is, the main, basic \(*mûla*\) mantra of *Bālātripurasundarī*: *ṛṣyādinyāsa*, then a triple placing of *aiṃ, klīṃ* and *sauḥ* \(which are the *bīja*, the *śakti* and the *kīlaka* of the mantra\). Then a triple *nyāsa* of fifty phonemes by encasing \(*saṃpuṭa*\) each one of them successively between one of the three monosyllables \(e.g. *aiṃ aṃ aiṃ, klīṃ aṃ klīṃ* etc.\).

12.*navayoninyāsa*: nine placings of *aiṃ, klīṃ* and *sauḥ* on the body.

13.*Rityādinyāsa*: ‘*aiṃ rityai namaḥ* on the *mūlādhāra, klīṃ rityai namaḥ* on the heart and *sauḥ mano bhavayai namaḥ* between the eyebrows, such is the *nyāsa*’.

14.*amṛteśvaryādinyāsa: sauḥ amṛteśvaryai namaḥ* between the eyebrows, *klīṃ yogeśvaryai namaḥ* on the heart and *aiṃ viśvayonyai namaḥ* on the *mūlādhāra*.

15.*mūrtinyāsa*: placing on the head, mouth, heart, genitals and feet of the five *brahma*- or *mūrti-mantras:shrauḥ īśanāyamanobhavāyanamaḥ, shreṃ tatpuruṣāya makaradhvapāya namaḥ, shrīṃ shrum aghorāya kandapāryāya namaḥ shrīoṃ vāmadevāya manmathāya namaḥ and shrīoṃ sadyojātāya kāmadevāya namaḥ*

16.*cakranyāsa*: same placing of the five mantras *īśāna* to *sadyojāta* on the five faces \(*pañcavaktāni*\) of, probably, a *liṅga*.

17.\[*nyāsa* given as uncertain: *mūlamantraṣaḋaṅganyāsa: aṃ klīṃ sauḥ*, two times on the heart, tuft etc.\].

18.*bāṇanyāsa*: five placings on the head, neck, face, genitals and heart: *draṃ dravaṇabhānāya namaḥ, driṃ kṣobhanabāṇāya namāh, klīṃ vaśīkaraṇabāṇāya namaḥ, blūṃ ākarśaṇabāṇāya namaḥ* and *saḥ sammohanabāṇāya namaḥ*.

19.*devatānyāsa*: eightfold placing with the *bījas aiṃ, klīṃ, blūṃ, strīṃ* of eight female divinities \(Subhaga, Bhagā, Bhagamālinī, etc.\) on different points of the head, heart, navel and *mūlādhāra*.

20.*pīṭhanyāsa*: placings on different points of the body of entities forming the seat or base \(*pīṭha*\) of the divinity. Then *dhyāna* of Bālātripurasundarī, which completes and ends the whole series of *nyāsas*.


It would have been useful to complete this exposition, which rests on Hindu examples only, with an examination of *nyāsas* such as those practised in Jainism and Buddhism. We have already quoted several examples of practices similar for Hindus, Jains or Buddhists, but it would be interesting to do more and notably to mark in what ways the two last traditions, especially the Buddhist, differ from the first. I have, however, not been able to gather enough documentation to enable me, as for Hinduism, to give a kind of general outline of usual uses in the Jain of Buddhist milieus. What would be especially worth examining are the practices \(along with the discourses that accompany them\), rather than the general problem of the *nyāsa* which, it seems to me, is in many regards the same – *mutatis mutandis* – in all traditions: it is always a matter of making the body or an object sacred by the placing of entities which carry a divine or spiritual force. But this not a topic I can enter into now.

Limited thus to Hinduism, this brief examination of *nyāsa* will, I hope, contribute to show the importance of this ritual practice in the Tantric or ‘tantricised’ forms of the Hindu religion. In the developed and organised form we have described \(and which is still used in India\), the practice is perhaps comparatively recent. But it is very likely that its origin goes back to an ancient past, and, above all, that it is founded on an ancient way of conceiving, apprehending and ‘living’ the body in religion and asceticism. India, indeed, has always invested the religious and the cosmic in the body. It is the place where the sacred geography, the levels and structure of the cosmos, the gods \(‘like cows in a cattle shed’\) are reflected and incarnated, where is played out again on a human scale – but in connection with the divine – the cosmic process of creation, manifestation and resorption. The role and raison d’être of the *nyāsa* is precisely to actualize the cosmic potentialities of the body, to structure it in cosmic correspondences or equipollences, an actualization that is the very goal aimed at by the rites and the religious or spiritual practices. Hence the importance of *nyāsa* as one of the essential components of the practice of the Indian religious man who seeks release not only in spirit but ‘in this life and this body.’



## 5 A Hindu rosary ritual
**1**



\(*Jayākhyasaṃhitā*, chapter 14\)





The use of a rosary or string of beads \(*akṣamālā, akṣasūtra*\) as a means for keeping count of a repeated incantation or prayer is very usual in Hinduism as well as in Buddhism. Most of the texts concerning the ritual recitation of a mantra, *japa*, that is – be they purāṇas, tantras or manuals of ritual – include passages on how to use a rosary, and how to assemble or to dispose of it. As is to be expected, such instructions are specially numerous and detailed in Tantric works.

One such text is the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(JS\) of the Vaiṣṇava Pāñcarātra, which is one of the ‘Three Jewels’, *ratnatraya* \(with the *Pauṣkāra*- and the *Sātvata-saṃhitā*\), of the Pāñcarātra: one of the most authoritative of such works. The JS is also one of the earliest samhitās since some of its passages are quoted by Utpalavaiṣṇava, in Kashmir, in the tenth century. As far as one can know or imagine, it originates, if not from Kashmir, at least most probably from the north-western part of India. Like all Pāñcarātra saṃhitās, it deals with a great variety of topics, several of its chapters concerning mantras: chapter 11 is on *mantranyāsa*, 14 on *japa*, 19 on the signs showing the mastery over mantras, chapters 26 to 29 on the rites to be performed after initiation by the initiate so as to master and make use of the mantra he has received \(*mantrasādhana*\). The ninety-five *ślokas* of chapter 14 are on *japa*, the ritual recitation of mantras \(*japavidhānam*\). Of these we shall leave aside those concerning such common rules as, for instance, the three sorts of *japa*, or the times and places when and where to perform it, and concentrate on the *ślokas* dealing with the rosary itself, insisting especially on such prescriptions as appear to be proper to this saṃhitā. As we shall see, these prescriptions bring together, in a very typically Indian Tantric way, ritual rules, yoga practices and metaphysical notions.

The chapter begins \(*śl*. 5b-27\) by saying how to prepare and put together a rosary: how to make the string, how to chose and assemble the beads. This is to be done by the user of the rosary \(who is in principle an initiate2\). It is not a mere technical operation, but a ritual process implicating personally the owner-user of this object. It is the initial, inaugurating, portion of the *japa*. The point in this case is not merely to acquire a ritual object for religious use, but to create and fashion it with reference to the use it will be put to, both as an object made up of certain materials and, more importantly, as an instrument charged with divine power, an image as it were of the deity whose *japa* the user will accomplish with it and which will thus help him to gain the fruits he is looking for.3

The beads of the rosary \(which the JS calls *maṇi*, jewels, even when they are made of some ordinary material\) are first, as is always the case in such texts, classified as being of three sorts: superior, middling and inferior. A classification, of a general order it seems, distinguishes between three sorts of vegetal seeds \(*śl*. 5–6\), the best being *akṣa* \(*rudrākṣa*, that is\), the middling ones are made of myrobalan fruits, *dhātrī*, the less good are jujube stones \(*badara*\).4 Another distinction is made by reference to the uses the rosary will be put to, in which case one distinguishes between different metals: gold to obtain riches, prosperity or beauty; copper for power of thought or sovereignty; lead or brass if to master several sorts of beings or demons, or to operate in hells. The lowest sort of rosary is made of iron. It is to be used for so-called inferior or bad rites \(*kṣudrakarmāṇi*\), that is, black magic, or sorcery. We may note that liberation \(*mokṣa*\) is not mentioned here among the aims of *japa*. It is quoted further on \(*śl*. 13–46\) in connection with the material of the beads: those in precious stones and of coral give long life, health, riches, happiness \(and can be used in all rites\); those made of crystal give liberation – which is therefore not associated with the most precious material. Crystal, however, usually symbolises the clarity of a pure being or that of a peaceful mind. Here as in many other cases in Tantra \(see note 2\) liberation appears as being not quite on the same level as the other, interested, aims that an adept may pursue – a fact that is not entirely surprising insofar as the normal addressee of a tantra is a *sādhaka*, that is, a *bhubukṣu*, not a *mumukṣu*.5

The JS does not merely mention the different sorts of beads \(a matter on which other texts are more explicit\). It describes how the rosary is to be ritually put together, then the rites which make it ready for use and cause the user to become apt and worthy to use it fruitfully.

The beads must all be of the same sort and the same size. They must first be washed free of all impurity \(*kṣalayet*\) with scented water and the Astra mantra, *OṂ HAḤ Astrāya PHAṬ*., the mantra having as much \(or even more than\) a purifying effect as water.6 The string \(*sūtra*\) is made by carefully twisting together three cotton or hemp threads, and it is then ‘washed’ in the same way as the beads \(*śl*. 19b-20\). All the constitutive parts of the rosary are thus submitted to the purifying action of water and of mantras.

The beads once threaded \(not freely, but following strict rules\), the two ends of the string are knotted together an additional bead being included in the knot. This is a very important point, for this bead, called Meru – thus evoking Mount Meru, the *axis mundi –* marks the limit of all recitations of the rosary, being thus both its two extreme and its central point. The recitation abuts \(being then briefly interrupted\) against this bead which must never be overstepped \(see *infra*. p. 86\).

The rosary thus constituted must be anointed with sandal paste, placed in a pure vessel and honoured with ‘flowers, incense, and so forth’, then a purification \(*śuddhi*\) is to be performed: ‘One must conceive it as being burned by the Astra\[mantra\], fanned by the Varma\[mantra\], then bathed by the *mūlamantra* as made of supreme ambrosia.’7 Here too the ritual operations are deemed to be effected by mantras: mantras are the main element of Tantric Hindu ritual, which is a universe where one ‘does things with words’ \(to use J.L. Austin’s phrase\). ‘The rosary once thus purified’, the JS adds, ‘it is to be conceived as a body’ \(*śaṃśodhyaivaṃ purā sūtraṃ dehavac cintayet tataḥ – śl*. 30a\). This is to say that the adept must imagine \(*smaret*\) it as ‘having four arms, being free from impurities, beyond compare like Nārāyaṇa, one hand making the gesture of granting wishes, the other that of fearlessness, \[the two other hands\] being joined in salutation’; after which the adept is to imagine this rosary as being ‘like a flame on the door of Brahmā \(that is, on the top of the head\) of this \[divine body\]’.8

The JS then discloses the mantra of the rosary \(*akṣasūtramantra*\), which is not the mantra to be recited with the help of the rosary but the mantra *of* the rosary, the formula which embodies its essence and is used to worship it. The process here is indeed the same as that of the mental worship of a deity, whose aspect is to be imagined by the worshipper, who has a mantra, and is invoked, made present in the cult icon and then ritually worshipped: these successive parts of the Tantric *pūjā* we shall see here being acted out for the rosary.9

*Śl*. 32b-34a give the *uddhāra*,10 the extraction, the word content, that is, of the *akṣasūtramantra*, which runs: *OṂ kaustubha trailokeśvaryada gopanākṣasūtrāya- namaḥ*, a formula in praise of the rosary, seen as a divine jewel \(*kaustubha*\), which protects and gives sovereignty over the three worlds.11 The rosary being considered as a deity has anthropomorphic features, hence the ritual process of *sakalīkaraṇa* now prescribed, which consists in placing on the different parts of the rosary’s ‘body’ and ‘hands’ ancillary mantras of the main mantra representing its different ‘parts’ \(its *aṅgas*: *hr̥daya, śiras, śikha, varman, netra* and *astra*12\), its powers, that is. Then a *pūjā* is to be performed: a brief worship, apparently, immediately followed by another, mental, worship, which is a complex yogico-spiritual practice where the mentally produced image of the divine power present in the rosary is to be seen and felt by the officiating adept as present in his body, as illuminating the place where he stays, and is finally imagined as being transferred from the adept to the rosary, all this being produced by that particular form of intense identifying mental concentration called *bhāvanā*.13 The passage is as follows:


This supreme Power of Viṣṇu, inseparable from the supreme Self, shining like the full moon moving in the sky, surrounded like the sun by rays, increased in power by the energy of the fire that destroys the cosmic cycles, must be invoked as before together with the inspired breath \(*pūrakena*\) in the order of emanation14 as situated in the lotus of the heart. Then, the breath being held \(*kumbhakena*\), O Best of Brahmins, it is to be kept \[there\]. One must then invoke her, staying in the lotus of the heart as before, as \[going\] upwards up to the *brahmarandhra*, whence, progressively, by the central channel, she will reach the *dvādaśānta*, this being done whilst breathing out \(*recakena yogena*\). The rosary is to be meditated with this \[Power\].15


The adept is now to imagine ‘the place of the sacrifice \[that is, the place where he practises the *japa*\] as illuminated by the rosary as the sky by the full moon’. This imaginary vision is to be pursued as follows:


He must then think that the King of mantras \[which is probably Visṇu’s *mūlamantra OṂ KṢĪṂ KṢĪḤ namaḥ nārāyaṇāya viṣvātmane HRĪṂ svāhā*\], which is partless \(*niṣkalā*\) though inseparable from all the \[other\] mantras, as being immersed in this \[rosary\], and meditate the Power of the Lord whose nature is the same as that of the mantra, as well as the phonemes of the mantra of the rosary as identical with it, for they are \[inseparably mixed up\] like water and milk. Then, taking hold of the rosary by its ‘back’16 with his two hands joined and holding flowers \(*puṣpāñjalau*\), the twice born17 must imagine that the \[*mūla*\]*mantra* – which is both one and made up of its constituent parts \(*sakalaniṣkala*\) – falls, following the same process as the creation of the cosmos \(*sr̥ṣṭikrameṇa*\), on the ‘back’ of the rosary made perfect \(*susaṃskr̥ta*\) \[by the preceding rites\], and that, reaching it, \[the mantra\] on the rosary will loose its strength like a shower of sparks \[flying from a fire\].18


This mental visualisation where Viṣṇu’s energy, which is mantra \(*mantrātmā*\) in the sense both of the basic mantra \(*mūlamantra*\) of the deity and of the original Word \(source and essence of all mantras, therefore both one and infinitely diverse\) is imagined falling like a shower of sparks on the rosary so as, as it were, to pervade it with its power and reinforce the ‘mantrisation’ of the rosary, identifying it with the Word, the Energy \(*śakti*\) of Viṣṇu. The adept is now to address the God, saying: ‘O Acyuta\! \[You who are here\] in the shape of the rosary, give \[it\] to me.’ He imagines thus that the rosary is given to him by Acyuta so as to perform the *japa* of the mantra. He takes it again by its ‘head’, saying ‘Be me favourable’.19 The adept is thus deemed to have received from the deity the rosary he has in fact made up himself, but which, being henceforth pervaded by mantras and by the energy of the deity, is an image, an aspect or form of that deity. For a *bhākta*, a true devotee, everything he receives comes from his god.

The deity, however, has until now only been invoked, which is necessary but not sufficient. It is also necessary that, being present, Viṣṇu/Acyuta should also be favourably inclined towards his devotee and therefore ready to listen to him and answer his prayer. The preliminary rites of the Tantric *pūjā* \(*āvahana, sthāpana*, etc.\) are now to be performed. That such rites should now to be performed is quite normal since the rosary is treated as an icon.

The JS says:


The rosary having been received, it must be installed. Then, having worshipped it with the water from the *arghyapātra*, with flowers and with incense, one must place on it \[the mantra\] with all it contains and all that accompanies it, \[considering it as\] surrounded by all the powers, \[and saying\] ‘O Acyuta\! Master of all gods\! Be thou present and remain in this ensemble of beads named rosary until moon and sun pass away.20


The adept is now to show the so-called gesture of the rosary \(*akṣasūtramudrā*\) which consists in touching with the thumb, in a particular order, the phalanxes of the right hand. This *mudrā*, which is in fact the gesture by which one usually keeps count of the recited *japa* formula – the so-called *karamālā*, ‘hand-rosary’ – can be seen as a kind of outward, visible, confirmation of the ritual process just performed. The JS underlines the significance of this gesture by saying that this *mudrā* is *nityasannidhikāriṇī*: making the deity constantly present. *Sannidhi* or *sannidhāna* is, as we have seen, one of the four rites always associated with the creation of a cult icon – which is precisely the case of the rosary.

‘Then, one must begin the *japa*, which must not be seen by other people’ \(*japaṃ samārabhet paścād adr̥ṣya itarair janaiḥ*\), says JS *śl*. 52a. The JS, however, does not immediately start describing the *japa*. Two other mental acts are to take place first. One consists of concentrating one’s attention \(*anusamdhāna*\) on the five states of consciousness \(*avasthā*\). The other is an intense identifying meditation \(*bhāvanā*\) of the mantra, felt as present in the adept as well as in the rosary. The aim of these two actions is to give to the *japa* a deeper significance and intent: not merely that of a devotional concentration on the deity, but, more intensely, that of an intuitive intellectual apprehension of the meaning and import of the speech act of the *japa* in an universe born from the divine Consciousness whose highest plane is *vāc*, the Word, and which is entirely pervaded by *vāc*. There is a correspondence between the five planes of individual consciousness \(*avasthā*\) \(from waking \(*jāgrat*\) to the fifth plane \(*turyātīta*\), the plane of fusion in the absolute\), the five levels of cosmic consciousness and the levels or planes of the Word. Grasping the essence of the mantra to be recited in *japa* is thus grasping the transcendent and immanent deity of which the mantra is the *vācaka*: this occurs on the fifth and supreme level which pervades and sustains the four others. Below is this passage of the JS:


One must first realise by meditation \(*bhāvayet*\) that the senses, the word and the mind are caused to be by Viṣṇu, the supreme Self, in the form of energy \(*śaktirūpeṇa*\), through mantra \(*mantreṇa*\). What is in thought, where the object is present, goes to speech, consciousness being thus associated with the object, speech coming third, O Narada\! This evolutionary process reaches progressively the plane of action. This is how the mantra evolves \(*vivartate*\) progressively from the fourth plane of consciousness \(*turya*\) to that of waking \(*jāgrat*21\), after which, O Brahmin\! it goes through the same stages in the reverse order. The nature \(*svarūpa*\) of the senses is that of *vāc* whose nature is that of consciousness \(*cidrūpiṇī*\). What is thought \(*citta*\) becomes mantra, which becomes the Unborn, Hari. This supreme Brahman is omnipresent \(*vyāpaka*\) and the *śakti* is that of Nārāyaṇa. She indeed, by transforming herself \(*pariṇamena*\), reaches the plane called fourth \(*turya*\), which becomes deep sleep \(*suṣupti*\), which becomes dream \(*svapna*\), which becomes waking \(*jāgrat*\), which in turn will be the first of the four planes. \[All these planes\] must be mentally evoked \(*smaret*\)22 \[from *jāgrat*\] up to the \[plane of\] the energy of the Lord as being all together and forming one whole. O Brahmin\! all that one sees in this world, ephemeral \[variegated but unsubstantial\], like a painting, this external phenomenal field, is what is called waking. The \[equally\] ephemeral but always superior to the preceding one, transitory, like a dream, is the state of dream which is the cause of \[the state of\] waking. Know that the perfectly peaceful state of deep sleep is superior to that of dream. To attain the energy form of Viṣṇu is to enter the fourth state. When one identifies oneself with this, this is called the state beyond the fourth \(*turyātītam*\). One must thus realise with one-pointed attention \(*anusaṃ dhayet*\) that the supreme mantra which is above all mantras and that the two \[conditions\] subtle and gross, as well as the fifth state, of the *ātman*, are but one. This one-pointed attention once attained, the *japa* is then to begin.23


Then a *bhāvanā* is to take place through which the adept, thanks to the intensity of his mental effort, identifies himself with the images he causes to appear and perceives mentally as present in his body:


The supreme Lord, resplendent, of crystal purity, abiding in the centre of the lotus of the heart, shines forth by his own luminous power \(*svatejasā*\). His great Energy made of sound \(*śabdamayīśakti*\) flows like fire, and the pure succession of the phonemes which is hers and of the same nature as Her comes forth engendering the mantras. From Her is born the King of mantras, sprouting out of Her like the flower of a creeper, O Best of Munis\! This is how one must realise \(*smaret*\) how the mantra appears in the rosary. Then, it must be dissolved again in the heart. Such is \[the *bhāvanā*\] of the only Lord of the mantra appearing inside and outside.24


This meditative practice strengthens the link between the adept and the deity he will worship whilst reciting his rosary since he experiments visually the deity and its mantra as present in his heart, from where he instils them in the rosary and then takes them back into himself. This process is parallel to that of the ritual worship \(*pūjā*\) of a deity performed with an icon \(*mūrti, bimba*\) where the deity is first to be imagined and felt as present in the heart of the officiating person, who will transfer it mentally, with the proper rites, into the cult icon or on a maṇḋala, which, vitalised, animated by the divine presence thus instilled in it, will be ready to be used for the ritual worship25 at the end of which the officiant will take back the deity into himself. Such a practice has the effect of bringing about an intensely experienced participation of the officiating person in the rite he performs. The JS underlines the union thus brought about between the reciter of the mantra and the deity: it is in a state of mental union or identification with Viṣṇu that the beads are to be told one after the other: *viṣṇuvad yogam āsr̥tya akṣam akṣaṃ samāharet* \(*śl*. 71b\).

The *japa* itself can now be performed. It consists of 100,000 repetitions of the mantra \(*śl*. 69\) – which implies that it lasts several days, or weeks. The beads are to be counted carefully \(*prayatnāt*\), for it is by concentrating on this action that the prescribed aim of union with Viṣṇu is attained. Each repetition of the mantra, on each bead, is to be done together with the movement of the breath \(*prāṇodayenaiva*\). An important point, too, is that the count of the beads should not overstep the central ‘Meru’ bead: one must go round it \(*pradakṣiṇaṃ kuryāt*\) because this bead is the ‘body’ \(*mūrti*\) of the formless mantra \(*niṣkalasya mantrasya*\) – it is ‘the bead-form of the pure omnipresent supreme Soul’.26 A different aspect of the ritual performance of the *japa* is then mentioned: the JS, *śl*. 76b–78a, says now that the adept is to have different imaginary perceptions of his rosary according to the different results aimed at when he performs the *japa*. If the *japa* is made to appease \(*śāntika*\), the rosary is to be imagined as translucent like a pure crystal; if the aim is to gain riches \(*pauṣṭika*\), it is imagined as yellow; if to dominate others \(*vaśya*\), it is to be seen as red like the kiṃśuka flower; for attracting others \(*ākarṣaṇa*\) it will be orange like the *nr̥paśaila*; black in the case of *māraṇa*, that is to kill or destroy; blue like the wing of a jay when practised for causing discord \(*vidveśa*\); and dark grey when used for driving away \(*uccāṭana*\). These actions for which a *japa* can be performed are a variant of the group of magical acts described in many tantras as the ‘six acts’ \(*ṣaṭkarmāṇi*\) of magic, their number being usually six. They are among the usual aims of the so-called optional, *kāmya*, rites, that is, rites undertaken for the attainment of some benefit.27 The JS, 78b-84, then goes on to mention other such acts. It says first that there are two sorts of *japa*: one luminous \(*jyotirmaya*\), which is inferior \(*apara*\), and the other made of word or sound \(*śabdākhya*, lit. ‘called word’\) which is superior \(*para*\). The first one is used for such magical aims as entering in another body \(*paradehapraveśa*\) or succeeding in doing other ‘cruel’ ritual acts \(*krūrakarmāṇi*\); for this the pure sound of the recited mantra is to be imagined as dissolved in light, this being done also to gain rewards or liberation \(*bhuktimukti*\) and to destroy defects and suffering. The other form of *japa*, said to be ‘with sound’ \(*saśabda*\), is used for the appeasing rites \(*śāntau*\), and to succeed in all one does, to obtain happiness and pleasure as well as for such actions as kindling the ritual fire \(*ādhāna*\), etc. ‘It is to be mentally perceived as Janārdhana shining like drops of water in the night. One must imagine that with one’s mantra the eternally manifest sound issues without any \[articulation\] effort from the lotus of the heart … The mantra thus recited gives all desired fruits.’28

One may well find it surprising that the first uses quoted here of *japa*, usually considered a devotional action, preceded and accompanied here by ritual and meditative practices which place it on a high and subtle metaphysical–religious plane, should be acts of magic, of black magic even – magical powers being mentioned before liberation. But Tantric texts, whether Vaiṣṇava or Śaiva, are meant first, as mentioned before \(note 2\), for the initiated adept, the *sādhaka*, who is a *bubhukṣu*, looking for rewards \(*bhukti*\) or powers \(*siddhi*\) to be obtained by mastering a mantra, not a *mumukṣu*, looking for liberation \(*mokṣa*\).

The JS 84ff. goes on to say that the mantra is to be recited whilst being carefully intent on the wished for end. This must be done going regularly from syllable to syllable, without any fault, neither too fast nor too slow, clearly uttering all words, with a concentrated mind intent on the highest thought \(*atyutkr̥rṣṭadhiyā*\). The *japa*, it is also said, is to be performed in the morning, at midday and in the evening, that is, at the usual times of the daily obligatory \(*nitya*\) cult.

Finally, the JS \(90–95b\) describes how the adept is to replace the string of the rosary when it is worn out. This is to be done according to precise ritual rules, for the rosary having been divinised, as we have seen, cannot be disposed of by simply throwing it or storing it away. Thus:


having cut the string at its ‘point of junction’ \[that is, where the knot which holds the rosary is\] whilst uttering the *visarjana* \(dismissal\) mantra,29 accompanied by the appropriate mudrā, O Narada\! then having made a new string and having consecrated it as said \[before\], one is to place on it the grains as is proper. Having knotted it, the mantrin is to bathe it according to rule, then to impose on it \[the mantra and so forth. This is to be done\] for fear that the string of the first rosary breaks. A cult is therefore to be performed, then an offering in the fire \(*homa*\), for \[the breaking of the string\] causes the destruction of the \[good\] *karman*. Having taken hold of the old string, he must divide its three constitutive threads, and, having knotted them around a stone he must throw it in deep water uttering Viṣvakṣeṇa’s30 mantra, and, having made an offering, he is to invoke Hari whilst \[reciting\] seven times the *mūlamantra*, O Best of Brahmins\! with a fully concentrated mind.31


It thus appears that from the time one assembles the constituent parts of the rosary to the time one disposes of them, the rosary is the constant object of complex ritual actions. This is because, for its user, who for such texts as the JS is a *sādhaka*, the *akṣamālā* is less an instrument of devotion than a means to put into action the power of the Word and use it for specific ends. Such ends can be reached only through a thorough and minutely organised ‘mise en scène’ with an intense bodily and mental participation of the *mantrin* in the ritual process. The mere devotional use of the rosary does of course also exist, and that especially in the Pāñcarātra Vaiṣṇava context, and in such cases all ritual is transcended. But this devotional use does not interest the text we have seen, which, on the contrary, shows a characteristic case of the ritual proliferation typical of Tantric Hinduism.



## 6 Mantradoṣa and mantrasaṃskāra

On the defects and the perfecting of mantras
**1**





As we have seen, Tantric mantras are the phonic form of deities – deities as mantras or mantras as deities. They are in this respect divine entities existing eternally as aspects of the supreme Word \(*vāc*\), or at least existing on a pure, perfect level of speech, free of all imperfections. But they are also conceived as limited entities, either as ‘souls’ \(*aṇu*\), of different degrees of perfection, or as spiritual powers existing on different levels of the cosmos. Finally, in ritual practice, they are empirically existing forms of phonic utterance: they are quoted in ritual manuals, ritually, often audibly, uttered and heard, sometimes even written, partaking thus of the imperfection of the created world.2 This explains why they can suffer from flaws or defects, *doṣas*, of which they must be freed so as to recover their pristine perfection and be able to be perfectly effective \(or harmless for their user\). Hence the existence of such ritual practices as *mantraśuddhi* and *mantrasaṃskāra.*

We may note in passing that, whether pristine or retrieved, the divine, transcendent nature of mantras is always present in practice on the empirical, human plane, since mantras are to be used in this world as empirically uttered formulas of a divine nature. They would be powerless if they were not divine: the immaterial absolute essence and the physically uttered sound are thus brought together in action: the nature of mantras is contradictory, paradoxical, even.3



### Mantradoṣa

A number of Tantric works deal with *mantradoṣas.* I shall refer here to a few of them only, mostly from the Śaiva traditions. The longest list of *doṣas* I know of is that of the *Kulārṇavatantra* \(KT\), one of the main Kaula tantras \(dated *c*. eleventh to fourteenth century\). The KT 15.65–69 quotes sixty *doṣas.* The eleventh-century *Śāradātilaka* \(ŚT\), of Lakṣmaṇadeśika, one of the most important digests of *mantraśāstra*, enumerates \(2.64–110\) then describes fifty such defects, its descriptions being expatiated upon in Rāghavabhaṭṭa’s commentary, where other works are quoted – notably the *Piṅgalāmata*, an important ancient Yāmalatantra, and the *Mantramuktāvali*, a voluminous, more recent, work.4 The *Tantrarājatantra* \(TRT\), a Śrīvidyā work \(1.75–48 or 1.73–815\), mentions twenty-five *doṣas*, the *Kaulāvalīnirṇaya* \(7.10–12\) a dozen. The earliest \(eighth century\) of these texts, the *Netratantra* \(NT\), in a passage on the efficacy of the *netramantra* \(8.59–63\), quotes nine *doṣas* as instances of such defects as can be cured by a particular use of that mantra. Many other works mention *mantradoṣas* without expatiating on the subject: the *Gandharvatantra* \(GT\), chapter 9, for instance, the *Somaśambhupaddhati* \(SP\), the *Īśanaśivaguudevapaddhati* \(ĪŚGP\), Appayadīkṣita’s *Śivārcanacandrikā*, and so forth.

The lists of *mantradoṣas* I have seen do not appear to enumerate them according to any logical order, nor do these listings follow the same order: they look like random collections. If one compares the two longest lists, those of the KT \(sixty *doṣas*\) and of the ŚT \(fifty\), only twenty *doṣas* are quoted in both texts and ten only are among the twenty-five ones of the TRT. This results in a total of nearly a hundred: a rather large number. The *doṣas* enumerated are not always clearly described. The ŚT \(2.72–110\) describes all the *doṣas* \(with Rāghavabhaṭṭa’s added comments\). Kṣemarāja’s *Uddyota* on NT 8.59–63\) gives some explanations and so does, too, briefly, Prāṇamañjarī on TRT. If the names of some *doṣas* are self-explanatory, others are not, having sometimes apparently little or nothing to do with their actual nature.

The *doṣas* enumerated in the ŚT 2.64–110 are all described as being of a purely linguistic nature, that is, as resulting either from the presence of particular letters or *bījas* or from the fact that these letters or *bījas* occur in certain portions of the mantra, or else because the mantra has a particular, inauspicious, number of syllables. Thus, if we look at this list, we find that a mantra of one syllable \(*akṣara*\) is *niraṃśa*;6 one of two letters is *sattvahīna*, devoid of essence or reality; a mantra of four *varṇas* is *kekara* \(squint-eyed\); one with two *bhūbījas* \(including twice the *bīja LAṂ* of the earth, that is\) is *ruddha*, ‘obstructed’, bringing neither *bhukti* nor *mukti.* A mantra of three letters and without *haṃsa* \(*HAṂ*\) is said to be in deep sleep \(*suṣupta*\) and therefore ineffective;7 and so forth. One may well ask why defects considered as resulting from purely phonetic traits should often be called by names evoking human bodily or mental traits \(squint-eyed, sluggish, frightened, and so forth\). This may be nothing else than a picturesque way of expressing the alleged inability of such mantras to effect properly what they are supposed to do. The verbal identification of mantras with human beings, however, is perhaps not entirely whimsical: it may reflect somehow the conception of mantras as particular types of beings, as individual souls \(*aṇu*\), which is indeed how they are conceived of in the Shaivasiddhānta, which is also consonant with the Śaiva system of the seven categories of experiencers \(*pramātr̥*\), one of which is that of mantras.

The fact that negative effects on the efficacy of mantras should be attached to certain traits of their phonetic pattern should not surprise us, for mantras are utterances whose power is grounded in their phonetic substance, in their form, which is therefore essential. As is well known, the phonetic content and pattern of mantras is far more important that their meaning – supposing they have a meaning, which is often not the case. This has been mentioned before.8 But mantras are also never spontaneous, improvised utterances. They are conventional rule-governed utterances transmitted by tradition. They are the essential, phonic, form of deities \(expounded, for the adept in *dhyānaślokas*\), or words of power transmitted by the ritual process of *uddhāra*, their phonetic content being always carefully described in ritual texts so as to ensure their faultless transmission, their original perfection. How then can such imperfections as those listed in the ŚT or other such works happen? Also, why should some syllable or word order be deemed faulty when such a large number of very different mantras exist? To the outside observer, this looks very arbitrary – which it probably largely is. A possible explanation could be that patterns listed as faulty are phonetic patterns that should not result from the rules of *mantroddhāra* laid down by a particular tradition and which would appear if these rules were not followed. It is also possible that these lists are in fact meant to exclude phonic patterns proper to other traditions. The lists of *doṣas* may also prove useful in such mantric practices as *vidarbha, pallava, grathana*,9 etc. where the transpositions, interpolations, etc. of the syllables or words of a mantra can result in one of the forbidden patterns. The question, however, remains as to why a number of patterns that do not look *prima facie* abnormal should be set apart, being considered as faulty or inefficacious.

There are, however, other *doṣas* which \(more reasonably, we would be tempted to say\) result from the way in which a mantra is transmitted, uttered, or made use of. Such is the case of several of the twenty-five *doṣas* listed in the TRT \(1.75–80\). Thus a mantra which has been heard by a third person is ‘burnt’ \(*dagdha*\), it is *trasta* \(frightened\) when not recited the prescribed number of times, *garvita* \(haughty\) when not transmitted according to the rules, *chinna* or *khaṇḋita* \(cut or torn\) when incomplete, *hīnavīrya* \(without force\) when given by a master who does not possess the *adhikāra*, the authority to transmit it, and so forth. The TRT also mentions the case of mantras not used at the proper time, not recited as they should be \(they are *rugna*, destroyed\) when not uttered clearly, *kliṣṭa* \(in bad condition\) when recited too slowly, *avamanita* \(despised\) when recited without paying attention or without faith, etc.\). The imperfections in those cases lie more with the user than with the mantra, but they are nevertheless classified as *mantradoṣas*, defects to be carefully avoided since mantras are rule-governed utterances and are therefore effective only insofar as these rules are carefully respected.

*Mantradoṣas* can also result from the fact that they are uttered in cases when they are not to be mentally formulated. The mantra then issues from the mouth of the mantrin, hence, for some texts, the existence of *doṣas* due to the contact of the mantra with the organs of speech. One finds this sort of *doṣa* in various texts, in the *Śivārcaṇacandrikā*10 for instance, or in a passage of Aghoraśiva’s commentary on ŚP 1.3,43 \(vol. 1, p. 145\) where he quotes an unidentified text which runs: *dantādhāroṣṭṭasaṃcare mantrasyāśaucanirhanāt/nādāntoccāreṇaivamantraśuddhir udāhr̥tā*, mentioning thus both cause of impurity and its cure. There is also the TRT 1.80 which says that mantras suffer from a *doṣa* when the teeth of the mantrin are not clean …

Among the *doṣas* quoted in various texts there is also the case where a mantra is said to be asleep \(*supta, susupta, prasupta, svāpaga*\). According to the ŚT \(2.84\), for instance, a mantra is *susupta* when it has three *varṇas* and no *haṃsa*, this being apparently a defective phonetic pattern. For other texts, a *supta or svāpaga *mantra is one used when it is ‘asleep’ or not ‘awakened’ at the proper time. This we find, for instance, in the TRT 1.77. Other texts, however, do not consider the *supta* \(or *svāpaga*, etc.\) state of the mantra as a *doṣa*, but as a state in which a nondefective mantra happens to be during certain periods of time, as are human beings, or because of a particular movement of *prāṇa. Supta* in this case, is taken as opposed to *prabuddha*:11 it is not a case of *doṣa.*

The KT 15.57–63, as mentioned previously, enumerates sixty *dosas.* It begins, however, by mentioning some preliminary conditions for a mantra to be effective. The first is that it should not suffer from the impurity of birth at its beginning or of death at its end, which would occur, it seems, if it were not to begin and end with *OṂ.* The ignorance of its aim \(*artha*\) or of its ‘consciousness’ \(*caitanya*\) – by which is meant, we may assume, the lack of consciousness of the mantrin – would rob the mantra of all efficiency; as would also the ignorance of the *yonimudrā*. Some other preliminary conditions are also mentioned. The same defect, with the same sort of *śuddhi*, is also to be found in the GT. The *doṣas* listed there \(65–69\) are only partly the same as those of the ŚT, and include such traits as *ripu* usually considered not as a *mantradoṣa* but as a bad *aṃśa.*

We may note, finally, on the problem of the faultless state of mantras, that though they must be pure to be effective, they must also, according to some, not avoid, but on the contrary bear necessarily a particular form of impurity, the *aiśvaryamala*, the impurity connected with power, which exists even in the purest beings insofar as they act. In the system of the seven *pramātr̥*, this impurity as well as the ‘impurity of authority’ \(*adhikāramala*\), permitting an activity, is considered to be present in mantras since they are considered as a category of conscious subjects \(*pramātr̥*\), and this gives them the capacity to act in this impure world.

The general rule is, however, that mantras must be without defects or impurity so as to be effective. We shall therefore see now how this necessary purity is given or restored to them.



### Mantraśuddhi mantrasaṃskāra

A mantra is to be made free of all defects so as not only to be more effective but also to protect its user from the dire effects which could result from a flawed formula. This is done through a ritual practice usually called *mantraśuddhi* or *mantraśodhana* \(purification of the mantra\), which is mentioned or described in several texts. Of these the older and more authoritative ones \(among those I have access to\) are the NT \(with Kṣemarāja’s commentary\), which enumerates nine *saṃskāras*, and the ŚT, listing ten. Kṣemarāja quotes the *Ucchuṣmatantra*12 \(recording seven *saṃskāras* only\); whilst Rāghavabhaṭṭa’s commentary on the ŚT cites abundantly the ancient *yāmalatantra Piṅgalamata. Mantrasaṃskāras* are also enumerated in more recent works such as Kr̥ṣṇānanda’s *Tantrasāra* \(sixteenth century\), which is quoted in the TBhS \(seventeenth century\). The practice has not disappeared: the texts quoted here are, I believe, still made use of in India by practitioners of mantras.

We will limit ourselves to quoting and comparing the *mantrasaṃskārās* of the NT and the ŚT which, interestingly, are practically the same in name and aim whilst having to be performed in completely different ways. The nine NT \(18.6–8\) *saṃskāras* are: *dīpana, bodhana, tāḋana, abhiṣecana, vimalīkaraṇa, indhananiveśana, saṃtarpaṇa, guptibhāva* and *āpyāyana*, that is illuminating, awakening, thrumming, sprinkling, purifying, using as fuel, satiating, hiding and strengthening. ‘Thanks to these nine *saṃskāras*’, says the NT \(18.8\), ‘one who masters the science of the mantras \(*mantravāda*\) will be master of the efficiency of the mantras.’ According to Ksemarāja’s commentary \(and to the *Ucchuṣmatantra*\), most of these *saṃskāras* are simply linguistic devices, consisting as they do in adding before the mantra and/or at its end such elements as *OṂ*, or as one of the *jātis* \(the ritual exclamations at the end of mantras\), or in interpolating them in the mantra. *Dīpana* is thus done by adding two *OṂ, bodhana* by adding *namaḥ, saṃtarpana* is done with two *LAṂ* \(the *bija* of water\). *Tādana*, however, as its name implies, consists in thrumming13 the letters of the mantra \(which is thus to be written\) whilst uttering twice the *jāti phaṭ. Guptibhāva* is more complex since it consists in ‘enclosing’ \(*saṃpuṭīkaraṇa*14\) the mantra between two *Netramantras* and then reciting it ten thousand times. *saṃpuṭīkaraṇa* is also used in *indhananiveśana*, ‘using as fuel’, the mantra being able in that case to burn all fetters or poisons afflicting a person.

The ŚT 2.112–123 quotes, and then describes, ten *mantrasaṃskāras* which include eight of those of the NT list excepting *indhananiveśana*, to which are added at the outset *janana* \(birth\) and *jīvana* \(vivifying\), which are not in the NT. These two first *saṃkāras* are, in fact, preliminary rites since *janana* is simply the extraction of the letters, the *akṣaras*, of the mantra from among the fifty phonemes, the *mātr̥kās*,15 of the Sanskrit alphabet ritually written on a lotus-shaped *maṇḋala*, which is nothing else than a variant of the rite of *mantroddhāra* described in chapter 2 of this book. It is the preliminary rite necessary for all mantras to exist as words of power. It is here quite logically followed by *jīvana*, since once ritually ‘born’, the mantra, to be effective, is to be animated by this rite, which, according to the ŚT, is done by reciting \(*japa*\) the mantra a hundred times while interpolating the *praṇava OṂ* between each of its letters: an oral rite, therefore. The eight other *saṃskāras*, however, though being the same in name as those prescribed in the NT, differ from these in that they are not purely linguistic, oral, performances, but rites performed on a written mantra. Thus *bodhana* is done by hitting the written mantra with laurel flowers while uttering the fire-*bīja RAṂ. Abhiṣeka* is done by touching the mantra written on birch-bark with aśvattha leaves \(this to be done 108 times according to the *Piṅgalamata*, or as many times as there are letters of the mantra according to ‘another tantra’, both quoted in the commentary\), and so forth for other *saṃskāras.* The purification, *vimalīkaraṇa*, is to be done, according to ṢT 2.119, by ‘burning’ the mantra with a fiery mantra \(*jyotirmantra*\), but it may also be done, according to the commentary, by a yogic practice, the raising of the mantrin’s *kuṇḋalinī*. For *dīpana* and *guptībhava*, mantras and *japa* are prescribed. We may be tempted to consider this variety of procedures – purely linguistic or ritual, written or oral, or yogic, as illogical, or even whimsical, which they perhaps are. The reason why a particular procedure is to be used for a particular *saṃskār̥a* surely does not appear logical. However, whether logical or whimsical, this variety can \(ought?\) be seen as reflecting the complex nature of mantras which are speech acts, thus oral, but are put into action by ritual; they are endowed with a divine power of which *kuṇḋalinī* is the bodily aspect; and in actual practice they can be written. The KT 15.71–72 enumerates the same ten *saṃskāras*: ‘As a sword rubbed on a whetstone gets sharpened, concludes the tantra, in the same way the mantras bloom and radiate thanks to the ten *saṃskāras.*’



## 7 Mantric practices and the nature of mantric utterance
**1**





Most ancient Tantric texts, and some more recent ones too, contain a mixture of sometimes very elaborate theological and metaphysical notions with a mystical and soteriological aim, together with a variety of magical speculations and practices, these two categories of notions and actions forming two very largely overlapping areas rather than two separate ones. A coincidence that should not surprise us since rites are governed by rules, that is, by theoretical notions which give them their meaning. The Tantric initiate for whose benefit such texts were composed, the *sādhaka*, was normally not a *mumukṣu*, a seeker of liberation, but a *bubhukṣu*, a religious virtuoso \(to use Weber’s terminology\) intent on obtaining supernatural powers or rewards and for whom *mokṣa* was the Tantric liberation in life, *jīvanmukti*, with its accompanying *siddhis.* These texts thus never left aside entirely the quest for liberation, as appears for instance in the Trika system of *upāyas* expounded mainly in Abhinavagupta’s *Tantrāloka* \(TĀ\) on the basis of earlier Tantras such as the *Mālinivijayottara* \(MVT\) and the *Siddhayogeśvarīmata*. Considering the fundamental role of mantras both in the quest for liberation and in the acquisition and practice of powers, it is not surprising that in all these works mantras are described as effective in those two fields. The mantras used for these various purposes are sometimes different; but they may also be the same ones. I would like to consider briefly here a group of mantric practices used when magical effect are aimed at but which can also be used for other reasons – these two different sorts of purposes being admittedly not easy to distinguish.

I shall consider here a passage from the *Netratantra* \(NT\),2 a Śaiva text \(undatable, but surely not later than the tenth century AD\), which was commented upon by Kṣemarāja \(fl. *c*.1000–1050\), a disciple of Abhinavagupta, and was interpreted by him in the spirit of the non-dualistic Śaiva system of the Kashmirian exegesis of the Trika-Pratyabhijñā. The NT \(often called by Kṣemarāja Mr̥tyujitbhaṭṭāraka\) extols the ‘Eye’ \(*netra*\) of Śiva \(sometimes also called Amr̥teśvara or Amr̥teśa\) and especially the mantra of that deity, the *netramantra* \(also named *mr̥tyujit* or *amr̥teśvaramantra*\), the basic form of which is *Oṃ juṃ saḥ*. The text describes at length the mystical, yogic and ritual or magical uses of that sacred formula.

Chapter 18 of NT describes a ritual called *śrīyāga* thanks to which the ‘good *sādhaka*’ initiated in the *netramantra* will be able to oppose those who try to counteract the action of his mantra or to make it turn against him. This ‘countermagic’ practice is technically called *pratyaṇgirā, pratyaṅgirasa* or *pratyaṅgiratva*3. To make his own mantra irresistible, the *sādhaka* first submits it to the action of some ritual treatments, of which nine are enumerated.4 One may, however, the tantra adds \(*śl*. 9\), give the mantra eleven different forms ‘thanks to which the *sādhakas* will succeed’, that is, they will obtain what they are seeking. *śl.* 10b–12a list these forms:


*samputaṃ grathitaṃ grastaṃ samastaṃ ca vidarbhitam* /

*ākrantaṃ ca tathādyantaṃ garbhasthaṃ sarvatovr̥tam* /

*tathā yuktividarbhaṃ ca vidarbhagrathitam tathā* //

*ity ekadaśadhā mantrā niyuktāḥ siddhidāḥ smr̥tāḥ* /


Thus listed are eleven different ways of interlocking the *netramantra* with the name \(or designation\) of the person aimed at, or the action to be effected: the *nāma, abhidheya* or *sādhya.*

The grammar of the above list, given here as printed in the KSTS edition of the NT, is not satisfactory. It is clear, however, that it enumerates some things that are to be done to the mantra, and this is indeed how Kṣemarāja explains these terms in his Uddyota \(vol. 2, pp. 77–79\), confirming his point, in each case, with a quotation from an unspecified text, probably the *Ucchuṣmatantra*. His definitions coincide with those given for several of these terms in other Tantric works \(of which I have checked only a few\), the practices listed here being fairly common in magic, especially for the so-called *ṣaṭkarmāṇi*, the ‘six \[magical\] actions’ described in a number of Tantric texts whether Hindu or Buddhist.

Here are these eleven terms – and the corresponding practices:

*Saṃpuṭa*: the word means a bowl or a rounded casket, or the space enclosed inside these objects, or between two covers, etc. The mantra \(or any part thereof, or any element with which it is associated\) must be symbolically ‘encased’ inside such a space or casket, covered as with a lid or within two covers.5 Kṣemarāja defines it here as the placing of the mantra before and after the other element which is thus encased, as it were, within it: *ādyantayor mantranyāsaḥ sa saṃpuṭavaṭ* The pattern is thus B A B \(where A is the mantra and B the *nāma/abhidheya / sādhya*\). The same practice is prescribed in NT 6.18, which adds \(19\) that one may thus ‘encase’ any mantra within the *amr̥teśvaramantra* and, if it is thus recited, this mantra, whether or not intrinsically powerful, will immediately become efficacious \(NT, vol. 1, p. 131\). The technique of *saṃpuṭa* \(sometimes called *puṭa*\) may also be applied to parts of a mantra, an *akṣara* of which being thus encased between another one repeated twice \(cf. ŚT 7.52\), the sequence is then b1 a1 b1 b2 a2 b2, etc.

One may note that in NT 6.18–19 the technique of *saṃpuṭa* is prescribed for a *japa*, that is, is used orally; but in the *Uddyota* on NT 6.18 Kṣemarāja describes it as written: *mantram ādau likhet.* In the *Agnipurāṇa* \(AgP\), chapter 138, where *saṃpuṭa* is prescribed for the magical action of *vaśīkaraṇa* and *ākarṣaṇa*, it is described as the placing of the mantra around the *sādhya* – above, under and to its right and left: a spatial pattern, not an oral operation. The mantra, in this case, though theoretically a sound pattern, not a written series of letters, is mentally conceived as disposed in that way whilst it is uttered.

*grathita* this practice is also known as *grathana* – from the verbal root *GRATH* \(*GRANTH*\), to bind. It consists in binding together, as it were, the mantra and the *sādhya*, as in a knot, by alternating their syllables, ‘each syllable of the *abhidheya* being enclosed within those of the mantra’, according to the quotation made by Kṣemarāja: *abhidheyārṇam ekekaikaṃ mantravarṇaiḥ saṃpuṭīkr̥tam.* These words are also quoted by Jayaratha in his *Vivaraṇa* on the VM 2.35–6 \(or NṢV, 2.36–37, p. 157\),6 which prescribes the enclosing of each letter of the *sādhya* within the *bīja* of Kāmakalā \(*ĪṂ*\), this being done \(in writing\) on a diagram, around the border of which all the letters of the alphabet are to be inscribed.7 The AgP 138.6, the *Tantrarājatantra* \(TRT\)1.72, or the ĪŚGP 1.5 give the same definition of *grathana* as Kṣemarāja.

*grasta* the term means swallowed or eclipsed, but also surrounded. Its use, for a practice consisting \(according to Kṣemarāja\) in putting the name or *sādhya* in the middle, with the mantra written on all four sides \(*madhyasthasya nāmno dikcatuṣṭaye mantraniveśaḥ*\), appears thus wholly justified.8 This practice is in fact what the AgP 138 calls *saṃpuṭīkaraṇa.*

In its present sense *grasta* is not found in the AgP nor in the TRT, the ĪŚGP or the *Pheṭkariṇītantra* \(PheṭK\). This can be said of the following term also.

*samasta* the *nāman* is uttered or written before the mantra, this being done twice: B A B A. *Samasta* meaning ‘put together’, ‘united’, the term could apply to any other combination as well. *Samasta* like *grasta* seems proper to the NT.

*vidarbhitam* ‘first the name, then the mantra is *vidarbha*’, says Kṣemarāja, and he quotes: *abhidheyaṃ bhavet pūrvaṃ tato mantra sakr̥d bhavet / vidarbhitam.* The Pheṭ K 3.148–149 defines it differently as alternating the letters of the mantra and those of the *abhidheya*, the pattern being not B A, but b1 a2 b2 a3 b3, etc. The AgP 138.7 says that one should alternate two syllables of the mantra with one of the *sādhya* \(*mantrākṣaraṃ dvayam. likhyā sādhyākṣaram punaḥ*\): a1 a2 b1 a3 a4 b2 a5, and so forth.



The VMT 2.33–34 \(or NṢA 2.34–35\) prescribes this practice for an amulet where the letters of the mantra and *sādhya* are inscribed in a *śrīcakra*, a practice described differently by Śivānanda in his *R̥juvimarśinī* \(as: a1 b1 a2 b2 a3 b3 etc.\) and by Vidyānanda in the *Artharatnāvalī* \(a1 a2 b1 a3 a4 b2, etc.\). The same text \(ś*l.* 21–22\) prescribes a *nyāsa* of the *mūlamantra* on the image of the goddess entwined with the *aṇkuśabīja* \(*KROṂ*\).9 There are thus different forms of *vidarbha* in *japa* or in writing.10 Whatever its form, however, *vidarbha* always consists of associating *sādhya* and mantra while cutting apart somehow either these two elements, or the whole formula, or their constituting syllables.

But why is this called *vidarbha*? In this technical mantric sense, the term seems not to be found in Sanskrit dictionaries or encyclopaedias. Edgerton’s *Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary*, however, defines *vidarbhayati* \(with *vidarbhana* and *pravidarbha*\) as ‘intertwines \(letters\), i.e. writes them between letters of a mantra’, and it refers to several passages of the *Sādhanamālā*. As I have shown elsewhere,11 the term can be explained by reference to *darbha*, the grass of that name, which has a cutting edge. The *Śabdakalpadruma* says: ‘*darbhaḥ – dr̥ṇati vidārayati, dradalibhyāṃ bhaḥ*’, Unādisūtra 3.151, ‘*iti bhas*’, that is, it refers *darbha*, in the sense of the verbal root *DR̥*, ‘to cut’, and since *Unā* 3.151 says that after *DR̥* and *DAL* one must have *bha*, this results in *darbha.* The prefix *vi* would then add the notion of separation, mantra and *sādhya* being cut off and separated. *darbha* can also be linked with the root *DR̥BH*, to string or tie together, the practice of *vidarbha* being then understood as first separating \(*vi*\), then stringing together mantra and *sādhya.*

The following six mantric practices – together with *grasta* and *samasta* – are, I believe, found in the NT only.

*ākrantam* *madhyasthasya nāmno mantro yadi veṣṭanayā nyāsta ākrāntam*, says Kṣemarāja: ‘when the mantra is placed so as to surround the name which is in the centre, \[this is called\] seized or invaded’. This looks like a variant of what NT calls *grasta* and AgP *saṃpuṭīkaraṇa.* \(Note that the past participle *ākrānta* applies to the *nāman*, not to the mantra.\)

*ādyanta* *mantrād anantaraṃ nāma tatas trimantra ity ādyantam*, ‘the name after the mantra, then thrice the mantra, this is “before and after’’’. The sequence is thus A B A A A .The term is self-explanatory.

*garbhastha* *madhyasthasya mantrasya caturdikkaṃ sādhyanāmanyāso garbhasthatvam*, says Kṣemarāja. This is in fact AgP’s definition of *saṃpuṭa*, except that the *Uddyota* on NT mentions the four directions of space instead of the four sides of the written mantra. It is also the reversal of what is defined as *grasta*. Like the AgP’s *saṃpuṭa*, this can be done only in writing.

*sarvatovr̥ta* *mantrasya ādyantayoḥ sādhyanāmaniveśaḥ sarvatovr̥tam*, ‘the placing of the *sādhya* or name before and after the mantra is \[having it\] completely surrounded’. This is the reversal of what is called *saṃpuṭa* by the NT. The pattern is B A B.

*yuktividarbha* the text quoted by Kṣemarāja defines this as placing the *abhidheya* before the mantra and three times after it: B A B B B. It is the inversion of *ādyanta.* The reason why this practice is so called is not clear.

*vidarbhagrathita* it is repeating three times the mantra after the *nāman*: *nāmnaḥ paścāt trimantranāsyaḥ*: B A A A. The reason why it is so called is also unclear since neither knotting \(*grath*\) nor cutting \(*vidarbha*\) occur.



This list of eleven mantric practices of the NT is an unusual one both in that it is longer than the usual one of six12 linked each with one of the *ṣaṭkarmāṇi* \(which are not mentioned here\), and in that it does not include three of these more usual ones, namely *yoga, rodha* and *pallava*, about which a few words must now be said.

*yoga* is defined in the TRT, PheṭK and ĪŚGP as placing or uttering the *sādhya* before the mantra: *mantrādau nāmasaṃsthānaṃ yoga ityabhidhīyate* \(PheṭK 3.142\). The AgP’s technique is different: *adau mantra tataḥ sādhyomadhye sādhyaḥ punar manuḥ.* We have thus either B A or A B B A. In both cases there occurs a conjunction or union \(*yoga*\) of the mantra and of whatever word or formula is associated with it, such union being deemed to increase the power of the mantra.

*rodha* consists \(according to AgP 138.3–4 and PheṭK 2.144\) in placing the mantra before, in the middle of, and after the *sādhya* – A B \(A\) B A: *nāmnā ādyantamadhyeṣu mantraḥ syād rodhaḥ. rodha*, from the verbal root *RUDH*, is probably understood as the surrounding, investing, or blockading of the *sādhya* by the mantra. It is mentioned in the ĪŚGP, but not in the TRT.

*pallava* consists, according to the TRT or PheṭK, in putting first the mantra, then the *sādhya* \(A B\). The *sādhya* appears thus as a shoot or extension \(*pallava*\), as it were, of the mantra. The AgP has a different description – it seems to add the mantra both before and after: *ādau sādhyaṃ likhet pūrvam. cānte mantrasamanvitam.* The pattern would then be A B A.



I have described the foregoing mantric practices not so much because I find them intrinsically interesting, but because I believe they contribute to throw some light on the nature of mantras or of mantric utterance or, more generally, on the Tantric conceptions of the relationship between sound or word and image or writing.

These practices, indeed, concern mantras, that is, oral/aural formulas transmitted by word of mouth from master to disciple and put into practice through utterance or recitation \(*uccāra, japa*\) only. Mantras can also be enunciated silently \(*tūṣṇīm*\); such silent utterance \(where the utterer ‘restrains his voice’, *vācaṃ yacchati*\), and still more the inner and purely mental one \(*mānasa*\), being in fact considered as the highest and most meritorious ones: the mental utterance is the highest because the Absolute, the supreme godhead is silent. Silence is higher than the highest plane of the word \(*vāc*\) because it is its primal Source. The mantrin, in such case, evokes \(or perhaps fuses with\) a transcendent plane of *vāc* which, imperceptible, is present as its animating power in all uttered mantras.

But how is it, then, that this power can also be evoked, made present, when a mantra is written? First, the writing or the placing of a written formula is not mere writing but a ritual performance which can be fruitful insofar only as it uses, as it is permeated by, the power of *vāc*, of the Word which inhabits the, by nature oral, mantra thus written down. The written formula is thus \(deemed to be\) infused with the energy of the oral formula. This explains how and why written mantric practices can be prescribed in a work such as the NT whose *mūlamantra*, the *mr̥tyujit OṂ JUṂ SAḤ*, is in principle effective only when uttered. It explains too why such practices are endorsed by Kṣemarāja, that is, by one of the main exponents of the non-dualistic Kaśmirian brand of Śaivism, whose concept of mantra is directly issued from that of the *Śivasūtra* \(ŚS 2.1: *cittaṃ mantraḥ*\), the main commentary on which is Kṣemarāja’s *Vimarśinī*, a work where he states that the supreme Word \(*parā vāc*\) or Consciousness \(*saṃvit*\) is the true nature of mantras.

Another explanation, and one that fits with the doctrine of the Trika-based *pratyabhijñā*, is that mantras exist and function on different levels. Abhinavagupta thus said that by nature they ‘consist of discursive thought as well as pure consciousness’ \(*vikalpasaṃvidmayaḥ*\).13 In their functioning, too, they may well appear differently. They may be felt and used as pure consciousness \(*saṃvit*\) by the liberation seeker \(the *mumukṣu*\) – and still more by the liberated in life \(*jīvanmukta*\), and be also \(even simultaneously\) used audibly on the plane of discursive thought and of the gross form of the word \(*vaikharī*\); they can even be written by a mantrin, a *sādhaka*, performing *kāmya* rites \(which are in fact those which are the main concern of the NT\).

These uses may differ widely; they are, however, grounded in the same, fundamentally oral, conception of mantras. Just as magic is never entirely separate from religion, of whose concepts it is merely a profane use, so mantras, even in their lowest, magical uses, cannot be separated from their highest, purely oral ones. In fact, such lower uses of mantras are effective only insofar as all mantras are in essence the supreme Word, pure divine energy.14

Thus a text such as the NT may expound some written \(and in some respects magical\) uses of mantras whilst still upholding the essentially spiritual nature of these ritual formulas. Let us take also, for instance, the case of mantras or *bījas* placed in ritual diagrams \(*cakra, yantra* or *maṇḋala*\). These may be placed in the diagram by the rite of *nyāsa*, which is at the same time a bodily and oral and mental action.15 They can also be inscribed, written, there. Some texts assert explicitly the power, value or meaning of these written mantras. A typical instance is that of the *kāmakalā* as described in the *Yoginīhr̥daya* \(YH\), one of the basic texts of the Śrīvidyā tradition.16 A passage of this work \(YH 2.21, *Dīpikā*, pp. 130–131\) describes – rather cryptically – the so-called *kāmakalācakra* as made up of two intersecting triangles with the *bīja ĪṂ* inscribed in the central part of the *cakra.*17 This *bīja* is to be meditated both as the *vācaka* of the goddess and as the *kunḋalinī* \(coiled like the letter *Ī* in nāgarī script\) in her ascent from *mūlādhāra* to *brahmarandhra*: the ritual process involved here is both visual and mental, resting as it does on the meditation of a ‘written sound’. The *Ī* of the *kāmakalā* can also be meditated as made up of three dots, that is, as it is written in the Brāhmī script: this use of an ancient script is perhaps a case of deliberate archaism. It can be taken, too, as suggesting an \(unlikely\!\) ancient origin of this practice.

In the ritual of *nyāsa*, too, the mental visualisation of the written shape of the *bīja* that is being placed is sometimes prescribed, or a written *bīja* or mantra is to be assigned somewhere. In the *Mantraparibhāṣā* \(chapter 293\) of the AgP, for instance, a *lipinyāsa* is prescribed, for which the *śaktis* of Rudra \(that is, the fifty *akṣaras* from *A* to *KṢA*\) are to be written, then ritually placed on the body of the *sādhaka* \(*vilikhet … vinyāset, śl.* 147\).18 More important, perhaps as regards the role of written letters or mantras \(it is well known that any *akṣara* can be considered as a *bījamantra*, from *AṂ* to *AḤ* and to *KṢAṂ*\) is the conception of Lipidevī, the \(written\) Alphabet Goddess19 mentioned, for instance, in AgP 293, or that of the ‘Tree of letters’, *lipitaru*, of the ŚT 7.08–14, under which the Goddess is seated. Among alphabet deities is also the goddess Mālinī of the Trika \(and of some Śaiva Kaśmirian systems\) which consists in a particular order of the Sanskrit alphabet, going from *ṆA* to *PHA* \(the *ṇādiphāntakrama*\).20 One finds it written in a triangular ritual diagram, a \[*mālinī*\]*gahvara* shown in the *Tantrasadbhāvatantra*. But, according to some texts, it can also be written in a gupta script, the letters being correlated with body parts. Since a mantra is always fundamentally an oral principle, when this representation of the Mālinī mantra-deity is ritually used, that is, mentally worshipped, the practice would combine oral, visual and mental elements.21 The written form of the letter *A* in the *devanāgarī* script is also sometimes the basis of a meditation, the different parts of the letter being meditated as embodying the movements of the supreme energy, *kunḋalinī*.22

We must also refer here to the ritual procedures used for the *uddhāra*, or for the research of the *aṃśa* of mantras, where letters of the Sanskrit alphabet are, for the *mantroddhāra*, written \(often in a particular secret order\) on a diagram, called *prastāra* or *ghavara*,23 or, for the research of the *aṃśa*, on *cakras* of various shapes, all procedures that are used in all Tantric traditions, whether Śaiva or Vaiṣṇava.24 Incidentally, we may remark that the prescription in tantras of such written procedures shows that these texts, though supposedly revealed, were originally written. We must also not forget the numerous uses of written mantras on amulets \(*kavaca*\) which, extremely frequent in modern times and nowadays, are in fact a very ancient use.

Coming back to the oral nature of mantras and to the practices we have seen of *saṃpuṭa*, etc., one must say that, to a large extent, these notions and practices can be traced back to Vedic origins. The Vedas were composed several centuries before writing began to be used in India. This explains perhaps the bias against the writing of revealed texts that was to appear later on, when writing began to be used \(seventh to eighth century BC?\). Writing was thus confined to practical, mundane uses and excluded from religious/ritual ones. However, since India was from early times a highly literate society, producing one of, if not *the* largest, literature in the world, there inevitably occurred interactions between the written and the unwritten traditions, a situation which resulted – to take a particular instance – in the \(apparent\) discrepancy between the in principle oral–aural nature of mantras and their written uses.25 We may note, too, that such mantric procedures as *vidarbha* and so forth, where the constituting parts of a mantra are separated, interpolated, duplicated, inverted, etc., have as their forerunners such Vedic usages as *viharaṇ a* and *vikr̥ti* \(intertwining or transposing\). In the same way, the use of ‘meaningless’ syllables or *bījas* added to, or interpolated in the sequence of a mantra can be traced back to the *vyāhr̥tis* of the Veda or to the syllables chanted by the Udgāta priest of the Sāmaveda.

Developed in a Sanskrit tradition going back to the Vedas, the Tantric *mantraśāstra* could not but participate in the main traits of some of the linguistic aspects of that tradition \(to which, from a certain time onward, it contributed largely\). Seen in this light, that is, as part of a stable and continuous but ever-changing culture, such seemingly out of the norm uses as those we have seen here appear as merely an aspect of a culture where the oral and the written have interacted during more than two millennia, and thus can never be entirely separated.26



## 8 Body and mantra
**1**

### Mantras in the human body





An interesting aspect of Tantric mantric practices and speculations concerns the \(imaginary, of course\) presence and circulation of mantras in the human body, or, more exactly, in the structure of channels \(*nāḋī*\) and centres or nodal points \(*granthi, cakra* or *padma*\) imagined in the haṭhayoga tradition as being present in the physical human body. This imaginary pattern is often called ‘subtle body’. But this is a misnomer since the subtle body properly so-called, *sūkṣmaśarīra* or *liṇgaśarīra*, in Sanskrit, is made up of an ensemble of *tattvas*, forming the element that transmigrates from body to body, and has by nature no form or aspect: it can be conceived, but not visualised; whereas the yogic structure is to be imagined, visualised, and it does not survive the death of the body. We shall therefore not call it subtle body, but rather yogic or imaginary body. In this structure, with which the Tantric adept lives and which he imagines \(and sometimes visualises mentally\) as being within his body, mantras are deemed to be present in the nodal points and to circulate in the *nāḋīs* like a fluid, as a flow of power. To look briefly at this bodily presence of mantras may be of some interest from the point of view of the nature of mantras, but also as regards the way in which Tantric adepts perceive and experience their body. For the yogic body is not only ‘intraposed’ \(to use T. Goudriaan’s felicitous expression\) within the physical body, but also it oversteps it \(the *dvādaśānta* cakra is twelve fingerbreadths over the head\). Furthermore, it includes cosmic visionary elements which transform it \(or rather transform the way in which it is experienced\), elements which also connect it, sometimes identify it, with aspects of the cosmos. The Tantrika’s experience of his body is thus of a very specific sort, being both human and cosmic or divine.

Mantras are evidently not present by nature in the human body. They are imagined as being there through the meditative effort of the yogin who not only imagines abstractly their presence in his body, but also comes to ‘visualise’, to see them mentally there, abiding in the cakras or circulating in the *nādīs.* Many texts, ancient or modern, prescribe or sometimes describe this mental practice.

It is most often by *nyāsa* \(on which see here the chapter on the subject\) that mantras are placed on or in the body of the adept or devotee, and are thus imagined by him to be present in him or to help him to identify himself with the deity he invokes or worships. In this chapter, the aspects of the subject I would rather underline are some peculiar forms of the presence of the word in the body \(brought about notably by such ritual practices as *nyāsa*, but also otherwise\) and the transforming effect of this presence on the image of the body2 and therefore on the way the body is perceived and experienced by the adept or devotee. The latter’s body appears thus as permeated by the power of the word which may simply purify it \(for the performance of a ritual, for instance\), but which can also inhabit it to such an extent that it becomes the receptacle of the deity and even is identified with it. It is sometimes said in such cases that the adept has \(at least for the time the rite lasts\) a ‘mantra-body’ \(*mantraśarīra* or *mantradeha*\),3 a problematic term, for what can such a body actually be? The problem, at least for us, is a double one. For, first, of what kind are the mantras that are present in the body? Are they aspects of the word, subtle forms of power, or deities? Then, how can one imagine and, still more, how can one have the actual, ‘lived’, experience of a mantra-body? What sort of experience and mastery the yogin has of a body thus transformed? Then, the body of the adept fully inhabited by mantras is often described as a divine body \(*dīvyadeha*\), or it is said that the nature of the adept becomes that of a mantra \(*mantratva*\), which are other complex notions. By their presence in it, mantras do not merely purify or divinise the body: being supernatural entities with a cosmic dimension and role, they ‘cosmicise’ it. Embodying as they do the traditional Indian homology of the human body and the cosmos, they give a cosmic dimension to the image the Tantric adept has of his body: he transcends his limits.

A case in point is the description given in the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(JS\)4 of the cult of Viṣṇu. In this text, as is the rule in Tantric ritual worship, the *pūjā*, the so-called ‘external’ \(*bāhya*\) cult, that is, the cult materially, visibly, performed, is preceded by an ‘inner sacrifice’ \(*antaryajana*\), which is entirely mental, all the parts of the cult having to be done in imagination, using as a support of these imagined actions the image of the body of the performer. During this mental ritual process, the officiating person resorbs, in ‘the ether of his heart’ \(*hr̥dākāśe*\), his consciousness \(*caitanya*\) and his vital force \(*jīva*\) into a ‘mantra body’ \(*mantraśarīra*\), the mantra being the mantra of the deity, therefore the god himself. The adept is then deemed to have no other body than this divine mantra-body. This moment of imaginary fusion with the deity is followed by several mental representations which will achieve the complete transformation of the officiant, so that, with his purified and transformed physical body – of which he somehow again takes possession – he will be able to enter the next, physically performed, part of the worship.5

To come back to *nyāsa*, it is normally accomplished using a particular position or gesture of the fingers \(a *mudrā*\) which are to touch the part of the body where the mantra is to be placed, the gesture being done together with the vocal or mental enunciation of that mantra, which is also to be visualised.6 What is thus to be mentally evoked \(by *dhyāna*\) is the aspect as described in ritual texts or manuals of iconography of the deity whose phonic essence and highest aspect is the mantra. The mantra itself is therefore what the adept sees mentally while placing it.7 By *nyāsa* one may also place abstract entities, difficult to imagine visually but which are also symbolised by a mantra. Such is the case of such cosmic elements as the *kalās* or the *tattvas.* These cosmic elements can be placed by *nyāsa* of their mantras on the body \(of the initiand notably\) which is thus imagined as ‘cosmicised’.8 According to some texts, what is to be imagined is the written form of the letters, to be visualised as shining since mantras are divine and therefore luminous. The forces thus placed on the body are therefore deemed not only to inhabit and transform it, but also somehow to illuminate it. One sees thus that the mental, imaginal aspect of *nyāsa* is essential to it, the image being not merely mental, but also experienced, felt as being present in the inner structure of the yogic body of the performer.

This mental visual aspect of *nyāsa* is all the more important when mantras are to be placed, as is sometimes prescribed, on the *cakras* or other centres of the yogic body. The practice is then necessarily entirely mental, even if a gesture towards the body is sometimes to be done: while uttering the mantra one is to imagine it as being placed on the *cakra* which is thus permeated with its power. The small figures of deities one sees in the traditional Indian images of haṭhayoga9 are the mantras which the yogin is mentally to place there. It is always mantras that populate \(if one may use this word\) the centres and channels of the yogic body described in Tantric texts.

Another form of the presence of mantras in the body is found in such ritual practices as the cult or invocation of deities. As we have just seen, the inner, mental *pūjā* which precedes the external concrete ritual worship is a mental worship, done entirely with mantras, which transforms the nature, the ‘ontological statute’, of the body of the officiating person. The deity, in this case, is to be invoked and imagined as present in the heart of the adept. Since this deity dominates the world which is as it were his/her throne \(*āsana*\), all the constitutive elements of the cosmos, the *tattvas*, from that of the earth to the one that precedes the deity, are to be imagined as tiered below the deity, being placed mentally, using mantras, by the officiant in his body. Thus, in the mental cult \(*mānasayāga*\) of Viṣṇu described in chapter 12 of the JS, the officiant who is already identified with the god \(*viṣṇumāyā*\) will build up his body as the *āsana* of the deity by visualising meditatively \(by *dhyāna*\) both the visible \(anthropomorphic\) and the phonetic \(uttered and/or written\) aspect of the mantras of all the elements constituting the cosmos, which will be thus placed in imagination in his body. He must first place, with their mantras, the supernatural powers and deities present in the cosmos together with the corresponding cosmic levels. He tiers them vertically along the axis of the *suṣumnā* and the ascending path of the *kuṇḋalinī*, beginning with the *ādhāraśakti*, the supporting power which is the pedestal of the universe, imagined as being in the *mūlādhāra*, continuing with the earth, the directions of space, the Vedas, the three Luminaries \(Sūrya, Soma, Agni\), Sun, Moon and Fire, and other divine entities, up to the god Gārūḋa \(Viṣṇu’s mount\) with Varāha. The throne is to be made up of the mantras of the twenty-seven *tattvas* from earth to *īśvara.* We may note here that this interiorised throne thus built up with the mantras of all the universe reflect two visions of the cosmic process: one mythical, theological, the other that of the structure of the cosmos inherited from the Sāṃkhya.10

In the Śaiva domain, we find an analogous process described in the SvT 1.88ff. for the cult of Svacchandabhairava: the throne of the god is first installed in the body of the adept, then the mantras which constitute phonetically the cosmos, then the god which is to be mentally worshipped.11 Similar but more complex is the mental installation of the three supreme goddesses of the Trika – Parā, Parāparā and Aparā – for the purpose of initiation, shown in chapter 15 of the TĀ. The worshipper, in that case, must first divinise his body by imposing on it mantras of somatisation \(*mūrtimantra*\) as a preliminary to the mental creation in his yogic body of several divine entities. Then he is to install in himself, by their mantras tiered along the *suṣumnā*, the divisions of the cosmos, the *tattvas*, with their presiding deities. This will transform him into the throne of the goddesses who are to be imagined as above his head, each seated on a Bhairava lying on a lotus, each placed on the tip of the three prongs of a trident issuing from the top of his head.12

Mantras, however, are not merely present in the imaginary body of the Tantric adept. They move inside it, spreading out their power, divinising the adept, and/or uniting him with the supreme godhead, leading him towards liberation. Several Śaiva or Vaiṣṇava examples could be given of this intra-bodily, liberating circulation of mantras which, more than the *nyāsas*, put into play the creative power of imagination when associated with the existential perception of the ‘lived’ body.13

The very term *uccāra*, used for an action which both enunciates a mantra and activates its power, underlines the bodily basis of this process. For *uccāra* denotes the ascending movement \(*uc-√CAR*\) of the vibrating subtle phonic substance of the mantra, the *nāda* \(it is the *nādoccāra*\), the inner ascent which goes together with the movement of *prāṇa* in the yogic body. It is an inner, intra-corporeal movement of the vital breath, together with a movement of consciousness towards the deity.14 The fact that this breath is ascending, associated with the ascent of *kuṇḋalinī*, shows that it is not a respiratory breath. It does take place in the adept’s body, but on the level of the yogic body ‘intraposed within the visible body’, to quote again T. Goudriaan.15

There is no dearth of cases of this intra-corporeal circulation of mantras. A first case in point is the mantric practice of the *ajapājapa*, the ‘recitation of the nonrecited’ where the bodily transit of the mantra is identified with the respiratory breath. I have described it in chapter 3 and therefore leave it aside now. I would like, however, to draw attention to the fact that in the *ajapājapa* the practitioner’s inner consciousness is to be eventually focused, not on the respiratory breath, but on the ‘central breath’ \(*madhyamaprāṇa*\) which is an aspect of the divine energy. The practitioner’s attention shifts from concentration on the movement of breath going on in his physical body to concentration on the vital, subtle breath which takes place in his yogic body: there is thus a coalescence of two visions and experiences of ‘breath’. Tantric texts often insist on the necessary connection between mantra and *prāṇa* in the sense of subtle vital breath. This is done for instance by Abhinavagupta in the TĀ \(7.39ff.\) where, referring to the *Siddhayogeśvarīmata*,16 he says that it is in harmonious connection with the vital breath \(*prāṇasamā*\) that the *kuṇḋalinī* reaches the transmental *unmanā* plane of the mantric utterance, adding that mantras, even repeated thousand of times, would be without effect \(*na siddhyanti*\) if not conjoined with the eternal ever-surging divine power by being enunciated in conjunction \(*yukta*\) with the movement of *prāṇa.*

We shall see now a few cases where mantras placed or deemed to be present in the yogic body move in it without involving the physical body, which is nonetheless not entirely non-implicated, since it is the milieu where the yogic body is imagined as present. It is therefore with his whole ‘lived body’ – his ‘*Leib*’ – that the Tantric adept lives, experiences himself, even though all that happens in such cases is, as we shall see, entirely imaginary.

One of the best-known cases of such intra-bodily mantric practices is the utterance, the *uccāra*, of *OṂ*, the *praṇava*, whose nasal ending, *Ṃ*, is considered as persisting through eight phonic stages \(*kalā*\), from *bindu* to *samanā*. The three phonemes, *A, U, M*, constitutive of *OṂ*, which are the three first *kalās*, are on the level of the \(audibly or mentally\) spoken word; the eight other *kalās* \(*bindu, ardhacandra, nirodhini, nāda, nādānta, śakti, vyāpini, samanā*\), then *unmanā*, form thereafter eight progressively more and more subtle planes of the enunciation which, in *unmanā*, eventually dissolves in the \(silence of the\) Absolute. It is a phonic ascent going from this world of distinct speech to fusion in the silence of the supreme godhead. Since it is an ascending movement, it naturally follows the movement of *kunḋalinī*, the divine power as present in the human body. The utterance of the mantra \(*uccāra*\) and the ascent of *kuṇḋalinī* are, from this point of view, identical. This ascending flow of *OṂ* is in fact sometimes explicitly named *haṃsoccāra* \(in SvT 4.262, for instance\).

There are, in Śaiva tantras, different descriptions of the *uccāra* of *OṂ*: the number of *kalās* may vary as well as the powers or cosmic divisions to which they correspond. This last point is of no importance in the present context. I mention it here to emphasise the cosmic and transcendent aspect of most mantric utterances, and especially of this one. For though the *uccāra* of *OṂ* is imagined as taking place in the yogic body of the adept, this body, if only because mantras are placed on it, has a supra-human dimension. It is patterned along the structure of the anatomical body, but it transcends it both because it is pervaded by the divine power and because it is the means through which the human creature can overstep its limits and tend towards the Absolute.

To come back to the bodily presence and ascent of *OṂ*, its ascent, associated with the movement of *prāṇa* and *haṃsa*, begins, according to SvT 4.263,17 with *A*, on the level of the heart centre \(*hr̥d*\). It continues with *U* in the throat \(*kaṇṭha*\), *M* in the palate \(*tālu*\), *bindu* between the eyebrows \(*bhrūmadhya*\), and *nāda* on the forehead \(*lalāta*\). Then, higher in the head, appear and dissolve the next ever-more subtle planes of the phonic vibration \(with the corresponding cosmic planes\), up to *unmanā*, which is not mentioned in the SvT but is probably above the head. The description of this practice by the NT 22.25ff. is largely similar, *OṂ* being, however, divided into five *kalās* only – *A U M, bindu* and *kalā* – conceived as pervading \(*vyāpti*\) the body, that is, being generally present in it, from the feet to the heart \(*A*\), from the heart to the palate \(*U*\), from the palate to the forehead \(*M*\), and then, for *nāda*, from forehead to *dvādaśānta*, the subtle centre twelve fingerbreadths above the head.18 This practice results in pervading the whole body of the adept with the power of the mantra which he will thus be able to master.

One of the most elaborate description of the ascending utterance – the *uccāra* – of a mantra is, I believe, the *japa* of the *śrīvidyā*, the mantra of the goddess Tripurasundarī, which is to be performed at the end of her *pūjā*, and which is described in the third chapter \(*śl.* 169–174\) of the *Yoginīhr̥daya* \(YH\), a Śaiva text, probably from Kashmir, dating from the tenth or eleventh century. The four stanzas which describe it are far from clear, but they are explained in Amr̥tānanda’s \(thirteenth to fourteenth century\) commentary.

This *japa*, the YH 3.169 says, consists in ‘the conjunction \[carried out\] in the three parts \[of the *śrīvidyā*\] and in the threefold *kuṇḋalinī* of the vibration of the *cakras* tiered one upon the other’.19 This abstruse formula underlines the link of the mantra and the *kuṇḋalinī* during this ascending process. What is actually to happen is as follows.

The mantra that the officiant is to raise from the lowest *cakra*, the *mūlādhāra*, to the highest one, the *dvādaśānta*, is the *śrividyā*, made up of the following fifteen syllables: *HA SA KA LA HRĪṂ HA SA KA HA LA HRĪṂ SA KA LA HRĪṂ*. The utterance of the three *HRĪṂ*, the *hr̥lekhā*, the flame of *HRĪ*, which crowns as it were each of the three groups of syllables is deemed to prolong itself, as in the case of *OṂ*, after the three letters *HRĪ*, through the nine *kalās*, from *bindu* to *unmanā* we have already seen, this movement going from the lowest *cakra*, the *mūlādhāra*, to the summit, the *dvādaśānta*. This is how the *nāda*, the phonic vibration of the mantra associates in the same ascending movement \(the same upwards going thrust of energy\) the three parts of the mantra and the three sections into which the *kuṇḋalinī* is considered as being divided.20 This being so, the officiant is to imagine that in the *mūlādhāra* are the phonemes of the first group, *HA SA KA LA* crowned by *HRĪṂ* \(*HRĪ* \+ *bindu*\), over which, going upward along the *suṣumnā* \(therefore together with the ascent of *kuṇḋalinī, prāṇa* and *nāda*\), the six *kalās* from *ardhacandra* to *samanā*, reaching and overstepping the *svādhiṣṭhāna* and *maṇipūra cakras*, the ascent going thus up to the heart \(*hr̥d* or *anāhata*\) *cakra.* There, in the *hr̥d*, is now be imagined the second group of phonemes, *HA SA KA HA LA* followed by *HRĪṂ*, with over them, again, the *kalās ardhacandra* and so forth, which will go on ascending in the same way, overstepping the *cakras viśuddha* and *tālu* \(neck and palate\), up to the *bhrūmadhya cakra* \(between the eyebrows\). There, the third group, *SA KA LA* followed by *HRĪṂ*, will be mentally placed, with over them the *kalās* which, in this case, include *unmanā*, and which also carry with them in their ascent \(according to Amr̥tānanda’s commentary\) the *kalās* of the two first groups. Thus the *uccāra* of the mantra reaches with the totality of its subtle part its highest point, where all phonic vibration dissolves into the Absolute. There, too, it oversteps the limits of the physical body of the adept since the plane of *unmanā* is reached in the *dvādaśānta* cakra twelve fingerbreadth above the head. The *śrīvidyā* thus travels through the whole yogic body of the adept, from the lowest to the highest *cakra*, pervading it with the divine power of the *śrīvidyā*, which is the phonic power form of the goddess, thus bringing him to the plane of the Absolute. Such a mantric practice needs an intense mental imaginative concentration on the part of the practitioner. If it is effectively realised and experienced, it cannot but influence the officiating adept’s consciousness of himself, all the more so if the process is to be repeated at least once every day during the daily regular \(*nitya*\) worship of Tripurasundarī. It goes without saying, that in the everyday ritual practice of *śrīvidyā* adepts, such an intense identification is probably a rare case; it ought nevertheless normally to take place since, in principle, all Tantric cults aim at bringing about an identification of the officiant with the deity he ritually worships.21

Another interesting case of the presence and circulation of mantras in the channels and centres of the yogic body is that of the ‘subtle meditation’ \(*sūkṣmadhyāna*\) of the Eye-Mantra \(the Netramantra\) of Śiva, god and mantra, both also named Mr̥tyujit \(‘Conqueror of Death’\), described in chapter 7 of the NT, a meditation of which there are two forms.

The tantra first \(*śl*. 1–4\) mentions a particularly large number of channels and centres of the yogic body: there are six *cakras* \(plus the *dvādaśānta*\), sixteen ‘supports’ \(*ādhāra*\), three ‘objects’ \(*lakṣya*\), five voids \(*śūnya*\), twelve knots \(*granthi*\), then three ‘celestial bodies’ or ‘glories’ \(*dhāman*\), these centres being connected with each other by innumerable veins or channels, the *nāḋīs*. This being so, for the first method \(*śl*. 5–15\), the adept is to imagine Śiva’s energy as present in the central ascending breath, and to place mentally on this ascending force the mantra which then vibrates. This subtle phonic vibration, following the course of the *suṣumnā*, will pierce through the *cakras*, the sixteen *ādhāras* and the twelve *granthis* till it reaches the *dvādaśānta* where it will fuse with Śiva. Thence it flows down by the same way till it reaches the heart *cakra* which the adept is to imagine as filling up with ambrosia \(*amr̥ta*\) which then spreads in the whole body through the numberless *nāḋīs*, which results in making the adept immortal: the physical body of the yogin is thus transformed, made divine, by this mental imaginative action on the \(equally imaginary\) yogic body.

The NT then describes \(*śl*. 16–52\) another practice where the meditation begins in the *mūlādhāra* \(here called *janmasthāna*, place of birth\), whence the adept’s consciousness, together with the mantra, will first go down to his toes.22 Then, it will go upwards again, reaching in succession the centres we have seen before, which, being as it were obstacles on the way,23 must be overstepped or pierced through. To this effect, the yogin uses the ‘Sword of Gnosis’ \(*jñānaśūla*\) which is, the commentary says, ‘the flashing of consciousness transformed into mantric energy’, the power of the mantra fused with the consciousness of the adept, that is. This is achieved by a particular yogic technique causing the ascent of *kuṇḋalinī.* His consciousness having thus reached, together with the mantra, the highest point, the *dvādaśānta*, the adept acquires henceforth the power to move into the ‘ether of consciousness’: he is *khecara.*24 Pervaded by this Energy he fuses into the supreme godhead. The NT, very Tantric in that, adds that this point once reached, the Energy engenders *amr̥ta* which, as in the first case, will spread in the body of the adept who becomes immortal: he is *mr̥tyujit*, ‘conqueror of death’. Here too mental representations act on the physical body. Not entirely surprisingly, one might say, since the human creature is inseparably body and mind and since he ‘s’existe’ en s’imaginant’ \(he exists imagining himself\). This squares, too, with the Tantric conception of liberation as being less a renunciation to the world than a supernatural \(‘magical’\) control and domination of oneself and of the universe. That such a goal can be reached by the presence and circulation of mantras in the body is also very Tantric – and even, from many points of view, typically Indian.



## 9 Mantra and mantraśāstra
The oral and the written

Mantra and *mantraśāstra**1*





In the theoretical approach as well as in the practice of mantras in Hinduism, the premium has always been \(and still is\) placed on the power of the oral word: Revelation, there, is not Scripture, but *śruti*, ‘what has been heard’ \(even though the first mantras were not heard, but ‘seen’ by the Vedic *r̥śis*\), a premium overemphasised in Tantra. Writing, however, is also sometimes used, and the literature on the subject, the so-called *mantraśāstra*, the ‘teaching of the mantras’, is made up of a vast quantity of written texts. It thus appears that one writes on what is oral – which itself is sometimes transposed in writing. This written as well as oral ensemble is, of course, in Sanskrit. The oral literature we shall consider here is a part of the learned, lettered, not of the popular, domain, even though the learned \(oral or written\) sometimes ‘debases’ into the popular. The question of the relationship of the oral with the written – secondarily of the learned with the popular – insofar as it appears in the case of mantras, is what we shall try to see here.



### A purely oral, spoken, ‘speaking’, word …

By their very nature, which is the nature of the Word, of *vāc*, mantras are word, utterance, voice. *Vāc*, however, since Vedic times, is also and foremost the Absolute, the all-powerful, the *brahman*: *brahma vai vāc*, says the *Aitareya Brahmana*, 6.21.1. Hence their power, their efficacy. Hence, too, their immateriality. Oral, uttered or unuttered, the word is ‘speaking’ or ‘spoken’ \(*vāc vadantī*\). Being made up in essence of the very highest plane of the word, mantras are therefore on the side of the Absolute: they are both word and the Absolute. There is an often-quoted saying in Tantric Śaiva texts: all mantras are made up of phonemes \(*mantrāḥ varṇātmakāḥ sarve*\), but the phonemes are of the nature of Śiva \(*śivātmakāḥ*\). The mantras are thus divine, and are therefore nothing to do with writing, which is purely human.

Being the *vācakas* of deities \(or of other supernatural entities\), that is, what ‘expresses’, or ‘says’ them, bringing them thus to existence, being the efficacious essence of these entities, mantras are powers.2 They have their own power or energy \(*mantravīrya* or *mantraśakti*\). They are efficacious utterances, able to effect various actions, to produce results, provided they are used according to prescription and by authorized persons: this is what they do when used in ritual.

All this is always done by word of mouth, by the spoken word, audibly or mentally uttered. The uttering of a mantra can be so low as to be inaudible, or else purely mental – the mental utterance being in fact the highest one, as was already stated in the Laws of Manu, 2.85. This utterance is a necessity: differing in this from the written word, a mantra always implies the existence of a speaker. It is never cut off from its production, from its origin, as is the case of the written word. A mantra may, of course, be deemed to act by itself without any human intervention, but this it does only insofar as it has been first uttered, thrust towards its goal by somebody being present. It cannot, like a piece of writing, become active after having remained dormant between the pages of a book, or the folios of a manuscript. It is necessarily associated not only with an enunciation but also \(in spite of Frits Staal\!\) with an intention to enunciate. True, there are cases, as we shall see, when the mantra, cut off from its utterer, is supposed to act in writing; but these cases are either exceptional or are part of popular, ‘magical’ practices.

Written words, in fact, are elements of language. But mantras, as is everywhere theoretically admitted, are not part of language. They are made up of phonemes or syllables \(*varṇa, akṣara*\), sometimes of words – of the phonetic material of speech, that is; but they are not meant for communication. They do not depend from, nor are they conditioned by, any outside factor \(they are *nirākaṇkṣa*, ‘autonomous’\). Above all, they are not ruled by the conventions \(*saṃketa*\) which govern the world of speech as a means of communication. Being *asāṃketika*, ‘non-conventional’, the mantra is a form of word existing on a primary, divine plane, prior to and above language. It is not turned towards the outside world, but towards the divine to which it may lead the user, whilst being able also \(and mainly\) to act in the world. This non-linguistic character of mantras is not due to their being often made up of meaningless syllables for, even when they are made up of ‘normal’ Sanskrit words or sentences, mantras are not speech. This of course is a metaphysical or theological principle. It is, however, justified if one considers how mantras work: their efficacy is not due to what they ‘say’, but to how they say – to their actual wording. It rests on their phonetic tenor \(hence the necessity of an absolutely perfect enunciation\). This efficacy rests on the substance of the expression \(to speak like Hjelmslev\), on the phonetic structure, on the sounds being somehow emitted, but not on any literal meaning \(supposing there is one\).

The inseparability of the mantra and of its utterer is underlined in many theoretical works and by a number of mantric practices. It appears also in the oftenproclaimed link between mantra and *prāṇa*, the vital breath linked to the Self, which is also one of the aspects of the cosmic energy \(according to L. Renou, *prāṇa* is ‘the vitalist aspect of the *ātman*’\). In the tantras and other Tantric texts, the utterance of a mantra is usually named *uccāra/uccaraṇa*: an enunciation which is an upward movement \(*ut-√CAR*, to go upwards, to ascend\) of the vital breath together with the mantra. *Uccāra* is in fact the ascending thrust of the phonic energy of the mantra. It is evidently not a respiratory breath. The term notes especially the ascent of the *kuṇḋalinī* caused by the upward moving conjunction, in the *suṣumnā*, of the *prāna* and *apāna* vital breaths: what happens there is, above all, the movement of the energy which goes upwards in the yogin’s ‘body’, but even in such a case a mantra is deemed to be uttered. Even when there is no vocal utterance, the mantra is nevertheless present and active in the consciousness and in the body \(or more exactly in the image of the body, in the ‘lived’ or ‘experienced’ body\) of the adept. One might describe this by saying that the mantra is ‘uttering itself’ in the consciousness of the adept whilst spreading out like a fluid in his body.3 The *uccāra* of a mantra, Abhinavagupta says when describing this process, is *prāṇacidātma* \(TĀ 5.128\): it is both ‘breath’ and consciousness. There is a conjunction of the vital and spiritual energy of the yogin and of the energy of the mantra. All this, evidently, cannot in any way be connected with writing.

We may remark here that all this is in complete conformity with the Indian traditional view according to which things of importance – especially when connected with religion – must not be dealt with in writing. The rule is as old as the Veda, which, as is well known, was transmitted orally during two millennia and is still being taught and used in ritual orally and with the most minute phonetic precision. Ṭhe superiority of the silent over the audible utterance of mantras, also, goes back to Vedic origins.

In the same way, mantras – those at least received in initiation to be used for spiritual or magical practices – can only be transmitted orally, by word of mouth, by the initiating master, the instruction going, according to the Sanskrit expression, ‘from ear to ear’ \(*karṇāt karṇopadeśena*\), for this only guarantees the secrecy of the transmission. Mantras are of divine origin, they were originally revealed to a first master \(*ācārya, guru*\) by the deity and then transmitted, always by word of mouth, through a succession of initiated masters down to the present times. Thus, only those who possess the needed qualification and authority \(*adhikāra*\) may transmit or receive, orally and according to precise rules, these secret and powerful sacred formulas. Many texts say that mantras that have not been received regularly \(or, still worse, found in a written text\!\) have no value. They are ‘fruitless’, ineffective. They may even be dangerous.

It is interesting to note that these strict mandatory rules on the orality of mantras have survived for centuries in a social milieu in which a literature in Sanskrit was being produced \(and there are many other languages in India\) which is one of the largest in the world.



### of which writing can only be a reflection or a comment …

Writing, in principle, appears as always devalued. It is merely a practical tool, an artefact without any value of its own. For Indians, as for Rousseau, ‘writing is a mere supplement of the spoken word \(‘l’écriture ne sert que de supplément à la parole’\), a ‘dangerous supplement’ \(un dangereux supplément\) even, since by its availability, by the fact that it extends the field of communication by spoken word or gesture, it wrecks the circle of direct interpersonal communication. By writing, one moves \(down\) from the qualitative, where the spoken word goes from the deity to the spiritual master, then to the disciple, to eventually turn back towards the divine through yogic practices or ritual action using mantras, to the quantitative where the word circulates freely in a homogeneous milieu where everybody can receive it, but where it has by this very fact lost all its power: when uttered it is mere noise, *flatus vocis*. Worse: once written, the spoken word becomes merely a stilted transfer, the visible, concrete, inferior form of a living, immaterial, supreme reality \(as unauthorised copy, it may even get the piratical user into trouble4\).

In spite of the, always valid, principle of the strictly phonetic, oral nature of mantras, their users or inventors \(in the two ancient meanings of the word: invent as well as discover\) did not entirely escape the rule of writing since they lived in a milieu where writing was being used. We will indeed see several mantric practices where writing is not simply a practical device, but is sometimes linked to the very nature of mantras: there are therefore legitimate, ‘respectable’ uses of writing not as a substitute, but as an additive to the oral.5 To this can be added cases where it can be said that the oral debases into writing, cases we will merely allude to later on in spite of their important place in practice, the frontier between these two uses being in fact not always very visible, the ‘inferior’ uses being not merely modern or contemporary ones \(nor purely written ones\).

As we noted earlier, there is first the *mantraśāstra*, that is, all the texts, of all sorts, which describe, prescribe, or deal in some way with mantras. Thousands of pages have thus been written during some two millenaries on the purely oral mantras. What is more, these texts, while ceaselessly proclaiming that mantras are secret formulas, sometimes give explicitly, in writing, their phonic tenor – which is perhaps to be explained by the conviction that a mantra discovered in a book has no power or efficacy.



### but which it can nevertheless help to reveal

Very often, nevertheless, such texts reveal only in veiled terms the phonemes that make up the mantra: using periphrases or conventional terms which only qualified masters or initiates can understand. They give, not the mantra, but its *uddhāra*:6 how to produce it or ‘extract’ it, how to make it arise out of the Word. This can safeguard its secrecy very effectively. In effect, if some conventional terms are common ones \(as *mayā* for *Ī, indu* for *bindu*, etc.\), and if there are manuals which give such meanings – *bījakośa, bījanighaṇṭu, uddhārakośa*, etc. – and also compendiums, listings of ‘secret’ terms, these riddles are sometimes very difficult to solve. Every tradition or initiatory lineage has its own system, carefully kept secret. The written, in such cases, assists the oral: it guards its secret against the ignorant, whilst disclosing it to those permitted to know it. Functioning as an aide-mémoire, it helps to keep up the oral tradition – a role it certainly had from ancient times.

The *uddhāras* do not merely use abstract notions or mythico-theological elements so as to indicate/refer to the letters of a mantra. They sometimes refer to their written form. Writing has in such cases a directly practical role. The *uddhāra* also often implies a spreading out \(*prastāra*\) of the phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet so as to ‘extract’ \(*ud-DHR̥*\) from among them those which are to constitute the mantra. This *prastāra* consists in spreading out \(*pra-STR̥*\) the forty-nine to fifty letters of the alphabet, writing them on an appropriate surface, either grouping them down by phonetic categories \(*varga*\), or distributing them according to specific rules on a diagram. The letters once spread out, one ‘extracts,’ chooses that is, those which are to make up the mantra, these letters being often designated by conventional \(secret\) names. This use of *prastaras* underlines the fact that mantras, as aspects of the word, are born from the *mātr̥kā*, the phonic ‘mother’ of the universe of which the Sanskrit alphabet is part, from which they are extracted. It shows both the subordination of the mantras – made up of letters – to the totality of the Word, the Sanskrit alphabet \(or the supreme deity insofar as it is made up of Word, alphabetical\), and the fact that mantras draw their power and efficacy from that alphabetical totality.

The spreading out of the *mātr̥kā* is also made use of differently, by using secret, initiatory *prastāras*, named *gahvaras*, a term which means cavern, hiding place, secret. These are theoretically secret diagrams, of different shapes, where the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet are placed in a conventional order known only by initiates. They are thus ‘caverns’ where the secret formulas, the mantras are hidden.7 The user of a tantra that prescribes the use of a certain *gahvara*, knowing how to draw it and the places where the letters are to be written, it suffices that the places where they are written and the order in which the letters are mentioned to enable him to construct the mantra. The design of such diagrams, the placing of the letters and their ‘extraction’, are all codified, sometimes complex ritual operations. This is not surprising since what is being done there is not merely drawing a diagram and writing letters on it: it is invoking and manipulating the divine power of the word so as to gather it up in a highly effective formula, a mantra, the power of which the adept will then master through the ensemble of rites and conducts of the *puraścaraṇa* or *mantrasādhanā*,8 and will then use – in principle orally, perhaps also by placing it on a diagram, a *maṇḋala* – to some spiritual or mundane end. The mantra thus produced can also be the mantra given to the disciple in the initiation \(*dīkṣā*\) ritual. It is interesting to see here written letters being used to make appear ritually a formula which in principle must remain purely oral. There are other ritual procedures of that type used to verify if the mantra is well adapted to its user and to the result he aims at. This checking, named *mantravicāra* or *mantraparīkṣ ā*, is done using diagrams of different sorts.9



### or even sometimes to show

One may perhaps be tempted to consider such procedures as rather external to mantras: they are preliminary to their use, with no influence on their nature or functioning. There are, however, also cases where it is in their very use, even in some measure in their essential nature, that mantras appear in a written form. Or, more, they may appear in a form that the user must imagine as being in writing. There are finally cases when mantras can be made use of only when not simply placed by *nyāsa*, but inscribed in a diagram.

In this domain, the oldest proven instances seem to be mainly Buddhist ones. They are numerous in Mahāyāna Buddhism, especially in Tibet where Sanskrit mantras are generally used. We may wonder whether this is not due in part to the influence of China, where the written sign, not the word, is essential. In effect, the best known and most characteristic Buddhist use of *bījas*, Sanskrit syllables, in a written form, is the Sino-Japanese \(mostly Japanese, in fact, in the Shingon sect\) of the *siddham* writing. This lies outside the Indian domain; the case is nevertheless worth mentioning here since, in some of the Tibetan traditions, the recitation and visualisation of the mantra are inseparable: there is a coalescence of the seen, meditated form and of the sound uttered and perceived inside, not merely the use of a phonic element in an outer visual frame.

Of all this, Hinduism also shows many instances, some being very ancient. One of the most evident is the visualization of *bījas* or of phonemes prescribed in the *kuṇḋalinīyoga*, where the yogin is to see with his mind’s eye, as present in the *cakras* of his yogic body,10 Sanskrit syllables or *bījamantras* written on the leaves or on the pericarp of the ‘lotuses’ which constitute the *cakras*. The sound, the oral utterance, of these *akṣaras* or *bījas*, is to be imagined, felt even, by the yogin as present in these centres. The *kuṇḋalinī*, too, as we have seen, when going upwards, may be identified with the upward thrust \(*uccāra*\) of a mantra. In some cases \(for instance, in the *japa* of the *śrīvidyā* described in the third chapter of the *Yoginīhr̥daya*\), the adept imagines the subtle phonic vibration \(the *nāda*\) of the mantra as ascending from the *mūlādhāra* to the *dvādaśānta*, the centre twelve finger-breadths above the head. In such a case, what is experienced by the adept is the phonic, oral/aural aspect of the process. It seems, however, that in some texts, the *bījas* or *akṣaras/varṇas* imagined as present in the visual structure of the *kunḋalinī* are to be visualised in their written form, on which it is probably easier to concentrate one’s attention than on a sound, by nature more evanescent.

There is, on the other hand, another mantric practice, where mantras or syllables are necessarily to be written: that of *nyāsa*. This consists in placing ritually \(with a *mudrā*\) on the body or on a support, a mantra, *bīja* or phoneme which is simultaneously to be mentally visualised \(*dhyayet*, say the texts, *dhyāna* being here used in the Tantric sense of visualisation11\), such visualisations being usually of their written form. \(Admittedly it can also be the form of the deity of the mantra, but this is not suggested by the texts I have seen.\) Some ritual treatises, sometimes explicitly, say that one is to visualise clearly the intensely shining letters of the mantra. Chapter 293 of the *Agni*-*Purāṇa* prescribes the *lipinyāsa* – the placing of written letters \(*lipi*\) – of the fifty letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, followed by the *nyāsa* of eight Lipīśvaras, ‘Lords of letters’, which are to be written \(*likhyate*\). The Purāṇa does not say how these deities are to be drawn \(written?\).



### One has also speculated on the written aspect of these oral letters

Having said that in principle mantras cannot be but oral since their nature is that of the word, of the primal *vāc*, identical with the formless Absolute, the *brahman*sound \(*śabdabrahman*\) as it is sometimes called, we must now look at cases where writing comes in, not merely in the ritual uses or practices of mantras, but at their highest level, on the level of the deity. In such cases writing appears as linked to the very nature of mantras.

Let us note first that in some texts \(the *Agnipurāṇa*, 293.51, or the *Brahmāṇḋapurāṇa*, for instance\) there exists a Lipidevī or Lipibhairavī: a ‘writing-goddess’; in the *Śāradātilaka*, 7.8–14, the goddess’s body is made up of letters \(*lipitanu*\) and she is seated under a ‘tree of letters’ \(*lipitaru*\). This alphabet-deity is the Mistress of the Word, Vāgīśvarī \(or Devī Vāgīśī\). It is in fact an aspect of Sarasvatī whose attributes she bears \(notably the rosary and the book\). Her plane, however, is not the supreme one: she is the goddess on the level where she gives birth to the world. In the non-dualist system of the Trika, on the other hand, it is the supreme goddess, Parā, who is *paravāk*, the supreme Word, a variant of Sarasvatī-Vāgīśī, who bears these attributes, the alphabet being present here, most subtly, as *mātr̥kā, śabdarāśī* or *mālinī*, as the supreme Energy or totality of the Word, that is, and therefore on a plane very much above the plane of writing. There is, however, a continuity or a proximity – underlined by the presence in both cases of Vāgīśvarī holding a book \(*pustaka*\) – between the totality of the word and the written Sanskrit alphabet. One could thus consider that there is here, as it were, a primary presence of writing: a ‘primordial trace’, or a ‘primordial writing’ \(*une écriture première*\), to use Derrida’s words; it being, however, understood that, in India as elsewhere, one may postulate the precedence of the oral over the written. It is only insofar as, in the course of time, one has speculated on the word and that the *mantraśāstra* has succeeded the mantra, that graphical elements appeared to reinforce the empire and power of the oral, to sustain, explain and describe its supremacy.

If we turn now towards the *mantraśāstra*, we will find striking instances – in fact, very well-known ones – of the intervention of the graphical in mantras or, to say it differently, of the interaction on all planes of the visual and the phonetic.

The most obvious example is probably that essential element of all *bījamantras*, the *anusvāra*, the nasalisation and prolongation of a syllable which one names *bindu* \(which is to say, drop, dot\) because of its written form as a dot placed over the nasalised phoneme. \(It is sometimes called *indu*, ‘moon’: it is a luminous circle.\) In mantras, it ends such *bījas* as *OṂ, HRĪṂ, LAṂ*, etc. Now, this written form is the basis of all the speculations on the *bindu* conceived as a ‘drop’ of concentrated phonic energy, as the point where the energy of the word gathers upon itself before dividing itself and spreading out to manifest outwardly its power and to manifest the universe.

Phonetically, the *anusvāra*, as a resonance which progressively fades out or which diminishes before a consonant, does not offer much food to the imagination. It is clearly and evidently its visual aspect which plays a role. Only the visual perception based on the written form can explain that the *bindu* at the end of a mantra could be generally described as the part which concentrates its dynamism, or \(to use Kṣemarāja’s words in his *Śivasūtravimarśinī*\) which ‘flies like the arrow thrust forward by the tautened bow’. Among the elements usually enumerated that characterise a mantra \(the *r̥ṣi*, etc.11\), the *bindu* represents usually the *kīlaka*, the ‘point’ or wedge that will pierce the target aimed at by the mantra.

In the traditional order of the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet \(the *varṇa*-*samāmnāya*\), the *anusvāra* is followed by the *visarga*, the sixteenth ‘vowel’, which, in Indian grammar, designates a release, an escape of breath after a vowel at the end of a word, its written form being two dots \(:\). It is thus graphically a division in two of the *bindu*, whereas – owing to its name and its place – it emits or produces \(*vi-SR̥J*\) the thirty-four consonants which follow it and, by this very fact, gives birth to the totality of the cosmic manifestation. This written form, a division in two of the *bindu*, also gives rise to speculations on the birth of the word. We may note here that very few mantras end with a *visarga*. I need not expatiate here on *bindu* and *visarga*, but refer readers to studies on the subject \(for instance, Padoux 1990, chap. 5, pp. 272–286\).

We may, on the other hand, apropos of the oral/written interaction as seen in the *mantraśāstra*, mention two other instances of speculations based on the written form of letters in the *devanāgarī* script.

First, on the drawing of the letter A, the first vowel, which is, in the Tantric metaphysical speculations on the word, the Absolute, the Unsurpassed \(*anuttara*\), the original phonic energy underlying all the other phonemes – therefore above all limits and all form. But, in emanative systems \(as are Tantric traditions\), it is necessary for the supreme deity, the Absolute, to hold in itself the seed or paradigm of all that it will emit. The energies that will create and sustain the cosmos are therefore all inchoately in the Absolute. Abhinavagupta elaborates upon this idea in the third chapter of his *Tantrāloka* \(where speculations on the written form of phonemes are in Jayaratha’s commentary on TĀ 3.67\). Such ideas are also to be found in another, older, text, the *Vātūlanāthasūtra*. The lines of the written form of the letter A are described as representing the four basic energies of Śiva: Raudrī is the head \(-\), Jyeṣṭhā, the weapon \(3\), Ambikā, the arm \(/\), and Vāmā \(who ‘vomits’, that is manifests, the world\) is the mouth \(|\). It is indeed not in its written form that *A* is the Unsurpassed with all its energies. But we see here the symbolic value given to the written form of a letter being used in support of the metaphysical interpretation of a phoneme. Another Sanskrit phoneme whose written form has given rise to the same speculations is *E*, whose written form is more or less triangular.13



### Then there are also diagrams and amulets

One finds nearly always, in the centre of the *yantras* or *cakras* of Tantric female deities, a triangle point downwards, or two inverted superposed triangles symbolising the \(sexual\) union of Śiva and Śakti. There are also sometimes, in these diagrams, several inverted superimposed triangles \(as, for instance, in the *srīcakra* of goddess Tripurasundarī\) replicating and reflecting the first couple, symbolising thus the creative dynamism of the goddess united with the god. In the centre of the central triangle of the *śrīcakra*, there is also a *bindu* which is the goddess herself, a spot where both the oral and the written focus since the symbolism of the *bindu* is both geometrical-visual and phonetic-oral.

Admittedly, such representations are, strictly speaking, outside the domain of the oral/written relationship in mantras. It is, however, a neighbouring domain, which intersects and oversteps this relationship, and is an important one; for what is in question here is not only the relation of the phonetic to the written, but also, more largely, the relation of the oral to the visual. For this, indeed, is the context within which is set the more general problem of the relationship of mantras to ritual diagrams \(*maṇḋala, yantra, cakra*\), which is the problem of the relationship between the phonetic, temporal \(and fugacious, evanescent\) and the spatial \(and lasting\). There are, of course, mantras, *bījas*, or phonemes in all ritual diagrams which often are no more than a means to display the phonetic elements for putting them into action: the word, there, becomes active as being spatially placed, or, if one prefers, space is ritually made use of only when qualified, infused with power by the word. In such cases, the functioning of the *yantra* and of the mantra appears as being totally linked. There are also cases when they function in full parallel, *cakra* and mantra appearing to the yogin as the two faces of the same divine reality, as two interchangeable modes of access to this reality. This is what takes place with the *śrīvidyā* and the *śrīcakra* in the Tripurā tradition. It also happens \(for instance, for the *śrīcakra*\) that one goes on directly from one regime to the other: from the spatial to the phonetic, this being all the more easy when, as sometimes happens, the *maṇḋala* is not concretely marked out, being only visualised in imagination. This is the case when the yogin is to visualise diagrams in his body, in the *cakras*, for instance, visualised with their design and the deities that abide there together with mantras or *bījas* and phonemes.

But there are also what we may call diagrammatic mantras whose utterance and functioning – their use, that is, in mantrayoga – is constituted partly of visual, spatial elements \(drawings and written letters\), these being either concrete or mentally visualised.

There exists therefore a common zone where correspondences, isomorphisms, between visual and audible are played out. This is in fact all the less surprising in a civilisation where the Word, the oral, is placed at the origin of everything that exists, its supremacy being always extolled; but a civilisation for which, at the same time, the direct visual \(*sakṣāt*\) perception is the best possible proof of the existence of something; where, too, in the common religious practice, the view, the vision of the image of the deity by the devotee – the *darśan* – together with the deity’s gaze going towards the devotee, are of the utmost importance. We would be tempted to say here that we have, in the Indian case, the \(apparent\) paradox of the omnipotence of the Word, which is invisible, being proclaimed, extolled by ‘visual seers’. This Word was ‘seen’, in the beginning, by the Vedic poet-seers, the *r̥ṣis*: ‘the sacred Formula \(*brahman*\) that was first born in the East, the seer discovered it from the shining edge \[of the world\]’ \(*Atharvaveda* 4.1\).

Many instances of the presence of visual elements in the structure and uses of mantras – in a, by nature, phonetic \(oral/aural\) process – could easily be adduced. Typical is thus the fact that when enouncing the subtle phonic levels \(*kalās*\) which prolong the utterance \(*uccāra*\) of *OṂ* and are above all actual physical utterances, since they are infinitely subtle and eventually disappear completely in utter silence, the practitioner is to ‘see’ these levels as symbolic geometrical figures. One could also quote the case of the *kāmakalā*, a symbolic representation of the sexual union of Śiva and Śakti, which is something both graphically visible and phonetically invisible since it is a diagram with an inscribed letter \(*ĪṂ* but also a *bīja* to be uttered.14

But we cannot dilate here on this sort of learned speculations and practices, intermixing oral and written, which are found in the Sanskrit texts of *mantraśāstra*. It would be interesting to know their origins and when they began, but on this we cannot do more than suggest possibilities. The earliest documents on the subject are in fact Buddhist and Chinese.15 Speculations on the Word, as well as magic, go back to Vedic times. It is therefore not surprising that even the magical uses of the word should have developed in a literate milieu. We may be permitted to believe that as soon as Indians began to write – at any rate very early – they used mantras as, shall we say, magic formulas, using for this purpose writing or lines of some sort, or by inscribing them in ritually drawn diagrams. Therefore, rather than a passage from the oral to the written attesting to a modern evolution, or a passage from the learned Sanskrit to the popular domain, there would have been from an early time, beside a strictly oral domain, the highest and most respectable one, a lower domain, nearer to magic \(by which I mean the manipulation of sacred power to notably mundane ends\), where oral and written co-exist but where the written plays often an autonomous or quasi-autonomous role. One must, of course, especially in modern times, make a distinction among the written elements: a devotedly preserved manuscript has not the same status as a printed text. The intrinsic value of the book matters little, in fact; what is important is to find in it the efficient formula and the way to use it.

If in India, today, one obtains mantras or amulets from specialists: *tāntrikas, mantiravatis*,16 *pūjāris* sometimes, or other magicians, these make them \(supposedly\) ritually, using rites where mantras are necessarily uttered. The oral mantra is somehow embodied in the written formula, thus investing it with power. Even for amulets, charms or *yantras* described in books, it is often specified \(see, Chawdri, 1984\) that, to put these magical contrivances into action, rites including the utterance of mantras and sometimes long *japas* are necessary, which shows the continuous power of the oral utterance. Nothing, in fact, is able to replace the enunciation, with the mental and bodily participation it implies: the presence in the body, one might say, of the word one knows ‘by heart’, or and perhaps better, in Sanskrit, which is *kaṇṭhasthā* :‘staying in the throat’, ready to be vocally uttered.



### And the circle of users

But who are those who use these oral or written mantras? In what context? Of what kind is the relationship between the user and the mantra he uses? Being in Sanskrit, mantras, in principle, may be used only by Brahmins or at most by other twice-born groups \(provided they are not Vedic mantras\). This circle of users, however, became larger as a consequence of the ‘mantrisation’ of Hindu traditions in the course of centuries: any initiated person, of whatever caste or sex, can, if the prescribed rules are respected, receive a mantra he/she will be able to make use of if he/she conforms to the rules. The *ācārya*, sole person permitted to transmit a mantra, is still usually a Brahmin; but the receiver who uses the mantra is not\), necessarily a Brahmin. More, as *bhakti* developed at the expense of ritual rules, any devotee could worship his chosen deity using the deity’s mantra. It is not only Brahmins, especially nowadays, who confer mantras on adepts or devotees – and their mantras are not less effective for that\! The circle of users permitted to utter mantras tends thus to extend indefinitely till the most extreme \(the lowest?\) level, reached with the uses of mantras written on amulets or found in books.

We may note, too, concerning the relationship of the user to the mantra, that Sanskrit having ceased for more than a millennium to be the mother tongue of any high-caste Indian, to use a mantra, which is in Sanskrit, is for the user both to manipulate the power \(intensified in the mantra\) proper to that strange divine tongue. and to participate in the particular, learned, world of the Sanskrit culture. It is a peculiar relationship: to an unusual, both learned and timeless, form of speech. Sanskrit is the liturgical language of Hinduism. It is not the common language of the Hindu religion, still less that of the believers, who are alien to the Sanskrit world. This relationship of the user of a \(Sanskrit\) mantra remains the same whether or not he understands the formula he utters. This does not matter, in fact, since a mantra acts by its mere utterance, by its phonetic content, its elocutionary value, not by its meaning – supposing it has one.17

Whether or not the use of a mantra resorts to writing, it remains an aspect of the word whose power can only be put into action by oral utterance. The power of the oral is always what underlies and shapes all uses of mantras, be it a concrete \(audible or inaudible\) utterance, the inner utterance in the form of the ascending movement of *prāṇa*, or a purely mental vision of the sounds: one of these forms of orality is always present \(even if momentarily\) in all mantric practices, even when apparently written. This, I believe, is what appears through any careful study of *mantraśāstra*.

## Notes





### 1 Introduction

1 Tantra is esoteric since its adepts, tāntrikas, are supposed to have been initiated. The sectarian initiation, *dīkṣā*, being held as a first step towards liberation. All Tantric adepts or believers, however, are not initiated, But with or without initiation Tantric teaching is always described as secret. On the role of secrecy, see studies by Hugh Urban, notably *The Economics of Ecstasy. Tantra, Secrecy and Power in Colonial Bengal* \(New York: Oxford University Press, 2001\).

2 In some cases, as we shall see \(for *mantroddhāra*, for instance – see chapter 1, pp. 12ff.\), mantras are to be written, or to be visualised mentally in their written form, but these are exceptions to the general rule of orality.

3 A most common form of those mantras – a form current in Tantric practice too – is for instance *OṂ HAUṂ śivāya namaḥ*.

For an overview of mantras in Hinduism, see chapter 22 in G. Flood, ed., *The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism* \(Oxford: Blackwell, 2003\). On mantras generally, the only comprehensive study remains to this day H. Alper, ed. *Understanding Mantras* \(Albany: SUNY Press, 1989\).

4 The word *mantra* is of the masculine grammatical gender.

5 On these exclamations – or inflections, as they are technically called – see the entry *jāti* of the Tāntrikābhidhānakośa \(TAK\), vol. 2.

6 On these, see A. Padoux, *Vāc. The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras* \(Albany, SUNY Press, 1990, repr. Delhi, Sri Satguru Publications, 1992\); this, however, being a translation of a 1964/1975 French thesis, reflects the state of knowledge of the subject at a time when many tantras now being studied were unknown or not available.

7 These alphabets are also forms of Bhairava or of the goddess: they are alphabetdeities.

8 ‘The *mātr̥kā*, the unknown universal Mother who gives birth to the cosmos through the \[Sanskrit\] phonemes from *A* to *KṢA*’, to quote from Kṣemarāja’s commentary on Śiva Sutrā 1.4. See here, chapter 4, on *nyāsa*: the ritual placing of the alphabet is called *mātr̥kānyāsa.* The conception of the goddess Mātr̥kā and of her role is not the same in all tantras. This subject is being studied by Judit Törzsök: paper read in Pondicherry in 2009.

9 For instance, *Ajtāgama* 1.13–14, the *tantrāvatāra* chapter, on the ‘descent’ of the tantra, not a chapter on mantras.

10 Not so surprising, however, if one refers to the Vedic *stobhas*, such as *ī hā bu hvā*.

11 *pārameśvare’pi avyaktadhvaner mukhyatayaiva prāyaśo mantratvam nirūpitam.* This work has been edited with an Italian translation by R. Gnoli \(Roma, IsMEO, 1985\). There also exists a \(less scientific, and difficult to use\) English translation by Jaidev Singh \(Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, 1988\) – a new edition is being prepared by Bettina Bäumer\).

12 The utterance of the mantra, that is. On *uccāra*, see A. Padoux, *Vāc The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras*, chapter 7; or the entry *uccāra* of the TĀK, vol. 1. See too, here, chapter 3 on *japa*. In Tantric usage, the *uccāra* of a mantra is often a yogic practice where the mantra moves upward together with the *kuṇḋalinī* – such is the case of the *japa* of the *śrīvidyā* described here, pp. 40–41. On this subject, see A. Padoux, ‘Corps et mantra. la présence des mantras dans le corps’, in O. Botto, *et al*., eds., *Du corps humain au carrefour de plusieurs savoirs en Inde* \(Bucarest-Paris, de Boccard, 2004, *Studia Asiatica* vols. IV–V\), pp. 563–578.

13 This was already stated in the Laws of Manu \(2.85\) and remains valid to this day. See chapter 3, on *japa*, p. 25.

14 It may be interesting to quote here the Tamil poet Tirumular’s \(*c*. seventh century\) definition of mantra as ‘perfect concentration of the mind on anything’.

15 In the dualistic Śaivasiddhānta, mantras are often called *aṇu*, that is, atom or rather individual soul. Mantras appear also as discrete, different, entities in the system of *pramātr̥*.

16 Such is the case, for instance, of the *japa* of the *śrīvidyā* which takes place at the end of the cult of Tripurasundarī described in chapter 3 of the *Yoginīhr̥daya* \(YH\) where the *śrīvidyā*, which is the mantric aspect of the goddess, ascends along the *suṣumnā* in the body of the worshipper, or of the ‘subtle’ meditation of the Netramantra described in chapter 7 \(pp. 15–51\), both briefly described here, chapter 3.

17 *mantrā varṇabhattārakā laukikapārameśvarādirūpā mananatrāṇarūpā vikalpasaṃ vinmayyāḥ*. \(PTV, p. 243\).

18 Nor were they the same in the śaivāgamas and in the earlier Pāñcarātra saṃhitās, and still less in the later ones.

19 These elements were taken over from the indexes of Vedic hymns \(*anukramaṇikā*\). They are completely arbitrary.

20 It is fair to say, however, that *mudrās*, as parts of a ritual or used otherwise, are sometimes held to be by themselves effective. This is the case in many rituals where, for instance, a deity is invoked and placed on a ritual support with a *mudrā.* Such is also the case of the *mudrās* described in chapter 1 of the *Yoginīhr̥daya* \(1.56–71\). These *mudrās* are also aspects of the power of the goddess, and deities worshipped during the *pūjā*. On this, see chapter 4.

21 Though *japa*, especially when made using the rosary, includes rites – see here chapter 5.

22 This is done by the *astra* \(weapon or arrow\) mantra *PHAṬ* or the *kavaca* \(cuirass\) mantra.

23 In the *prāṇapratiṣṭhā* ritual.

24 They may therefore be described as performative utterances or as illocutionary forces, in the sense of J.L. Austin.

25 Then come, in decreasing importance and value, the *vijñānākalas*, the *pralayākalas* and finally the *sakalas*. On this system, see H. Brunner’s ‘Mantras et *mantras* dans les tantras śivaïtes’, in R. Torella, ed., *Le parole e i marmi, Studi in onore di Raniero Gnoli* \(Roma, IsIAO, 2001\), pp. 185ff., or *Vāc*, p. 104 n.

26 Which was the case of *vāc* in the Veda: ‘the Word that speaks and is the harmonious ruler of the gods’ \(R̥V 8.100,10\).

27 My position differs in this from Hélène Brunner’s in her 2001 study referred to in note 25, where she distinguishes clearly betwen ‘Mantras’ as powers and ‘mantras’ as sound units, this distinction corresponding to two different uses of mantras. The distinction of uses, I believe, does not necessarily imply a distinction of nature.

28 The *mūlamantra* of a deity is the deity itself. The *mūrtimantra* evokes the deity’s form; the *aṅgamantras* of a deity symbolise and evoke the *aṅgas*, the ‘limbs’, that is, the constitutive parts or qualities \(*guṇa*\) of that deity. The ‘weapons’ \(*āyudha*\) of a deity have also mantras used to evoke them or to place them on the deity’s image.

29 See the *uccāra* of *OṂ, SAUḤ* or of the *saṃhārabīja KHPREṂ/HSHPHREṂ* described in *Vāc*, pp. 401–426.

30 *dhyāna* in Tantric context is the word for the mental visualisation of a deity – in addition, of course, to its usual meaning of meditation.

31 On this subject, see chapter 2.

32 Two such well-known manuals of iconography are Mahīdhara’s Mantramahodadhi \(sixteenth century\) and the somewhat later *Mantramahārṇava*. The former has been translated with introduction and notes by G. Bühnemann, *The Iconography of Hindu Tantric Deities*, vol. 1 \(Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 2000\). The second volume deals with the pantheons of the *Prapañcasāra* and of the *Śāradātilaka* \(ibid., 2001\).

33 This ritual is described in several texts, notably in chapter 15 of the *Kulārṇavatantra* \(KT\), on which see G. Bühnemann’s study in T. Goudriaan, ed., *Ritual and Speculation in Early Tantrism* \(Albany: SUNY Press, 1992\), pp. 61–106.

34 The rituals thus performed are therefore classified among the *kāmya*, ‘desiderative’ rites.

35 On these see T. Goudriaan, *Māyā Divine and Human* \(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1978\), pp. 251–412.

36 This subject is approached more fully in chapter 7, on mantras, of *Vāc*, quoted in note 12.

37 Or should we say ‘mantra-deity’? Or ‘mantra *qua* deity’?

38 *tasya yā sattā aśeṣaviśvābhedamayapūrṇāhaṃvimarśatmā sphurattā sā mantrāṇāṃ rahasyam upaniṣat* \(ŚSV 2.3, comm., p. 50 of the KSTS edition, Srinagar, 1911\).

39 In this perspective, mantras, made of phonemes ‘extracted’ from the Sanskrit alphabet, are also \(or at least one of them can be\) at the source of the alphabet.

40 *tadākramya balaṃmantrāḥ sarvajñabalaśalināḥ/*

*pravartante ‘dhikārāya karaṇām īva dehinām //26//*

*tatraiva saṃpralīyante śāntarūpā nirañjanāḥ /*

*sahārādhakacittena tenaite śivadharminaḥ //* 27//

41 This, the Saiddhantika authors would see differently since for them the mantras are powers that act by themselves. Their position is explained by H. Brunner in the article quoted in note 25.

42 mahāhradānusaṃdhānān mantravīryānubhavaḥ /.

43 See infra, p. 58 for *nyāsa* or p. 46 for *japa.*

44 New York: Peter Lang, 1990/93; Indian edition, Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, 1996.

45 Vedic recitation, too, was governed by the rule of the absolute respect of the phonetic content of the recited mantra. The Vedic reciter concentrates on the sounds he emits, not on the meaning of the words he utters: this is still the case today. The Tantrika is heir to the Vedic *r̥ṣi*.

46 Such views are briefly reviewed in A. Padoux, L’énergie de la parole, pp. 178–190 \(Paris, Le Soleil Noir, 1980, reprint Fata Morgana, 1994\).

47 On mantras in general I would refer the reader to *Understanding Mantras*, quoted in note 3 and, perhaps, more specially, to the article I wrote as a \(far from definitive\) conclusion to that book: ‘Mantras, what are they?’ \(pp. 295–318\).





### 2 The extraction and examination of mantras

1 This is a new version of a paper ‘La sélection des mantras’ published in the *BEFEO*, LXV, 1978, pp. 65–85.

2 As is often said: *mantrāḥvarṇātmakāḥsarve varnāḥ sarve śivātmakāḥ*, ‘all mantras are made of phonemes which are all made up of Śiva’.

3 vidyās are feminine mantras \(or female mantradevatās\), or mantras of female deities. On the nature of mantras, see the Introduction.

4 See Padoux, *Vāc*, chapter 1 on *vāc*, and chapter 7 on mantras.

5 On the term *uddhāra*, see the entry on this word in vol. 1 of the *Tāntrikābhidhānakośa* \(henceforth referred to as TAK\), p. 231.

6 In chapter VIII of Teun Goudriaan and Sanjukta Gupta, *Hindu Tantric and Śākta Literature* \(Leiden, Brill, 1981\).

7 A well-known one is Dakṣiṇāmūrti’s *Uddhārakośa*, edited by Raghu Vira and Shodo Taki, Delhi, 1978. Or the *Tantrābhidhāna with Vīja-nighantu*, edited by Tāranātha Vidyāratna \(‘Tantrik Texts’ vol.1, Calcutta 1913\).

8 The reason for this identification, as well as that for *M* and time, is not clear for me.

9 *caturdaśayutaṃ bhadre tithīśāntasamanvitam//*

*tritīyaṃ brahma suśroni hr̥dayaṃbhairatmanaḥ:*

10 In the *varṇasamāmnāya* \(notably in the case of the phonematic emanation, the *varṇ aparāmarśa* as expounded in the *Tantrāloka* \(TĀ\)\), the additional phonetic signs *bindu* and *visarga* are included among the vowels which are thus considered as being sixteen in number. \(I follow here the traditional practice of considering the diphtongs as vowels. See Padoux, *Vāc*, pp. 223ff.\).

11 *tritīyaṃbrahma sakāraḥ*, says Jayaratha *ad* TĀ 30–.167 – this because of *Bhāgavadgīta* 17.23: *oṃ tat sad iti nirdeśo brahmaṇas trividhaḥ smr̥tah*, where *sad* \(therefore, here, *SA* or *S*\) is quoted as the third of the three phonemes \(*oṃ tat sat*\) that are the *brahman*. The esoteric play on words goes here quite far, but the more obscure, the better\! \(The use of words in more than one sense \(*śleṣa*\) is a current Indian traditional interpretative practice – on the subject, see for instance Sanderson’s remarkable study, ‘A commentary on the opening verses of the *Tantrasāra* of Abhinavagupta’, in S. Das and E. Fürlinger, eds. *Sāmarasya, Studies in Indian Arts* \(New Delhi, D.K. Printworld, 2005\) pp. 89–148.

12 See the articles *ācārya, guru* and *deśika* in vols. 1 and 2 of TAK.

13 On this process, see Hélène Brunner’s article, ‘Le *sādhaka*, personnage oublié du śivaïsme du sud’ \(*JAs*, 1975, pp. 411–443, and Gudrun Buhnemann, ‘On Puraścaraṇa: Kulārṇavatantra, Chapter 15’ in T. Goudriaan ed., *Ritual and Speculation in Early Tantrism* \(Albany, SUNY Press, 1992\), pp. 61–106.

14 Admittedly, alphabet is not the best term to name the ensemble of the 49/50 Sanskrit phonemes, *varṇas*. I use it however for simplicity’s sake since it is familiar to us. As is well known, the Sanskrit alphabet includes 14 vowels \(*svara*\) and two additional phonetic units, 4 semivowels \(*antaḥstha*\), 25 consonants \(*vyañjana*\), and 4 sibilants, a total of 49 letters to which, in Tantric traditions, is added the consonant group *KṢA.*

15 The whole alphabet is also sometimes considered as a mantra. There are, too, alphabet-goddesses.

16 Note to his edition of the *Mahānirvānatantra*, III, 11–12 \(p. 33\), a passage where the *mantroddhāra* is very much simplified, but Avalon’s formula is nevertheless generally valid. Arthur Avalon was no expert in Sanskrit, but the pandits he worked with were. His contribution to the Tantric field was important – and remains useful. The Mahānirvāṇatantra is a late \(18th c.\) fabrication. It includes elements showing British influences, but it is still worth quoting on some specific points.

17 We shall see later on the technical meaning of this term.

18 *varṇasaṃghaṭtanāśarīrāṇāṃ mantrāṇāṃ saiva bhagavatī vyākhyātarūpā vidyāśarīrasattā rahasyaṃ iti pradarśitam/pratyāgamaṃ ca mātr̥kāmālinīprastārapūrvakaṃ mantroddhārakathanasya ayam eva āśayaḥ.*

On *mātr̥kā* and *mālinī*, see Padoux, *Vāc*, pp. 312–327.

19 A Śaiva text; one of the early \(perhaps eighth century\) Bhairavatantras. It was commented upon, according to the non-dualist Trika system, by Abhinavagupta’s disciple Kṣemarāja \(the *Uddyota*\). Text and commentary are published in the ‘Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies’ \(Bombay, 1921–1933\).

20 *mātr̥kāṃ paśunām ajñātāṃ viśvamātaraṃ sarvamantratantrajananīṃ ādikṣābtām …* \(SvT-Uddyota, vol. 1, p. 26\). See *Śivasūtravimarśinī* 1.4 \(p. 16\): *tasya ādiksāntarūpā ajñātā mātā mātr̥kā viśvajananī*: ‘its unknown mother, *mātr̥kā*, begetter of the universe, formed of \[the phonemes\] from *A* to *KṢA*’.

21 *prastaret*, says SvT 1.31b, verbal form explained by Kṣemarāja \(ibid., p. 277, l.1\) as an *ārṣa* form for *prastr̥ṇīyāt.*

22 *ekacittaḥ* is explained in the *Uddyota* \(vol. 1, p. 26\) as *mantrodayanibhālanapravaṇaḥ*, intent upon the perception of the production \(creation or coming up\) of the mantra.

23 The Mahāmātr̥kā or Mahāmātaraḥ are in fact usually seven: the so-called Saptamātr̥kā – and this is the number mentioned in this passage of the SvT and in Kṣemarāja’s *Uddyota*, in spite of the fact that the text actually enumerates not seven but eight goddesses.

24 The *mūrtimantra* is the mantra which, in the ritual, serves to invoke the subtle bodily aspect \(*mūrti*\) of the deity being worshipped – or which is, or represents, on a subtle plane, the body of the deity.

25 *ante’syā uddharen mantrān yathākramaniyogataḥ//* 37//

Comm.: *asyā – mātr̥kāpūjāyāḥ, yathakramam – āsanamantramūrtimantrādikramena yo niyogaḥ – tattanmantramūrtimantrādikramena yo niyogaḥ – tattanmantrāvācya devatānusaṃdhānaparatvaṃ tena.*

26 See for instance *Rauravāgama, kriyāpada*, 1.1–21.

On the notion of *aṇga*, I refer to Hélène Brunner’s study, ‘Les membres de Śiva’, *Asiatische Studien/Etudes Asiatiques*, XL-2, 1986, pp. 90–132.

27 This is composed usually of milk, curds, ghee, cow urine and dung. Another group of five offering substances is that called *pañcāmr̥ta*, which, in ordinary rituals, consists of five ‘innocuous’ substances such as molasses, honey, ghee, curds and milk, but, in Kaula rites, is made up of human fluids and excreta mixed with alcoholic liquor \(*vāmāmr̥ta*\). On these, see A. Sanderson, *op. cit.*, note 63, p. 113.

28 The officiating person is, if not an *ācārya*, at least an initiated *putraka* or *sādhaka.* Note that here as in the case of the NT, the adept is to act ‘with devotion’: the manipulation of the sacred does not exclude faith, devotion, nor does it exclude its correlate, divine grace.

29 In the Pāñcarātra tradition \(as in other ones\), each of the fifty phonemes – as a phoneme and as a deity – has a name or names. *A* may thus be called *aprameya, prathama, viṣṇu*, etc. *Śl.* 32 to 58 of this chapter enumerates these names. Such lists of names are given as appendices in the Sanskrit editions of the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* or of the LT \(see also app. XIII of the English translation of that tantra\). See too Dakṣiṇamūrti’s *Uddhārakośa*, or chapter 347 of the *Agnipurāṇa* \(*ekākṣarābhidhānam.*\).

30 The LT, chapter 25, *śl*. 30–37 \(p. 86, p. 136–137 of the English translation\) expresses itself in a similar fashion: ‘The phonemes made powerful by the *śakti* of Lakṣmī are the source of all mantras. They must be intensely worshipped, praised and meditated upon using their names …, they participate mutually in each other when used in mantras. There is nothing in this movable and immovable world that is not produced by them. Although the forms of mantras are supreme, divine and eternal, they are yet conceived of as produced by the phonemes … Just as one imagines divisions in space which is one, so, for convenience’s sake, one imagines that there are divisions between phonemes \[though they are indivisible sound-units\] … Having thus clearly realized in his mind this presence of the phonemes in the mantras, and having worshipped them on the ground, in the lotus \[the diagram\] and in the body of the goddess, he should extract them \(*mantrān samuddharet*\)’. The LT, chapters 23–24, describes in details how to display the *mātr̥kā*, the mother of the mantras \(*mantramātr̥kā*\), the divine power creating and pervading the cosmos, and how to worship her before extracting the mantras. The tantra adds that once the lotus-shaped *cakra* has been drawn, the adept is to visualize the *mantramātr̥kā*, who is the Self of Viṣṇu as seated on the pericarp of the lotus, her body being made of the fifty phonemes. He is to worship her before extracting the mantras. The *Sanatkumārasaṃhitā* \(Indrarātra, chapter 2\), gives a similar description.

31 A good summary of this passage is given by Marion Rastelli, *Philosophisch-theologische Grundanschauungen der Jayākhyāsaṃhitā* \(Vienne, 1999\), pp. 126–128.

32 There are fifty-one letters when the vedic l̥ is added after *KṢA.*

33 LT 24, 1–34, pp. 80–82; pp. 127–130 of the English translation.

34 In the LT, chapters 23 and 24, there is a very complete and interesting description of how to display the *mātr̥kā*, the mother of mantras \(*mantramātr̥kā*, the divine energy pervading the cosmos she has begotten, and how to worship her before extracting the mantras. The tantra adds that once the diagram has been drawn, one must visualise the *mantramātr̥kā* who is the very Self of Viṣṇu as being on the pericarp of the lotus, her body adorned by and made of the fifty phonemes. She is to be worshipped by the master who must identify himself with her before extracting the mantras \(LT, pp. 77–81\). The *Sanatkumārasaṃhitā*a \(Indrarātra, chapter 2: *mantroddhāra*, pp. 228ff. of the Adyar, 1969 edition\) gives a largely similar description.

35 On *mātr̥kā* and *śabdarāśi* as on *mātr̥kā* and *mālinī*, see Padoux, *Vāc*, chapter 5, pp. 305–329.

36 On the *prastāras* and *gahvaras*, see Appendix I of *The Ṣaṭsāhasra Saṃhitā*, chapters 1–5 \(Leiden, 1982\), edited and translated by J.A. Schoterman: it is a very complete and interesting study of the *prastāra* and *gahvara* system, based on an as yet unedited text of the Kubjikāmata Kaula tradition, the *Saṃvartārthaprekāśa* of Mukundarāja, where a large number of such diagrams are reconstructed.

Appendix II of Schoterman’s study \(pp. 210–221\) is on Mālinī, both as an order of letters and as a goddess, and on Śabdarāśi, both as the Sanskrit alphabet and as the god Śabdarāśibhairava.

The fourth chapter of the *Kubjikiāmatatantra* – KMT \(75–106\) describes the extraction of mantras from the *mālinīgahvara. mālinī* being feminine, it is the energy aspect of phonemes that prevails here. The goddess Mālinī is said in the tantra to be the supreme matrix \(*parā yoni*\) of the Rudras and Yoginīs.

There is a *Yonigahvaratantra* where a *gahvara* is said to be the matrix \(*yoni*\) of all mantras. *Gahvaras* are also described in the *Gorakṣasaṃhitā*.

37 One finds frequently in India prescribed processes that are as theoretically or apparently constraining as they are in actual practice flexible and adaptable. This is met with continually in Āgamic ritual prescriptions. But it corresponds, in fact, to a very general attitude in Hinduism, where, very often, the general prescribed ruling is accompanied by so many circumstantial precisions or exceptions that it can eventually be adapted to any issue. In the same way, in purāṇic hinduism, to quote Madeleine Biardeau \(‘*Etudes de mythologie hindoue*’ BEFEO, LVIII, pp. 63–65\), ‘while the official aim is to be freed of rebirth, all functions so as to allow the world to go on existing eternally’. This seems to be a characteristic trait of the Hindu religious-social consciousness, one of the ways in which Hinduism integrates and resolves its contradictions.

38 Two texts that I happen to have at my disposal: others could as well have been quoted.

39 Pp. 1–26, vol. 4 of the KSTS edition of the SvT.

40 This is Ksemarāja’s gloss.

41 *śl.* 3 to 10 enumerate various deities or supernatural beings of whom the adept might be an *amśa* and the efffect this will have. Thus the adept who has *brahmāmṣa* will be devoted to the Veda, with *rudrāṃśa* he will be *rudrabhakta*; the adept with *amśa* of *the* Gandharvas will sing constantly, that of Kāma will love courtesans \(*gaṇikapriya*\), and so forth. In all these cases, explains Kṣemarāja, the deity will give the adept the fruit corresponding to its power after being meditated upon, its mantra being recited and being offered an oblation \(*svasiddheḥ phaladāḥ sarve svadhyānajapahomataḥ – śl.* 11a\).

42 Pp. 8–9, vol. 4; the process is not described in the Tantra but in the commentary.

43 There are many periphrases for designating human flesh used as ritual offering. Used here are the two rather unusual terms *vaihāyasa* and *dhvaja*, which, according to Kṣemarāja’s explanation, are used as meaning \[the flesh\] of a man who has been hanged \(*udbaddha*\), and of a man who has been executed by impalement \(*śūlāropita*\). However, as Professor Alexis Sanderson \(whose help in this matter I gratefully acknowledge\) suggests Kṣemarāja may have interchanged the meanings of these two terms which are sometimes to be met with, the two sorts of human flesh being paired for option, in Hindu and Buddhist tantras.

Common terms for sacrificial human flesh are *mahāmāṃsa* \(great flesh\), *mahādhūpa* \(great incense\), *mahākṣmā*, etc.

44 The same practice is described briefly \(and more clearly\) in Kṣemarāja’s commentary of NT 8. 59b–63, vol.1, pp. 208–209.

45 On this see for instance the ŚT, 2. 127–128 and its commentary \(vol. 1, p. 102\). This *cakra* is shown and explained in G. Bühnemann’s study of *puraścaraṇa* in T. Goudriaan, ed., *Ritual and Speculation in early Tantrism.* Albany: SUNY Press, 1992, p. 100.

46 This *cakra* is mentioned in the KT 15, 86. It is reproduced on p. 97 of G. Bühnemann’s study quoted above.

47 It is shown and explained in Bühnemann, *op. cit*., p. 101.

48 See Bühnemann, *op. cit*., p. 96.

On all these methods, see the commentary of ŚT, 2.129–131 \(vol. 1, pp. 102–112\) which refers and quotes several tantras: MVT, *Mantramukāvali*, and \(frequently\) *Piṇgalāmata*. The *Tārabhaktisuddhārṇava* \(TBhS\), a seventeenth century manual, in its section on *aṃśa*, quotes in its tenth chapter \(pp. 359–366\) many such texts.

Krsṇa-vaiṣṇava practices of this sort \(very similar to the Śaiva ones\) are described, in French, with reference mainly to the *Rāmārcaṇcandrik*ā, in R.V. Joshi, *Rituel de la dévotion kr̥ṣṇaïte* \(Pondichéry, 1959\), pp. 20–22. The diagram with four squares is shown there. This diagram and those used in other *aṃśa/ka* practices \(often called *śuddhi* in the sense of discharge\) are to be found in most contemporary ritual manuals, in all Indian tongues. For example, in Hindi: *Mantrasiddhi kā upāya*, by Bhadraśīla Śarma \(Allahabad, 1968\).

49 The *kūrmacakra* is described in the ŚT, 2.133–137 and in pp. 114–117 \(vol. 2\) of the commentary, without, however, the way to use it being clearly explained. This is an important diagram used also in other ritual circumstances, in *puraścaraṇa* notably. It is also described in the short chapter 20 of the *Pheṭkāriṇītantra*, where it is explained how to use it to determine the *aṃśa*; the tantra also mentions the mantras whose validity has not been checked.

50 It is sometimes also called *mantrārādhana*. The term *puraścaraṇa* can also be applied to the worship of the mantra – *sādhanaṃ mūlamantrasya puraścaraṇam ucyate*, says a text quoted in the TBhS, p. 315 – since it is the preliminary act \(*puraskriyā*\) of the mastery of the mantra. On *puraścaraṇa*, see G. Bühnemann’s study ‘On Puraścaraṇa: Kulārṇavatantra, chapter 15’, in T. Goudriaan, ed., *Ritual and Speculation in Early Tantrism.*

51 See for instance the cult of two Yoginīs prescribed in YH 3 166.

52 The SvT, in chapter 8, *śl*. 3–10, enumerates the different powers the adept will possess if he has the *aṃśa* of the mantra of various deities: see above, note 36.

53 On these magical acts, see T. Goudriaan, *Māyā Divine and Human* \(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1978\), which is according to its sub-title ‘a study of magic in its religious foundations in Sanskrit texts, with a particular attention to a fragment on Viṣṇu’s Māyā preserved in Bali’ – a very interesting study.

The TBhS, chapter 10 \(pp. 359–366\) gives the rules for *mantravicāra* to be practised with different diagrams for the ‘six \[magical\] acts’.

54 The KT 15.97 excludes thus *kūṭamantras*, these being however, according to the tantra’s commentary, mantras consisting of a group of consonants. The same tantra \(15.97–99\) excludes also different mantras, such as those given by a woman, received in a dream, or those originating from the four Kula traditions \(*caturāmnāyaja*\) – which would exclude at least the *mūlamantras* of all the Kaula deities – and so forth. In this case, as in other ones, exceptions are invoked to blunt the edge of the general rule.

55 These mantras are among those excluded by the KT, as said in the preceding note.

56 For instance in the Sanatkumārasaṃhitā, Indrarātra, 2.





### 3 Japa

1 This is an English version, corrected, emended or when necessary updated of the paper *japa*, published in the *BEFEO*, LXXVI, 1967, pp. 117–164.

2 The *Amarakośa* 2.7,47 says: *svādhyāyaḥ syaj japaḥ*, underlining thus either the role of *japa* in the *svādhyāya* or the fact that all *japa* is a sacrifice of the word, and thus, like the *svādhyāya* a *mahāyajña*, a very important ritual action.

3 The Brāhmaṇas relate silence \(*tuṣṇīm*\), mumbling \(*jalpa*\), speaking in a low voice \(*upāmśu*\) to the indefinite or illimited \(*anirukta*\): ŚBr.5.4.4,13\). The mumbling or murmur \(*jalpa*\) is associated with life \(AiTBr. 2.39,1. See L. Silburn, *Instant et cause*, Paris, 1995.

4 According to the LT \(39.35\), the *vācikajapa* is to be used for minor rituals; the *upāmṣu* for rituals which bring success or power \(*siddhikarmāni*\), the mental \(*mānasa*\) one, for rites which bring both success and liberation. The *japa* done by *dhyāna* \(meditation or visualisation of a deity?\) is for achieving success in all cases \(*sarvasiddhi*\).

The three sorts of *japa* are sometimes related to the three levels of *vāc*: *paśyantī, madhyamā* and *vaikharī* – thus Kṣemarāja *ad* SvT 2.146–7. Or the commentary of Kṣemarāja on SvT 2. 146–7:


*ātma na sr̥ṇuteyaṃ tu mānaso ‘sau prakīrtitaḥ*

*ātmanā śruyate yas tu tampāṃśuṃ vijānate*/146/

*pare ṣr̥ṇvanti yaṃ devi saśabdaḥ sa udāhr̥taḥ*/


where he explains:


*manaso madhyamāyam vāci/upāmśusaśabdau tu*

*sūkṣmasthūlaprayatnayāṃ vaikharyam.*


5 These aspects of *japa* in the MBh are studied by V.M. Bedekar, ‘The place of *japa* in the Mokṣadharmaparvan \(MBh XII. 189–193\) and the Yogasūtras’, *ABORI*, vol. XLIV, 1963 \(pp. 63–74\). On the relationship of *japa* with Yoga, see J.W. Hauer, *Der Yoga* \(Stuttgart, 1958\), pp. 198–199.

6 *hotr̥ japaṃ japati retas tat siñcatyupāmśu. japaty upāṃśviva vai retasaḥ siktiḥ*. The same text \(2. 31–32\), regarding the recitation of the silent praise, *tūṣṇīṃ śaṃsa*, which consists in the *japa* of *bhur bhuvaḥ svar*, considered as the essence of the sacrifice, parallels it, too, with the emission of semen. See L. de La Vallée Poussin, *Etudes et matériaux* \(London, 1898\), pp. 120–123.

7 On Hindu conceptions concerning sexual energy, its spending or its storing, see Sudhir Kakar, *The Inner World. A Psycho-analytic Study of Childhood and Society in India* \(Delhi, 1981\). See too, A. Padoux, ‘Le monde hindou et le sexe’, *Cahiers Internationaux de Sociologie*, vol. LXXVI, 1984.

8 I refer to Alexis Sanderson, ‘The Śaiva Age – The Rise and Dominance of Śaivism during the Early Medieval Period’, *in* Shingo Einoo, ed., *Genesis and Development of Tantrism* \(Tokyo: Institute of Oriental Culture, University of Tokyo, 2009, pp. 41–350\).

9 A unity that reflects the unity of the Hindu world. Buddhist ṭantric practices, too, are marked by the same representations \(on the creative efficacy of consciousness or on the image of the body notably\).

10 ‘It has come to designate, in classical India, all types of prayer’, see L. Renou, ‘La valeur du silence dans le culte védique’, *JAOS*, 1979, pp. 11–18.

11 Hélène Brunner, who read a first draft of this chapter and made a number of useful suggestions, remarked that it would have probably been more rational, and clearer, for me to distinguish between the cases where the worship is the main portion and raison d’être of a rite, *japa* being accessory, and those where the *japa* is the essential part, the worship being accessory. She also drew my attention to the fact that it is in *kāmya* rites – especially those performed by the *sādhaka* – that *japa* takes the larger place, which is true, see note 16.

12 As, for instance, for Gaṇeśa: *OṂ HRĪṂ ŚRĪṂ ṄLAUṂ GAṂ Gaṇapataye vara varda sarvagaṇaṃ me vaśa ānaya THAḤ THAḤ*.

13 *akārādi kṣakārāntam aksaramālā vidur budhāḥ* \(*Japalakṣaṇam* – ms. no. 545, Gov. Orl. Library, Madras\). The *Nityotsava* \(NU\), p. 127, enumerates thus the rosaries made of the *varṇas* of the *mātr̥kā* ‘from the letter *A* to the letter *KṢA*’ and those made of *rudrākṣa*, pearls, rubies, crystal and so forth. The *japa* of the *varṇamālā* is prescribed in a number of texts. A Śaiva Upaniṣad, the *Akṣamālikopaniṣad*, describes this *japa*, which is done with a rosary and includes various mental visualisations.

14 See *Pheṭkāriṇī* \(PheṭkT\) 18.1–8:


*bhūtalipyā pūṭīkr̥tyā yo mantram bhajate naraḥ /*

*kramotkramācchatāvr̥ttyā tasya siddho bhaven mantraḥ* //1//


The following *ślokas* describe this action and its effects. This technique is also prescribed by the KT 15.16. On *saṃpuṭīkaraṇa*, see here, chapter 7, note 5.

15 *mātr̥kājapamātreṇa mantrāṇāṃ koṭikoṭayaḥ/japitāḥ syur na sandaho yataḥ sarvaṃ tadudbhavam* //18// – KT 15.18\).

16 See, for instance, the *japa* of the *gāyatrī* among Brahmins of Gujerat described by L. Sinclair Stevenson, *The Rites of the Twice-Born* \(New Delhi: Orl. Books Reprint Corporation, 1971\), p. 223. Or, more generally, R.B.Ś. Chandra Vidyarnava, *The Daily Practice of the Hindus*, chapter IV, *Sandhyā*,, especially pp. 39–42.

17 Various prescriptions on favourable periods for *japa* are to be found in TBhS, pp. 316–317, where several texts are quoted. The JayS 14.188–189 prescribes different periods according to the nature \(*sātvika*, etc.\) of the adept. See also AgPur 292.31ff.: *mantrasya devatā tāvat tithivāreṣu vai japet*:/ etc.

There is also a rule in several texts \(AgPur, ŚT, TRT, etc.\) saying that *japa* is fruitless when done while the mantra ‘sleeps’: *svāpakāle tu mantrasya japo na phalapradaḥ*, says the *Rudrayāmala* quoted in TBhS, p. 324. But the times when a mantra is ‘asleep’, or ‘awake’ are not to do with the time of clocks. For the AgP \(292.8\) they are linked with the flow of *prāṇa* in the *nāḋis idā* and *piṅgalā* \(see Padoux ‘On Mantras and Mantric Practices in the *Agni*-*Purāṇa*’, *Purāṇa*, vol. XX/1, 1978, p. 59\). Other texts say that the ‘sleeping’ state of the mantra is the effect of a *doṣa* due to its phonetic structure – so ŚT 2.84: *trivarṇo haṃsahīno yaḥ suśuptaḥ sa udīritaḥ* – this defect is cured, the ŚT says, by showing the *yonimudrā* together with the *udāna prāṇa.* The commentary on this *śloka* \(ŚT 2.110, vol. 1, p. 94\), however, says that the correction of the defect is necessary only in *kāmya* rites. This point would tend to justify Hélène Brunner’s suggestion I mentioned previously \(note 10\) that insofar as *japa* is a manipulation of the power of the word for particular ends, *japa* would especially be used by *sādhakas* rather than by liberation-seekers \(*mumukṣu*\).

18 *Infra*, p. 42.

19 This is also called *pūrvaseva*, which designates more generally the preliminary propitiation of a deity by the *sādhaka* to obtain supernatural powers – see the entry on that word in TAK3.

20 I will come back on this later \(see pp. 34–35\). On the *mantrasādhana*, see Hélène Brunner’s study, ‘Le *sādhaka*, personnage oublié du śivaïsme du sud’, *J.As.*, 1975, pp. 411–443, where, for the choice of the place, the author refers notably to the Mr̥g *Cp*. 1.95ff.

21 KT 15.22–30. Similar prescriptions are to be found in the PRKS 3.2.35–3/1 \(p. 544\), or in the TBhS, p. 317, which quotes three different texts; or in the *Makuṭāgama* 2.766–768 \(information H. Brunner\).

22 See A. Sanderson, ‘Power and Purity among the Brahmins of Kashmir’, in M. Carrithers, *et al*., eds., *The Category of the Person* \(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985\), pp. 200–202.

23 See, for instance, the prescriptions of the JRY 2.11 for the *sādhana* of the goddess Mahājhaṇkariṇī: the *japa* is done at night, in a cremation ground, a temple to the Mothers or a place for ‘Heroes’ \(*vīrasthāna*\), while wearing black clothes, etc.

24 Before a ritual is performed it is necessary to enclose the ritual area by means of a rite named *digbandhana*, which both delimitates and protects it from dangers coming from outside. On such a rite, see, for instance, TBhS pp. 317–348.

More generally, on the question of the protection of the ritual area against dangers and impurity felt as always menacing – on the Hindu preoccupation with boundaries, see D. Shulman, ‘The enemy within: idealism & dissent in South Indian Hinduism’, in S.N. Eisenstadt *et al., Orthodoxy, Heterodoxy and Dissent in India* \(Berlin: Mouton, 1984\), pp. 11ff.

25 In principle, one must not be lying nor standing – see KT15.032–33, or the MatP *Kp*. 11.12b–13 where other references are given \(information H. Brunner\).

26 See Mr̥g *Cp*. 75b: *sādhakaḥ. sādhyaveṣadharaḥ.* The same text, *Kp.* 3.1–45b–47, mentions the colours of the different aspects of Ṣiva \(inf. Brunner\). All worship \(as well as many other rites\) are to be performed wearing the proper sort of clothing. Usually it must be pure and clean; but in Tantric context it may, on the contrary, be chosen so as to mark the transgression: rags, black material for the Kāpalikās, transvestism in goddess cults, and so forth.

27 Such *pavitras* are usually rings of sacred herbs bound around the finger. On the subject, see the SP, vol. 2.

28 On all these points, see Rāghavabhaṭt .a’s commentary on ŚT 16.54–56 \(vol. 2, pp. 656ff., which is on *puraścaraṇa*, and quotes a number of texts. Detailed prescriptions are also found in recent works, which shows that these instructions are still valid: see, for instance, Karanidan Sethiya, *Mantra-vidyā*, Calcutta, sam. 2033 \(in Hindi\), pp. 10–16 – the directions given concern *japa* in general. For the author, the colour of the clothes to be worn must be in accordance with the *bhāva* of the deity. Sewed garments are often prohibited – which is a general rule among observant Brahmins, for all rituals.

29 The *Brahmayāmalatantra* is as yet \(2009\) unpublished, It has been studied and partly edited by Shaman Hatley \(thesis, 2007\).

*Bhrūkuṭi*, contracted brow, is a facial expression typical of wrathful deities – Bhairava, here. *Aṭṭahāsa* is the laugh of Bhairava or other wrathful deities \(such, for instance, as the corpse-like Sadāśiva imagined by the yogin as lying at the base of the *triśūla* on top of which are the three supreme goddesses of the Trika – Parā, Parāparā and Aparā.

30 This still unpublished tantra is being studied and is in the course of edition by Judit Törzsök.

31 On these *nyāsas* see the next section.

32 NU, p. 93; *Prāṇatoṣiṇī*, p. 421, quoting the *Sarrasvatītantra*, which prescribes a preliminary purification of the mouth, *mukhaśodhana*. The GT prescribes the utterance of the *setu OṂ* before and after the *japa*. Other prescriptions in the JS, chapter 14.

33 NU pp. 93 and 94.

34 See for instance the LT 28.47–50 already quoted which prescribes alternate *japas* and meditation.

35 ŚT 16.56, comm. \(pp. 655–6\). For Kr̥ṣṇa rites, see R.V. Joshi, *Le rituel de la dévotion kr̥ṣṇaïte* \(Pondichéry, 1959\). Many informations given there come from the *Haribhaktivilāsa*, an important ritual manual. See too the *Nāradapañcarātra* – *Ṣrī Nārada Pañcaratanam* \(Sacred Books of the Hindus, 23, reprint, New York 1974\).

36 The comm. on Mr̥g, *Cp* 1.76 prescribes audible, murmured or mental *japa* depending as to whether the mantra to be mastered by *mantrasādhana* is of an inferior, middling, or superior sort \(without saying what are these three sorts of mantras\).

37 Thus NU, pp. 129–130, quoting the *Svachandatantrasāra*: *japas tu ṣaḋvidhaḥ vācika mānasa yogavācika yogamānasika vaṇmānasikayaugikaḥ* – the four last sorts corresponding to the association of the utterance of the mantra with yogic practices. On *japa, prāṇa* and yoga, see further down. The Makuṭāgama 2.760 lists *japas* in descending order as follows: *mānasa, kaṇṭhoṣtha* \(?\), *upāṃśu* and *vācika.*

TĀ 29. 82–88, quoting the *Yogasaṃcāratantra*, describes different sorts of *japa* which are yogic practices involving the movement of *prāṇa.*

38 ‘Hasty *japa* brings about sickness and slow utterance destroys wealth’ writes a contemporary author: introduction to an edition of the *Mantramahodadhi* \(Mud\) \(Delhi, 1981\)

39 YS 1.28: *tajjapastadarthabhāvanam* ‘Its \[*sil*. of the mantra\] repetition and concentration on its meaning \[should be made\]’.

40 One may well ask oneself, in such cases, whether the mind of the practitioner is fastened on this mental image, or on the sound of the mantra he recites. Perhaps, the sound forms, as it were, a basis whence the visual image arises.

41 On this subject, see the studies of J.F. Staal \(for whom rites are without meaning\), *The Science of Ritual* \(Poona, 1982\), and *Ritual and Mantras*: *Rules without Meaning* \(Indian edition, Delhi, 1996\).

42 See YH 3.191, and Dī, p. 332. The *japakāla* may last a fraction of a second: there is no real duration. But such *japas* are in fact a mental attitude, a *bhāvanā*, of the practitioner. Many such instances are to be found – see, for instance, the *Kulamūlaratnapañcakāvatāra* of the Kubjikā tradition, 3.17.

43 In the Mahādevayajña ritual of Tanjore, for instance \(in 1951, as reported by C.G. Diehl in *Instrument and Purpose*, Lund, 1956\), were performed a hundred thousand repetitions of the thousand Names of the Goddess, a hundred million recitations of the *śrīvidyā*, etc.

44 PRKS, p. 550. The form or the material of the seat, the clothes, the bodily posture, etc., vary according to the context and circumstances of the *japa*. See, for instance, MatP *Kp* 11.12ff. \(vol. 2, p. 198\). In all cases one is to follow the prescriptions given for the ritual which includes the *japa*.

45 One could say here that insofar as we may consider mantras to be performative utterances in the sense of Austin and Searle, the circumstances mentioned previously in which the *japa* is to be made to produce the desired effect are merely an intensely meticulous case of the necessity of the appropriate social conditions of utterance for it to be effective as defined by these two authors. On performative utterances, one may refer to J.L. Austin, *How to Do Things with Words* \(Oxford, 1975\), and to J.R. Searle, *Speech Acts* \(Cambridge, 1980\).

46 Śākta texts sometimes prescribe counting on eight phalanxes only, which results in sixty-four \(8 × 8\), an important number in Tantra: there are sixty-four Bhairava tantras, sixty-four Yoginīs, and so forth. See for instance *Yoginītantra* 2.30, Another method \(on nine phalanxes\), GT 18.11–12.

47 The JayS 14.72–76 \(*meror taṇghananiṣedhaḥ*\) explains how to do this. For *japa* of the *varṇamālā*,, *KṢA* is considered as the Meru, but it can be included in the count: see *Mantrakaumudī* of Devanātha Thakura \(Darbhanga, 1960\), 14: *anulomavilomais tair binduvāṇmātr̥kākṣaraiḥ/kṣamerukaiḥ sāṣṭvargaiḥ kl̥iptayā varṇamālayā* //13//.

If one uses the hand for counting \(*karamālā*\), the second of the middle finger \(at least according to some texts\) is to play the role of the Meru. But the counting is not done going forward and backward \(see *Yoginītantra* 2.40: *anulomavilomabhyāṃ sarvamālāsu saṃjapet*/*kevalaṃcānulomena prajapet karamālayā*\). For the JayS 14.72ff., the rosary is always to be counted in the same way, a particular gesture avoiding the overstepping of the Meru.

When one does *japa* of the phonemes \(*varṇamālā*\), from *A* to *KṢA*, one recites it twice, *anuloma* then *vilomena*, the first phonemes of each of the eight *varga* \(*A, KA, TA*, etc.\) so as to reach a total of 108. According to the JayS, the *akṣamālā* has 108, 54 or 27 beads.

48 This is a case of the rule prevalent in the Hindu world that the index is never to be used except in destructive or malignant rites. See GT 18.27–30 which prescribes the use of different fingers for different aims. Prescriptions of the same sort in the *Śivārcaṇacandrikā* quoted in SP1, pp. 216–217: one must use different fingers depending on the the *japa* being audible, whispered, or mental.

49 PRKS, p. 551: *vastreṇācchādya tu karaṃ dakṣiṇaṃ yaḥ sadā japet.*

50 See YH 3.189b: ‘the *japa* once thus accomplished, it must be offered in the left hand of the Goddess’, *evaṃkr̥tvā japaṃ devyā vāmahaste nivedayet.*

51 If a new rosary breaks, one is to repeat a thousand times the Aghoramantra, but merely a hundred times if the rosary is an old one \(see *prāyaścittavidhiḥ*, 48, SP2, pp. 260– 261\). The breaking of the rosary is *karmachidrakaraṇam*: it causes the destruction of the \[good\] *karman* \(JS 14.93\).

52 *OṂHŪṂ VAUṂ Viśvakṣeṇāya namaḥ*.

53 Pp. 325–329 of the TBhS are on *puraścaraṇa*., enumerating or describing its rites. See too Rāgahvabhaṭṭa’s commentary on ŚT 15.54 \(vol. 2, pp. 656ff.\) which quotes many texts; or GT. 18. For the vaiṣṇava rite, see the *Nāradapañcarāttra*, III, chapters 10 to 14. Kane, *History of Dharmaśāstra*, vol. 5/2, pp. 1008–1112 are on *puraścaraṇa*, with many textual references. See also H. Brunner’s study, ‘Le *sādhaka*’ quoted in note 13 of chapter 2.

54 KT 15.18, the *pūjā* of this list is the threefold daily *sandhya* – a *nitya* ritual.

55 See Hélène Brunner’s \(French\) translation, and her notes, pp. 282–284 of the study quoted in notes 16 and 44.

56 The ŚT 18.14 \(vol. 2, p. 716\) prescribes 24 million \(*tattvalakṣaṃ japan mantram*\) repetitions of the *mūlamantra* of Śiva, followed by 24,000 oblations, which implies that the ritual lasts several days or months. Manuals of ritual discuss such details and the time necessary for such practices.

57 See thus the *Nāradapañcarātra*, III. chapter 14, *śl*. 15ff., where the *japa* of two mantras of Kr̥ṣṇa protects children against demons \(15\), keeps away harmful astral influences \(19\), gives long life \(28\), brings rain \(45\), protects from illnesses and from sudden death \(52\), etc. This *japa* is to be accompanied by offerings in the fire whilst meditating and visualising the child Kr̥ṣṇā in his ‘games’ \(*līlā*\).

58 Cf. GT 18.68: *agnir eva mukhaṃ devyās tasmād agnau hutet sadā*. Those are ancient notions.

59 Kane \(*op. cit*., p. 1109\) says thus that, according to the *Kaulāvalinirṇaya*, a rite of *japa* is to be done during the night in a cremation ground with a corpse. The TBhS \(p. 334\), quoting the *Svātantratantra*, describes another nocturnal rite where the *japa* accompanies sexual ritual practices.

60 The same prescription \(but without the *mudrā*\) is found in the Mr̥g. *Kp*. 4, 5 \(p. 42, where Bhaṭṭanārāṇayakaṇṭha’s commentary is very explicit\).

61 This is at least how the rite appears to me. H. Brunner, who knows the subject much better than I do, feels that I stretch unduly the meaning of this action. For her, the flower symbolises the whole *japa*, this symbol being what is given to the deity \(see Mr̥g’s French translation, p. 55, note 2\).

62 But a Tantric *pūjā* is always seen as a process of identification with the deity that is worshipped, an identification that is ritually achieved \(or played out\) several times during the cult.

63 On these elements, see here chapter 4 on *nyāsa*.

64 *devīnāṃ vāmahaste tu devānāṃ dakṣiṇe ‘rpayet*, says the *Rudrayāmala* quoted in the *Tāriṇīpārijata*, p. 94: this eighteenth-century work gives a number of details on the *japa* \(*japamālā*\), of the phonemes of the alphabet, pp. 87–89.

65 The LT 40.18 says \(the goddess is speaking\): ‘having completed the *japa* according to the prescribed method, he should give it over to Me and imagine the ś*akti* in the form of *japa* as being in my mouth’. Here too the deity absorbs the power of the word when the utterance of the *japa* ends. The officiant is now to ring a bell identified with Sarasvatī, the goddess of speech, which will cause the mantras to come and thus contribute to the efficacy of the recitation. There follows a ritual worship which will ensure the mantrin’s mastery of the mantra or the fruitful result of its use \(*mantrasiddhiṃ nigacchati – śl.* 29\).

66 See for instance *Daily Practice of the Hindus*, chapter 9, ‘Sandhyā of the Yajurvedins’, section 23, *japanivedana*: having recited the *gāyatrī* 108, 28 or 10 times, the officiant, seated in front of the image of the deity, pours some water in the palm of his right hand while saying *anena* \(*daśa, aṣṭaviṃśati*, etc.\) *saṃkhyayā japam. bhagavan* \(*Brahmā Visṇu*, etc.\) *svarūpi sevitā priyatāṃ namaḥ*, and pours that water in the hand of the *devatā* \(ibid., p. 109\).

On the other hand, the private cult that the temple officiant performs at home \(or in the temple\) for himself, where the *japanivedana* we have seen takes place, is entirely Tantric.

A mental *nivedana* linked to the movement of *prāṇa*, at the end of the *japa*, is prescribed in SvT 2.136–143.

We may, apropos of the practices described above, underline once more the fact that Tantric practices, far from contradicting the Brahmanic tradition \(even if it often runs counter to it\), takes place within this tradition: Tantra, I believe, brings to light the inner virtualities of Brahmanism.

67 Here is, as an example, how a small modern manual \(*Śrīkāīīnityārcaṇa*, Prayāg, Kalyan Mandir, saṃ 2030, p. 89\) describes \(I have shortened a little\) the *japa* at the end of Kālī’s *pūjā*: after the preliminary rites, pay homage \(*tarpaṇa* and *pūjā*\) to the rosary with the mantra *Śrīdakṣiṇakālikā-akṣamālāṃ tarpayāmi pūjāyāmi namaḥ*; then pray to the rosary to give success \(*me siddhidā bhava*\). One holds it then with the right hand and says another prayer to remove all obstacles. Having saluted the rosary, one will place it on the middle phalanx of the middle finger and touch it with the thumb saying *OṂ*, which is done while ‘meditating’ \(*dhyāna*\) the form of the goddess. Then one will pray to the rosary, asking it to grant happiness and success. Having held it to his head while reciting as before the *setu* and *mahāsetu*, the adept or devotee will practise a *prāṇāyāma.* He then does a *r̥ṣyādinyāsa* and a *karāṇganyāsa.* Then the *japa* itself is to be done. Once finished, it is to be offered, together with a special *arghya* and *amr̥ta*, in the left hand of the goddess, while saying *OṂ guhyātiguhyagoptri tvaṃ gr̥hanas matkr̥taṃ japaṃ. siddhir bhavatu me devi tvatprasādānan maheśvari. idaṃ japaṃ śrīdakṣiṇakālikādevyā samarpayāmi svāhā.* Then one salutes her making the *yonimudrā* and saying *HRĪṂ siddhayai namaḥ.* After which the rosary is to be kept in a secret place. The *japa* is to be followed by a *homa.*

The TĀ 29, describing a *pūja* according to the *Mādhavakula* and quoting the *Yogasaṃcāratantra*, prescribes a *japa* of a 100,000 to 1,200,000 repetitions, linked to the ascent of *kuṇḋalinī*; it is said to be a murmuring \(*saṃjalpa*\) whose essential nature is an awareness of the subtle phonic vibration \(*nādāmarśasvarūpiṇī*\).

68 In the case of the *japa* \(as part of the *mantrasādhana*\) prescribed in the NṢA 5, according to the number of repetitions \(from 100,000 – one *lakh* – to 900,000\), the mantrin would be freed from the sins of his previous lives, would be granted the eight ‘great powers’ \(*mahāsiddhi*\), or, for nine *lakhs*, the fusion with the deity \(ibid., *śl.*5–6\).

69 The fact that *śānti*, a favourable rite, is among the six magical actions \(and is even often quoted first\), as well as the fact that these acts are usually described in mythical and religious texts, show that the distinction religion/magic which I make here is problematic and, in fact, quite difficult to apply in the Indian context. This would also raise the more technical problem of the distinction between *kāmya* rites \(that of *śānti *notably\) and *nityā* rites – on which see H. Brunner’s observations in her seminars at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, Sciences Religieuses, in 1984.

70 See also *Vīṇaśikhatantra* \(ed. Goudriaan, Delhi, 1985\), *śl.* 224ff.

*śāntipuṣṭivaśākr̥tyucāṭana māraṇe* /

See too the explanatory note 62 in SP3, p. 166, or ibid., pp. 532–533, on *astrābhiṣeka* \(ritual sprinkling\). In the *māraṇa*, etc. rites, one utters the mantra without *bindu* or *nāda.*

72 One finds prescriptions of the same sort in the *Śeṣasaṃhitā* \(14.58–64,a,d 15, pp. 79–83\) in a passage concerning the *ṣaṭkarmāṇi.* Concerning the use of fingers, that of the index for destructive rites is normal \(see above\). In fact, prescriptions vary largely according to texts. The relationship between some physical aspects of *japa* and the nature of the rite does not appear to us *prima facie* to be logically grounded – though, admittedly, a more precise research on the subject may uncover symbolic reasons for this situation.

On the magical uses of mantras in contemporary India, one may refer to C.G. Diehl’s study, *Instrument and Purpose*, previously quoted.

73 See the observations of Hélène Brunner in SP3.

74 The omissions or errors repaired by *prāyaścitta* are, so to speak, technical accidents during the utterance. They are not the procedural errors or omissions – the ‘infelicities’ – which, in Austin’s then in Searle’s theory, make the speech acts ineffective. \(On mantras as illocutionary or perlocutionary acts, see A.C.S. McDermott, ‘Towards a pragmatics of mantra recitation’, *Journal of Indian Philosophy*, vol. 3, 1975, pp. 283–298.\)

75 See H. Brunner’s study ‘Le *sādhaka*.’, *JAs*, 1975, previously quoted.

76 *Sāttvatasaṃhitā*, with a commentary by Alasinga Bhatta, edited by V.V. Dvivedi \(Varanasi, 1982\).

77 Thus the *brahmavidyā* recited in the ear of a dying person, the *dīkṣā* being in that case limited to the repetition of a mantra, according to the TĀ 19. 31–33 – the recitation, in that case, is a mere ‘reading’ \(\(*paṭha*\) of the mantra.

78 See, for instance, SP3, note 54a, p. 221, where is quoted the Mr̥g, *Kp* 7, 98–110, prescribing a *japa* of the Svapnamāṇavakamantra, an invocation of the god of dreams \(necessary to be known for the *dīkṣā*\).

79 In the funerals, *antyeṣṭi*, for instance \(see SP3, pp. 372–3 and 610\), but it is in fact a *prāyaṣcitta*; or, in the cult of ancestors, the *ṣrāddha* \(ibid, pp. 656–657. The MatP *Cp* 10.73 prescribes 108 repetitions of the Bahurūpamantra to purify those who bear the corpse of an ascetic \(*yātin*\) to the place where he will be buried.

80 On this point, see Milton Singer, ‘The Radhâ-Krishna *bhajanas* of Madras city’ in M. Singer, ed., *Krishna*: *Myths, Rites and Attitudes* \(Honolulu: East-West Press Center, 1966\). See too the observations of Hélène Brunner in the Supplément of vol. 3, ‘Rites et Fêtes’, Fr. L’Hernault & M-L. Reiniche, eds. of the study carried out and published by The Ecole Française d’Extrême Orient, Paris, 1990–1999, *Tiruvannamalai, Un lieu saint sivaïte du Sud de l’Inde.*

81 See pp. 377–392 of that translation; a chart is given on p. 378 of the ascent of the *śrīvidyā* along the *suṣumnā*.

82 On these, see the very detailed notes of H. Brunner in SP3, pp. 358–396.

83 Infra, p. 46.

84 Commenting on the passage of the YH 3 on the *japa* of the *avasthās* and on the *śūnyas*, Amr̥tānanda uses the term *bhāvanā* to describe this process. On *bhāvanā*, see F. Chenet, ‘*Bhāvanā* et la créativité de la conscience’, *Numen*, vol. XXXIV, 1987, pp. 45–96.

In an analogous though somewhat different perspective, the TRT 38.18, apropos of the cult of the Yoginīs in the *śrīcakra*, mentions three different ways for identifying with the deity: *nyāsa*, which makes the body of the adept similar to that of the deity, *japa*, which creates this similarity \(*japas tanmayatārūpabhāvanam*\), and *homa*, as a symbolical offering of the universe which dissolves the multiplicity of the created world into the unity of the Self.

85 This sort of *japa is* sometimes described as a remembrance \(*smaraṇa*\). Thus YH 3.184, on the *japa* of the *avasthās*, or the *Varivasyārahasya* of Bhāskararāya, 52, on the *japa* of the *avasthās, śūnyas* and *viṣuvas*. This is due to the influence on these authors of the Pratyabhijñā system for which *smaraṇa* is a means for the realisation of the Absolute since, by linking the past to the present, it focuses the attention on the supreme reality underlying all phenomena.

86 This information I owe to Alexis Sanderson.

87 F.D. Lessing and A. Wayman, *op. cit*., p. 187.

On another analogous Buddhist practice, see Stephen Beyer, *The Cult of Tārā* \(Berkeley, 1973\), p. 450–452, ‘Reciting the mantra’. Simpler is the *japa* of chapter 3 of the *Mahāvairocanasūtra* \(ed. Tajima, pp. 117ff.\) where a meditative recitation \(*bunsho manju*\) is done by contemplating in one’s heart the shape of the letters of the mantra: one sees there the importance of the written sign in Sino-Japanese culture.

88 See Padoux, *Vāc.*

89 The *Yogīśvarīmata*, also called *Siddhayogeśvarīmata, Siddhamata, Siddhatantra*, etc., is often quoted in the TĀ. Its doctrine is said to be expounded in the MVT. A critical edition of selected chapters of this tantra, with an annotated translation, was done by Judit Törzsök in an unpublished habilitation thesis \(Paris, 2010\). However, few of the quotations of this tantra given in the TĀ are to be found in this edition, which is perhaps that of a shorter version.

The *Yoginīkaula* is quoted only once in the TĀ: is it the same text as the *Yoginītantra* mentioned in the JRY?

90 He quotes the following *śloka*:


*japet tu prānasāmyena tataḥ siddhir bhaved dhruvam* /

*nānyathā siddhim āpnoti hāsyam āpnoti sundari* // \(vol. 4/2, p. 30\).


91 Here is Jayaratha’s commentary: *tattadekapiṇḋādyātmakamantrarūpatayā bahir ullasantī varṇakuṇḋalinyākhyā parameśvarī śaktir yadi nāma prāṇasamā prāṇasāmyenodayam iyāt tadunmanā śvaikātmyena prasphured ityarthaḥ \(p. 32\).*

92 This at least is how one usually translates *haṃsa*, this bird being in fact a duck of sorts.

93 See for instance, SvT 7.54–55 or VBh 155: ‘21.600 time by day and night this *japa* is prescribed as that of the Goddess’. See too TĀ 7.47–50, where various divisions of the mantra and of its utterance all result in 21,600. This number of breaths per twenty-four hours is in fact perfectly real.

94 Thus SvT, VBh, TĀ, ŚSV, such Upaniṣads as *Dhyānabindu, Mahāvākya, Yogaśikhā*, and so forth. In the *Brahmavidy*ā Up., the *japa* of *haṃsa* is combined with that of OṂ and is associated to the ascent of *kuṇḋalinī*

95 *Gāyatrīs* can be composed on the model of the *savitrī* for all divinities.

96 A Tamil author who may have lived in the sixteenth century. This work was edited and translated in French and commented on by Tara Michael \(Pondichéry: Institut Français d’Indologie, 1975\).

97 Here is SvT 7.59:


*nāsyoccarāyitā kaścit pratihanta na vidyate*/

*svayam uccārate haṃsaḥ prāṇinām urasi sthitaḥ*//


The *ślokas* of VBh run as follows:


*sakāreṇa bahir yātihakāreṇa viṣet punaḥ*/

*haṃsahaṃsety amuṃ mantraṃ jīvo japaḥ nityaśaḥ*//

*ṣaṭśatāni divā rātrau sahasrāṇy ekaviṃśatiḥ*/

*japo devyāḥ samuddiṣṭaḥ sulabho durlabho jaḋaiḥ*//


They can be translated as follows:


With the letter *sa* \[breath\] flows out; with the letter *ha* it flows back.

Thus the living being recites this mantra *haṃsahaṃsa*.

Twenty-one thousand times, night and day, is this *japa* of the supreme goddess,

it is very easy \[but\] difficult for the ignorant.


98 See, for instance, the *Gorakṣaśataka* quoted by Briggs, in *Goraknāth and the Kanphata Yogis* \(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1982\), pp. 292–293; or the *Yogaviṣaya*, 29, p. 47 of Kalyan Mallik’s *Siddhasiddhāntapaddhati & Other Works of Nāth Yogis* \(Poona: Oriental Bookhouse, 1954; or the *Yogamārtanda*, 33ff. \(ibid., pp. 58–59\). The *ajapājapa* is still in current use even in non-yogic or ascetic milieus. An analogous practice is to be found \(with *so’ham.* instead of *haṃsa*\) in the *Haṃsopaniṣad*, 10–13, the *Brahvidyopaniṣad*, 78–79, among the Sants, etc.

99 See the texts quoted by S.B. Dasgupta in *An Introduction to Tantric Buddhism* \(University of Calcutta, 1950\), pp. 122–125, and in *Obscure Religious Cults* \(already quoted here\), pp. 96–99.

*samyendriyasañcaraṃ proccaren nādam āntaram* /

*eṣaiva japaḥ prokto na tu bāhyajapo japaḥ* //


This stanza comes perhaps from the *Saṇketapaddhati*, an important work of the Śrīvidyā known only by quotations.

101 Except probably insofar as the inner perception of the *nāda* can be actually perceptible as some sort of subtle inner phonic vibration. Several works describe different sorts of *nāda* accessible to yogins, some of which appear as perceptible. There is thus a division into sixty-seven *nādas*, eleven of which are ‘unstruck’ \(*anāhata*\) sound: see Vidyānanda, *Artharatnāvalīū*ī *ad* NṢA 1.12. The subtle form of *nāda* is often compared to the end of the vibration of a bell which becomes ever more fine untill it disappears altogether in utter silence.

102 


*bhūyo bhūyaḥ pare bhāve bhāvanā bhāvyate hi yā* /

*japaḥ so’tra svayaṃ nādo mantrātmā japya īdr̥śaḥ* //


103 The I is *aham*, which written *a*\+ *h* \+*ṃ* symbolises the totality of the cosmic manifestation which, going from the first \(A\) to the last \(HA\) letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, is brought together into a unique dot, the origin of everything, the *bindu Ṃ.*

*A* and *Ha* are sometimes taken as symbolising the manifestation and the resorption of the cosmos; thus Ksemarāja *ad* SvT7, 29.

104 This tantra, also named *Triśirastantra, Trśiromata*, etc., is often quoted by Abhinavagupta. It is known only by quotations. It apparently expounds the conception of the supreme godhead as made of the three goddesses Parā, Parāparā and Aparā.

105 


*kalmaṣakṣīmanasā smr̥timātranirodhanāt* /

*dhyāyate paramaṃ dhyaṃ gamāgapada sthitam* /89/

*paraṃśivaṃ tu vrajati bhairavākhyaṃ japaḋ api* /

*tatsvarū paṃjapaḥ prokto bhāvābhāvapadācyutaḥ* //90//


106 *Parāmarśa*, this essential notion of the Trika, is very difficult to translate; see the entry on that word in TAK, Vol. 3.

107 This text seems to be known only through quotations by Kṣemarāja and a few other authors. It is likely to be a Krama text.

108 *mahāmantrātmakākr̥takāhaṃvimarśārūḋhasya yad yad ālāpādi tat tad asya savātmadevatāvimarśānavaratāvartanātmā japo jāyate.*

109 For Bhāskara \(*ŚSVārttika*\), *japa* appears in this case as an enunciation resting on energy \(*vīrya*\) and leading to identification with the supreme Being. According to him, it can be of four sorts: ‘of energy’ \(*śākta*\), identifying the soul with the Self, ‘without parts’ \(*niṣkalā*\), which seems to be the utterance of *OṂ*, that of the *haṃsa* ‘made of the *klaās* of *nāda – nādātmika* – and finally the *japa* of the living being \(*jīva*\), or of the body \(*paudgala*\) which is probably the movement of respiratory breath. This commentary is earlier than Ksemarāja’s, and probably nearer to the spirit of the ŚS.

110 We might say of *haṃsa* with Lilian Silburn: ‘All human beings recite it perpetually, without their knowing it, whether awake or asleep. But the *jñānin*, different in that from the ignorant, is aware of this *haṃsa*; he enjoys the presence of Śiva united with his energies, powerful, omniscient’ \(my translation from p. 178 of L. Silburn’s French translation of the *Śivasūtras* with Kṣemarāja’s *Vimarśinī*\).

111 


*akr̥trimataddhr̥dayārūḋho yat kiṃcid ācaret* /

*prānyād vā mr̥śate vāpi sa sarvo’sya japo mataḥ* //


112 In the fourth chapter of the *Tantrasāra*, which gives a shortened version of TĀ 4, Abhinavagupta says that pure intuitive reasoning \(*sattarka*\), the pure gnosis \(*śuddhavidyā*\) which is the way towards the Absolute can be attained by sacrifice, by oblation in the fire \(*homa*\), by *japa* or by yoga, all of which he defines as an immersion in divine Consciousness. Of *japa*, he says: ‘it is an inner intense awareness of the fact that the supreme Reality exists by its own nature, independently from the existence of the diversity of the cognisable, for all that is then to appear is a consciousness which grasps and transcends all this dichotomy’ \(*ubhayātmakaparāmarśodaya*\).

113 


*matparaṃ nāsti tatrāpi jāpako’smi tadaikyataḥ* /

*tattvena japa ityaksamālayā diśasi kvacit* //


114 When commenting on this stanza, Kṣemarāja adds: ‘You teach that this *japa* which in essence is an awareness of the Unsurpassed … is to be accompanied by the placing \[on the body\] of the letters of the alphabet’ \(*japaḥ … anuttaravimarśasāro … varṇalipinyāsena yuktyā śikṣayasi*\).

In fact, all *japas* are oriented towards an identification with the deity. This is obvious for the devotional *japa*, as we shall see. But even in the *puraścaraṇa* preliminary to *kāmya* rites, this identification is described as necessary: without it the *japa* is useless.

115 See, for instance, the YH 3.3 where Bhairava justifies the daily practice of the *pūjā* of the *śrīcakra* by saying: ‘It is performed perpetually by me’ – *cakrapūjā ca sadā niṣ padyate mayā.*

116 On this, one may refer to C.G. Diehl’s study, *Instrument and Purpose*, quoted here, note 43. See notably, pp. 267–324, on ‘Mantirikam’, where many prophylactic healing rites, rites for success and so forth are described, of which *japa* is an important element.

117 A difference which of course does exist up to a point in non-dualistic context, where the essential unity of the human being and the godhead, of the *ātman* and of the *brahman*, is effectively experienced at the end of the ascesis by the liberated in life. The Śivastotrāvalī is an instance of non-dualistic devotional literature.

118 Elsewhere he writes about *japa* in *āṇavopāya*: ‘shall we say that the repetition of a religious formula plays the same part in bringing about the liberation as does a lullaby in putting a child to sleep, a state of physical quiescence’. Further on, he compares the effect of the two other *upāyas* to autosuggestion \(*śāktopāya*\) or deep sleep \(*śāṃbhavopāya*\) where the loss of consciousness is complete – but sleep, in this case, is taken in the sense of the second *avasthā*, therefore as a state superior to wakefulness, which is not our perspective. The case is nevertheless worth considering.

119 See RV 10.63, 2: ‘For all your names are worthy of homage, worthy of praise, Gods, \[your names\] are also worthy of sacrifice’, *viśvā hi vo namaśyāni vandyā devā utà yajṇiyāni vaḥ.*

120 The same sort of *japa is* prescribed in Śaiva Upaniṣads \(*Atharvaśiras, Kaivalya, Jābali*\).

121 *kiṃ japyenāmr̥tatvaṃ brūhīti/sa hovāca yajṇāvalkyaḥ śatarudriyeṇeti /*

122 Cf. SkPur 1.1.14:


*śiveti dvyakṣaṃ nāma vyāhariṣyanti ye janaḥ /*

*teṣāṃ svargaś ca mokṣaś ca bhaviṣyati na cānyathā* //


123 Such practices seem to have existed earlier in Buddhism for the worship of Amitābhā. But both the ‘spirit’ and the actual practice of such a *japa* differ very much from those of the Hindu *japa*.

124 This according to Ch. Vaudeville, *Kabir* \(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1974\). Curiously, the Haripāṭh of Jñāndev \(8.2\) says that the *japa* of Rama’s name is the ‘breath’ of Śiva: *ātmā jo śivācā/rāmajapa:* Ch. Vaudeville, *L’Invocation. Le Haripāth de Dyāndev* \(Paris: EFEO, 1969\), p. 64. See note 120.

125 See Milton Singer, ed. *op. cit*., note 80, ‘The Radha-Krishna *bhajanas* of Madras City’, especially pp. 118–121.

126 Adh.R, I.6.69; II.5.25; IV.1.78 – this reference is found in F. Whaling, *The Rise of the Religious Significance of Rāma* \(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1988\), p. 160.

127 Tulsidas, while affirming that no other name than Rama’s saves, admits however the efficacy of other names, notably those of Sītā and Bharata ‘for many are the names of the Lord’.

We may note that for Tulsidas Rāma is the mantra of Śiva who, at Kaśi \(Varanasi\), saves all beings by giving them this mantra. The *Haripāth* says \(8.2\) that the *japa* of Rāma’s name is the breath of Śiva – is this an allusion to the *ajapājapa*? ‘Hari, Hari, such is the mantra of Śiva’ says also the *Haripātth* quoted by Ch. Vaudeville, *op.cit*., p. 64–65.

128 *Caitanyacaritāmr̥ta* of Kr̥ṣṇadāsa, *ādilīlā*, 8.22, quoted in E.C. Dimock, *The Place of the Hidden Moon* \(Chicago University Press, 1966\), p. 226.

129 See A.K. Majumdar, *Caitanya. His Life and Doctrine* \(Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1969\), p. 226. Rūpagosvamin, in his *Bhaktirasāmr̥tasindhu*, 1.2,48, defines *kīrtan* as follows: *nāmalīlāguṇādinām uccair bhāṣā tu kīrtanam*, ‘the fact of saying or singing the name, the play and the virtues or qualities of the Lord’ \(ibid., p. 143\).

130 On the Naths as they exist now in India, the most recent study is that of Véronique Bouillier, *Itinérance et vie monastique. Les ascètes Nāth Yogīs en Inde contemporaine* \(Paris: Editions de la Maison des Sciences de l’Homme, 2008\).

131 The Haripath recommends also the silent *japa* \(26.4\): ‘Dñyandev has taken the vow of silence. He wears his rosary in his heart. This is where he invokes the Name of Hari’ \(ibid., p. 146\). This, however, does not prevent the Haripāth from recommending mainly the collective singing of the Name: ‘the \[only\] means of salvation is the company of the saints’ \(5.4\).

132 *to karī tetulī pūjā/to kalpi to japi majhā /… /samādhi majhī* // This quotation, like all cited here on the subject is taken from Ch. Vaudeville’s study of the *Haripāth*, quoted in note 124.

133 See Ch. Vaudeville, *Kabir Granthāvali* \(*Doha*\), \(Pondichéry: Institut Français d’Indologie, 1957\), pp. XVIII and 36.

134 Ibid., pp. XVII–XVIII. See also passages from the *Gorakhbāni*, the sayings of Goraknāth quoted by Ch. Vaudeville in the introduction to her *Kabir* \(Oxford, 1974\), p. 138: ‘Get hold of the *śabda*, O Avadhūt \! Get hold of the Śabda\! The ‘stages’ \(*sthāna*\) are useless obstacles.’

135 This was, for instance, the belief of the Rāmanandins, whose mantra is *OṂ Rāmāya namaḥ*, or merely *rāmāya namaḥ*, for *OṂ* is considered as the equivalent of Rāma. On this and on Tantric elements in Kabir, see Ch. Vaudeville, *op. cit*., especially section V of the Introduction, ‘Tantric concepts in Kabir’s verses’.

136 One may mention here the persisting use of *sumiran*, mental *japa* \(*mānasajapa*\), in the contemporary sect of the Radhasoamis: a modern variant of a very ancient tradition. On the Radhasoamis, see H. H. Sahabji Maharaj Sir Anand Sarup, *Yathārtha Prakāśa* \(Dayalbagh, Agra, Radhasoami Satsang Sabha, 1984\).

137 On *dhikr*, see the interesting study of G.C. Anawati and L. Gardet, *Mystique musulmane, aspects et tendances, expériences et techniques* \(Paris: Vrin, 1970\), pp. 187– 258, which notes analogies between *dhikr* and *japa.*

138 According to Anawati and Gardet, *op cit*. p. 197, the existence of the practice of *dhikr* made in common is not attested before the twelfth century, and could have appeared under the influence of *japa*.

139 There are in Bengal Muslim Baùls, the Fakirs.

140 Their case, but also the whole question of the rapports between Islam and Hinduism, was studied by Sayid A.A. Rizvi, *A History of Sufism in India* \(New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 2 vol., 1978–1983\): vol. 1, ch. 6, ‘Interactions between Medieval Hindu Mystic traditions and Sufism’, vol. 2, ch. 8, ‘The Sufi Response to Hinduism’. Other more recent studies on the subject could be quoted; for instance Thomas Dahnhardt, *Change and Continuity in Indian Sūfism* \(New Delhi: D.K. Printworld, 2002\).

An interesting case of syncretism is that of the Ismaelis, see T. Kassam and Fr. Mallison, *Ginans. Texts and Contexts. Essays on Ismaeli Hymns from South Asia in Honor of Zawahir Moir* \(New Delhi: Matrix Publishing, 2007\); or Dominique Sila Khan, *Conversions and Shifting Identities. Ramdev Pir and the Ismaelis of Rajasthan* \(New Delhi: Manohar, 1997\).

141 A paragraph on the subject in the original French version of this article is not translated here.

142 But what is a prayer strictly speaking, if not what one uses to consider as such in the traditionally Christian Western world? Not a generally valid definition, therefore. Using the word prayer for *japa* cannot but lead to misunderstandings.





### 4 Nyāsa
the ritual placing of mantras

1 This is an English version by Gavin Flood of the article ‘*nyāsa*: l’imposition des mantras’, published in the *BEFEO*, vol. LXVII, 1980, pp. 62–102. The original text was, where necessary, corrected and updated by the author.

2 We also find the terms *vi-ny-AS*: ‘to put or place down in different places, spread out, distribute, arrange …; *vinyāsa* \(masc.\), putting or placing down … arrangement, disposition, order …, scattering, spreading out, putting together’ \(Monier-Williams *Dict*. – we also need to retain the nuances of these senses\).

3 The Brāhmaṇa and the Kalpasūtra testify to the ancient use of ritual touching: we meet them quite often in the *Śatapathabrāhmaṇa*, accompanied with mantra recitation \(e.g. ŚB I.1,2, 10–11; I.2, 2, 4–11; III.2, 1, 4–6 etc.\). The word used is *abhi-MṚŚ*, that is, to touch.

We note that it is the more recent *smṛti* texts which prescribe *nyāsa*, although certain authors condemn their use as non-vedic \(*avaidika*\): cf. Kane *History of Dharmaśastra* vol. 2, p. 319. From a certain period the use is general.

4 The *nyāsas* have not, to my knowledge, been the object of study in any European language except for Aghehananda Bharati ‘Symbolik der Berührung in der hinduistisch-buddhistischen Vorstellungswelt’, in *Studium Generale*, vol XVII, no. 10, 1964, Heidelberg, pp. 609–620. This article which places the practice in a general anthropological perspective is somewhat brief about the *nyāsas* themselves.

5 See, for example, ‘hand’ in Hasting’s *Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics*. For India we can observe that hand gestures have a protective value and are used for consecration or homage, as witnessed on ancient Buddhist monuments down to our own day. On this point see the study by Ph. Vogel *The Sign of the Spread Hand or ‘five finger token’ \(pañcāṇgulika\) in Pali literature* \(Amsterdam, 1919\). See also J. Auboyer *Le Trône et son Symbolisme dans l’Inde ancienne*, pp. 11–15.

6 Cf. my *Vâc. The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras* \(Albany: SUNY Press, 1990\).

7 On the *karanyāsa* \(or *karāṇganyāsa*\), see later p. 70.

8 This is a natural connection insofar as mantras are a variety of speech-act, and that speech is bound to gesture. If this form of speech which is mantra can be regarded as relevant to language, it is naturally also bound to gesture since in many respects language is in gesture as much as in speech. *Mantra* and *mudrā* are systems of coordinated signs. It could be interesting to make a semiotic study of them, without losing sight of the fact that both are grounded in a deeper level of meaning to which they merely give an expression.

9 It is a fact that tantric *pūjā*, yoga, etc. are complex acts whose sense and scope are at the same time human, cosmic *and* divine, but which one can also consider in some cases or to a certain extent as taking place entirely on the divine plane, the gestures and operations accomplished by the officiant or adept being then only figures. \(Unless it is the sacrificial act which supports the worlds – an ancient brahmanical idea that *pūjā* has not entirely abandoned.\)

10 We find this in a number of passages of *śruti* \(from Veda to Upaniṣads\). Tara Michaël has underlined the fact in the introduction to her translation of the *Haṭhayogapradīpikā* \(Fayard, 1974\), pp. 65f.

11 We will further see how *nyāsa* can be used to impose a mantra which symbolises the supreme *brahman*: in this case one goes \(or one tries to go\) directly from the empirical plane to pure transcendence.

12 Tara Michaël, *op cit*. p. 73.

13 On the practices associated with *prāṇa* and *nyāsa*, see below. *Prāṇa* forms somehow a bond between the subtle and gross body of man.

14 On the nature of mantras, see the Introduction. See too *Vāc*, quoted above, note 6.

15 *Pārameśvarasaṃhitā*, Kriyākhaṇḋa \(ed. U.V. Govindacarya, Śri Vilasam Press, Srirangam, 1953\). The text is essentially on ritual.

16 


Ibid. *śl*. 4: *vyāparo mānaso hyeṣa nyāsākhyo yadyapi smṛtaḥ /*

*na badhnati sthitiṃ samyak tathā ‘pi kriyayā vinā* //


17 See, for example, SP1, II, *śl.* 2–3 on the Sūryapūjā. ‘One must imagine oneself transformed into the sun’ etc. *ātmānaṃ ravirūpeṇa saṃcintyā* \(vol. 1, pp. 72–73\). These operations are described more clearly in chapter 15 of Abhinavagupta’s *Tantrāloka*, summarised below \(pp. 60–63\).

18 The level of *manas* and *prāṇa* in the sense of vital breath is that of the *liṇgaśarīra*, composed of three ‘envelopes’: the *prāṇamaya, manomaya*, and *ānandamaya-kośas*. Cf. below, note 35.

19 TĀ 15, 159: *nyāsakrameṇa śivatāladātmyam adhiśerate*. The sacrificer, the sacrifice etc. come to identify with the condition of Śiva by the process of *nyāsa*, that is, by the execution of the ritual procedures.

20 Or at least after a ritual activity which presupposes a certain concentration.

21 Cf. above p. 56.

22 We see here that if India does not make a clear break between body and spirit, the *nyāsa* is a means to integrate these two elements.

23 For example, TĀ 15, 295f. summarised below pp. 60–63. One can also refer to the third chapter of the YH, where *śl*. 83 indicates that the adept, who has performed the *nyāsa* of the *śrīcakra* on his body, must consider the goddess as inseparably united to himself \(*svābhedena vicintayet*\); see below p. 64\).

24 There are cases, however, where meditation, evocation, or mental representation, appear distinct from placing itself. The texts can, besides, designate or not as *nyāsa* the operations they prescribe.

We should recall that the *nyāsa*, as with *japa*, can be considered as also having in certain cases \(sometimes above all\) a psychological aspect: to turn the attention towards the divinity rather than towards the actions one is performing – such is the case, for instance, for the *nyāsas* performed during the daily ritual bath, etc.

25 Notably by using as ink particular substances such as orpiment, sandal and so on, or by using a particular script. This, we especially meet in Chinese and Japanese Buddhism where the *bījas* are drawn in so-called *siddha* characters according to a peculiar technique which links the writing of the letters to mental concentration and control of the breath. Cf. *Shuji-shu, a collection of siddham bījas, the original work of Chozen Bikshu*, published by Matsumo Etasu, Koyasan, 1978. Here it is the user of the *bījas* who draws them.

But the adept can also use a *yantra* made by an other who has already written the *bījas* or the whole *mātṛkā*, so that it is enough to touch them during the ritual so as to perform the prescribed placing.

26 In his translation of these *ślokas*, M.N. Dutt writes that these entities ‘should be contemplated as written in fire inside the different parts of the body,’ which has no connection with the Sanskrit texts but gives a possible solution to the problem. One practitioner of *nyāsa* I consulted on this point told me that in the *mātṛkānyāsa* ‘one touches the concerned part of the body with the *mahāmudrā* \(joining the ring finger with the thumb\). While touching, one has to meditate that the letter is there in blazing form.’

27 *The Tantrāloka of Abhinavagupta, with the commentary of Rajanaka Jayaratha*, Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies, Bombay, 1918–1938, 12 vols. of Sanskrit text. *Yoginīhṛdayam Amrtanandayogikrtadîpikâ bhâvânuvâdena ca sahitam*, Varanasi, Motilal Banarsidass, 1989. This edition by Vrajavallabha Dviveda is the only reliable one of this text.

28 Abhinavagupta, in these two chapters, follows a more ancient text, the *Mālinīvijayottara Tantra* \(MVT\), a work held in special esteem by Kashmiri Śaivism, in which chapters 6 and 8 explain, briefly, the same practices intended for initiation to attain supernatural powers and salvation.

29 The *samayadīkṣā* is the less elevated of the initiations. After this comes the *putraka*\(or *nirvāṇa*-\) *dīkṣā*, then that of the *sādhaka* and finally that of the *ācārya*. On the subject, refer to the entries on *dīkṣā* of vol. 3 of the TAK. See also the article by H. Brunner ‘Le sādhaka, personnage oublié de l’Inde du sud’, *Journal Asiatique*, 1975.

30 **Note added 2011**: on this alphabetical order, see Somdev Vasudeva, ‘Synaesthetic Iconography: the Nâdiphântakrama’ in D. Goodall and A. Padoux, eds., *Tantric Studies in Memory of Hélène Brunner* \(Pondicherry, 2007\), pp. 517–550.

31 One sees here that a mantra, the sound aspect or form of the deity \(and in this respect more essential than the deity\) can also be considered – meditated upon – as a visible, extant, form: that of the deity itself.

The *astra* is the weapon of Śiva \(his cult is described in the same chapter 15 of the TĀ, to *śl*. 378f.\) – cf. *infra* p. 39, n. 77.

We note that a mantra can be meditated, conceived visibly in spirit, not only in the more or less anthropomorphic form of the deity or one of his attributes, but also in a written form as luminous letters, or else only as a coloured light or a luminous disc \(this is especially the case in so-called Tantric Buddhism\).

32 He will activate here a non-visual, phonic image which will be the subtle form of Śiva. All the gods have in principle a *mūrtimantra*. This is not confined to Śaivism.

33 See below p. 63.

34 Here it is the mantra itself which is the god. This is a phonic form of Śiva – but Navātman has also an anthropomorphic aspect, as a beautiful young man. It is the same for the mantra gods Bhairavasadbhāva and Ratiśekhara as, accompanied by their energy, for Mātṛsadhbhāva etc; for all deities, in fact; tantric pantheons are pantheons of mantras rather than of deities.

35 Situated precisely at the level of the energy Parāparā and forming the energy \(*śākta*\) aspect of the phonemes. See *Vâc*, pp. 320ff. and above, note 30.

36 Pure, says Abhinavagupta, because born from the *mūrtimantra* which appears \(ibid., *śl*. 238 and 261–262\) when consciousness is immersed in the pure Reality.

On the emanation within Siva, see chapter 3 of the TÂ and *Vâc*, pp. 306ff.

A purely spiritual and metaphysical interpretation of a *nyāsa* is given in the PTV, p. 20, a passage commenting *śl*. 27 of this text attributed to Abhinavagupta.

37 *Tathā śivo’ haṃ nānyo’ smītyevaṃ bhāvayatas tathā / etad evocyate darḋhyam vimarśahṛdayāṇgamam // 270 śivaikātmyavikalpaughadvārikā nirvikalpatā /*

38 This *nyāsa* is described in *śl.* 295–312 of chapter 15, which develops the information of the eighth chapter, *śl.* 54f. of the MVT. They are part of a section on the ‘mental sacrifice’ \(*manoyāga*\) which is to take place before the ‘external rites’.

39 The SP 1 \(vol 1. p. 154f.\) describes a cult of the throne of Śiva where the same series of energies and entities are invoked to make the whole cosmic manifestation the throne of Śiva. Here, the cult being mental, the adept is at the same time the seat of the divine, the divine itself, and the worshipper.

40 But laughing, conscious, his body shining like ‘ten million fires of time’ \(*kālāgni*\): MVT 8, 68, SvT 2.81.

41 *Unmanā*, for the Śaiva traditions, is the transcendental Void, *śunyatiśunya*, the supreme principle without a second \(*nirābhāsaṃ paraṃ tattvam anuttamam*, NT 12, 23\).

42 On this installation of the trident in the body for the initiation, see A. Sanderson, ‘Mandala and Agamic identity in the Trika’, in A. Padoux, ed., *Mantras et diagrammes rituels dans l’hindouisme* \(Paris: Editions du CNRS, 1986\), pp. 169–205.

43 A procedure analogous to the purification of the *adhvans* is described in chapters 84 and 85 of the *Agni Purāṇa* dealing with the *nirvāṇadikṣā*, chapters which are Śaivite. As described there, these rites are related to the process, in fact general in Hinduism, of the *bhūta*-\(or *deha*-\)*śuddhi*, where the elements constituting the body and cosmos are reabsorbed the one in the other up to where only pure divinity exists \(for example, the LT. chapters 30 and 54: *bhūtaśuddhi*; *Jayākhya Saṃhit*ā chapter 10; *Kālika*-*Purāṇa* chapters 54–55, etc.\). The operation is essentially mental: it is through a meditation based on the image of the body that the elements are reabsorbed; but insofar as the process is accompanied by mantras placed on different parts of the body, *nyāsas* can play a role. On the process of *bhūtaśuddhi*, see the article by Gavin Flood, ‘The purification of the body in Tantric ritual representation’, *Indo-Iranian Journal*, 45, 2002, pp. 25–43.

The complex *nyāsas* are well represented in the texts, thus there is the *mahāṣoḋhānyāsa* of the fourth chapter of the *Kulārṇavatantra*, or the *nyāsa* described in the second chapter of SvT or in the eleventh chapter of the GT. The chapter 25 of the AgPur also provides an example.

The *Parameśvara Saṃhitā* \(4, *śl.* 53, and chapter 54\) describe a purification \(*śuddhi*\) of the body by *nyāsas*. On the system of the six *adhvan*, see *Vâc*, pp. 330–371.

44 One may note the frequent occurrence of the sixfold *nyāsa* in the Śaiva and Śākta texts. The *ṣoḋhānyāsa* \(*gaṇeśa, graha, nakṣatra, yoginī, rāśi, pīṭha*\) is described for example in the *Vīra-tantra*, the GT \(chapter 10\) and the *Mantramahodadhi* \(11.48\). It involves imposing six forms or aspects \(*rūpa*\) of the goddess. Cf. VMT I.1.

The TBhS 5, p. 163f. gives variants. The KT \(chapter 4\) has a different *ṣoḋhānyāsa*, the same being given by the *Prapañcasārasārasaṅgraha* \(chapter 8\).

But why the number six? The *kara-, aṅga*- and *karāṅganyāsa* which are the most current, are encountered in all traditions \(see below p. 70\) are also six.

45 The GT chapter 10 describes a sixfold *nyāsa* of the *śrīvidyā* composed of the six same same series of *rūpa* of the goddess. But this is a modern work that borrows entire passages from other texts, notably the YH. The introduction of this text published in Srinagar in 1934 is, however, interesting because it gives a table of different *nyāsas* with their *mantra, bīja* and phonemes, the points of placing and so on. This edition has run out and is difficult to find.

The *Nityotsava* \(G.O.S. 1923, vol. 23\) describes in a detailed way a *laghuṣoḋhanyāsa* \(p. 98\) which is made on the fingers, the palms and the back of the hands. It follows the complete *ṣoḋhānyāsa* \(pp. 98–109\) made on the entire body and where the placings are always preceded by *dhyāna*, that is, a mental visualisation of the visible aspect, described by the texts, of the imposed entities. The same text furthermore expounds \(pp. 109–117\), under the name *mahāṣoḋhānyāsa*, a placing on the body of the officiant of the *śrīcakra*.

On the placing of the *pīṭhās* see below p. 74.

46 In all this ritual, it is in effect the *cakra* itself that is imposed \(in chapter 2, *śl.* 6–12, pp. 93–97, of the same text, it is the *nyāsa* of nine divinities presiding over nine parts of the *cakra* – the *cakreśvarī* – which is prescribed\). These mantras therefore invoke parts of the *cakra*, and not the deities which reside there. Sometimes, however, in operations of this kind, the mantras used refer both to the *cakra* imposed and to the deity concerned. It also often quotes the part of the body on which a placing has been made.

47 This is only effective in the case of an adept very advanced in spiritual life: for the majority of adepts the identification remains only in the realm of representation – an observation that applies to all rites of identification described here or elsewhere.

48 There are many descriptions of the imposition of a diagram. For the *śrīcakra* we may quote the VM 1.112, or the *Nityotsava*, pp. 109–117 of the GOS edition, where the adept imposes successively the deities of the *cakra* on his body meditatively perceived as identical with the *śricakra*, as having the same shape: *śarīraṃ cintayed adau nijaṃ śrīcakrarūpam*. Jayaratha says similarly in his commentary on the VM, p. 60: *evam tripurīkṛtavigrahaḥ sādhakaḥ*.

As an instance of contemporary practices, we can quote \(among many others\) the ritual booklet *Śrīvidyānityārcana* \(ed. Kalyan Mandir, Prayag, 1967\). It prescribes two impositions of the *cakra* during the cult: first external \(*bahiścakranyāsa*\) on the body from feet to head; then internal \(*antaścakranyāsa*\) on the *cakras* which is purely mental.

49 In the GT, chapter 9, which is the first of the section on *nyāsa* of this tantra, begins with a purification of the hands \(*karaśuddhi*\) made with the *mahāvidyā AṂ ĀṂ SAUḥ* \(*śl* 3–4\). After this the adept purifies his fingertips with the same mantra and a red flower which he then throws away. The *ṛṣyādinyāsa* of the mantra \(see below p. 68f.\) and all the rest of the ritual are described afterwards.

In the *Mantramahārṇava*, a vast collection of Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava mantras which describes worship and practice, the *ṛṣyādinyāsa* – which places as it were the preliminary mantras on the body of the celebrant – comes first, but it is immediately followed by the *karāṅganyāsa* preceding the worship itself.

50 That is, makes full or complete \(*sakala*\), or which provides the body of the officiant with parts \(*kalā*\). This is another name for the *karāṅganyāsa*. This can be found in a Sanskrit text quoted by Aghoraśiva, with a French translation, in appendix 1 \(pp. 322–325\) of the first volume of the edition of the SP by Hélène Brunner.

In a general manner, the rite of the *sakalīkaraṇa* consists of imposing the *aṅgas* of the deity on the body of the disciple to divinise it and to create, in the course of the *pūjā*, the body with its diverse parts \(*sāṅgam*\) as the deity to be worshipped.

51 On the different meanings of this term, and especially on the notion of portions or parts of a deity, see the long entry on *kalâ* of the TAK, vol. 2.

52 Twelve is, in fact, a solar figure. It is the number of *kalās* of the sun, whereas sixteen is the number of *kalās* or digits of the moon.

53 *Pārameśvara-saṃhitā* 4.5–22 \(p. 18\): I have translated the passage, simplifying it a little. The JayS 11.10–22 \(pp. 94–95\) prescribes practically the same *nyāsa*: from the *mūla* and *mūrtimantra*, then the *aṅgamantras hṛdaya* etc. and the attributes and aspects of Viṣṇu. The three final *śloka* are analogous to those which end the passage translated here. The LT 25.61–63 \(pp. 135–136\) prescribes *nyāsa* first on the fingers with five *śakti*, then with the *aṅgamantras*, and following with the placing of the *aṅgas* of Viṣṇu on the palms. See also *Agastyasaṃhita* 2, chapter 12 etc. In the Śaiva domain, one can cite the *Tantrasāra* of Kr̥ṣṇānanda, p. 74 etc, A *karaśuddhi* made with the *mūlavidyā* of the Goddess is also prescribed before the *pūjā* in the VMT 1.109 \(p. 57\). A *mūrtinyāsa*, distinct from the *karanyāsa*, is prescribed in the JayS. 20.180–181 \(p. 212\).

The placings can be of deities, of aspects of a god or, in the case of a mantra, of different words of the mantra etc. One can also place serially groups of phonemes of the *mātr̥kā*, this is one of the forms of the *mātṛkānyāsa*. The procedures differ according to the schools, traditions etc; it does not seem, at first sight, that they can be reduced to a general rule. There is even in the *Mantramahārṇava* 1.6 \(folio 95f.\) a mantra of Tryambaka of a vedic type: *Oṃ tryambakam yajāmahe sugandhiṃ puṣṭivardanam urvarukamiva bandhanānmṛtyor kukṣīya māmṛtāt*, of which the *karanyāsa* is made in the following way: *oṃ tryambakam aśṅguṣṭhabhyāṃ namaḥ, yajamahe tarjanibhyāṃ namaḥ, sugandhiṃ, puṣṭivardhanaṃ madhyamabhyāṃ namaḥ* etc. up to: *māmṛtāt karatalabhyāṃ namaḥ.*

54 TĀ 15.456–459 \(vol. 9 pp. 230–231\).

55 SP2, pp. 52–53. The text is brief, a single śloka, but Helene Brunner explains it in a note, referring to the *Purusaṃhitā* itself cited in the commentary of the Mrg, *kriyāpāda* 7.14, which mentions the rite. One washes the right hand, anoints it, imposes the *brahmamantra* on it, then one draws, with the thumb of the left hand on the palm of the right, a *maṇḋala* where one places Śiva, to which one pays homage. See also SP3, p. 289. or the *Suprabhedāgama*, chapter 4 analysed by Brunner \(*Journal Asiatique*, 1967\).

The Buddhist *hastapūjā* \(Finot, ‘Manuscrits sanskrits de Sādhana,’ *Journal Asiatique*, 1934\), includes the *nyāsa* of *bījas*, mentally placing them on the hand together with a lotus and divinities; this is a rite akin but different. The *hastābhimantraṇa* mentioned in the *Adikarmapradīpika*, edited by L. de La Vallée Poussin \(*Études et Matériaux*, pp. 192 and 217\) appears, on the contrary, as a *hastanyāsa*, although the word *nyāsa* is not used: *hastam abhimantrya \[mantraṃ\] vibhāvya*.

56 In the sense, it is explained, of being opposed \(*vāma*\) to transmigration \(*śl*. 278\) and of secrecy \(*śl*. 279\) as is normally the case of the practices of the so-called left hand, in particular in the Kaula schools.

57 A gesture one sees often made by Indians outside of a ritual context. Generally, thepositions or movements of the hands of Indians differ from those observable in Western societies.

58 According to the commentary of the SP1 – III.41 \(vol. 1, pp. 142–143 note\), the *āsanamantra* involves putting a flower on the throne which is thus consecrated. This resembles the *Nityotsava* \(*nyāsaprakaranam*, p. 95\) where a triple *āsana* must be imposed with flowers on the *śricakra*.

The GT as cited in *Principles of Tantra*, p. 158f., seems to have a rite of installing a *devatā* in a *yantra* by means of flowers to which the adept has transmitted divine energy with his breath and the *vāyubīja* YAṂ.

59 See, for example, Dale Saunders *Mudrā* \(New York: Pantheon Books, 1960\), or Stephen Beyer *The Cult of Tārā* \(Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1973\).

60 The SP, for example, prescribes a number of *mudrās*, and in the first volume of Hélène Brunner’s edition there is an appendix of descriptions and photographs. One can also cite āgamas and saṃhitās etc. In volume V of the *History of Dharmaśātra* \(pp. 1123–1131\), P.V. Kane presents a brief study with an abundant – but still far from complete – Sanskrit bibliography. For Buddhism, one must add to India, Tibet, China and Japan.

61 I have not checked their provenance. There are several texts, from the non-dualist Śaiva Krama tradition, of that name.

62 As the royal seal is a symbol of authority, the *mudrā* symbolises the power of the divinity; or as the seal authenticates a contract, the *mudrā* seals a pact between the worshipper and the worshipped. Cf. Dale Saunders, ‘Symbolic Gestures in Buddhism’ *Artibus Asiae* vol. 21, 1957.

63 In the context of Buddhism, a justification of the mantra-*mudrā* association has sometimes been based on the theory of the three bodies, *vāk-kaya-citta*: these being three coordinated and complementary aspects of an ensemble.

64 *Bhāvayati*, causative of *BHU*, means to make become, give birth, but also to consecrate, to control and to have in mind, to consider, and to know. The word *bhāvanā* \(f.\), derived from *BHU*, designates intense, mental concentration, the creative power and efficacy of imagination, and mystical realisation \(in the ‘way of energy’, the *śāktopāya* according to the TA\). On *bhāvanā*, François Chenet, ‘*Bhāvanā* et créativité de la conscience’ \(*Numen*, vol. xxxiv, 1987, pp. 45–96\).

65 In this I entirely disagree with Frits Staal’s position: see his *Ritual and Mantras. Rules without Meaning* \(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1996\).

66 We know that the word *mudrā* has several senses, one of which is that of a mystical attitude; *mudrā* is thus the seal of the ineffable, purely spiritual; in this sense see *Mahārthamañjarī* \(MM\), cited in the next note; see also TĀ 32.1–3 – on which A. Padoux, ‘The body in tantric ritual: the case of the *mudrās’*, in Teun Goudriaan, ed., *The Sanskrit Tradition and Tantrism* \(Leiden: Brill, 1990\).

67 *Avikalpatayā marś vikalpavargasyāṅgasannāhaḥ / Arghyaṃ vedyavilāsaḥ puṣpāṇi svabhāvapoṣakā bhāvāḥ*. The reference is: *Maheśvarānandapraṇitā mahārthamañjarī svopajñānaparimalākhyavyākhyopetā* \(Varanasi: Vārāṇaseya, Sanskrit Viśvavidyālaya, 1972\), pp. 112–113.

68 These elements are not always mentioned. The *ṛṣi*, the *chandas*, and the *devatā* are indispensable and their mention is ancient \(along with the *viniyoga*\), dating back to the *anukramaṇi* of the Veda. The other elements are Tantric and they do not always appear; they cannot therefore be considered as necessary elements of all Tantric mantras.

The *ṛṣi* is, of course, entirely fictitious; it is in fact sometimes a deity. As for the *chandas*, it can be real if the mantra is of Vedic origin or if the Tantric mantra’s structure corresponds to a certain meter. But the non-Vedic mantras are often formed from a group of short syllables \(often unpronounceable\) or even consist in one *bīja*, such as *HRĪṂ* or *SAUḤ*, or the fifty *varṇas* of the *mātṛkā*, which do not, strictly speaking, have a meter. There are, however, lists of *ṛṣi* and *chandas* for each of the fifty *varṇas*. In other cases, several meters are given. This mention is therefore preserved in many cases only as a kind of reference to the Vedic tradition. The reference is real when elements of a Tantric mantra are derived from a Vedic text, in which case these will be given the same meter as the Vedic passages from where they come. Otherwise, the reference seems to be purely theoretical; although, for contemporary followers, the *chandas* appears to expresses, if not really a meter, at least a number, an inner rhythm particular to the mantra: for such adepts, this is nothing theoretical.

It sometimes happens that the *bīja* is formed from one or from several words, which is contradictory. The *śakti* is, in theory, the central part of the mantra and is believed to concentrate in itself its energy; its place in the mantra is in fact variable. As for the *kīlaka*, a pin, bolt or wedge, it should normally be at the end of the mantra as in an arrow so as to pierce its target, but its place and form also varies.

Another element, the *kavaca* \(in the sense of amulet or protective formula\) is sometimes added.

69 This is the principle, valid even if this transformation is generally only theoretical and imagined.

70 We see here the usual dialectic of the tantric *pūjā. deva eva yajed devam, nādevo devam arcayet*, that one finds constantly and which also explains the purifications during the *pūjā* as well as the succession of deifying *nyāsas* \(those which we have previously seen for example\). One must be already deified to be permitted to ritually worship a deity by a cult which is deemed to lead to deification, and one must be already ‘mantricised’ in order to use and assimilate more completely a mantra. It is necessary to have, in some measure, at the beginning that towards which one strives.

Should we not see there a sign of what is, it seems to me, a well-pronounced intellectual tendency in India: a tendency not to admit \(or a difficulty to conceive\) a first beginning or a progress which would be a new advent: before starting, things are as it were already there. This is the view, so widespread, of the *satkāryavāda*, for which the effect pre-exists in the cause or, for cosmology, of all cyclical cosmologies.

Of course, insofar as the *pūjā* continues – and preserves certain elements of – the old, brahmanical sacrifice, the preliminary divinisation of the tantric officiant can be regarded as continuing, under a different form, the rites by which the Vedic sacrificer and the victim were preliminarily consecrated in order to enter into communication with the gods in the sacrificial area. Perhaps we should add that, in the course of the ritual, the *nyāsas* seem to have only a temporary role and effectiveness: in each part of the rite, placings are done that are cancelled by those which follow, or by the *ācamana* which separates them \(an observation that I owe to Hélène Brunner\). The cancellation of a rite by the following one\(s\) is also one of the reasons of the redundancy so characteristic of Hindu rites.

71 This according to the *Mantramahārṇava* 1.6 \(folio 91\).

Some texts specify the *mudrā* to be used for these placings. Thus in the *Śārasaṅgraha* cited in the TBhS, 5, p. 70: the placings of the *ṛṣi, chandas* and *devatā* are done with four fingers excluding the thumb – the same way for the *bīja* and the *śakti*. But the *kīlaka*, according to another author, is imposed with both hands on all the body: it is the same if, as is generally the case, the *viniyoga* finishes the series.

72 For a better view of the *mūdra*s shown during a *pūjā*, see for instance G. Bühnemann, *The Worship of Mahāganapati according to the Nityotsava* \(Witrach: Institut für Indologie, 1988\); or Richard H. Davis, *Ritual in an Oscillating Universe. Worshipping Siva in Medieval India*, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991\).

A small modern treatise, the *Yoga-mantra-saṃhitā*, explains: the *ṛṣi* who has ‘seen’ the mantra is for the adept as his master: that mantra is placed on the head with respect; the meter being made of words and of syllables is placed on the mouth; the deity, residing in the heart of all creatures, must be placed in the heart; and the seed on the genitals.

73 See the translation by Brunner \(SP vol. 1, p. 132\). Here is the text:

*Hṛdayādikarānteṣu kaniṣṭhādyangulīṣu ca / hṛdādimantravinyāsaḥ sakalīkaraṇaṃ matam //*

This *nyāsa* is also called *ṣaḋaṅganyāsa, hṛdayādinyāsa*, or *hṛdayādiṣaḋaṅganyāsa* and, for the hands, *anguṣṭhādiṣaḋaṅganyāsa*.

The adept must make the *aṅgamantras* according to the rules at the same time as he places them, thanks to which he deifies his hands and body. Sometimes *netra* does not appear among the *aṅga*, which are then only five: this is the *pañcāṅganyāsa* prescribed in various texts – thus the *Nāradapañcaratra* 3.3,10–11.

74 There are also secondary aspects called *upāṅga*: accessory limbs which are placed after the first ones.

75 They are also sometimes represented as separate deities that one ritually places on or around the image being used for worship – thus SP1 \(vol. 1 pp. 208–210\). On the *aṅga* and their symbolism in Śaivism see SP1, introduction, p. xxxiv and pp. 194–197\), also vol. 3, pp. 400–404 \(note 440\), and Hélène Brunner, ‘Les membres de Śiva’, *Asiatische Studien/Etudes Asiatiques*, XL.2 \(1986\), pp. 89–132.

76 In the Śaiva tradition, this is the third eye of Śiva, that of consciousness, situated on the forehead between the two others eyes: the word *netra* in the *aṅgamantra netra* is in the singular \(for the third eye\) or in the plural \(for the three eyes\), but never in the dual.

77 The consonants which serve to form these *bījas* vary according to the deity, the school etc. But the vocalic element is stereotyped – *saḋdhīrghair ādyādyabījena karāṅganyāsam* says the *Phetkāriṇitantra*, as cited in the TBhS \(p. 170\). One forms the *bījas* on the basis of the *bīja* or of the principal *vidyā* \(*ādyabījena*\) of the mantra while associating it, in due order, with the six long vowels *Ā* etc. \(*ṣaḋdīrghair ādi…*\), in fact with *ā, ī, ū, ai, au*, and *aḥ*. One will thus have, starting from the *vidyā SAUḤ*: *sāṃ, sīṃ, sūṃ, saim, saḥ;* starting from *HṚĪṂ*: *hrām* etc.

The *vaktra* mantras, on the other hand, are done with short vowels. The same instructions are in the *Agni Purāṇa* 25, 5 fl. \(Vaiṣṇava chapter\); the same \(for only the *aṅgamantra*\) in the JayS 6.105ff. etc.

78 In the Pāñcarātra tradition, the LT \(ch. 33\) gives the *aṅgas* of the *tārikāvidyā* of Tārā used in the cult of Lakṣmī: one adds to the *aṅga* a term \(*jñāna, aiśvarya, śakti, bala, tejas*\) whose invocation carries to the adept, through *nyāsa*, each of the qualities enumerated – the *aṅgas* are of the model *Oṃ hrāṃ jñānāya hṛdayāya namaḥ* \(we note that the *aṅgamantra* for *netra* is *netrabhyām*, the two eyes, instead of the three eyes of Śaivism\). The commentary on the Śaiva ST 18.6 \(p. 713\) associates in the same way to the six *aṅgas* the enunciation of the six qualities \(*guṇa*\) or infinite glories of Śiva, omniscience, etc. The SP1 quoted above associates the *aṅgamantras* with five other attributes of Śiva \(the *netra* is sometimes omitted – cf. above note 68.

79 *Phaṭ* is usually called the *astra* \(or *heti*\) mantra – it is the weapon, the missile, especially the arm of Agni. It shines, says the TĀ \(15.232\), as the flame of the fire of time, destroying and purifying the gross and subtle body of the adept. The same designation of *phaṭ* occurs in Buddhism – cf. Finot, ‘Manuscrits sanskrits de sādhanas’, *JAs.* 1934, p. 60: *phaṭ phaṭ sarvāṅgeṣvastram … arpayet.*

80 The rule often allows exceptions in certain traditions. See, for example, the notes of N.R. Bhatt in his edition of the *Raurāvāgama* \(I.1.4, vol. 1, p. 18\); see also the commentary of the *Haṃsopaniṣad* by Upaniṣadbrahmayogin \(ed. Adyar, p. 566\). There may also exist variants in the case of optional rites \(*kāmyakarmāṇi*\).

81 Preceded sometimes by a bīja formed as indicated above.

82 This is according to the TBhS \(p. 170\). But there are other ways of doing it: thus the *Nāradapañcarātra* III.3.24. This triple *nyāsa* has the main sense of symbolising the threefold activity of the divinity and therefore of placing it with all its cosmic dynamism. But each of the three *nyāsas* can also be supposed to have a particular effect \(cf. *Nāradapañcarātra loc. cit*.\) or else can be prescribed for different categories of adepts \(cf. *Tāriṇīpārjāta*, p. 23\).

83 One finds the *aṅga*-or *karāṅganyāsa* described or prescribed as well in texts other than those presented above or in the preceding notes. For example, the TĀ \(chapter 30\), the SvT 1.71–72, the NT 12.28–33, the *Kālīkāpurāṇa*, the JayS 6.105ff. etc.

84 


*Mantrā mūkatvam āyānti vinyāsena vinā lipeḥ/*

*Sarvamantrasiddhyarthaṃ tasmād adau lipiṃ nyaset//* \(TBhS p. 159\).


A small modern manual \(*Śrīvidyānityāḥnika*\) describes the *mātṛkā* as a great mantra serving to place the goddess Mātṛkāsarasvatī: *śrīmātṛikāsarasvatīnyāsamahāmantra*.

85 ‘The *mātṛkā*, mother of the gods, origin of all mantras’, says the GT 9.14, in the exposition of *nyāsa*. And Abhinavagupta in the TĀ 15.130–31: ‘This inner energy born from Bhairava under the aspect of the mass of sound \(*śabdarāśi*\), one calls *mātṛkā*, because it is the mother of all that appears’ \(TĀ vol. 9, p. 58\).

86 The formula used is generally of the type: a group of consonants \(*varga*\) framed by two vowels \(one short, one long\), these and the others with the *bindu*: *aṃ, kaṃ* etc. \+ part of the hand or *aṅga* \+ the appropriate *jāti* \(*namaḥ* etc.\); this allows the placing of twelve vowels \(6 × 2\) and all the other phonemes. Cf, for example, *Nityotsava* \(*nyāsaprakaraṇam*\), p. 73.

87 *Vaiṣṇava Gautamīya* cited in TBhS p. 160. The placings on the lotuses are not necessarily made in the order from bottom to top, as in the *Dakṣinamūrti-saṃhitā* cited by TBhS p. 160. This saṃhitā, which is a text of the Śrīvidyā and not of the Pāñcarātra, contains in its eighth *paṭala* the description of a *mātṛikāpūjā* including *ṣaḋaṅga*- and *bahirmātṛkānyāsa*, thanks to which, it tells us \(*śl*. 16\), the mantrin will become *varṇa-svarūpa*, thus identified in his essence with the divine energy of the phonemes. This *pūjā* continues with the *dhyāna* of the *mātṛkādevī*, then by the drawing of a *yantra* where worship will be performed to her.

88 TBhS p. 160. The same in the *Nityotsava* p. 94: *iti dhyatvā manasā puṣpāñjaliṃ dattvā mātr̥kāḥ … svāṅgeṣu nyaset*.

89 TBhS citing the *Vaiṣṇava-Gautamīya*. This description, as the name of the text would suggest, is a Vaiṣṇava work. I have not, however, found in the Vaiṣṇava texts I have consulted a description of the *mātṛkānyāsa* being exactly the same as that of the Śaiva texts I quote here, which is more complex.

90 Citations of another tantra \(*tantrāntara*\) in the TBhS 5, p. 159.

91 The prescriptions are varied. But often the vowels are placed on the face and head, the consonants on the body, and the semi-vowels, spirants and *KṢA* on the heart, associating them there with the elements that constitute the body, the breath, and the self. Thus the GT 9.25–31; AgPur, chapter 293, 37–39; *lipinyāsa*; *Tāriṇīpārijāta*, pp. 18–19 etc.

92 TBhS, pp. 160–162.

93 Cf *Vāc* pp. 320–327, based on TĀ 15.120–142 – vol. 9, pp. 62–74. The *mālinī* is also mentioned in other, earlier tantric works, such as the *Siddhayogesvarimata*, the *Tantrasadbhâva*, the *Satsāhasrasamhitā*, etc.

On the subject I refer to Somdev Vasudeva’s interesting and novel study, ‘Synaesthetic Iconography: 1. the Nâdiphântakrama’, in D. Goodall and A. Padoux, eds., *Mélanges tantriques à la mémoire d’Hélène Brunner*, Pondichéry: Institut Français de Pondichéry et Ecole Française d’Extrême-Orient, 2007, pp. 517–550. Note that the above paragraph on *mālinīnyāsa* was re-drafted in 2009.

94 Cf. the study of D.C. Sirkar, *The Śākta Pīṭhas* \(JRASB letters, XIV, 1948, pp. 1–108 and MLBD\). It is a presentation and edition of a text, the *Pīṭhanirṇaya*, or *Mahāpīṭhanirūpaṇa*.

A special number of the Hindi periodical *Kalyān* dedicated to pilgrimage \(‘Tīrtā*ṅ*k’, Gorakhpur n.d.\) gives \(pp. 513–528\) a list of 108 places of the cult of Śakti, then of the fifty-one *pīṭha* of the goddess, with a map and descriptions of the places, followed by a study of the secret *pīṭha* of the goddess: *śaktipīṭharahasya*.

The TĀ \(15.81–98\) enumerates the *pīṭha* ‘external’ or ‘internal’, that is, situated in the world or interiorised in different points of the physical or ‘subtle’ body.

95 The system of 108 *pīṭha* has in effect been taken over and adapted in the Vaiṣṇava tradition.

We may note, apropos of *pīṭhas*, that some texts \(thus the ŚT 2.134 comm; vol. 1, p. 115\) call the sixteen vowels *pīṭha*, as contrasted with the consonants then called *kṣetra*. We see here the connection between phonemes and space. Jayaratha, in fact, commenting on the first *śloka* of the VM where the goddess is described as assuming six aspects \(Ganeśa, *rāśi* etc.\) which are placed in the *ṣoḋhanyāsa*, stresses the point that the *pīṭhas* correspond to extension since the goddess also appears in this form \(*deśrūpatayā*\): ‘The Lord,’ says Abhinavagupta in the ĪPV 2.1,5, ‘manifests spatial succession by the diversity of forms \(*mūrtivaicitrya*\)’; this corresponds to the path of space \(*deśādhvan*\) in the theory of the six ways \(TĀ 6.34–36\).

The *diṅnyāsa*, the placing of the directions of space, which is a part of several rites, does not seem to be associated with the same notion since it consists in reciting the formulas of the *nyāsa* and showing a *mudrā* while turning to the eight directions of space in order to win the favour of the *devatās* of the directions; this is not really a *nyāsa*.

96 We also find a brief description in the *Mantramahodadhi* which concludes: *iti dehamaye pīṭhe dhyayet svābhīṣṭa-devatām*: ‘he should meditate his own deity on the seat which has become his body’. Also see *Tāriṇipārijāta* pp. 34–37, which enumerates the entities and mantras to be placed; *Tārarahasya* 3, p. 119; *Siddhasiddhāntapaddhati* 2.1–9; or a recent manual *Balārcanapaddhati* and so on.

97 That is to say, from the twenty-sixth to the thirty-fourth *tattva* in the system of thirty-six *tattvas* of Tantric Hinduism.

98 It is perhaps interesting, from the point of view of the range or psychology of the *nyāsa*, to mention here a poem cited in the *Principles of Tantra* \(p. 1142\), where the sixth verse, recalling the unity of the worshipper with the divinity he worships, adds: ‘otherwise, how does Nyāsa on Thy limbs affect Me or Nyāsa on my limbs affect Thee?’ ‘They are one and the same,’ comments A. Avalon, ‘and therefore when the sādhaka does Nyāsa on himself, he does Nyāsa on the Devatā also’ \(ibid. note 4\).

Another point of view, contemporary but undoubtedly exactly traditional in sentiment, is that of R.K. Ray *Encyclopedia of Yoga* \(Varanasi, 1975\) which, in relation to *pīṭhanyāsa*, writes: ‘Nyāsa is useful in effecting the proper distribution of the Śaktis of the human frame in their proper positions so as to avoid the production of discord and distractions in worship. The actions of Nyāsa on the body, finger and palms stimulate the nerve centres and nerves therein. Thus, for the attainment of that state in which a Sādhaka feels that the *Bhāva* \(nature, disposition\) of the Devatā has come upon him, Nyāsa is a great auxiliary. It is, as it were, the wearing of jewels on different parts of the body. The Bījas of the Devatā are the jewels which the Sādhaka places on different parts of his body. By Nyāsa he places his Abhiṣṭadevatā \(Iṣṭa-devatā\) in such parts, and by Vyāpaka-nyāsa \(comprehensive Nyāsa\) he spreads His presence through himself and he becomes permeated by Him, losing himself in the divine Self.’ \(See too MNT 5.105 and passim; ŚT 6.1ff; *Prapañcasāra Tantra* p. 138 and passim; *Yoginī Tantra* 2.1.1 and passim\).

99 The *nyāsa* can be made with a flower or blades of grass as said before – see p. 71.

100 SP1 \(vol. 1, pp. 124–125\): *darśayitvāmṛtīmudrām* ‘and one shows the *mudrā* which transforms into nectar’ \(Brunner examines this problem in the introduction, p. xxxvi\).

101 The *Tāriṇīpārijāta*, pp. 18–19, describes, after expounding the *bhūtaśuddhi*, a *jīvanyāsa* made with the *prāṇapratiṣṭhāmantra* of the goddess Tāriṇī along with a whole series of placings \(*ṛṣyādi, kara, ṣaḋaṅga* etc.\) with *dhyāna, japa* etc. The structure of the rites is the same as that of the *prāṇapratiṣṭhā* such as those found in diverse modern manuals \(*Śrīkapadruma* or some other\).

The *jīvanyāsa* is mentioned in the same way in the MNT \(5.105\). The adept places by this rite the divine breaths in his own body: *taddehe devyāḥ prāṇān nidhāpayet* \(the commentary glosses *taddehe* by *tasmin navīne dehe*: ‘in this new body’, in this body renewed, transformed by the *bhūtaśuddhi*.

The same occurs in SP 1 \(vol. 1 pp. 128–133\).

102 The *vyāpakanyāsa* consists usually in passing the two hands several times on the entire body, from feet to head, while repeating the *mūlamantra* \(see TBhS 5, p. 171\). We have seen that this can also be done differently. But it always consists in the placing of a *mūlamantra*, or of a fundamental entity or diagram, on the entire body, which must be entirely impregnated and penetrated \(*vyāpta*\).

Cf. *Principles of Tantra* p. 1140: ‘and then by means of Vyāpaka, or comprehensive Nyāsa, to feel the presence of the devatā as one undivided entity whose substance is Mantra all over one’s body from the feet to the crown of the head’.

103 See, for example, the LT chapter 46: *pūjā* of the *laksmīmantra*. Three other chapters of this text \(47, 48, 49\) describe the cult of other mantras: the *nyāsas* are identical. For the *tārikā-mantra*, the principal mantra of the Tantra \(chapters 42–43\), different *nyāsas* are prescribed, but this is because there is no ‘external’ worship here but a *sādhana* where mental elements, visualisations, *japa*, and *mantrayoga*, play an essential role.

Other Vaiṣṇava examples include: the *pūjā* of *Vasudeva-mantra* with eleven *akṣara* in the *Varśakriyākaumudī* pp. 182f.; or the placings of the *mūlamantra* of eight and twelve *akṣara* in the *Sanatkumārasaṃhitā* I, *adhyaya* 9 \(p. 72f. ed. Adyar, 1969\).

### 5 A Hindu rosary ritual

1 The French original version of this paper, ‘Un rituel hindou du rosaire \(*Jayākhyasaṃhitā*, chapitre 14\)’ was published in the *Journal Asiatique*, CCLXXV, 1987, pp. 115–129.

2 Tantric texts are normally meant for the instruction of initiates, these being generally *sādhakas*, adepts looking for rewards or powers \(*bubhukṣu*\). On the *sādhaka*, H. Brunner’s study, ‘Le sādhaka, personnage oublié du śivaïsme du sud’ \(*J.As*, 1975, pp. 411–443\), is still very much worth consulting. The Śaiva *sādhaka*- or *nirvāṇa-dīkṣ ā* is described in vol. 3 of H. Brunner’s edition of the *Somaśambhupaddhati* – SP \(Pondichéry, 1977\).

3 One may of course acquire a fully constituted rosary: this is what all non-initiates – the majority of devotees – do. But such a rosary must be consecrated before it is used.

4 Perhaps surprisingly in a Vaiṣṇava context, the *rudrākṣa*, the berries of Śiva’s tree, are considered the best ones.

5 Tantras usually count women and children among those seeking *mokṣa.*

6 *Astra*, the Weapon mantra, is used in many ritual contexts, being placed \(*nyāsta*\) or ‘sprinkled’ \(*saṃprokṣya*\).

7 *saṃpūjya puṣpadhūpādyais tasya śuddhim athā caret* //28// *dagdham astreṇa saṃcintya varmaṇā māruteritam / āplavyamūlamantreṇa paramāmr̥tarūpiṇā* //29//. Astra and Varman are two of the six ‘limbs’ \(*aṅga*\) of Viṣṇu \(or Śiva\). Astra, the Weapon, is a divine destructive arrow. Varman, or Kavaca, the Cuirass, is protecting: it safeguards the purity given by the fire of the Astra deemed to burn away all impurities. Bathing and fanning are two of the usual services \(*upacāra*\) offered to a deity. We may note here the important role of mental representations in the Hindu cult, the *pūjā*, which is to a large extent a play of imagination.

8 *Caturbhujaṃ tu virajo nārāyanam ivāparam* //30// *varadābhayahastaṃ ca baddhāñjalidharaṃ smaret/brahmadvārasthitaṃ tac ca sūtraṃ dhyayecchikhopamam* //31//. The mentally conceived divine anthropomorphic figure of the rosary is imagined as bearing it also on its head as is the case of the *āyudhapuruṣas* who represent symbolically the ‘arms’ of a deity and bear them on their heads.

9 On the ritual for the Tantric worship of a deity, see SP, vol. 1, pp. 90ff.

10 On the *uddhāra* of mantras, see the first paper, above,

11 In the introduction, p. 37, the editor of the JS gives a shorter form of the mantra: *OṂ THAṂ aksasutrāya namaḥ*.

12 On the *aṅgas*, see H. Brunner’s study: ‘Les membres de Śiva’ in *Asiatische Studien/Etudes Asiatiques*, XL. 2. 1986, pp. 89–132.

13 On *bhāvanā*, see F. Chenet, ‘*Bhāvanā* et créativité de la conscience’, *in Numen*, vol. XXXIV, 1987, pp. 45–96.

14 *sr̥ṣṭikrameṇa*, since the power of the deity is entering the image of the rosary, a process analogous to that of the cosmic process of emanation \(*sr̥ṣṭi*\).

15 *Yā parā vaiṣṇavī śaktir abhinnā paramātmanaḥ* //35// *pracalatpūrṇacandrābhā sūryavatkiraṇāvr̥ttā / yugakṣayograhutabhuktejasā tīvrabr̥ṃhitā* //36// *prāgvat sr̥ṣṭikrameṇaiva smared hr̥tpadmamadhyagām / pūrakeṇa tu viprendra kumbhakena nirodhitām* //37// *hr̥tpadmadmād utthitāṃ bhūyo brahmarandhrāvadīṃ smaret/brahmarandhrāt tato vipra prollasantīṃśanaiś śanaiḥ* //38// *pūrvavat sandhimārgena cintayed dvādaśāntagāṃ / recakākhyena yogena tayā sūtraṃ tu bhāvayet* //39//

16 *Pr̥ṣṭhe*: that is, by the part opposite to the Meru.

17 Note that the JS teachings are only meant for members of the three higher varnas.

18 *niṣkalo mantrarāt tataḥ* //40// *mantravr̥ndasamāyukto magnas tatreti cintayet/ mantrātmā bhagavacchaktis sūtramantrākṣarāṇi vai* //41// *sarvam ekīkr̥tam. dhyāyed yathā kṣīreṇa sodakam / tatra puṣpāñjalau pr̥ṣhe gr̥hītvā cintayed imam* //42// *susaṃ sr̥tākṣasūtrasya patantaṃ pr̥ṣṭhato dvija / sr̥sṭikramāt samāyātaṃ mantraṃ sakalaniṣ kalam* //43// *sphuliṅgaṇasaṅkāśam ādheyatamutāṃ gatam /*

19 *idaṃ vijñāpya deveśam aksasūtramayācyuta* //44// *prayaccha mantrajāpārthaṃ smared dattaṃca tena tat / gr̥hītvā śirasā paścāt prasīda iti coccāret* //45//.

20 *prāptaṃ saṃsrāpayet paścād arghyapātrāc ca vāriṇā / saṃpūjya puṣpadhūpādyair mantraṃ tac ca vinyaset* //46// *sādhāraṃ sādhanaṃ caiva śaktipūrvais samāvr̥ttam* / *sannidhau bhava deveśa sanniruddho bhavācyuta* //47// *sūtrākhye maṇijāle’smin yāvac candrārkatārakam* /.

21 The four stages from thought to action thus correspond to the planes of consciousness, from *turya* to *jāgrat*. The inverse movement is that of the return from discursive waking state to pure inner consciousness.

22 *smaraṇa* is not mere remembrance or memory. It is a recalling to mind and a mental concentration on a thought or on a mantra. In the Trika, *smaraṇa* is used to designate the intuitive consciousness of the highest Reality. In the PTV \(p. 245\), Abhinavagupta glosses *smarati* with *anusaṃdhatte*, that is, one-pointed attention. This sense given to *smarati* goes back to the ancient meaning of *SMR̥*: on this, see L. Silburn, *Instant et Cause* \(Paris: Vrin, 1955, pp. 374–346\).

23 *śl.* 52b–64: *karaṇaṃ vāṅmanaścaiva mantreṇa paramātmanā* //52// *viṣṇunāśaktirūpeṇa bhāvitaṃ bhāvayet purā / cetasā yad uparūḋhaṃ tad yuktaṃ vastu vāggatam* //53// *vastuyuktaṃ ca caitanyaṃ vāktr̥tīyā ca nārada / samārohet karmapade vikāratve śanaiś* śanaiḥ //54// *evaṃ vivartate mantras turyāj jāgrāvadhi kramāt / prātilomyena vai vipra punar eva nivartate* //55// *karaṇaṃ vāksvarūpaṃ syād vāk ca cidrūpiṇī bhavet / yac cittaṃ sa bhaven mantro yo mantras sa tvajo hariḥ* //56// *brahmādya jāgratparyantaṃ punar atraiva samnayet / vyāpakaṃ yat paraṃ brahma śaktir nārāyaṇī ca yā* //57// *sā hy eva pariṇāmena turyākhyaṃ bhajate padam / turyaṃ suṣuptatām eti suṣuptaṃ svapnatāṃ vrajet* //58// *jāgratvaṃ svapnam āyāti evaṃ jāgrādaditaḥ punaḥ / bhagavacchaktiparyantaṃ sandhānaṃ caikataṃ smaret* //59// *yad anityam idaṃ vipra citravat parid śyate / bāhyaṃ viṣayajālaṃ jāgrad etad udāhr̥tam* //60// *anityapratipattir yā asminn upari sarvadā / bhaṇgure svapnatulyo yas sa svapno jāgrakāraṇam* // 61//suṣuptaṃ śāntatāṃ viddhi svapnavr̥tteḥ paraṃ tu yat / śaktirūpasya vai viṣṇoḥ prāptas turyatvam eti saḥ //62// *tayā saha samatvaṃ ca turyātītaṃ tad ucyate / mantrātītaṃ paraṃ mantraṃ sthūlasūkṣmadvayaṃ tathā* //63//*ātmānaṃ pañcamaṃ vipra ekatvenānusaṃdhayet / kr̥tvaivaṃ anusaṃdhānaṃ prārabheta japaṃ tathā* //64//

24 *hr̥tpuṇḋarīkamadhyastho bhārūpaḥ parameśvaraḥ / nirmalasphaṭikaprakhyaḥ prasphuran yaḥ svatejasā* //65// *tasya śabdamayī śaktī* \(? ?\) *jvālāvan nismr̥taṃ mahat*\(?\)/*taddharmadharmiṇī śuddhā tasyā vai varṇasaṃtatiḥ* //66// *nismr̥tā mantrajananī tadagrāc- caiva mantrarāṭ/nismr̥taṃ* \(*tu*\) *yathā puṣpaṃ latāgrān munisattama* //67// *evam evākṣasūtre tu uditaṃ ca kramaṃ smaret/hr̥llayam. tallayīkuryāddhr̥llayasya ca tat thatā* //68// *ekasya mantranāthasya antarbāhyoditasya ca* /.

25 Such a rite for the so-called ‘outer worship’ \(*bāhyayāga*\) of the deity is described in chapter 13 \(ś*l*. 100ff.\) of the JS. A similar ritual is to be found in the Śaiva context – \(see for instance the SP1 – similitude due to the fact that the Pāñcarātra was strongly influenced by shaivism.

26 This is carefully described in *śl.* 73–76a. It appears to be done by a particular movement of the thumb which moves the rosary along the finger \(the index, normally\) on which it rests, the counting going on in the same sense. To avoid crossing the Meru, other texts prescribe counting the beads alternatively in one sense and then in the reverse.

27 There are variant lists of these acts, some including nine acts. On the *ṣaṭkarmāṇI*, see T. Goudriaan’s study, *Māyā Divine and Human*, already quoted, pp. 251–412.

28 The passage I allude to is as follows: « *paradehepraveśe ca tattvānāṃpreraṇe dvija/ krūrakarmaṇī siddhyarthaṃ japo jyotirmayas smr̥taḥ* // 79// *tatrāntarlīnam amalaṃ śabdaṃ tu paribhāvayet / bhuktimuktiprasiddhyarthaṃ doṣaduhkhakṣayaṅkaram* //80// *śāntau tu sarvakāryāṇāṃ siddhyartham avicārataḥ / sukhasaubhāgyasiddhyarthaṃ tataḥ ‘py ādhānakarmaṇi* //81// *japo bhavati śabdākhyas tatrāntaras tu vibhāvayet / niśāmbukaṇasaṅkāśaprakāśātma janārdana* //82// *hr̥tpadmāt tu svamantreṇa bhāvayeccchabdam utthitam / nityoditaṃtu tenaiva prayatnarahiteṇa tu* //83// *praṇāpannapadasthena bhāvanāmiṣritena / japyamānas tu vai mantras sarvakāmaphala pradaḥ* //84//.

29 In all ritual worship, the deity first installed in the icon by the rite of *āvahana* so as to be worshipped is removed from the ritual icon by the *visarjana* rite, once the worship is over. The same process is used for the rosary. The mantra being used is: *OṂ bhagavanmantramūrte svapadam āsādya kṣamasva kṣamasva OṂ namo namaḥ.*

30 This mantra is: *OṂ ḤRŪṂ VAUṂ viṣvakṣenāya namaḥ.*

### 6 On the defects and the perfecting of mantras

1 A paper on the same subject was published as pp. 499–510 of the *Pandit N.R. Bhatt Felicitation Volume*, P-S. Filliozat, S.P. Narang and G.P. Bhatta, eds., Delhi, 1994.

2 On this dual aspect of mantras, see Hélène Brunner’s study ‘Mantras et *mantras* dans les Tantras śivaïtes’ in *Le parole e i marmi. Studi in onore di Raniero Gnoli nel suo 70° compleano*, Raffaele Torella et al., Rome: IIAO, 2001, pp. 183–212.

3 See Introduction, p. 95, and the next chapter.

4 On this tantra of the śākta Yāmala tradition \(existing only in manuscript form\), and on its commentaries, see A. Sanderson ‘The Sulva Exegesis of Kashmir’ in D. Goodall and A. Padoux, *Mélanges tantriques à la mémoire d’Hélène Brunner*, Pondichéry, 2007, pp. 231–424. On this tantra, and on the \(perhaps thirteenth century\) *Mantramuktāvali*, as well as on the ŚT, see also T. Goudriaan and S. Gupta, *Hindu Tantric and Śākta Literature*, Wiesbaden, 1981, pp. 49, 134–137,

5 1.75–78 refers to the Tantrik Texts edition of the TRT \(reprint Delhi, 1981\); 1.73–81 to the edition of its first chapter with the Sudarśana commentary of Prāṇamañjarī \(Calcutta, 1940\). This Tantrarāja is a different text from the tantra quoted by Abhinavagupta in the Tantrāloka as Tantrarājabhaṭṭāraka, which is the 24.000 *śloka Jayadrathayāmala*.

6 The absence of *aṃśa* is a serious defect since, as we have seen previously \(see chapter 2, pp. 19–21, on *mantravicāra*, a mantra can only be made use of by a *sādhaka* if there is an *aṃśa.*

7 This is a different case from that of a mantra which is ‘asleep’ without being defective, and is to be ‘awakened’ before being made use of.

8 See Introduction, pp. 3–4.

9 On these practices, see the next chapter.

10 According to the *Śivārcanacandrikā*, the mantra in such a case is purified by repeating it thrice whilst raising the *kuṇḋalinī* and then doing a *pūjā* to the devatā.

11 See *Agnipurāṇa*, chapter 292 or Tārābhaktisudhārṇava \(p. 324\) quoting the *Rudrayāmala*.

12 This tantra is perhaps the same as the *Mahocchuṣma* quoted by Jayaratha in his Viveka on TĀ 1.18 as one of the eight Brahmayāmalatantras \(*ibid*. vol. 1, p. 42\), a group of texts where Kapālīśabhairava has Mahocchuṣmā among the four goddesses of his retinue \(see A. Sanderson, ‘Saivism and the Tantric traditions’, in C. Carrithers et al. eds, *The Category of the Person*, London, 1988, pp. 660–704\).

13 It is unclear how this is to be done.

14 On this term, see chapter 7, p. 96.

15 The term *mātr̥kā* for the letters of the alphabet is used when their nature of powers \(*śakti*\) is to be underlined – for instance, when they are ritually placed on the body by *nyāsa*.

2 The NT, with Kṣemarāja’s *Uddyota*, was published as vols. 16 and 61 of the Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies \(KSTS\), Bombay, 1926–1939. This edition is reprinted in one volume edited with an introduction by V.V. Dvivedi, Delhi: Parimal Publications, 1985.

3 On this practice, see the entry on *pratyaṅgira* of the *Tāntrikābhidhānakośa* \(TAK\), vol. 3 \(forthcoming\).

4 These nine practices are as follows: *dīpana, bodhana, tāḋana, abhiṣecana, vimalikaraṇa, indhananiveśana, santarpaṇa, guptībhāva and āpyāya.* This list is partly the same as that of the usual ten *mantrasaṃskāras* used to counteract the *mantradoṣas* quoted, for instance, in the *Śāradātilaka* 2.112–123, or in the *Kuārṇavatantra*: on the subject, see here chapter 6.

5 The action of encasing is *sampuṭīkaraṇa/kr̥iti*, a term used more often, I believe, metaphorically, especially in the Trika, to describe the mutual encasement \(that is, the conjunction or fusion\) of two metaphysical entities, usually Śiva and Śakti. It is also used to express the mutual inherence of Śiva and the cosmos \(see MVT 11.07; TĀ 3.205–206; *Parātriṃśikāvivaraṇa*, pp. 264–265, etc.\). The term is used in the NṢA \(1.29–30\) to describe the coincidence of the first two \(inner\) triangles of the *śrīcakra*: one identified with Śiva, the other with Śakti.

6 These two works are the same text under two different names: *Vāmake*ś*varīmata*a, with the commentary of Rājanaka Jayaratha, KSTS, LXVI, Srinagar, 1945. *Nity*ā*ṣoḋaśikārṇava*, with two commentaries, *R̥ijuvimaśinī* of Śivānanda and *Artharatnāvalī* of Vidyānanda, edited by V.V. Dvidedi, Varanasi, 1968.

7 This is a magical practice: *cakra, bīja* and letters are to be inscribed on gold leaf to be worn as a protective amulet \(*rakṣā*\).

8 The meaning of *grasta* in this context is not to be linked with its meaning in grammar/phonetics, where it is a fault of pronunciation due to the utterance of a letter hindered or held back at the throat – cf.*R̥kprātiśakya* XIV,3: *jihvāmūlavigrahe grastam etat.*

9 In their commentaries on NṢA or VMT, Śivānanda and Vidyānanda explain: *aṅkuśaḥ kromkāraḥ.*

10 This is clearly stated in Prāṇamañjarī’s commentary on TRT 1.72 where she describes several practices and says that there are still other ones. Cf. TRT with the commentary *Sudarśana* of Prāṇamañjarī critically edited for the first time by Jatindrabimal Chaudhury, Calcutta, 1940. Prāṇamañjarī lived in Varanasi in the eighteenth century.

11 See ‘Un terme technique de *mantraśāstra, vidarbha*’, *JAs*, CCLXV \(1977\), pp. 345–349.

12 These are usually *pallava, yoga, rodha, grathana, sampuṭa* and *vidarbha* \(order of the PheṭK\). The longer list of the NT originates perhaps – like the one previously given of nine mantric practices – in the *Ucchuṣmatantra*, that is, in an earlier stratum of Tantric texts.

13 In the PTV, p. 243 – see above, Introduction, p. 8 and note 17.

14 On the nature of mantras as well as on the non-dualistic Śaiva conceptions of the word, refer to my *Vāc. The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras* \(Albany: SUNY Press, 1990; Indian edition, Delhi: Satguru Publications, 1992\), and to H.P. Alper, ed., *Understanding Mantras* \(Albany: SUNY Press, 1988\), which includes an – at that date – exhaustive bibliography on the subject.

15 On *nyā*sa, see here chapter 4.

16 The YH with Amr̥tānanda’s commentary, the *Dīpikā*, was edited by V.V. Dvivedi, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1998. I refer here to this edition which is the only reliable Indian edition of this work. French translation with introduction and notes by André Padoux: *Le coeur de la Yoginī*, Yoginīhr̥daya, *avec le commentaire* Dīpikā *d’Amr̥tānanda*, Paris: Collège de France, 1994.

17 An explanatory note with a drawing of the *kāmakalā* is given on p. 202 of my translation of the YH. On the *kāmakalā*, and especially its sexual connotations, see David G. White, *Kiss of the Yoginī. ‘Tantric Sex’ in its South Asian Context*, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2000.

18 We saw above \(p. 97\) a *nyāsa*, on the image of the goddess Tripurasundarī, of her *mūlavidyā, aṅkuśena vidarbhitā*: intersected and bound up with the *aṅkuśabīja KROṂ*.

19 This is Sarasvatī, also called Vāgīṣī. The name Lipidevī, however, implies that this is a *written* alphabet goddess. Sarasvatī, in fact, holds a book in one of her hands; the written word is thus associated with her, on the divine plane.

20 It is described in several tantras, the *Siddhayogeśvarīṃata, Mālinīvijayottara, Kubjik*ā*mata*, in the PTV, as well as in the AgP 145.

21 On the Mālinī, see the *ṇādiphānta* entry of the TAK, vol. 3. An interpretive study of this letter-deity is that of Somdev Vasudeva, ‘Synaesthetic Iconography: 1. The N. ādiphāntakrama’, which quotes several texts, published in D. Goodall and A. Padoux, eds., *Mélanges tantriques à la mémoire d’Hélène Brunner/Tantric Studies in Memory of Hélène Brunner*, Pondichéry: Institut Français de Pondichéry, 2007, pp. 517–550.

22 This is described in Jayaratha’s commentary on TĀ 3.67. On this, see my *Vāc* \(quoted above, note 14\), pp. 241–243.

23 On these diagrams, see the appendix of J.A. Schoterman’s edition of the *Ṣaṭsāhasrasaṃhitā, op cit*.

24 On *mantroddhāra* and the quest for *aṃśa*, I wrote an article published in the *BEFEO* 65, 1978, an English \(revised\) version of which is published here as chapter 2.

25 On should perhaps underline in this respect that the same Sanskrit term, *pāṭha*, is used for reading and for reciting. The coalescence of these two meanings is interesting, and is surely not accidental.

26 Transposed in another civilisation where the written sign is fundamental, mantras have evolved differently, as instanced by the *siddham* script of the Japanese Shingon sect, where Sanskrit *bījas* are used in meditation very much like Chinese characters. See on this R.H. van Gulik, *Siddham. An Essay on the History of Sanskrit Studies in China and Japan*, New Delhi: Sharada Rani, 1980.

ADDENDA 2009: On the nature of mantras and especially on the oral/written relationship, see A. Padoux, ‘L’oral et l’écrit. mantra et *mantraśāstra*’, translated here as chapter 9.

On the role of writing in India, see Charles Malamoud, ‘Noirceur de l’écriture. Remarques sur un thème littéraire de l’Inde ancienne’, in *Paroles à dire, paroles à écrire*, Paris: Editions de l’EHESS, 1997, pp. 85–114.





### 8 Body and mantra: mantras in the human body

1 In this paper I take up again, but more briefly, a subject on which I wrote an article

‘Corps et mantra. De la présence des mantras dans le corps’ published in Oscar Botto, *et al*, eds., *Du corps humain, au carrefour de plusieurs savoirs en Inde. Mélanges offerts à Arion Roṣu par ses collègues et ses amis à l’occasion de son 80e anniversaire*, Bucarest et Paris, 2004, pp.563–578.

2 On this important notion, see Paul Schilder’s classical work on the subject: *The Image and Appearance of the Human Body*, first published in 1935.

3 One says, too, that the yogin attains a state of mantra: *mantratvam.*

4 This important text of the Pāñcarātra contains many ritual prescriptions. It was edited in the Gaekwad Oriental Series \(vol. 54\), Baroda, 1967. See on this Marion Rastelli, *Philosophisch-theologische Grundanschauungen des Jayākhyasaṃhitā. mit einer Darstellung des Täglichen Rituals*, Vienna, Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1999. Though very interesting, this text has not been translated.

5 This mental worship is studied and carefully commented upon in chapter 12 of the thesis of M. Rastelli, quoted in the preceding note.

6 There are, as far as I know, no serious systematic studies of Hindu *mudrās* used in ritual. On a particular Tantric case, see A. Padoux, ‘The body in Tantric ritual: the case of the mudrās’, in T. Goudriaan, ed., *The Sanskrit Tradition and Tantrism*, Leiden, 1990, pp. 60–75.

7 This assertion is to be qualified, for a deity can very well be conceived as being ‘made of’ letters only. The mantra-god Navātman, for instance, is made up of the nine phonemes *HSKŚMLVRYŪṂ*, A Tantric deity having always one or several ‘faces’ \(*vaktra*\) and ‘members’ \(*aṅga*\), its mantric form will also include theses additions, which will also be made up of phonemes – see TĀ 30.15–16a. Are we faced, then, with mental images or with mentally evoked phonetic enunciations? As for Navātman, this god is also described as a beautiful young man, associated with different goddesses, notably the hunchbacked goddess Kubjikā: what is evoked in his case? The anthropomorphic figure, or the syllabic enunciation? On the *navātman* mantra, see the *navātman* entry of the TĀK, vol. 3.

8 On this, see the *Somaśambupaddhati*, vol. 3, edited and translated in French by Hélène Brunner \(Pondicherry, 1977\), on the Śaiva initiations. Plates in the appendix to that book show how such cosmic elements are placed on the body of the initiand.

9 Such, for instance, as those illustrating the *Ṣaṭcakranirūpaṇa* edited by A. Avalon as *The Serpent Power, being the Shat-Chakra-Nirūpana and Pādukāpañcaka*, Madras: Ganesh & Co., 1953.

10 The process is described in full detail by M. Rastelli, in pp. 246–270 of her study *Philosophisch-theologische Grundanschauungen der Jayākhyāsaṃhitā* \(Vienna, 1999\).

11 This mental rite is studied by A. Sanderson: ‘Meaning in Tantric ritual’, in A.M. Blondeau and Fr. Schipper, eds., *Essais sur le rituel* III, Paris: Bibliothèque des Hautes Etudes, Sciences Religieuses, vol. CII, pp. 15–95.

12 This worship of the goddesses is described and commented by A. Sanderson, ‘Maṇḋala and Āgamic Identity in the Trika of Kashmir’, in A. Padoux, ed., *Mantras et diagrammes rituels dans l’hindouisme* \(Paris 1986\), with a drawing showing the body of the adept drawn by Stefanie Sanderson – printed again on p. 308 of the 1999 reprint of R. Gnoli’s translation of the TĀ \(Milano: Adelphi, 1999\).

13 I am not sure ‘lived body’ is good English – probably not. What I wish to refer to here is the distinction put forward by Max Scheler \(and taken over by existential psychoanalysis, the Daseinanalyse\) between the *Leib*, the body as it is experienced, lived, and the *Körper*, which is the perceived, physical, anatomic body; both of course are never separated – one does not ‘live’ merely with one’s physical body.

14 On *uccāra*, see the entry on this word in vol.1 of the TĀK. *prāṇa* is not the respiratory breath, but a ‘subtle’ inner vital ‘breath’. L. Renou defined it as ‘l’aspect vital de l’*ātman*’. On this subject, see the entry *prāṇa* of the TĀK.

15 In S. Gupta, D.J Hoens, T. Goudriaan, *Hindu Tantrism* \(Leiden, 1979\). Though purely imaginary, the yogic body, being ‘intraposed’ within the anatomic body, is both very largely delineated on it and linked to it when its aspect and functioning are visualised: all this ‘happens in the body’. This authorises some – Mircea Eliade, for instance – to speak in such a case of ‘physiologie mystique’: the expression is debatable, but it underlines well the link, the interaction of those two ‘bodies’.

16 This important tantra is often quoted or referred to by Abhinavagupta. It deals mostly with the cult of mantra-goddesses possessing magical powers. A shorter version of this work was edited and translated in English by Judit Törzsök for an Oxford \(unpublished\) thesis. A fuller edition is now expected.

17 The SvT describes this in the cosmic and soteriological perspective of the six ‘ways’ \(*adhvan*\).

18 The NT completes the series of twelve *kalās* with those from *nādānta to unmanā* as corresponding to different, ever higher, planes of the deity. A precise and very usefully commented description of this passage of the NT is given by Hélène Brunner in her study of that tantra: ‘Un tantra du nord: le Netratantra’, *BEFEO*, LXI \(1974\), pp. 125–197.

*kūṭatraye mahādevi kuṇḋalinītraye ‘pi ca*/

*cakranāṃ pūrvapūrveṣāṃ nādarūpeṇa yojanam*//


20 For the *Yoginīhr̥daīya*, as for many Śaiva texts, the *kuṇḋalinī* is considered as comprising three sections: igneous, solar and lunar. The first, igneous, section starting from the lowest *cakra*, the second part, solar, extends from the heart-*cakra* to the *bhrūmadhya*, where begins the third one. To this threefold division corresponds that of the ś*rīvidyā*; it is also present in the nine *cakras* constituting the *śrīcakra* which are also distributed into three groups. During the *japa*, all these three groups are brought together by the ascent of the *nāda* which prolongs the *uccāra* of the three *HRĪṂ.*

21 For the Śaiva cultic practice as described in the āgamas \(and as it is still, in some cases, performed in India today\), see R.H. Davis, *Ritual in an Oscillating Universe. Worshipping Śiva in Medieval India*, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991. We, of course, do not know if a real mystical union with the deity in ritual was current among Śaiva adepts in the tenth to fourteenth centuries. We know, on the other hand, that officiants often limit themselves to the mere enunciation of the prescribed mantras – mantraprayoga – without trying to do anything else than follow formally the prescriptions of the ritual handbooks: this is indeed very far from the world of the ancient texts – but we do not know much about that world.

22 The big toe of the right foot is the spot where Kālāgni, the \(destructive\) Fire of Time which burns the cosmos to cinders, comes forth. We see here that the destruction of the body of the adept is foreseen.

23 The *cakras or granthis*, spots, ‘nods’ where the power, the *prāṇa*, concentrates are in a way obstacles for they are thresholds to be passed. This is why, to progress, they are to be cut or pierced: *granthiccheda*. See the entries on these terms in the TĀK, vol. 2.

24 On *khecara* and the state of being *khecara* \(*khecaratā/khecaratva*\), see the corresponding entries of the TĀK, vol. 2,





### 9 The oral and the written

1 Translation of ‘L’oral et l’ecrit. Mantra et *mantraśāstra*’, in C. Champion, ed., *Traditions orales dans le monde indien*, Paris: Editions de l’EHESS, 1996, pp. 133–148.

2 They are, in fact, deities: Tantric pantheons are pantheons of mantras.

3 On the ‘circulation’ of a mantra in the *nāḋīs*, see, for instance, chapter 7 of the NT which describes the ‘subtle meditation’ \(*sūkṣmadhyāna*\) of the Netramantra *OṂ JUṂ SAḤ*. This mantric practice is briefly described in Brunner, 1974, and Padoux, 1990, pp. 411–406.

4 The recordings on cassettes \(or otherwise\) of the mantras of the *pūjā* that one finds nowadays in India show another aspect of the ‘vulgarisation’ of mantras. The ritual formulas of the usual daily Hindu worship, however, are not secret – differing in this from those for the worship of esoteric Tantric deities.

5 We must not forget, on this subject, that silent, purely visual, reading is a comparatively modern usage. Earlier, reading was pronouncing, thus giving back to the oral its rightful place. See Ong, 1982.

6 *uddhāra:* from *ud-DHR̥*, take out, raise up, select, extract, See, here, chapter 2 on the extraction and selection of mantras.

7 On prastaras and gahvaras, see J.G. Schoterman, *The Satsahasrasamhita*, Brill, 1982.

8 On the rites through which an adept – a *sādhaka* – masters the mantra he has received, see Brunner 1974a, pp. 411–443.

9 On these rites, see here chapter 2, pp. 18–22.

10 That is, the imaginary structure of centres \(*cakra*\) and channels \(*nāḋī*\) conceived as present in the physical body. It is usually, but wrongly, called ‘subtle body’; the subtle body \(*sūkṣma*- or *liṅgaśarīra*\) properly so-called being something else.

11 On this sense of *dhyāna*, see the entry on that word in the TAK, vol. 3 which refers to G. Bühneman, *The Iconography of Hindu Tantric Deities* \(two vol., Groningen. Egbert Forsten, 2000–2001\). By *nyāsa* one may also place divine entities, cosmic divisions, *yantras* or *cakras*, etc.

12 When tantras, etc., name a mantra, they generally quote the *r̥ṣi* who has first ‘seen’ it, its metre \(*chandas*\) – which gives it a ‘vedic’ air – then the deity \(*devatā*\) it expresses, and the syllable which is its seed \(*bīja*\). To these are sometimes added the power \(*śakti*\), the point \(*kīlaka*\) and the use \(*viniyoga*\) of the mantra.

13 A triangle \(point down\) is the symbol of the goddess, of the feminine. The phoneme *E* is thus in essence the locus of creation – and of bliss. It is, Jayaratha says \(*ad*, TĀ 3.94\), the ‘mouth of the Yoginī’ \(*yoginīvaktra*\) where one receives initiation and experiences the bliss of liberation. But *vaktra*, in this case, is not the mouth, but the sexual organ of the Yoginī, where the yogin in sexual union with his ritual partner attains bliss and fusion with the Absolute. The deity, in this case, is above all form, whilst being also \(at least metaphysically\) triangular.

This sort of practice is described in chapter 29 of the *Tantrāloka* – on which see Silburn, *Kundalinī. The Energy of the Depths*, Albany, 1988.

14 On the *uccāra* of *OṂ*, see Padoux, 1990, chap. 7, pp. 402–411. On the *kāmakalā*, see Punyānanda’s *Kāmakalāvilāsa*, edited and translated by A. Avalon, or, for a study and interpretation of this diagram, David G. White, ‘Transformation in the Art of Love. Kāmakalā Practices in Hindu Tantric and Kaula Traditions,’ *History of Religions*, 18/2, 1998, pp. 172–198.

15 Buddhist *dhāraṇis* were translated in Chinese, written therefore since the fourth century. But the cult and homage paid to the *sūtras* as holy ‘Scripture’ seem to have existed earlier in the Mahāyāna traditions. The most marked cult of the Book is that of the Sikh *Adigranth*, but it is by reciting it that it is honoured and that a beneficial result is produced. See Dusenbery 1992.

In the Hindu field, a purāṇa, as a book or, better, in manuscript, may be honoured. Such is the case notably of the *Devīmāhatmya*: see Coburn, 1991.

16 On the *mantiravatis*, see Diehl, 1956.

17 On the *anārthakya* \(lack of meaning\) of mantras, see Renou, 1960, specially, pp. 70ff.
