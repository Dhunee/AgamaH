TANTRA  IN PRACTICE  

Edited by David Gordon White  

## 
As David White explains in the Introduction to Tantra in Practice, Tantra is an Asian body  of beliefs and practices that seeks to channel the divine energy that grounds the universe,  in creative and liberating ways. The subsequent chapters reflect the wide geographical and  temporal scope of Tantra by examining thirty-six texts from China, India, Japan, Nepal,  and Tibet, ranging from the seventh century to the present day, and representing the full  range of Tantric experience - Buddhist, Hindu, Jain, and even Islamic. Each text has been  chosen and translated, often for the first time, by an international expert in the field who  also provides detailed background material. Students of Asian religions and general readers  alike will find the book rich and informative.  

The book includes plays, transcribed interviews, poetry, parodies, inscriptions, instruc tional texts, scriptures, philosophical conjectures, dreams, and astronomical speculations,  each text illustrating one of the diverse traditions and practices of Tantra. Thus, the nine teenth-century Indian Buddhist Garland of Gems, a series of songs, warns against the illu sion of appearance by referring to bees, yogurt, and the fire of Malaya Mountain; while  fourteenth-century Chinese Buddhist manuscripts detail how to prosper through the Seven  Stars of the Northern Dipper by burning incense, making offerings to scriptures, and chanting  incantations. In a transcribed conversation, a modern Hindu priest in Bengal candidly ex plains how he serves the black goddess Kali and feeds temple skulls lentils, wine, or rice. A  seventeenth-century Nepalese Hindu praise-poem hammered into the golden doors to the  temple of the Goddess Taleju lists a king's faults and begs her forgiveness and grace. An  introduction accompanies each text, identifying its period and genre, discussing the his tory and influence of the work, and identifying points of particular interest or difficulty.  

The first book to bring together texts from the entire range of Tantric phenomena, Tantra  in Practice continues the Princeton Readings in Religions series. The breadth of work in cluded, geographic areas spanned, and expert scholarship highlighting each piece serve to  expand our understanding of what it means to practice Tantra.  

David Gordon White is Associate Professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the  University of California, Santa Barbara. A specialist in the religions of South Asia, he is the  author of Myths of the Dog-Man and The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval  India.

Adopting a fresh approach to sourcebooks on the religions of the world, Princeton Readings in  Religions moves away from an emphasis on philosophy and the religious expressions of elite  groups to represent instead a wide range of current and historical religious practices. The series  provides a new configuration of texts by making available for the first time works that have never  been translated before, including ritual texts, hagiographical and autobiographical works,  folktales, and ethnographic material. Although the books are designed for students, specialists  will discover in them a wealth of unfamiliar and valuable material. Furthermore, the selections,  appealing in themselves, are placed in an understandable context to attract a wide audience  of general readers. The contributors include experts from around the world, each of whom  provides a substantial introduction for his or her piece, placing the text in time and genre,  discussing the history and influence of the work, and identifying points of particular difficulty  or interest. Each volume also contains a substantial general introduction in which the history  of the traditions is outlined and the significance of each work is explored.

TANTR A I N PRACTIC E   

### INTRODUCTION  

Tantra in Practice: Mapping a Tradition  

David Gordon White  

As with all the books in this series, the present volume has the word "practice"  in its title. Practice is impossible without agents of practice, that is, practitioners,  and the first four sections of this volume comprise those contributions that focus  on Tantric practitioners or actors. These include Tantric preceptors (gurus) and  their followers; kings and priests; and devotees and the Tantric gods they worship  (for the gods too are Tantric actors). These relationships were not static, however,  and the fourth section contains accounts of traditions in transition and conflict.  The last three sections of the volume are devoted to the practices themselves.  Those contributions which describe the broad general practice of an entire tra dition or region of the Tantric world make up the fifth section. A wide gamut of  types or elements of Tantric practice, both external rites and their internal cor 

relates, is explored in sections six and seven.  

It may be that the ideal medium for a presentation of Tantric practice (or any  practice, for that matter) would be a video or CD-ROM, in which one could  actually view Tantric practitioners practicing their Tantra. This is impossible for  a number of reasons - Tantric secrecy, the fact that many of the practices detailed  here disappeared centuries ago, the practical limitations of scholarly publishing - so the reader is presented with a thick book. But books have their advantages as  well, and the Tantras themselves (which are texts) clearly state that scripture is  the necessary complement to the oral teachings one receives from the mouth of  one's guru. Furthermore, "pure" practice without interpretive theory is like a map  without a legend: if you don't know what the various elements of the practice  mean, then it is nothing but empty gestures. The reader should therefore not be  susprised to find that this volume on Tantric practice contains a significant  amount of material on Tantric theory. Very often, this is built into the structure  of the Tantric texts themselves: instructions for practice are contextualized in the  theories - of man, the universe, and everything - that undergird them. Yet these  theories can be as impenetrable as the practices themselves, especially in such 

4 DAVID GORDON WHITE  

esoteric traditions as these. Therefore, a second level of interpretation is in order,  and this is the invaluable contribution of the thirty-nine scholars whose chapters  are presented here, for not only have they translated the many languages of the  Tantras into English but they have also translated the multifaceted Tantric world 

view into comprehensible language in their introductory essays.  I have attempted to do the same in this general introduction, and the reader  will find that my analysis is based in no small part on the work of these same  scholars, whose publications I cite. In this introduction, names in [square brack ets] refer to contributions found in this volume; references in (parentheses) refer  to works found in the bibliography to this essay.  

Can Tantra Be Mapped?  

The contributions brought together in this volume all treat of Tantra, a body of  religious practice that has long defied scholarly attempts at definition. There are  many who maintain that Tantra or "Tantrism" is a Western category, imposed  upon Asian traditions in much the same way that the term "Hinduism" was ap 

plied, some centuries ago, to a wide swath of mainstream religious beliefs and  practices found on the Indian subcontinent. As Gertrude Stein did for the city of  Oakland, such persons assert on the subject of Tantra that there is no "there"  there. One could make the same claim regarding much of the terminology we  live with, of course: the categories of "religion," "democracy," and "art," for ex 

ample, prove to be quite nebulous when exposed to the glare of critical scrutiny.  Others would maintain that the Indian parable of the blind men and the elephant  is applicable to Tantra. Depending on which part of the elephant (which specific  Tantric tradition) a given blind man (scholar) is touching (studying), his account  of the animal (Tantra) will vary widely from that of his fellow blind man. The  scholar examining the fine hard tusk of pure Buddhist esotericism in modern day Japan would find herself hard pressed to recognize that the deeply furrowed  hide of the medieval Indian Kapalika's (Skull-Bearer's) practice [Lorenzen] is a  part of the same Tantric organism.  

Then there are the Western dilettantes, the self-proclaimed Tantric entrepre neurs, who have hitched their elephant-wagons to the New Age star to peddle a  dubious product called Tantric Sex, which they (and their clientele) assume to  be all there ever was to Tantra. It is certainly the case that the earliest accounts  of Tantra to reach the West were colonial descriptions from India, penned by  missionaries or administrators who presented its practices as particularly abomi nable excrescences of South Asian superstition. Their descriptions often included  shocking images of wholesale orgy in which every taboo was broken and all  human propriety perverted. Over the past two hundred years, there have been  three sorts of reactions to these distorted images. The first of these is that of India  itself: colonial and postcolonial Indians simply deny that such has ever existed;  or if it has, that it has had anything to do with Hinduism (another term that defies  categorization). The second is that of Tantric scholar-practitioners, both AsianINTRODUCTIO N 5  

and Western, who, in an attempt to rehabilitate this image of Tantra, have em phasized the refined ("right-handed") philosophical speculation that grew out of  preexisting ("left-handed") Tantric practices - some of which were of a sexual or  transgressive nature - while generally denying the foundational importance of  transgressivity or sexuality to the traditions themselves. The third, already men tioned, is that of the for-profit purveyors of Tantric Sex, who have no compunc tions about appropriating a misguided nineteenth-century polemic to peddle their  shoddy wares.  

' All three interpretive strategies may be viewed as legacies of the original "text"  of colonial misrepresentations of Tantra in India. All three tend to imagine Tantra  as a timeless, unalterable essence or excrescence that did not undergo any changes  either prior to or since its nineteenth-century "coming out," and that remained  constant as it was carried outward from India into every part of Asia. As the  variety of contributions to this volume show, neither the sensationalist colonial  representations nor the unsatisfactory monothetic responses to them, either "for"  or "against," stand up against the empirical data. The picture that emerges is rather  one of a complex array of ritual, theoretical, and narrative strategies that are  specific to their various religious, cultural, sociopolitical, geographical, and his torical contexts. Yet for all this, there nonetheless exists a grouping of common  denominators that should permit us to classify these as so many varieties of a  single tradition, the "there" of Tantra.  

In the pages that follow, I attempt to tease out the parameters and lineaments  of this thing called Tantra from a number of perspectives. The first of these is  thematic or phenomenological. This is mainly a comparative endeavor, in which  the common elements of many types of Tantric theory and practice arejuxtaposed  and synthesized. This sort of outsider's assessment of Tantra is an etic one: made  from a variety of perspectives, it will tend to characterize Tantra in ways not  necessarily recognizable to Tantric practitioners themselves. The Tantric insider's  or emic view must of necessity also be incorporated into our description. These  two perspectives, when juxtaposed with one another, ought to provide us with a  Tantric "ideology" - that is, a set of categorical "lenses" through which Tantric  practitioners have made sense of their practice within their broader worldview  (their ontology) and understandings of power in the world (their religious polity),  and human salvation in or beyond this world (their soteriology). Systems of prac tice that are incompatible with or unadaptable to lived experience on the one  hand, and to an imagined ontology, polity, and soteriology on the other, will not  persist through time. Perhaps unbeknownst to themselves, practitioners are con stantly testing their traditions against lived reality, and although religious change  is notoriously slow, it is nonetheless inexorable. Therefore, if there is still some 

thing called Tantra that has persisted since its origins in the middle of the first  millennium of the common era down to the present day - and I contend that  there is - its architectonics should be discernable through its emic categories.  Our approach, then, will consist of an inductive linking of the most salient features  of Tantric practice to specific and general Tantric precepts.  

The second perspective adopted here is historical. It is the case that every South 

6 DAVI D GORDO N WHIT E  

and East Asian religious tradition has had a Tantric phase or component, and  many of these continue down to the present day. However, none of these have  continued unchanged since the original Tantric impetus, and it is for this reason  that our account of Tantra must be historical. No synchronic taxonomy of the  salient features of Tantric theory and practice will suffice; only through a dia 

chronic or evolutionary overview of the various schools, sects, scriptures, bodies  of practice, and lines of transmission that have comprised Tantra will we be able  to make sense of this tradition. Such a historical accounting must not, moreover,  be limited to a simple history of ideas. It must engage as well with ground-level  practice, imagery, institutions, political realities, and the interface between public  and private religion.  

Third, our approach must attend to the human agents or actors in the dissem ination and transformation of Tantric doctrines and practices. Here the following  questions must be addressed. Which Tantric practitioners have practiced for  themselves, and which have practiced for others as Tantric specialists? What have  been the social and religious backgrounds of the latter? Who have constituted  their clienteles? What have been their clients' motives for engaging them to per form their functions? When a king or other potentate is a Tantric practitioner,  what impact does his patronage have on religious institutions and the religious  and political life of his subjects? What has been the nature of the interface between  "popular" and "elite" forms of practice? How do theory and practice change when  practice becomes individual as opposed to collective?  

Finally, a word about the scope of this endeavor. Because this is a comparative  enterprise (in which different forms of Tantra, from different historical periods,  religious traditions, and sociopolitical contexts are being compared), the question  of parameters arises: where does one draw the line between "Tantra" and "not 

Tantra"? In other words, if we are attempting to delimit Tantra from other forms  of religious practice in Asia, what are our criteria to be for determining Tantra's  specificity? What is it that has made Tantra stand out from the mainstream (or  in some cases, as the mainstream) as a body of practice to live for - and sometimes  to fight for, to kill for, or to die for? Throughout the fifteen hundred years of its  history, Tantra has rarely left people indifferent, and this has been precisely due  to the fact that it has been viewed as something different.  

Our definition of Tantra must therefore attend to Tantra's difference, but here  as well we must tread with caution. We may speak in terms of a "hard core" and  a "soft core" of Tantra. The former, composed solely of those elements of Tantric  doctrine and practice that are not found anywhere else in the Asian religious  traditions under study, would provide us with a sharply defined but very limited  account of Tantra - and one that would, moreover, probably exclude many of  the doctrines and practices that practitioners have themselves deemed to be Tan 

tric. A more inclusive, "soft core," definition tends to break down, however, be cause its parameters will encompass doctrines and practices found in nearly all  forms of the various Asian traditions, from the Vedas and early teachings of the  Buddha and Mahavira down through conventional forms of Hinduism, Jainism, 

INTRODUCTION 7  

Buddhism, Daoism, and Shinto, as well as in many nonelite forms of Asian reli gious practice. For example, much of mainstream Hindu devotional ritual - pre liminary purifications, the use of mantras for honoring the deity, forms of worship,  and so on - has its origins in the scriptures of the "soft core" of Hindu Tantra,  the Saiva Agamas. Elsewhere, the Tantric dictum that the human being (as op posed to an animal or a deity) is the creature best suited to salvation or liberation  through Tantric practice differs little from anthropocentric doctrines of the  broader Hindu, Buddhist, or Jain mainstream. The danger here is that everything  becomes Tantra, and our category loses its specificity.  

Yet, at the same time, if we were to deny that this "soft core" is authentically  Tantric, we would fly in the face of the emic understandings of householders and  ritual specialists from the modern-day Tantric mainstream, including Hindu Sri vidya practitioners in India and Nepal, Buddhist Gelugpa practitioners in Tibet  and the Tibetan diaspora, and practitioners of pure Buddhist esotericism (mikkyo,  from the Chinese mijiao, "esoteric teaching") in Japan. If these practitioners con sider their daily religious observances as well as their life-cycle rites and post mortem rituals to be Tantric, who are we to say they are wrong?  

A Working Definition  

Tantra has persisted and often thrived throughout Asian history since the middle  of the first millennium of the common era. Its practitioners have lived in India,  China, Japan, Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Korea, and Mongolia, as  well as in the "Greater India" of medieval Southeast Asia: Cambodia, Burma, and  Indonesia. No form of medieval Hinduism, Buddhism, orjainism [Dundas] has  been without a Tantric component; and some South Asian Islamic traditions have,  as well, borne a Tantric stamp [Khan]. In Hindu India, the Paficaratra [Flood],  Gaudlya Vaisnava, Sahajiya, Pasupata, Kapalika, Saiva Siddhanta, Siddha Kaula,  Yogini Kaula, Krama, Trika, Srividya, Pascimamnaya, Nath Siddha, Aghori, Ben gali Sakta-Vaisnava and Baul traditions, and Tamil Nayanar and Alvar traditions  (Hudson], have all been Tantric or heavily colored by Tantra.  

Although Buddhism disappeared from India in the thirteenth century, India  was the source of the Buddhist Mahasiddha tradition [Kapstein] and the cradle  of Buddhist Tantra in its Mahayana, Mantrayana, and Vajrayana (including Ka lacakra [Newman]) forms. In Java, the layout of the massive Borobadur monu ment, begun in the eighth century, is that of a massive cosmogram, perhaps the  dharmadhatu-mandala, a Buddhist Tantric rendering of the enlightened universe.  The late tenth-century author of the Buddhist Kalacakra Tantra, although he may  have been born in Java (Newman 1985: 85), probably composed his work, which  contains a number of references to Islam, in what is now central Pakistan (Orofino  1997). Tibetan Buddhism is by definition a Tantric tradition: this applies to the  four major orders (the Nyingmapas, Kagyupas, Sakyapas, and Gelugpas), as well  as to the Dzogchen [Klein] and other syncretistic traditions. Much of the ritual

of the medieval Chinese state was Tantric, and it was from China that nearly all  of the Buddhist Tantric traditions of Japan were transmitted. In China, Tantra has  survived since the twelfth century C.E. within Daoist ritual practice, and it has  been said that Daoism is the most enduring Chinese monument to Tantric Bud 

dhism (Strickmann 1996: 49). Elsewhere, the Chinese Chan (a Sinicization of  Sanskrit dhydna, "meditation") school lives on in Japan as Zen Buddhism [Bodi ford]. In Burma, the Zawgyis, Theravada monk-alchemists, have for centuries  combined elements of Theravada Buddhism, Daoism, and Tantric alchemy in their  practice. Cambodian inscriptions indicate the presence of Hindu tantrikas (prac titioners of Tantra) there in the medieval period. Present-day Balinese Hinduism  betrays its medieval Indian Tantric origins, and Sri Lankan cults of the "demonic"  beings known as yakkhas (yaksas in Sanskrit) and of Kataragama (the equivalent  of Skanda/Manjusri) contain elements that may be qualified as Tantric. In Japan,  all of the eight schools of Buddhism have a Tantric pedigree, although Shingon  and Tendai have been Japan's most sucessful exponents of "Pure Buddhist  Esotericism."  

Finally, the constitutional monarchies of Nepal and Bhutan are the world's sole  surviving "Tantric kingdoms"; their state ceremonial comprises Hindu Tantric  liturgies and rituals, and nearly all of their deities are Tantric. One of these,  Bhairava, is a Tantric god found in every part of Asia, and worshiped in a Tantric  mode by Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists alike. Similarly, the goddesses and gods  Tara, Ambika, Aksobhya, Mahakala, Ganesa, Avalokitesvara-Lokesvara-Guanyin Kannon, and Skanda-Manjusri, as well as numerous groups of multiple Tantric  deities, are found throughout much of Asia. It is the pan-Asian existence of deities  such as these that supports an argument that medieval and precolonial Asian  religions, rather than having been discrete Tantric Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain  traditions, were, to a great extent, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain varieties of an over arching tradition called "Tantra."  

On what theoretical basis or bases may we term all of these medieval, precolonial,  or modem traditions "Tantric"? I will begin by borrowing a definition proposed by  Madeleine Biardeau and broadened by Andre Padoux. Padoux (1986: 273), citing  Biardeau, begins by saying that the doctrinal aspect of Tantra is "an attempt to place  kama, desire, in every sense of the word, in the service of liberation . . . not to  sacrifice this world for liberation's sake, but to reinstate it, in varying ways, within  the perspective of salvation. This use of kama and of all aspects of this world  to gain both worldly and supernatural enjoyments (bhukri) and powers (siddhis),  and to obtain liberation in this life (jivanmukti), implies a particular attitude on the  part of the Tantric adept toward the cosmos, whereby he feels integrated within  an all-embracing system of micro-macrocosmic correlations."  

This definition concentrates on the goals of Tantric practice (sadhana). Here, I  wish to add a consideration of the nature of Tantric practice itself. Tantric practice  is an effort to gain access to and appropriate the energy or enlightened conscious ness of the absolute godhead that courses through the universe, giving its crea tures life and the potential for salvation. Humans in particular are empowered to 

INTRODUCTION 9  

realize this goal through strategies of embodiment - that is, of causing that divine  energy to become concentrated in one or another sort of template, grid, or me socosm - prior to its internalization in or identification with the individual mi crocosm. With this, I offer the following working definition of Tantra:  

Tantra is that Asian body of beliefs and practices which, working from the principle  that the universe we experience is nothing other than the concrete manifestation of ,  the divine energy of the godhead that creates and maintains that universe, seeks to  ritually appropriate and channel that energy, within the human microcosm, in cre ative and emancipatory ways.  

This definition, however, must be modified according to its contexts, given that  it would probably be rejected out of hand by many Tantric practitioners, who  would find it at variance with their own particular doctrines and perspectives.  Buddhists, for example, would be inclined to replace the term "energy" with  "teaching" or "enlightened consciousness," whereas a village-level practitioner  would, if asked, probably feel more comfortable with the term "beings." However,  when this definition is shown to be applicable to major forms of Tantric practice  across the gamut of its regional and vernacular Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain forms  in Asia, it becomes a valuable organizing principle.  

The Tantric Mandala  

The key to understanding Tantric practice is the mandala, the energy grid that  represents the constant flow of divine and demonic, human and animal impulses  in the universe, as they interact in both constructive and destructive patterns.  Like the Vedic sacrificial altar of which it is a streamlined form, the mandala is a  mesocosm, mediating between the great and small (the universal macrocosm and  the individual microcosm), as well as between the mundane and the sublime (the  protocosm of the visible world of human experience and the transcendent-yet immanent metacosm that is its invisible fount). This grid is three dimensional, in  the sense that it locates the supreme deity (god, goddess, celestial buddha, bo 

dhisattva, or enlightened tirthankara), the source of that energy and ground of  the grid itself, at the center and apex of a hierarchized cosmos. All other beings,  including the practitioner, will be situated at lower levels of energy/consciousness/  being, radiating downward and outward from the mandala's elevated center  point.  

Because the deity is both transcendent and immanent, all of the beings located  at the various energy levels on the grid participate in the outward flow of the  godhead, and are in some way emanations or hypostases of the deity himself (or  herself). For Hindu Tantra, this means that the world is real and not an illusion;  this is an important distinguishing feature of Hindu Tantric doctrine. Rather than  attempting to see through or transcend the world, the practioner comes to rec 

ognize "that" (the world) as "I" (the supreme egoity of the godhead): in other  words, s/he gains a "god's eye view" of the universe, and recognizes it to be 

10 DAVI D GORDO N WHIT E  

nothing other than herself/himself. For East Asian Buddhist Tantra in particular,  this means that the totality of the cosmos is a "realm of Dharma," sharing an  underlying common principle (the teachings of the buddhas), if not a common  material substance [Rambelli]. More generally, this means that buddhahood is  virtual within all creatures. In the words of the Hevajra Tantra (2.4.70, 75), "All  beings are buddhas" and "there is no being that is not enlightened, if it but knows  its own true nature." To render this blissful Buddha nature manifest is the purpose  of Tantric practice - whether externalized in rites or internalized in yoga (Kvaerne  1975: 128) - and the body is "the indispensable organ for contact with the ab solute" (Faure 1998: 61). Rather than being impediments, the world and the  human body become channels to salvation.  

At popular levels of practice throughout Asia, this means that the world of  everyday life can only be negotiated by transacting with myriad beings extending  from the spirit world of the recently deceased to the fierce protector deities that  are the lower emanations or simply the servants of the high gods at the center of  the elite mandalas. Here, embodying the divine is less a goal than a ritual tech 

nique (inducing a state of possession) for combatting demons. We will turn to  the nonelite Tantric practice of the mandala in Part Two of this essay; here, we  concentrate on elite theory and practice.  

The energy levels of the Tantric universe are generally represented as a set of  concentric circles (cakras) of hypostasized forms of the divine energy which, in  addition to appearing as an array of divine, enlightened, perfected, demonic,  human, or animal beings, also manifest themselves on an acoustic level, as gar 

lands or piled-up aggregates of phonemes (mantras); on a graphic level, as the  written characters of the hieratic alphabets; and as the hierarchized cakras of the  yogic body. These same configurations constitute the flow charts of Tantric line ages, with the flow of divine energy (but also the fluid, acoustic, or photic essence  of the godhead; or the teachings of enlightened buddhas) streaming downward  and outward through a succession of male and female deities and demigods - the latter often portrayed in an animal or demonic mode - into "superhuman"  gurus [Padoux] and their human disciples.  

In every case, one detects "fractal" patterns, in which the original bipolar dyad  of the godhead in essence and manifestation (usually male and female) proliferates  into increasing orders of multiplicity. Unity in multiplicity is a hallmark of Tantra,  and in this respect, it is an extension of earlier, less complex, Asian metaphysical  systems. There is, in Tantra, an exponential explosion of all preexisting pantheons  of deities, and together with these, an expansion of every sort of category - family,  number, color, direction, aspect, and so on - into an intricate cosmic calculus.  With its perfect geometric forms and elaborately interwoven lines, the mandala  is the ideal conceptual tool for plotting the multi-leveled and polyvalent interre lationships between these categories. As such it can, and often does, become self 

referential, a transcendent and ideal "utopia," entirely abstracted from the "real  world" of which it is the invisible, theoretical ground. Perhaps the best-known  mandala-cum-plotting device in the Tantric universe is the Sri Cakra or Sri Yantra  of Hindu Tantric practice, a perfectly balanced three-dimensional geometric di-

INTRODUCTIO N 1 1  

agram comprising of a series of eleven interlocking and embedded triangles (also  called cakras) radiating downward and outward from a center point, and enclosed  by a circle and a square. The mandalas of Buddhist and Jain Tantric practice  follow similar structural and dynamic principles.  

Even at this level of abstraction, the Tantric mandala remains a template  through which humans may interact with the divine, and thereby come to ex perience reality from a superhuman perspective. The practice of the mandala  generally involves a meditative or performative projection of both the metacosmic  godhead and the protocosmic self into its vortex, followed by an implosion of the  entire grid into its center point. Here, the underlying assumption is that this  implosion is a reversal of the original cosmogony - that is, of a primal impulse  or flow (samsara) into manifest existence - back into the source of energies  mapped on the grid. One's self-projection into the mandala and gradual return  to the center is therefore a return to the source of one's being; at each level, one  is gnoseologically transformed into a higher, more divine, more enlightened being,  until one becomes the god or buddha at the center (except in some dualist forms  of Tantra). As we will show, there is an implicit notion of biological succession  here, from the supreme godhead down through a guru-disciple lineage, which  makes initiation and consecration central features of Tantric theory and practice.  

Although the name, attributes, and entourage of the deity located at the center  of the mandala vary from one tradition to another, nearly all Tantric practice of  the mandala has this same goal, of transacting with and eventually identifying  with that deity. In this practice, movement toward the center, effected through a  combination of external ritual and internal meditative practices, entails harmo 

nizing one's own energy or consciousness level with that of the (deities of the)  circle in which one finds oneself. First encountered as obstacles, these divine,  demonic, or animal impulses are eventually overcome, that is, transformed into  positive sources of energy that carry one closer and closer to the deity at the  center. Alternatively, one may, having overcome them, also coerce those same  potentially destructive lower-level beings to do one's bidding through various  ritual technologies, about which more below. Here, the true sense of the term  yantra (as in the Sri Yantra) is brought to the fore: a yantra is a mesocosmic device  or machine for controlling (from the Sanskrit root yam) one's conceptual reality  [Rabe].  

It is the nature of this grid or template, together with the chosen medium - that is, the mediating substance - of this process of divine embodiment that, more  than anything else, differentiates one form of Tantra from another. When the  template is the body of a naked maiden and the medium her sexual or menstrual  discharge, we are in the presence of the Tantra of the old Hindu "clans" (the Kula  or Kaula) and their inner and East Asian Buddhist Tantric homologues. Once we  leave these traditions behind, however, the template will more often be a body  of sound, of organized space, or of a deity - either in the form of a concrete or  abstract worship support, a buddha's "pleasure body" (sambhogakaya), one's own  subtle body, the person of the Tantric guru or lama, or the empty sky.  

Often, templates and media will be combined. By far the most prevalent and 

12 DAVI D GORDO N WHIT E  

most important example of this is the practice of identifying the deity with his or  her "seed mantra" (bija-mantra): this notion, that the sound shape of a mantra  exactly renders a given deity's energy level, is the basis for mantric practice across  all Tantric traditions. Elsewhere, mandalas will have mantras inscribed on them;  mantras infused into water will transform it into nectar and other fluids worthy  of the gods; configurations or positions of the practitioner's hands or body (mu 

dras) will represent a deity's energies; mandalas will be projected onto the subtle  body, while the practitioner identifies with the deity at the center (as in Buddhist  "deity yoga" [Lopez]); using mantras, deities will be transferred from the subtle  body into a concrete image for worship; or mandalas with their arrays of deities  will be reproduced by human participants in ritual choreographies (Brooks 1992:  418-28; Samuel 1993: 266). Much of Tantric yogic practice combines nearly all  of these elements, embodying the energy of the godhead on the grid of the subtle  body through solid, fluid, acoustic, and photic media.  

Generally speaking, the more subtle the medium (sound and light), the more  internal, meditative, and sublimated the practice; conversely, concrete (fluid and  solid) media imply external and more body-related practice, including sexual  ritual, alchemy, and hatha yoga. Internal practice, although it may incorporate  the lower demonic and animal forms of divine energy, will tend to focus on the  deity in sublime, even abstract, ways; external practice, which often implies sac 

rificial offerings, possessed states, and ritual technologies, will more often focus  on fierce forms or hypostases of the deity, which it seeks to coerce and control.  Much of the "soft core" of mainstream Tantric practice combines external ritual  manipulations with internal meditiative practice, through the templates of man 

date, mantra, and mudra, and often in a devotional mode [Gupta].  One might characterize the range of Tantric uses of these templates and media  as a continuum extending from "doing" to "knowing." At one extreme, we find  the concrete external utilization of blood offerings, human bones, bodily fluids,  sexual intercourse, and so on, that characterize the mortuary practices - or at  least the imagery thereof - of the early Hindu Kaula, early Jain Tantra, and the  Buddhist Tantras of Supreme Yoga. At the other, we find a meditative ritual  construction and mental enactment of generally less horrific or erotic practices,  which Douglas Brooks has referred to as the "prescriptive imagination," and Glen  Hayes the "imaginative structuring of experience." We also find a correlation  between these bodies of practice, with their variable media and templates, and  their goals. Practitioners who "do" their Tantra will emphasize the somatic goals  of bodily immortality (jivanmukti), pleasure (bhukti), and power (or "powers,"  siddhis) in the world. Those who "know" their practice will tend to focus on self deification at a more cognitive or psychological level: the transformation of human  consciousness into divine consciousness [Muller-Ortega] or the perfection of wis dom and realization of one's own inherent Buddha nature. Here, ritual practice  mainly serves as a catalyst for a spiritual breakthrough, a transformation of con sciousness; the Zen koan is a well-known case in point. In Buddhist Tantra - and  in this it differs from Hinduism or Jainism - the ultimate goal of both those who 

INTRODUCTIO N 13  

"do" and who "know" their practice will be to enlighten and thereby liberate all  other creatures from suffering existence. This ethical parameter is by and large  absent from Hindu Tantra (Samuel 1993: 243). Finally, the goals of "soft-core"  Tantric householders will differ little from those of their "non-Tantric" counter 

parts: liberation into the godhead, the extinction of suffering, purification, health,  wealth, long life, and a strong family unit.  

What is important to remember here is that the basic structure and dynamics  of the mandala itself remain constant, regardless of variations in the media that  flow through it or the names and iconographies of the deities found within its  boundaries. Although it is mainly on the basis of these important details that  various Tantric lineages, sects, and traditions distinguish themselves from one  another, it is their common use of the mandala, more than any other feature of  their practice, that makes them Tantric. Viewed in this way, the varieties of Tantric  practice exhibit a certain uniformity. Practitioners located outside or at the mar gins of the mesocosmic energy grid project themselves into the mandala and work  their way back to the deity at the center, with whom they identify (in nondualist  Tantric systems) or with whom they enter into immediate proximity or contact  (in such dualist systems as Saiva Siddhanta, which maintained that one could  never become Siva; at best, one could become a "second Siva," and experience  the world in the same way as god). Now, it is true that all of these media (with  the possible exception of sexual fluids) may also be found in non-Tantric forms  of practice throughout Asia, ranging from mainstream devotional traditions to the  "ritual technologies" of shamans and other nonelite religious specialists. The ritual  use of these media, however, in combination with the mandala as matrix for the  energy flow between the protocosmic and metacosmic levels of cosmic reality is,  I would argue, specific to Tantra.  

Tantric Initiation  

The theory and practice of the Tantric mandala operates on a mesocosmic level,  that is, on the level of a mediating template between protocosm and metacosm  as well as between macrocosm and microcosm. Quite often, Tantric practitioners  will project the mandala upon the internal grid of the "heart," the subtle or yogic  body, or a body that has been modified to embody enlightenment. This process  of internalization generally begins with initiation, which plays two complementary  roles. On the one hand, it transforms a biologically given individual into a vessel  capable of receiving, channeling, or actualizing the divine energy of the godhead;  on the other, it initiates her or him into a particular Tantric lineage and body of  teachings that extend back, through the guru or lama and his predecessors, to  the godhead itself. Initiation is effected by the teacher, who has been previously  transformed and empowered through his own initiation (diksa) and consecration  (abhiseka), who plants in the initiate's body a "seed" or "seme" of the essence of  the godhead. This seed takes a number of forms, ranging from a drop of bodily  or sexual fluid to a mantra, a photic image, or a drop or seed of consciousness 

14 DAVI D GORDO N WHIT E  

or the bodhisattva's "thought of enlightenment" (bodhicitta). Vital breath (prana)  is generally the dynamic element in this transfer, just as it is in the animation of  external images for worship and the internal practices of yoga. Through this "in semination" process, the guru or lama makes the initiate a part of the flow chart  of the Tantric lineage, which radiates outward in mandala fashion from the god head or buddhahood that is its center and source. In many Tantric traditions,  this process involves a transfer of the guru or lama's feminine energy (sakti) or  wisdom (prajna) into his disciple. The form that that transfer takes, ranging from  the actual participation of a female consort in ritual sex to more sublimated trans fers effected through food (yogurt, for example), mantras, or other media, varies  according to tradition. The pivotal and transformative role of the guru in initiation  has led to an equation in most Tantric traditions between guru and godhead, and  meditation will often involve visualizing the guru as god at the center of the  mandala.  

This very concrete notion of lineage is so fundamental to Tantra in the Tibetan  tradition that two similar terms (both pronounced gyr) are used for "teaching  linege," "genealogical lineage," and "Tantra" in the Tibetan language. Similarly, in  Indian Hindu and Buddhist Tantra, the term kula ("family," "clan") is applied to  the entire mandala [Brooks]: initiation into the mandala is initiation into the divine  family of Siva, Vajradhara, and so on, and the mandala of the monastery consti 

tutes a sort of microcosmic household (Samuel 1993: 150-51). This intimate  relationship between spiritual lineage and biological lineage is based in no small  part in socioreligious reality; very often, one is initiated into a Tantric tradition  by one's biological father. The same rule often applies at the state level; lineages  of princes and kings are initiated by parallel lineages of royal Tantric gurus, with  the lineage god or goddess of both king and priest - that is, the deity at the heart  of the mandala - being the same for both. In cases of theocratic government, as  in Tibet, the interpenetration of biological, spiritual, and royal lines become more  pronounced.  

Yoga and Tantra  

Crucial to the initiation process is the notion that within the gross body of the  human microcosm or protocosm there is a subtle, yogic body that is the meso cosmic replica of the divine, universal macrocosm or metacosm. As such, yoga  constitutes a vital component of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain [Qvarnstrom] Tantric  theory and practice. This body, which comprises energy channels (nadis) and  centers (cakras), drops, and winds, is itself a mandala. If it were to be viewed  from above, the vertical central channel of the subtle body, which mediates the  bipolar (and sexually gendered) internal dynamic of the godhead, would appear  as the center point of the mandala, with the various cakras aligned along that  channel appearing as so many concentric circles, wheels, or lotuses radiating  outward from that center. Often, each of the spokes or petals of these cakras will  have male and female deities, as well as Sanskrit phonemes and graphemes, as-INTRODUCTION 15  

signed to it. As such, initiation and all forms of yogic practice involve, once again,  an effort on the part of the practitioner to return to the elevated center point of  the emanated mandala. Once the practitioner has succeeded in centering all of  the energies coursing through his subtle body - energies that flow through the  myriad subtle channels in the form of fluids, phonemes, and graphemes - the  final phase of his practice will effect the reimplosion of feminine energy into (a  usually) masculine essence or pure consciousness. This final phase is often por trayed as the merging of the inner female energy - called Kundalini (the coiled  serpent energy, in Hinduism) or Avadhuti or Candali (in Buddhism) - situated  in the lower half of the body, with a masculine principle (Siva in Hinduism, Upaya  in Buddhism) located in the cranial vault. This union is represented in terms not  only of energies but of sexual fluids, as well. In Hindu practice, the sanguinary  Kundalini rises to join the seminal Siva in the cranial vault, with the "nectar"  produced from their union optimally being held there by the practitioner, as a  means to becoming a Siddha, a "self-made god" (White 1996: 320)  

Buddhist yogic imagery is similar to that of the Hindus. A number of early  Vajrayana works speak of red and white sexual fluids being united into the  thought of enlightenment in the central channel; one of these texts, the Hevajra  Tantra (1.32), portrays the internal feminine energy as the Candali ("Outcaste  Woman") who blazes upward into the cranial vault. The male "moon" residing  there is made to melt by her heat, and their conjoined fluid - now the bodhi 

citta - flows down through the cakras, suffusing the practitioner as it does with  the bliss of their union. Later Buddhist traditions more closely follow the dynamic  of Hindu hatha yogic practice, with feminine energy being made to rise through  the cakras to the "Lotus of Great Bliss" in the head (Kvaerne 1975: 120-21). The  Completion Phase of Supreme Yoga visualization [Bentor] - in which the mandala  is incorporated into the subtle body - is rife with the imagery of both sexuality  and death; however, as in all of Buddhist practice, these transformative experi ences are but means to the higher end of enlightenment and buddhahood.  

"Tantric Sex"  

Both historically and conceptually, yoga is in many ways an internalization of  sexual intecourse between a man and a woman [Hayes], which brings us back to  the vexed matter of Tantric sex. Tantric art abounds in representations of couples  (and sometimes larger groups) engaged in all manner of sexual intercourse (mai 

thuna, yab-yum, and so on), and most Tantric scriptures include extended dis cussions of sexual practice. Siva and Vajrasattva, the high gods of Saiva Hindu  Tantra and Buddhist Vajrayana, are themselves depicted as engaging in endless  sexual marathons with their consorts, when they (and a number of other super natural beings) are not portrayed as actually dwelling inside the female organ  itself. If the Tantric practitioner's goal is to replace mundane human thought with  enlightened god-consciousness, and if sexuality is the divine path to enlighten ment, then the practitioner's imitatio dei should, quite reasonably, be enacted in 

16 DAVI D GORDO N WHIT E  

a sexual mode. Yet, over the centuries, the debate has raged as to whether Tantric  sexual imagery is to be taken literally or simply as so much figurative symboli zation of exalted, dispassionate, even disembodied, states of consciousness.  

This debate, both pro and con, may be somewhat misplaced, when one con siders the possible origins of "Tantric sex." In early Hindu Tantra, sexual inter course was often simply the practical means for generating the sexual fluids that  constituted the preferred offering of the Tantric deities. Elsewhere, there can be  no doubt that an early and persistent form of Tantric initiation and practice in volved transactions in sexual fluids between a male initiate and a female consort - termed yogini, duti (the female "messenger"), or Sakti ("energy") for Hindus; and  dakini, prajna ("wisdom"), or mudra (the "seal") for their Buddhist counterparts.  Here, the male initiate was physically inseminated or insanguinated with the sex ual emissions of the female consort (sometimes together with the semen of the  male guru or lama), as a means of transforming him, reproductively as it were,  into a son of the clan (kula-putra, in Hindu Tantra). Here, the role of the female  consort is vital, because the clan fluid (kula-dravya) or clan nectar (kulamrta),  vulval essence (yoni-tattva), or thought of enlightenment (bodhicitta) is understood  to flow naturally through her womb. Because she is herself the embodiment of  the energy of the godhead (or Wisdom, the complement to male Skill in Means),  her sexual or menstrual discharge is considered to be the germ plasm of the  godhead or enlightened consciousness itself. Human males, through whom this  divine fluid does not naturally flow, can only gain access to it through the conduit  of the female sexual organ (White 1998). As such, "Tantric sex" would originally  have been a matter of generating, offering, and ingesting transformative sexual  fluids. It was only later that bliss itself would come to take center stage, replacing  the notion of sexual orgasm as a means to an end with a more psychologized  understanding of the same as an end in itself - a blissful expansion of conscious ness (Sanderson 1988: 679-80).  

Transactions in and the consumption of sexual fluids also served as means for  affirming the doctrine of identity in difference, or the identity of samsara and  nirvana, in Hindu and Buddhist Tantra. In tenth- to eleventh-century Hindu  Tantra in Kashmir, for example, a recognition of the consciousness-expanding  effects of orgasm was accompanied by an understanding of the psychological  effects of the oral consumption of such an impure - and thereby powerful and  dangerous - substance as female discharge (sexual emissions and menstrual  blood), as well as the other prohibited substances: the five makaras, the five  nectars, and so on. Here, in a socioreligious system in which "you are what you  eat," the potentially self-destructive act of ingesting such substances was deemed  sufficient to effect a breakthrough from limited conventional thought to ex panded, enlightened god-consciousness (Sanderson 1995: 85-87). The Siddhas  and "crazy yogis" of Vajrayana tradition are legendary for having resorted to ali 

mentary and sexual transgression as means of teaching the identity of samsara and  nirvana. One of these, the Bhutanese Drukpa Kunley, made a career of converting  demonesses to Buddhism with his "flaming thunderbolt of wisdom," that is, his 

INTRODUCTIO N 17  

penis, about which he then sang songs in public meetings. For those who had  eyes to see and ears to hear, this would no doubt have been a consciousness raising experience (Dowman 1980).  

Erotico-mystical practices such as these were not present in every form of early  Tantra, and most Tantric traditions have, over time, refined them into more sub limated forms of practice, on a mantric, mandalic, ritual, or yogic level; some  traditions have played down their importance or eschewed them as too dangerous  for all but the supremely qualified. Many later Hindu and Buddhist Tantric  schools have valued visualization of the Tantric consort over actual intercourse  with her; and in spite of explicit references to emission of the bodhicitta in most  Supreme Yoga Tantra consecrations, Buddhist Tantra has generally emphasized  seminal retention and the reversal of sexual energy within the body of the male  practitioner (Kvaerne 1975: 108). In fact, the great bulk of Buddhist Tantric dis 

course on sexuality - as well as on alchemy, which is the union of male and  female reagents - has long since been internalized into descriptions of the yogic  union of female Wisdom with male Skill in Means, within the subtle body.  

Yet the sexual referent has nearly always remained present in even the most  "cosmeticized" or "semanticized" forms of Tantric discourse (Sanderson 1995:  79). If Michel Strickmann (1996: 203) is correct when he asserts that Tantric art  is Tantric ritual, and that Buddhist Tantric ritual is [sexual] union with an icon,  then there is little to Tantric practice that has not borne some occult or explicit  sexual valence. This is as it should be. The soteriological value of passion or desire  itself has always been a watchword of Tantra: on this basis alone, "salvific sexu ality" ought to lie at the heart of Tantric practice. However, the extent to which  precept has been reproduced in practice varies from one Tantric tradition to  another, and has changed over time within every one of those traditions.  

Here, a general statement on the place of the feminine in Tantra is in order.  Many if not most Tantric traditions emphasize the role of women and (or as)  goddesses on a number of levels. One of the distinguishing features of Tantra is,  in fact, its proliferation of goddesses - sometimes benign like the compassionate  Guanyin, or ambiguous like the hunchbacked Kubjika [Goudriaan], but most  often fierce, like the terrible black Kali [McDermott]. In such traditions, the hy 

postases or energies of the male (or sometimes female, in "pure Sakta" forms of  Hindu Tantra) godhead are generally female, as are the inner energies of the subtle  body, the body of the Tantric consort, Buddhist Wisdom (prajna), and the sacred  geography of the world itself. In the Hindu Tantric worldview, the world is the  body of the goddess, and its myriad religious landscapes her many physical fea 

tures. This understanding lies at the heart of the networks of the goddess's pithas  ("benches") in South Asia (Sircar 1973; Dyczkowski 1999), as well as of the many  "womb-caves" of the Tantric goddesses that dot the Tibetan and inner Asian  Buddhist landscape (Stein 1988). Elsewhere, exceptional women have risen to  prominence in certain Tantric traditions - the Tibetan Yogini Ma gcig Lab sgron  being a case in point [Orofino] - and women have been praised and often wor 

shiped as goddesses in many Tantric scriptures. 

18 DAVID GORDON WHITE  

It would, however, be incorrect to say that all Tantric traditions have placed  this stress on the power of the feminine. Japanese Tantra generally identifies the  "six elements" of our world as the body of the male buddha Vairocana, and  Japanese sacred mountains are generally male. Elsewhere, a number of early "cler 

ical" Tantric traditions, discussed below (especially Hindu Saiva Siddhanta and  the Buddhist Tantras of Action and Observance), portray the expansion of the  godhead into the world as a predominantly masculine affair. Furthermore, it  would be hasty to conclude, on the basis of the general Tantric exaltation of  feminine energy, that female practitioners have ever dominated the religious or  political Tantric sphere. Even in her transformative initiatory role, the Tantric  consort has remained instrumental to the requirements of the male practitioners  she transforms.  

Historical Parameters  

As Geoffrey Samuel (1993: 7-10) has argued for Tibetan Buddhist society, the  body of doctrines and practices that are grouped under the heading of Tantra all  draw, to varying degrees, upon two types of sources. These are the "shamanic"  magical practices or ritual technologies of nonelite religious specialists and their  clienteles; and the speculative and scholasticist productions of often state-spon 

sored religious elites (which Samuel terms "clerical"). The history of Tantra is the  history of the interaction between these two strands of practice and practitioners,  whose clienteles, comprising commoners and political elites, have nearly always  overlapped. There can be no doubt that the relationships among Indian kings and  the Tantric specialists they chose over other alternatives (generally Vedic) are key  to understanding the origins and history of this interaction. These specialists  would probably have included professional priests of emerging temples of Tantric  deities; royal chaplains seeking enhanced religious protection for their royal cli ents; court astrologers, physicians, and magicians; "shamanic" itinerant Siddhas  and their female consorts or saktis (Gupta-Hoens-Goudriaan 1979: 29-35); and  the leaders of important monastic orders.  

Apart from the fact of its Indian provenance, the "origin" of Tantra will not be  treated here. Depending on whether one's criteria are text- or iconography-based  or grounded in practice, deities, lineages, or sociopolitical contexts, one's dating  and account of Tantra's origins will vary significantly. Here, we limit ourselves to  stating that Tantra was an orthogenic development out of prior mainstream (but  not necessarily elite) traditions, that nonetheless also drew on both foreign (ad 

stratal) and popular (substratal) sources. So, for example, the homa (fire) rites  common to most Tantric traditions are direct heirs of the Vedic homa sacrifices  (an orthogenic development), whereas certain elements of Tibetan Buddhist Tan tra clearly draw on both Iranian (adstratal) and indigenous (substratal) traditions.  In Japan, the sanrinjin (literally, "three bodies with discs") theory, which divided  the Buddha's appearances in the phenomenal world into three types, was an 

INTRODUCTIO N 19  

explicit means for incorporating the (adstratal) Indian deities of Hinduism into  the Buddhist fold as "propagators of Buddhism" (a strategy introduced in India),  as well as for Buddhicizing (substratal) indigenous Japanese kami deities (Mat sunaga 1987: 52). The question nonetheless remains as to when and by what  means these deities and the rituals and beliefs associated with them became "Tan tric," as opposed to "Vedic," "non-Tantric Buddhist," "non-Tantric Jain," "popular  Indian," "popular Chinese," "popular Japanese," and so on.  

When subjected to close scrutiny, these sorts of distinctions nearly always break  down. We may take as an example the multiple goddesses - called yoginis, dak inis, "vixen" spirits, and so on - that are found in nearly every Tantric tradition.  In the Indian context out of which so much of Tantra arose, cults of multiple  goddesses were already present, prior to the common era, in the apsarasas  (nymphs), yaksinis (female dryads), matrs (Mothers), and grahanis (female seiz ers), who were generally propitiated with animal sacrifices and early forms of  devotional worship. Although it is true that such powerful and petulant beings  (devouring when ignored, but nurturing when honored) were rarely if ever qual ified as high gods by the Hindu, Buddhist, or Jain elites, nevertheless, whenever  any woman - whether the wife of a brahman, king, or commoner - was about  to give birth, an image of one or more of these female deities would have been  painted on the walls of the birthing chamber. That these goddesses were main stream is further attested by the fact that such Mothers or female seizers as Sasthi  and Hariti were depicted on Kushan and Gupta-age coinage and sculpture  throughout greater India. Moreover, groups of goddesses of this type figure  prominently among the "export deities" that took root and flourished in foreign  soil, in Inner and East Asia - making theirs a truly cosmopolitan cult.  

When persons from every level of Asian society were worshiping these multiple  female deities, is it proper to call this a "folk" or "popular" cult? And where does  one draw the line between "indigenous" and "foreign"? Often the sole changes  that have historically occurred in the cults of these groups have been their group  name and the use to which they have been put in religious practice. Thus Putana,  one of the multiple Mothers or female seizers of Hindu epic tradition, is later  listed as a yogini in the Hindu Puranas and Tantras. The name Putana also appears  as the name of a class of disease demonesses in such Buddhist sources as the early  Mahayana Lotus of the True Law (Filliozat 1937: 160) and the early seventh-cen tury Chinese version of Collection of the Dharani Teachings (Strickmann 1996:  156). In these later developments, Putana the Hindu yogini or Putana the Bud 

dhist dakini is no longer merely propitiated as a means of preventing miscarriage  or childhood diseases; she has now become a part of the "enshrinement and  employment of demigods as instruments of power" (Sutherland 1991: 146) that  was and remains one of the hallmarks of Tantric practice. One calls her and her  dangerous host down upon oneself, and through ritual manipulation, compels  them to do one's bidding.  

This ritual strategy forms the core of the so-called Buddhist dharani texts (Mat sunaga 1987: 47-48), collections of spells and ritual techniques that, composed 

20 DAVID GORDON WHITE  

in India in the second to sixth centuries C.E,, were in the centuries that followed  the calling cards of the Tantric masters who became the most powerful and pres tigious ritualists of the Chinese imperial court (Strickmann 1996: 30). In Japan,  a Shingon legend concerning Kamatari, the seventh-century founder of the Fu jiwara lineage, relates that he was, in his youth, abducted by a vixen that was a  manifestation of a deity named Dakini. After having had sexual relations with the  vixen, he received from her the magic formula and the insignia of power (kama)  that became part of his name (Faure 1998: 262). In modern-day rural Japan,  certain types of vixens, termed "witch animals," are brought under the control of  solitary male ascetics through a rite formerly known as the Daten or Dagini rite  (Blacker 1975: 51-55) - this latter term clearly being a Japanese rendering of the  Sanskrit dakini. If it were possible to determine the precise dates of appropriations  such as this into an explicitly Tantric classification schema and body of practice,  one could, perhaps, pinpoint the century of the "origins" of this element of Tantra.  As this is impossible, however, I will close this digression by simply stating that  Tantra emerged out of the South Asian elite and popular mainstream some time  in the middle of the first millennium C.E.  

The origins of Tantra are, from both emic and etic perspectives, Indian. All  authentic Tantric lineages - of deities, scriptures, oral teachings, and teachers - claim to extend back to Indian sources. Perhaps the earliest reference to sects that  have subsequently come to be classified as Tantric is a passage from a fourth 

century C.E. portion of the great Hindu epic, the Mahabhdrata (12.335.40), which  names the (Saiva) Pasupatas and the (Vaisnava) Pancaratras as "non-Vedic." The  founders of every major Tantric tradition, school, or sect either trace their guru disciple lineages back to an Indian source or are considered to be incarnations of  bodhisattvas of Indian "origin." The exploded pantheon of Tantra - its principal  multiheaded and multiarmed deities and their burgeoning families or clans - are  generally Indian, or at least traceable to Indian prototypes. The same holds for  scriptural traditions: all Asian Tantric traditions are explicit concerning the Indian  origins of their teachings, and the transmission of their teachings from India; this  includes the Tibetan Treasure - gter ma, pronounced "terma" - traditions which,  while "discovered" in Tibet, were nonetheless "hidden" there by the Indian teach 

ers Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava [Germano-Gyatso]. Much of Tantric legend  concerns the Indian "shamanic culture heroes" (Samuel 1993: 19) known as Sid dhas or Mahasiddhas. The hieratic language of Tantra generally remains the San skrit of medieval Indian Hinduism and Buddhism. That is, for any lineage-based  Tantric body of practice (sddhana) to be legitimate in Chinese, Japanese, or Tibetan  Tantric traditions, its translated root text must be traceable back to a Sanskrit  original. In these translated sources, mantras - whose efficacy resides in their  sound shape - will not be translated but rather frozen (at least in theory) in the  original Sanskrit. Furthermore, Indic characters form the basis of the hieratic  Siddham script employed in Chinese and Japanese Tantric mandalas and texts.  The yogic practice that is so central to Tantra is also of Indian origin (albeit  influenced by Daoist techniques) - and the list goes on.  

As for the history of Tantra, it may be approached from both emic and etic 

INTRODUCTIO N 21  

perspectives. By way of presenting the problems of Tantric historiography, I begin  by presenting an emic dilemma in Japan. Here, of course, we are in the presence  of "export" Tantra, in this case Mahayana traditions brought to greater Asia from  India by monks and other religious specialists from the fifth century C.E. onward.  What we find, in fact, is that the historical time frame in which the transmission  (to China, Tibet, Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia) of various Indian Tantric para 

digms occurred has invariably proven definitive for the structure and content of  the "export" Tantric tradition in question. It is as if the original revelation re mained fossilized, like an insect in a block of amber, in the export tradition. This  is manifestly the case, for example, with Japanese Shingon - founded by Kukai  (774-835 C.E.) - whose core revelations are the seventh-century C.E. Mahavai 

rocana-sutra and the Tattvasamgraha-sutra. It was precisely these two south Indian  Mahayana texts - brought to China by Subhakarasiriha (637-735 C.E.) for the  Mahavairocana, and Vajrabodhi (671-741 C.E.) and Amoghavajra (eighth cen tury C.E.), for the Tattvasamgraha, and taught to him in China by Amoghavajra's  disciple Huiguo - that formed the core of Kukai's Shingon teachings. Shingon  practice remains, in many respects, a preserved specimen of those enshrined in  seventh-century Indian paradigms, but with a Japanese overlay. Following this  eighth-century watershed, subsequent Indian developments in Tantra had limited  or no impact on Shingon for four centuries (Matsunaga 1987: 50-52; Yamasaki  1988: 3-12, 19-20). Similarly, Tibetan Buddhism, with its preponderance of  Vajrayana practice based on revelations found in what would later be classified  as the Tantras of Yoga and Supreme Yoga, preserves the Tantric status quo of  eighth-century India, from which it was introduced into Tibet by the legendary  Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava.  

Shingon is one of the two most important mainstream forms of Japanese Tantra,  the other being Tendai, founded by Saicho (767-822 C.E.). Together, Shingon  and Tendai are widely considered to constitute mikkyo, the "esoteric Buddhism"  or "pure esotericism" of Japan. Here, mikkyo is held to be "pure" in contradis 

tinction to the "mixed esotericism" of Tantra, of which two medieval movements  were termed jakyo (heresies) (Faure 1998: 126). One of these, injected into Shin gon from Tibet via Chinese Daoism, was the Tachikawa-ryu [Faure]. In Tachi kawa - which equated sexual bliss with Kukai's doctrine of "bodily buddha hood" - Tantric practice took a new (for Shingon) highly sexualized coloring,  typical of Supreme Yoga Tantra consecrations (described in Snellgrove 1987:  257-61). Here, "Skull Ritual" initiations - real or imagined - that involved the  union of (male) Skill in Means and (female) Wisdom, enacted through sexual  intercourse and the subsequent collection of sexual fluids, were very close in style  to Hevajra and Candamaharosana Tantra-based consecrations that had, in the  tenth and eleventh centuries, been incorporated into the Tibetan Tantric "clerical"  mainstream. By the mid-thirteenth century, the doctrines of this school had be come so popular as to necessitate an orthodox Shingon backlash against the "Ta chikawa heresy," which culminated in its effective suppression by the late fifteenth  century (Sanford 1991: 1-4, 9-18; Strickmann 1996: 245).  

Yet, as Bernard Faure has indicated, Japanese mikkyo, like Indo-Tibetan Vaj-

22 DAVI D GORDO N WHIT E  

rayana, feminized a number of Buddhist deities; and ritual sex with them (or their  human substitutes) was part of the ritual. In the same vein, the Bizei betsu (Par ticular Notes on the Abhiseka) of Jien, an "orthodox" twelfth- to thirteenth-cen tury Tendai text, describes a cognate rite of sexual union between the emperor  and his consort, in the role of Tantric adepts (Faure 1998: 126). In spite of the  historical presence, within their own traditions, of these elements of Indo-Tibetan  Tantric practice, Shingon and Tendai apologists have for centuries tried to dis tance themselves from - if not deny the existence of - the darker magical (and  in particular sexual) components of Tachikawa-ryu and other Tantric "heresies."  How can their emic claims to purity prevail against the etic historical data pre sented here?  

Here, let us turn to a set of emic categories that, although they originated in  India, have been used widely to classify all the Buddhist Tantric sects and schools.  These are the categories of the Tantras of Action (Kriya Tantras), Tantras of Ob servance (Carya Tantras), Tantras of Yoga (Yoga Tantras), and Tantras of Supreme  Yoga (Anuttarayoga Tantras). These categories are used in reference to bodies of  revealed texts, ritual practice, and especially to types of consecration, with the  latter two being far more esoteric than the former two forms of Buddhist Tantric  practice. Within more esoteric Buddhist traditions, this means that Yoga and  Supreme Yoga consecrations follow or are "higher" than those of Action and  Observance. In the more conventional or exoteric Buddhist Tantric schools, these  Yoga and Supreme Yoga texts, rituals, and consecrations are simply omitted.  

This emic hierarchy or ordering does not, however, necessarily imply a his torical evolution. As Geoffrey Samuel (1993: 411-12) has argued, the Tantras of  Action and Observance, which grew up as extensions of ritual, yogic, and devo tional tendencies already present within earlier Mahayana traditions, were prob ably well ensconced within Indian Buddhist monastic communities by the eighth  and ninth centuries. As for the more esoteric and antinomian Tantras of Yoga and  Supreme Yoga - the core of Vajrayana Buddhism (so-called for its "diamond,"  that is, vajra, families of deities) - their origins were probably coeval with if not  prior to those of the Tantras of Action and Observance. However, these remained  the preserve of the more independent and solitary "shamanic" Siddha-type prac titioners until the tenth and eleventh centuries. For this reason, there are relatively  few texts of the Yoga and Supreme Yoga variety prior to their insertion, as "higher"  or more esoteric initiations, into "clerical" Tantric traditions. Whatever the case,  the patterns of development of these hierarchized revelations appear to fall into  lockstep with similar evolutions taking place within the Hindu Tantric schools in  India; this parallel evolution has been clearly delineated by Alexis Sanderson  (1988: 678-79) as follows:  

By the eighth century C.E. the Buddhists had accumulated a hierarchy of Tantric  revelations roughly parallel in its organisation and character to that of the [Hindu]  Mantramarga [whose textual canon comprises the Siva-Agamas and Rudra-Agamas of  the Saiva Siddhanta and the Bhairava-Agamas of Kapalika Saivism]. Their literature 

INTRODUCTIO N 23  

was divided in order of ascending esotericism into the Tantras of Action (kriya tantras), of Observance (carya-tantras), of Yoga (yoga-tantras), and Supreme Yoga  (yoganuttara-tantras). . . .  

[W]e can compare the relatively orthodox cult of the mild Vairocana Buddha in  the Tantras of Observance (Mahavairocanasutra, etc.) and Yoga (Jattvasamgraha, Par amadya, etc.) with the Saiva Siddhanta cult of Sadasiva, and the more esoteric and  heteropractic traditions of the Higher Yoga (Guhyasamaja, etc.), and Supreme Yoga  (Abhidhanottara, Hevajra, Dakinlvajrapanjara, etc.) with the [more orthoprax male 

deity-oriented] Mantrapitha and [the heteroprax female-deity-oriented] Vidyapitha of  the Tantras of Bhairava. Just as the Svacchandabhairava cult of the Mantrapitha is  transitional between the more exoteric Saiva Siddhanta and the Kapalika Vidyapitha,  so that of Aksobhya in the Higher Yoga stands bridging the gap between the Vairocana  cult and the feminised and Kapalika-like cults of Heruka, Vajravarahi and the other  khatvanga (skull-rattle)-bearing deities of the Supreme Yoga.  

At the lower levels of the Buddhist Tantric canon, there is certainly the influence  of the general character and liturgical methods of the Saiva and Pancaratra-Vaisnava  Tantric traditions. But at the final (and latest) level the dependence is much more  profound and detailed. As in the Vidyapitha cults these Buddhist deities are Kapalika  in an iconic form. They wear the five bone-ornaments and are smeared with ashes  (the six seals [mudras] of the Kapalikas). They drink blood from skull-bowls (kapala),  have the Saiva third eye, stand on the prostrate bodies of lesser deities, wear Siva's  sickle moon in their massed and matted hair (jata). And, just as in the Vidyapitha,  their cults are set in that of the Yoginis. Those who are initiated by introduction into  the mandalas of these Yogini-encircled Buddhist deities are adorned with bone-or naments and given the Kapalika's khatvanga and skull-bowl to hold.  

Sanderson goes on to argue that it was the Buddhists who borrowed from the  Hindus in these forms of Tantric practice, an argument that has been expanded  by Robert Mayer (1996: 102-32) with specific reference to Tibetan Buddhism.  This is not the place to discuss the issue of who borrowed from whom; the point  is that Tantra was a body of religious practice that evolved through similar phases  both within India and throughout its expansion into greater Asia. For any given  period, there has been a certain uniformity to Tantric practice that would have  been identifiable as "Tantra," both within India and across Asia.  

Within India, we may take the example of an early tenth-century Jain Tantra  entitled the Jvalini Kalpa. This text - which features yaksinis as consorts of the  tirthahkaras; Tantric sorcery (satkriya); yoga and alchemy; erotic practice involv ing the use of a female partner's sexual fluids as power substances (candali vijja);  use of mandalas, mudras, and mantras; nyasa (imposition of the deity's body on  the practitioner's); and cult of the Eight Mothers (Nandi, 1973: 147-67) - is in  nearly every respect identical to Hindu and Buddhist Tantric sources of the same  period. Nothing but the names of the deities invoked, visualized, or manipulated  in these practices is specifically Jain; all the features, however, are specific to tenth 

century Indian Tantra, whether Hindu, Buddhist, or Jain. Most of these "hard 

24 DAVID GORDON WHITE  

core" practices disappeared from Jain Tantra in the centuries that followed, just  as they did from Hindu and Buddhist Tantra; however, in this tenth-century  stratum, Jain, Hindu, and Buddhist Tantra were largely identical.  

Outside of India, we may return to the emic conundrum of the Japanese pro ponents of mikkyo, who have had to grapple with (or who more often simply  deny) the problem of the presence, within the historical development of their  own tradition, of elements of the Tachikawa "heresy." The same principle that  applies within Indo-Tibetan Buddhism also applies to "export" Tantra. Both the  exoteric Mahayana form of Tantra that was central to the formation of Shingon  in the eighth century and the esoteric Vajrayana form of Tantra central to Tachi kawa practice were forms of Tantric practice that were normative for their re spective times. In the light of this, the Shingon emic category of mikkyo as well  as the broader Tantric emic category of the four types of revelation (encompassing  both Shingon as "pure esotericism" and the Tachikawa "heresy") that fell within  the purview of some twelfth-century Shingon practices are both admissable, when  viewed through the etic lens of historical development.  

Tantric Actors  

Tantric actors, who include Siddhas, gurus or lamas, monks and nuns, yogins,  sorcerers, witches, rulers, royal preceptors and chaplains, spirit mediums, vision ary bards, oracles, astrologers, healers, and lay- or householder-practitioners, may  be classified into three main groups: Tantric specialists who have received initi ation into a textual, teaching lineage and their generally elite clients; Tantric spe cialists lacking in formal initiation, whose training tends to be through oral trans mission (or divine possession) alone, and their generally nonelite clients; and  householder or lay nonspecialists whose personal practice may be qualified as  Tantric. Although the third category is numerically the largest, lay or householder  Tantric practice is generally "soft core," and will therefore not enter significantly  into our discussion. There is overlap among these groups, of course, with house holder practitioners, for example, calling upon one or another type of specialist  for teachings, guidance, and ritual expertise and practice. The purview of the  Tantric actor par excellence, the Tantric ruler - usually a king or emperor but,  in the case of Tibet, a head of the monastic theocracy - covers all three of these  categories. Apart from the kings of Nepal and Bhutan, there are no Tantric rulers  remaining in the world, and it is perhaps for this reason that most twentieth century scholarly and popular accounts of Tantra tend to view it either as little  more than popular superstition or "sympathetic magic," on the one hand, or as  a sublime theoretical edifice on the other, without seeking to describe the rela tionship between these types of practice and their practitioners. In this final sec tion, I argue that the person and office of the Tantric ruler is the glue that holds  together all three levels or types of Tantric practice, without whom an integratedINTRODUCTIO N 25  

understanding of Tantra cannot be gained. As before, the Tantric mandala will  serve to map the tradition.  

The View from the Center  

In our working definition of Tantra, we identified the mandala as the hallmark  of Tantric theory and practice, the mesocosmic template through which the Tan tric practitioner transacts with and appropriates the myriad energies that course  through every level of the cosmos. Here, it is important to note that the mandala  was, in its origins, directly related to royal power. The notion of the king as  cakravartin - as both he who turns (vartayati) the wheel (cakra) of his kingdom  or empire from its center and he whose chariot wheel has rolled around its pe rimeter without obstruction - is one that goes back to the late Vedic period in  India. A cognate ideology of the emperor, the "son of Heaven," as center was  already in place in China in the same period. Basic to these constructions of  kingship is the notion that the king, standing at the center of his kingdom (from  which he also rules over the periphery) mirrors the godhead at the center of his  realm, his divine or celestial kingdom. However, whereas the godhead's heavenly  kingdom is unchanging and eternal, the terrestrial ruler's kingdom is only made  so through the "utopia" of the mandala. As such, the idealized "constructed king dom" of the mandala is the mesocosmic template between real landscapes, both  geographical and political (the protocosm) and the heavenly kingdom of the god head (metacosm), with the person of the king as god on earth constituting the  idealized microcosm. Ruling from his capital at the conceptual center of the uni verse, the king is strategically located at the base of the prime channel of com munication between upper and lower worlds, which he keeps "open" through  the mediation of his religious specialists.  

This royal ideology of "galactic polity" (Tambiah 1976: 102-31) or the "ex emplary center" comprising the king, his deity, and the capital city, has been  mediated by the mandala in nearly every premodern Asian political system. In  India, the practice of the mandala is tantamount to the royal conquest of the four  directions (digvijaya) which, beginning with a fire sacrifice (homa), has the king  process through the four compass points, around the theoretical perimeter of his  realm, before returning to his point of origin, which has now been transformed  into the royal capital and center of the earth (Sax 1990: 143,145). This last detail  is an important one, because it highlights the king's dual role as pivot between  heaven and earth. On the one hand, he is the microcosmic godhead incarnate,  ruling from the center; on the other, he is the protocosmic representative of  Everyman, struggling against myriad hostile forces that threaten him from the  periphery. It is here that, in terms of the mandala and Tantric practice in general,  the king constitutes the link that binds together elite and nonelite practitioners  and traditions.  

In reality, the king's hold on the mandala of his realm has often been more 

26 DAVI D GORDO N WHIT E  

Utopian than real. Conversely, given the intrinsically Utopian (belonging to "no place") nature of the mandala, Tantric practitioners have often flourished, or at  least survived, in situations of political anarchy or oppression; that is, in the  absence of a religiously sanctioned ruler. In this latter case, religious power, when  forced to operate on a clandestine level, controls the invisible forces of the uni verse from the hidden "center" of the tantrika's "peripheral" shrine, monastery,  or lodge. It is not for nothing that in India, the abbot of a powerful monastery or  leader of a religious order continues to be addressed, in the present day, as guru raja, "preceptor-king."  

In this sense, the Tantric practitioner is a crypto-potentate, transacting like a  king with the boundless energy of the godhead that flows from the elevated center  of his worship mandala. The early history of the Gaudiya Vaisnavas, arguably a  Tantric sect in its origins, is a remarkable example of this strategy. Finding them 

selves in a world without a Vaisnava king following the fall of the Gajapati dynasty  in Orissa in 1568 C.E., the Gaudiya Vaisnavas created a ritually ordered cosmos  for themselves in which the cultic centers of Nabadwip and Vrindaban came to  be identified, through the architectonics of the mandala, with the descent of the  celestial realm (dhaman) of the royal god Visnu/Krsna. Since that time, Gaudiya  Vaisnava practitioners have visualized themselves at the center of a Utopian king 

dom, meditatively envisioning the power relationship between features of these  cult centers' natural landscape and the divine realm of Krsna's Goloka heaven  (Stewart, 1995: 5).  

Here, then, we see that the utopia of the Tantric mandala may serve both to  ground legitimate royal authority and power when the king is a Tantric practi tioner, and to subvert illegitimate power or create a covert nexus of power when  the wrong king or no king is on the throne. This is precisely the strategy of the  present Dalai Lama's government in exile vis-a-vis the occupation of Tibet by the  People's Republic of China. The role of the lama in Tibetan Buddhist religious  polity stands out as a unique case in the history of Tantra inasmuch as the lamas  have actually exercised temporal power, governing, protecting, and working for  the enlightenment of their country and its people. This is a pattern that began in  the thirteenth century with the establishment of a relationship between the Sak yapa order and the Mongol emperors, whereby the former became the Tantric  initiators of the latter. In terms of religious ideology, however, this pattern goes  back to the twelfth century, at which time certain Nyingmapa "Treasure" scrip tures had begun to portray the seventh-century Tibetan monarch Song-tsen  Gampo as a Tantric manifestation of Avalokitesvara, and created an elaborate  national mythos around this theme (Kapstein 1992: 79-93). This was institu tionalized (also with Mongol support) with the establishment of the fifth Dalai  Lama as the temporal and spiritual ruler of Tibet in 1642; for the next 308 years,  the Gelugpa Dalai Lama, the incarnation of the celestial bodhisattva Avalokites vara, "ruled" Tibet from his Potala palace (Samuel 1993: 488, 527, 544). Since  1950, the mandala of the Dalai Lama's rule has once more become a Utopian one.  

In the entire history of Tantra, the Tibetan theocracy alone has succeeded in 

INTRODUCTIO N 27  

collapsing the three types of Tantric practitioners mentioned at the beginning of  this section - as well as the dual (spiritual and temporal) role of the Tantric  ruler - into the single person of the lama. In the remainder of the Tantric world,  the division of labor outlined above has remained the rule, with the royal courts  of Hindu and Buddhist kings constituting the privileged clienteles of Tantric spe 

cialists. This symbiotic relationship between Tantric "power brokers" and their  power-wielding royal patrons is particularly apparent in Tantric rituals of initia tion (diksa), and consecration or empowerment (abhiseka). Tantric consecration  has long been the special prerogative of Asian rulers. In fact, royal participation  in Tantric ritual colors the totality of Tantric literature; and "it is no mystery that  central ritual of Tantra - consecration - was modeled on the ancient Indian ritual  of royal investiture, [which] not only transformed monks into Tantric kings, but  also kings into Tantric masters" (Strickmann 1996: 40).  

In fact, abhiseka itself may well have had a sexual connotation, from the time  of the royal consecrations of the Vedic period. As Per Kvaerne has argued, the  verbal root of this term is sic, which means "sprinkle," "wet," "soak," and the  original sense of consecration was one of a hieros gamos, a sacred marriage be 

tween king and earth. As such, the distant origins of this core element of Tantric  practice may lie in a notion that the sex act and the ritual act were in some way  equivalent (Kvaerne 1975: 102-9). The practices of the Tachikawa-ryu that so  shocked the Shingon mainstream in Japan should also be viewed in this light: the  sexual symbolism of the imperial accession ceremony was the same as that of the  Tachikawa ritual, although it is not clear which influenced the other. These cult  practices may also have had a pre-Tantric precedent in Japan, in which the ancient  enthronement ceremony included a secret rite wherein an imitation of the hier ogamy between the emperor and a goddess may have been enacted with a sacred  prostitute (Faure 1998: 125-29, 169-70).  

In India as well, the role of the person of the queen - and of her sexual emis sion - as the source of her husband's energy is one that predates the emergence  of Tantra by several centuries. A particularly evocative description of such is found  in a ca. 100-300 C.E. Tamil poem, the Netunalvatai, which has been summarized  and interpreted by Dennis Hudson (1993: 133-34) as follows:  

Inside the house of the Pandya king there stood another "house," in which ananku,  the sexual and sacred power of the ur, the territory of his kingdom as a person, was  present. This house, called the karu ("embryo") - like the inner sanctum, the "womb  house" (garbha-grha) of the Hindu temple - was a bedroom into which the sole male  that entered was the king himself. In the place of the temple altar was a large round  bed replete with symbols of marital and fertile power. On the bed sat the queen,  naked save for her wedding necklace, awaiting her king who had gone into battle.  One of her maidservants prayed to the Mother goddess for his victory.  

The round bed is the round Vedic fire altar that symbolizes the earth and the  queen the Vedic fire, awaiting the oblation 5f soma-semen from her husband. Known  as "The Goddess Who Founds the Family" (kula-mutaltevi), she embodies the 

28 DAVI D GORDO N WHIT E  

"Mother" to whom the maidservant prays for victory, and the ananku that pervades  the fortress. That ananku, transmitted by her to the king each time they have sexual  intercourse (kutal), is carried inside of him as the sakti, the energy, that wins him  victory in battle.  

Yet the king must exile himself to the periphery of his kingdom, to the bor derlands where the battleline is constantly being drawn, to protect the center.  

The View from the Periphery  

As we have noted, the role of the king in the practice of the Tantric mandala is a  dual one. In Chinese parlance, the emperor is the "son of Heaven" when he rules  from the center of his palace in the heart of the middle kingdom; at the same  time, he is the representative of Everyman, battling to protect the periphery of  his realm against eruptions of barbarian demons, monsters, epidemics, and so on.  Here, it may be helpful to introduce the typology of the "transcendental" and  "pragmatic" aspects of religion. This typology, first proposed in the 1960s by the  anthropologist David Mandelbaum (1966) in relation to village-level religious  practice in India, should help us to understand the dual role of the Tantric king,  and serve as a theoretical bridge between what appear today to be two distinct  types of Tantric specialists and their clients, and two distinct and generally dis connected types of Tantric practice in Asia.  

When practitioners pay homage to the great gods of their tradition in the  controlled atmosphere of a religious festival or periodical ritual observance, this  is an example of a "transcendental" religion. When, however, an uncontrolled  epidemic breaks out in their village or territory, and the local or regional deity of  the disease in question is worshiped to protect and save them from their affliction,  this is an example of "pragmatic" religion. Tantric elites - kings and their priestly  specialists, householder practitioners, and so on - will generally take a "transcen dental" approach to their religion, transacting with high gods through the con 

trolled template of the mandala. On the other hand, Tantric specialists from lower  levels of society - healers, exorcists, spirit-mediums, and so on - will generally  be called upon by their clients for their "pragmatic" abilities to transact with a  malevolent spirit world that has already erupted into their lives, far away from  the mandala's quiet center. By and large, the transcendental approach is proactive,  while the pragmatic approach is reactive.  

From the transcendent perspective, the mandala is a Utopia ("no-place") as  geometrically perfect as the Hindu Sri Yantras or Tibetan Buddhist sand mandalas.  But real life always occurs "someplace," and it is here, at the pragmatic fringes,  that the world of the mandala becomes somewhat messier. More than any other  Tantric actor, the king is obliged to adopt both transcendental and pragmatic  strategies in his transactions through the mandala. We have already outlined the  transcendental side of his practice: in the latter role, he is Everyman, not only  because he is the representative and protector of every one of his people, but also  because he is himself his own person, subject to many of the same trammels of 

INTRODUCTIO N 29  

existence as everyone else in his realm. Like them, he has a home and a family,  a body that is prey to disease and death, and deceased relations who come to visit  him in his dreams. In this respect, he must transact with the same gods, ghosts,  and ancestors as have most Asian individuals from time immemorial - beings  which, because they are closer to the human world than are the high gods, are  generally viewed as having a more immediate impact on human life.  

Most pragmatic religious life in Asia revolves around family gods, that is, those  deceased family members, distant or recent, who have died untimely or unusual  deaths. Such a death has barred their path to the protected world of the ances tors - the happy dead - and as such, these unhappy and unsettled spirits find  themselves condemned to a marginal and dangerous existence. Because these  spirits inhabit the world between the living and the dead, they are most readily  encountered in the places at which they departed from this world: graveyards and  charnel- and cremation- grounds [McDaniel]. As such, these sites become the  privileged venues of certain types of pragmatic Tantric practice (exorcism, sub 

jugation, killing, and so on), and are described in gruesome detail in Tantric  literature and graphically illustrated on the lower portions or borders of Buddhist  mandala art, in particular.  

In their unhappy situation, these beings will often seek to avenge themselves  against their family, clan, or village, and so become malevolent ghosts, the bhut prets of India or kuei of China. The semantic field of this latter term is particularly  telling, extending as it does to not only the mesocosm of the household and the  malevolent deities that threaten it but also to that of the empire, and the barbarian monsters (kuei) that would overrun the center were the king's armies not vigilantly  patrolling the periphery. The protean horde of these lesser deities form or hem  in the outermost fringes of the great mandala that the king, as an incarnation of  the godhead, rules from the center. Yet it is one and the same mandala, the same  mesocosm of interpenetrating energies; all that changes is the perspective from  which it is viewed.  

Over the past two millennia, Asian traditions have generated a remarkably  unified taxonomy of these malevolent deities, based for the most part on origin,  form, and function. They are a highly volatile and capricious group, by turns  hostile and friendly, terrible and benign, semidemonic and semidivine, with  changes in demeanor corresponding directly to the ritual attention given them by  humans. Capable of changing bodily containers - that is, of possessing the bodies  of both the living and dead - their host fills the sky, earth, waters, stones, and  trees, as well as the bodies of every type of living creature. Their names are legion,  as are their forms and functions. In South Asia alone, one encounters - across  Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, and Muslim traditions alike - cults of and practices relat ing to female yoginis, dakinis, Saktis, Mothers, yaksinis, raksasis, pisacinis, and  vidyarajnis; and male bhairavas, Siddhas, viras, ganas, bhutas, pretas, vetalas,  raksasas, pisacas, maras, and vidyarajas. Many of these classes of beings were  carried from India, in the first wave of export Tantric literature and liturgies, into  Inner and East Asia, where they came to jostle and often merge with already 

30 DAVI D GORDO N WHIT E  

existing indigenous pantheons. They continue to be found in myriad regional and  vernacular forms throughout all of Asia. Yet, as has already been stated, we must  not conclude from this that Asian belief systems and practices concerning these  hosts of beings constitute the "origins" of Tantra. They have always been with the  Asian peoples: when their cults became "tantric" - or when "Tantra" emerged  out of their cult practices - is a chicken/egg question that is impossible to resolve.  

At the pragmatic outer fringes of the mandala, possession, exorcism, divination,  and healing have historically been the most pervasive forms of Tantric practice  [Erndl], and it has been in their roles as ritual healers, "psychoanalysts," clair voyants, and ground-level problem solvers [Walter] that nonelite Tantric spe cialists - whether they be called Ojhas or Bhopas in India, Good-pas (pronounced  "chopa") in Tibet, or even Daoists in China, or Shinto priests in Japan - first  established and have continued to maintain their closest ties with every level of  Asian society. The dark counterpart to these practices is ritual sorcery or black  magic, the manipulation of the same low-level deities or demons to strike down  enemies with the same afflictions as those they are called upon to placate or  eliminate. Most often, practitioners gain access to and control over these malev olent deities by entering into a possessed state or mediumistic trance, and it must  be allowed that at this level, Tantric specialists rarely make explicit use of the  mandala. Nonetheless, it informs their practice, since they know themselves to  be transacting with deities that are in some way the emanations, sons, daughters,  or servants of the transcendent godhead at the distant center. This is the case, for  example, with the multiple Bhairavas of popular Hindu traditions in South Asia.  In Jain Tantric practice, these beings are termed "unliberated deities," as opposed  to the enlightened and liberated tirthankaras [Cort]; in Buddhist Tantra, they are  conceived as ordinary worldly deities who have vowed to protect the Dharma, as  opposed to enlightened buddhas or bodhisattvas.  

We should bear in mind here that the transcendent/pragmatic religion typology  is just that: an ideal construct employed to classify types of Tantric practice. In  fact, the world of Tantric practice is a continuum that draws on both the tran scendent and the pragmatic approaches. This is the strategy of the Tibetan lamas,  who are both teachers of the Dharma and protectors of their people from malev olent deities. Lay practitioners too will often combine the two approaches, ap pealing directly to semidivine intermediaries for protection and succor in their  daily lives while focusing their meditative practice on the godhead at the center  of the mandala. An example of such a combinatory practice is the preliminary  Tantric ritual process known as bhutasuddhi, the "cleansing of the five elements"  but also "the purging of the demonic beings." Prior to meditatively constructing  the god at the center of the worship mandala, and then identifying it with their  own subtle bodies, practitioners must first purge their bodies of these lower ele ments/malevolent beings (bhutas). In some Hindu practice, this process culmi nates in the dramatic expulsion of a black "Sin Man" (papapurusa) - a conden sation of all the malevolent beings inhabiting the mandalic mesocosm of his  body - through the practitioner's left nostril.  

What differentiates elite Tantric specialists from their nonelite counterparts is 

INTRODUCTIO N 31  

not the basic structure of the mandala as transactional mesocosm, but rather the  name and attributes of the deities with whom they transact. Elite practitioners - by virtue of their higher Tantric empowerments, textual lineages, and formal  instruction - are able to transact with the supreme transcendent-yet-immanent  deity of the Tantric universe at the center to control all of the beings of the  mandala - divine, semidivine, and demonic - for the protection the king, his  court, and the state as a whole. The principal deity with whom the nonelite  specialist or practitioner will interact - some low-level "lord of spirits" - will not  be absent from the elite mandala; rather, he or she will be relegated to a zone  nearer to the periphery of that mandala, as a fierce protector deity guarding the  mandala of the king's (and supreme deity's) Utopian realm from incursions by  malevolent spirits from the outside, that is, enemies.  

In this, his protective role, the ruler will call upon his elite Tantric specialists  to perform rituals generally considered to fall within the purview of their nonelite  counterparts (or, in some cases, simply call upon the latter to perform them).  "Binding the directions" (dig-bandhana) to fence out demons from the mandala,  a standard preliminary to nearly every type of Tantric ritual, is a practice that  betrays this concern with the dangerous boundary between inside and outside,  "us" and "them" [Gardiner]. Yet this is but one of a body of ritual technologies - for driving away, immobilizing, confusing, and annihilating "demonic" enemies  of the state - that elite Tantric specialists have marshaled on behalf of their royal  clients for over a millennium. From this royal perspective as well, the fierce and  heavily armed deities pictured at the borders and gates of the Tantric mandalas  are recognized as protectors of the realm. Very often, those fierce deities have  been female - circles of wild animal- or bird-headed goddesses - a reminder once  again that the activated energy that flows through the Tantric mandala is nearly  always feminine.  

Contributions to this volume amply illustrate this intimate relationship between  various types of Tantric specialists, their royal clients, and the protection of the  state throughout Asia, including Tang China [Orzech-Sanford], Heian Japan [Gra pard], Malla Nepal [Bledsoe], and Kalacuri central India [Davis]. Here, elite ritual  technologies have been backed up by military force: as in the West, fighting  monastic orders have long been a part of the Asian landscape, and the orders in  question, in both South and East Asia, have generally been Tantric (Strickmann  1996: 41; Lorenzen 1978: 61-75). In South Asia, tantrikas were power brokers  throughout the medieval period, and one may even see in the presence, in the  early 1990s, of the Nath Siddha leader Avaidyanath on the ruling council of the  Hindu-nationalist organization known as the Visva Hindu Parisad, an attempt to  reclaim that role in postcolonial India (White 1996: 304-13; 342-49).  

Where is the Mainstream?  

Throughout this essay, I have made ambiguous use of the term "mainstream,"  sometimes referring to the "Tantric mainstream" and at others contrasting Tantric  with non-Tantric "mainstream" practices, albeit with the mitigating heuristic de-

32 DAVID GORDON WHITE  

vice of "hard-core" and "soft-core" Tantra. This ambiguity is one that flows (to  stay with a fluid metaphor) from the ambiguity of the Tantric mandala itself. As  has been argued, the Tantric mandala becomes "utopian" when there is no tem poral ruler to be identified with the godhead at the center. In such cases, Tantra  is outside the mainstream, potentially subversive and antinomian, the province  of the practitioner as crypto-potentate. When, however, the ruler is himself a  Tantric practitioner/client, then the mandala takes on a real-world referent, and  stands as the mesocosmic template between politicoreligious realities and their  metacosmic prototype, the realm of the divine. In the first instance, the Tantric  mandala is covert and occulted; in the latter, it is overt and hegemonic. The  anonymous author of the Agama Prakasa [Rinehart-Stewart] states this aphoris 

tically: "Every city has one-fourth part of its population as Saktas [that is, tantri kas] - and the ceremonies are performed very secretly in the middle of the night;  if a king be a supporter, they are also observed publicly."  

It is this bivalency of the portable Tantric mandala that has both ensured the  survival of Tantra in times of religious and political subjugation and rendered an  accounting of it so difficult for the scholar. When the king is a Tantric practitioner,  Tantra is a protective bulwark of the state, and its specialists are power-brokering  bearers of religious authority. Geoffrey Samuel (1993: 34) sums up this situation  in the following terms: "[A] practitioner can relate directly to the sources of power  and authority, by contacting the Tantric 'deities' and other central 'culture-heroes.'  Once the practitioner becomes a lama, this direct contact with power legitimates  a social role that can as easily extend into the political sphere." When, however,  there is no ruler, or when the "wrong king" is on the throne, the Tantric specialist  becomes a covert operative, an occult cosmocrat, controlling a universe in which  he is, through his identity with the god at the center of the mandala, the creator,  preserver, and destroyer. This latter state of affairs is, of course, threatening to  the "wrong king" in question, and Siddha mythology is replete with accounts of  the triumph of Tantric masters over wrong-headed temporal rulers. There are,  however, other possible scenarios, giving rise to other strategies on the part of  Tantric actors, which need to be explored. These concern relationships among  power elites - Tantric specialists and their royal or aristocratic clients - in which  the former, whether they consider their royal client to be legitimate or not, seek  to find ways by which to assert their authority over the latter. These are the  strategies of secrecy and dissimulation.  

Until recent times, Tantric ritual constituted a bulwark for the state in the  Indianized and Sanskritized monarchies of Asia, from Nepal to Bali (Strickmann  1996: 348). Reciprocally, it has especially been through royal support (protection,  land grants, tax-exempt status, and so on) that the various Tantric orders have  been empowered both to propagate their sectarian teachings and to consolidate  their socioeconomic position in the realm. In this symbiotic relationship, Tantric  lineages - of families, teaching traditions, and royal, priestly, and monastic suc 

cession - have often been closely intertwined. It is particularly in Nepal - where  the royal preceptor (raj guru) has, since the thirteenth century, been the king's 

INTRODUCTIO N 33  

chief religious advisor, initiating his royal client into the circles of deities that  comprise and energize the nepala-mandala (Toffin 1989: 24-25) - that the re lationship between the tantrika and his king has remained in force down to the  present day.  

This modern-day survival of a medieval Tantric legacy has been the subject of  the important research of Mark Dyczkowski, the fruits of which will appear  shortly in the context of a forthcoming massive study of the Kubjika Tantras.  According to Dyczkowski's analysis, control of the cult of the great royal goddess  Taleju (whose secret worship and liturgies are based on those of the Tantric Hindu  goddess Kubjika) lies at the heart of the power relationship between that goddess's  Newar priesthood and the royal family of Nepal. After reviewing the cults of the  gods of the Newars' public religion, the gods of the "civic space" or "mesocosm"  (Levy 1992), Dyezkowski (2000: 2-3) presents the following scenario:  

But there is an inner secret domain which is the Newars' "microcosm." This does not  form a part of the sacred geography of the Newar civis, although, from the initiate's  point of view, it is the source and reason for much of it. The deities that populate  this "inner space" and their rites are closely guarded secrets and, often, they are the  secret identity of the public deities known only to initiates. The two domains com 

plement each other. The outer is dominantly male. It is the domain of the attendants  and protectors of both the civic space and the inner expanse, which is dominantly  female. In the public domain . . . the male dominates the female, while the secret  lineage deities of the higher castes [of the elite Tantric specialists] are invariably female  accompanied by male consorts. . . . The inner domain is layered and graded in hier 

achies of deepening and more elevated esotericism that ranges from the individual  to the family group, clan, caste, and out through the complex interrelationships that  make up Newar society. Thus the interplay between the inner and outer domains is  maintained both by the secrecy in which it is grounded and one of the most char 

acteristic features of Newar Tantrism as a whole, namely, its close relationship to the  Newar caste system.  

The outer domain is that of the pragmatic boundary of the mandala, discussed  earlier; here, the multiple Bhairabs (Bhairavas) who guard the boundaries of vil lages, fields, and the entire Kathmandu Valley itself are so many hypostases of  the great Bhairabs of the royal cultus: Kal Bhairab, Akas Bhairab, and so on. As  we have noted, however, it is only by transacting with the transcendent deity at  the heart of the mandala that one gains and maintains supreme power. Here  secrecy becomes a prime strategy. The Taleju brahmans offer Bhairava initiations  to the king as the maintainer of the outer, public state cultus; however, it is only  among themselves that they offer initiations and empowerments specific to their  lineage goddess - and it is precisely through these secret initiations and empow erments that they maintain their elevated status vis-a-vis all the other castes in  the Kathmandu Valley, including that of their principal client, the king himself.  Because the goddess at the center of that mandala is their lineage goddess, and  theirs alone, and because her higher initiations are their secret prerogative, the 

34 DAVI D GORDO N WHIT E  

Newar priesthood is able to "control" the king and the nepala-mandala as a whole.  Higher levels of initiation into the Kubjika Tantras, accessible only to these elite  tantrikas, afford them hegemony over the religious life of the kingdom, which  translates into an occult control of the Nepal royal administration - the political  edifice that protects the kingdom from all malevolent spirits, both internal and  external - which in turn enhances their social status and economic situation. A  comparison with the world of espionage is perhaps useful: only those of the  privileged inner circle (heart of the Tantric mandala) have the highest security  clearance (Tantric initiations) and access to the most secret codes (Tantric man tras) and classified documents (Tantric scriptures). The Taleju brahmans of Kath 

mandu, tantrikas to the king, are the "intelligence community" of the kingdom,  and their secret knowledge affords them a symbolic and real power greater than  that of the king himself. In this way, the political power that the Newars lost  through the eighteenth-century invasion of the Kathmandu Valley by the founder  of the Shah dynasty has been recovered through their control of the goddess at  the heart of the royal mandala and their control of the administration of the  kingdom.  

When one looks at the strategy of secrecy employed by the Taleju brahmans  of Nepal to exert occult control over a kingdom whose political power they lost  over two centuries ago, one is not far from the practice of dissimulation, of pre tending to be someone other than who one is. Dissimulation is a particular strat egy for maintaining secrecy that is most often employed when the "wrong king"  is on the throne, and practitioners are forced "underground." Basically the same  aphorism, found in both Hindu and Buddhist Tantric traditions, expresses this  strategy: "outwardly Vedic, a Saiva at home, secretly a Sakta [that is, a tantrika]";  "externally a Hinayana, internally a Mahayana, secretly a Vajrayana," in the Bud dhist version. This strategy is altogether comprehensible in a situation of political  or religious oppression. Curiously, or not so curiously, it is a strategy employed  in times of relative freedom, as well. This is the stuff secret societies are made of  the world over. The question of why one would wish to dissemble when fear  of oppression is not one's principal motivation may again be approached by  borrowing terminology from the world of espionage. Dissimulation allows for  covert operatives to possess a double (or triple) identity, and to inhabit more than  one world at the same time. It is also a means for "insiders" to recognize one  another without being recognized by "outsiders," through the use of secret signs  (mudras), language (mantras), codes (forms of mantric encryption), and so on. It  is a means for creating an elite, even if its eliteness is known to none but the  insider community.  

The Broken World of Tantra  

The Tantric ruler is the Tantric actor par excellence, with galactic polity operating  on the level of mandalas of deities as well as that of agglomerations of peoples,  clans, and territorial units. The royal palace is located at the center of a mandalaINTRODUCTIO N 35  

that is the master grid controlling and encompassing all the beings - human,  subhuman, and superhuman - within its purview; at the same time, the king  polices and protects the boundaries of his royal mandala from outside incursions.  As such, the office and person of the king have constituted the vital link between  elite and nonelite forms of Tantric practice. Without him, the center is missing,  and the phenomenon that is Tantra becomes cloven into two bodies of practice - the one transcendent and quietistic and the other pragmatic and "shamanistic" - that appear to have little or no relationship to one another. Yet, as we have noted,  with the possible exceptions of Bhutan, Nepal (now a constitutional monarchy),  and Tibet (a theocracy in exile), there are no Tantric systems of galactic polity  remaining on the planet.  

What effect has this loss of the center had on Tantra? Generally speaking, it  has apparently split Tantra into two bodies of practice whose connections are  barely recognizable to either practitioners or scholars. On the one hand, the pow erful Tantric rites of subjugation, immobilization, annihilation, and so on - the  "Six Practices" or "Six Rites of Magic" (satkarmdni) [Buhnemann] - have become  the sole province of individuals practicing for their own prestige and profit, or  on behalf of other individuals on a for-cash basis. In the absence of state patron age, deployment of these ritual technologies often amounts to little more than  black magic. When no longer employed in the service of the state, what had  previously been a coherent body of practice for the state's protection can appear  to be little other than a massive "protection racket" against supernatural thugs. It  is in this context that many Hindus in India today deny the relevance of Tantra  to their tradition, past or present, and identify what they call "tantra-mantra" as  so much mumbo-jumbo.  

The second body of practice that has emerged from this loss of a political center  generally involves Tantric elites. When there no longer is a royal client to support  them, many of those elite specialists who had been royal chaplains or preceptors  have tended to turn their energies toward "perfecting" the rituals and liturgies for  which a performance arena no longer exists. Closed into monasteries or other  conventicles, these specialists have tended to scholasticize Tantric theory and  internalize, sublimate, or semanticize external Tantric practice. Taken to its ex 

treme, this scholasticizing tendency has removed Tantra from its this-worldly  concerns and transformed it into an idealized and intellectualized inner exercise  generally reserved for an elite group of insiders. Minutely categorizing every facet  of the universe of experience and practice is the mark of scholasticist Tantra, and  a great number of the passages translated in this volume betray that mindset. This  tendency has been further catalyzed by a gradual loss of touch with the original  clan lineage-based ground for Tantric ritual (Gupta-Hoens-Goudriaan 1979: 124;  White 1998: 192-95).  

There have been two major upshots of these developments. On the one hand,  much of Tantra has become highly philosophical, and many of the most brilliant  Tantric summa have been the work of "pure theoreticians." Even when the lan guage of such forms of Tantra remains antinomian, this is a purely ritual or 

36 DAVI D GORDO N WHIT E  

philosophical antinomianism, one cut off from the outside world, that is being  espoused. On the other, as we have already noted, Tantric specialists have often,  in the absence of politically powerful patrons, adopted the strategy of dissimu lation, of hiding their "true" Tantric identity behind a facade of conventional  behavior in the public sphere. In this context, elite "Tantra has moved towards  the doctrinally orthodox and politically unobjectionable. . . . The magical and  shamanic powers have lost their importance, the 'disreputable' sexual practices  are avoided, and Tantric ritual has become little more than a supplement to the  ordinary Brahmanic cult. Much the same . . . appears to be true for Buddhist  Tantra among the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley, and in Japan, and for both  Buddhist and Hindu Tantra in Bali" (Samuel 1993: 432).  

These two strategies, of appropriating Tantric ritual technologies as means to  self-promotion, and of dissimulation combined with scholasticist theorization,  only appear to be the legacy of two different traditions. In fact, they are two sides  of the same coin; however, the coin is one that no longer bears a royal head or  device on its face. Such is the broken world of Tantra at the dawn of the new  millennium.

## Gurus and Adepts 

### 01 The Tantric Guru  

Andre Padoux  

The importance accorded to the spiritual master, the guru or acarya, was a general  characteristic of Indian culture from very early times, and the trait was developed  and intensified in Tantric Hinduism and Buddhism. It goes back to the Vedic  period and is still visible in India today.  

A reason for the guru's importance may lie in the fact that Indian traditions  always gave precedence to the oral/aural/verbal, rather than to the written, form  of religious or spiritual teachings. The Vedic Revelation is not scripture. It is sruti,  that which has been heard and which is transmitted by word of mouth. The  Buddha and the Jina taught orally, and their teaching was long committed to  memory only. The various Tantric doctrines, though they seem to have been  written down early (by the fifth or sixth century C.E., perhaps, for Hindu Tantras,  earlier for the Buddhist ones), were also deemed to have been revealed - that is,  told, orally expressed - by a deity to a first master and then transmitted in the  same oral fashion to initiates alone, through a succession of masters (gurupar amparya), to succeeding generations of believers or adepts. Tantric texts that  embody this sort of teaching in writing are therefore often couched in the form  of a dialogue between a deity and a mortal, or between two deities speaking in  mythical times - one asking to be taught, the other revealing orally his/her teach ing.  

In this Indian context, the highest wisdom, liberating truth, can issue only from  the mouth of the master: gurumukhad eva. All such teaching, moreover, is nec essarily esoteric. It is given, orally, only to those whom the guru considers worthy  of receiving it and capable of keeping it secret. The esoteric transmission of doc trine by the guru to his chosen disciple includes the (necessarily oral) transmission  of a mantra that is believed to be all-powerful, superhuman in nature: only some one endowed with superhuman powers can have access to and transmit such a  power. This is a further reason why the Tantric guru is regarded as divine.  Tantric texts often do not expressly state that the guru is divine. They take it 

42 ANDRE PADOUX  

for granted, so obvious is such a notion to them. This identification with the deity  goes so far that in some cases it is not clear whether the Tantra refers to the master  or to the deity. For example, there is a passage in the Yoginihrdaya (a Saiva text  dating probably from the tenth or eleventh century C.E., but still read and used  in Srividya circles today) which exhorts the adept to invoke and perceive mentally  in one of the centers (cakras) of his "subtle" imaginary body the presence of the  "footprints or sandals of the Master" (gurupadukas); these, says the text, "pervade  the universe and fill it with celestial ambrosia," that is, with bliss. Now, the com mentary explains this paduka to be that of the guru, but it goes on to quote a  stanza that mentions only the deity, while alluding further on to the paduka of  "the guru whose nature is that of the supreme Siva." To realize mystically the  supreme nature of the gurupaduka, says the Yoginihrdaya, is also to realize one's  total identity with the supreme deity. What the adept is to experience is thus both  the spiritual presence in his heart of his guru and the presence of the deity: they  are both there but as one and the same, both transcendant and immanent reality.  As appears in the translation given below of excerpts from the Kularnavatantra,  this is what is generally implied by the term paduka.  

Admittedly, the Yoginihrdaya belongs doctrinally to the nondualistic form of  Saivism for which the supreme godhead forms the essence and omnipresent sub strate of the cosmos, a divine essence that pervades the guru as well. However, it  goes further than that. For this Tantric text (as for many others) there is a real,  active, all-powerful and grace-bestowing presence of the deity existing in, or rather  as, the guru. He has to be divine because in spiritual matters one gives not so  much what one has as what one is.  

The reverence and respect paid to the guru are reflected in the fact that Tantric  ritual worship usually begins by an invocation of the guru (gurusmarana) by which  the worshiper places him/herself mentally within his/her own tradition: rather  than one's own guru, it is the succession of the gurus of one's tradition, the  guruparamparya or gurupahkti, which is thus made spiritually present.  

In the Saiva Kaula traditions, this gurupahkti is sometimes described as con sisting of a threefold succession or "flow" (ogha) of masters, the first group being  "divine" (divya), the second "accomplished" (siddha) and the last "human" (man ova). If not historically then at least mythically, this flow links all the succeding  gurus to the supreme godhead by whom the tradition is supposed to have been  originally revealed. In this threefold succession (sometimes considered to corre spond to the yugas, the succeeding ages of the world), the gurus are progressively  less perfect as they pass from a divine to a mere human condition. However, even  human gurus are incarnations of the godhead and are to be worshiped as such  by their disciples.  

Tantric traditions are not alone in viewing the guru as divine. It could be said  that Indian gurus of whatever persuasion, and whether living in the past or the  present, are regarded by their disciples as divine. A well-known and remarkable  non-Tantric instance of such divinization is that of Caitanya, who came to be  regarded as an androgynous incarnation of Radha and Krsna. It is well known 

T HE TANTRI C GURU 43  

that Ananda Moyi, who died a few years ago, used to be worshiped in Varanasi  as an incarnation of the goddess Durga. More curious is the case of Sobha Ma,  who lives in Varanasi now, and who is considered by her disciples as a manifes tation of the (Tantric) goddess Kali. But once a year, she is worshiped by them  as an incarnation of the non-Tantric god Krsna. One is also tempted to refer to  the famous Bengali guru Ramakrsna, who came from a Tantric milieu, was a priest  of Kali, and was initiated by two Tantric ascetics. But he stopped halfway, lacking  the will to act as a real tantrika. Such instances (and many others could be quoted)  are clearly due to the diffusion, throughout India, of the Tantric conception of  the guru. As a well-known stanza from the Kularnavatantra (12.45) puts it, "Who 

ever regards the guru as a human being, the mantra as mere letters, and the images  [of deities] as stone, goes to hell." The proper attitude toward the guru is sum marized by another oft-quoted stanza from the same text (12.49): "The guru is  the father, the guru is the mother, the guru is God, the supreme Lord. When Siva  is angry, the guru saves [from his wrath]. When the guru is angry, nobody [can  help]." Many such quotations could be cited. The Tantrarajatantra (The King of  All Tantras), an undated - perhaps seventeenth-century - text belonging to the  Srividya tradition, includes in its first chapter a brief hymn to the guru, identifying  him with different aspects of the deity or of the cosmos; the human condition  appears to be utterly transcended.  

A richer and more detailed description of the Tantric guru is that of the twelfth  chapter (ullasa), "concerning the footprints [of the guru]," of the Kularnavatantra.  This Saiva Tantra is an important text of the Kaula tradition, and one of the best  known. Its date is unknown, but it is certainly earlier than the fifteenth century.  It was edited by Arthur Avalon and commented upon by him. The chapter in  question, 129 stanzas in length, is too long to be translated here in its entirety.  But the excerpts below show how far the extolling of the guru can go. Excessive  praise is of course an ancient Indian literary practice, and it was never to be taken  literally. But in its excess the Kularnavatantra expresses a widespread, typically  Tantric perception of the spiritual master. The eulogy is reinforced in the following  chapter of the same text, all 133 stanzas of which deal with the qualities, good  or bad, of the guru and of the disciple. It describes especially the traits a disciple  must exhibit in order for him to be chosen and then to serve his master properly:  absolute devotion and submission are the rule.  

Considered to be drvine, deserving of praise, and treated as a deity, the Tantric  guru is naturally a figure to be worshiped. Indeed, a gurupuja, ritual worship of  the guru, is sometimes prescribed. It is to be carried out by the newly initiated  disciple for the master who has initiated him, and by the newly consecrated acarya  for the master who has consecrated him and whom he is to succeed. The puja  may consist of a mere recitation (japa) of the gurumantra, which is sometimes a  long formula, and sometimes simply Om Om sri gurave namah. Whether short or  long, the gurumantra, when its japa is completed, is to be "offered" by the per former of the rite and symbolically placed in the guru's right hand. This is pre 

scribed in all Tantric cults for the final japa of the deity's mantra. This rite is 

44 ANDRE PADOU X  

interesting as a symbolic offering both of one's prayer and of oneself to the god head - or to the guru.  

The gurupuja may also be a complete ritual program during which the guru,  seated on a throne (asana) that symbolizes the whole cosmos (which he is thus  deemed to transcend), is worshiped "with his mantras" and with the same offer ings as those made to a deity, with the remainder of the offered drinks or food  then being consumed (as in any puja) by the disciple, who must also worship the  "wheel of power" (sakticakra) presumed to encircle the guru. If all this is not done,  it is said, the whole initiation ritual would be void and without effect.  

Such being the divine nature ascribed to the Tantric guru and the worship  shown him, we would expect him to appear mysteriously, as a supernatural being  spontaneously endowed with all manner of perfections and uncommon powers.  But in fact only the founding masters of Tantric traditions, Hindu or Buddhist,  are ever described in such a way. This is often the case with the Siddhas. Well 

known examples are those of Matsyendranatha and Goraksanatha, the mythical  founders of the Natha tradition. On the other hand, whenever human rather than  mythical gurus are concerned, Tantric texts carefully describe and emphasize the  necessity of their ritual initiation (diksa) or consecration (abhiseka). The guru,  though essentially divine, is a human person who in fact becomes divine only  after a ritual empowerment by which his master transmits to him his own super 

natural excellence, together with his spiritual powers and ritual qualifications.  There is such a thing as the "making of a master" (acaryakaranam).  As a rule the acarya- (or guru-) diksa or abhiseka is the highest in a series of  initiations and is therefore given only to persons who have already received lesser  initiations. To become a guru one must, in addition, have a number of social,  physical, and mental qualities. These vary according to the doctrines, preferences,  or prejudices of the different Tantric traditions. They concern caste (often the  guru must be a brahman, he must at least be of good family, a kulin), gender  (usually only males can be gurus), family (a guru is normally married), knowledge  of the scriptures (the Sastras) and the ability to explain them, and so forth. Texts  often insist on the beauty, majestic appearance, deep voice, and other physical  traits a guru ought to possess. Some Tantras say a good guru cannot come from  certain parts of India. The thirteenth chapter of the Kuldrnavatantra mentions  different kinds of guru, with different capacities and different ways of teaching  and practicing different rituals. It lists the particular subjects with which a guru  ought to be conversant. It also mentions and warns against bad gurus. Only the  sadguru, the real guru, the embodiment of absolute truth, saves and is to be  worshiped. All of this goes to show that though extolled as divine, the Tantric  guru is also viewed a mere mortal who is not above human frailties. A point worth  noting is that the guru takes over his office and his powers from the master, who  initiates him and thereby transfers and relinquishes to him his own role and  authority. According to the Mrgendrdgama, the initiating master says to his suc cessor: "The power and authority I resign to you now, you will henceforth wield  until you transmit them to another." The rule is that there are never two masters  officially active at the same time in the same guruparamparya.

The importance thus attributed to ritual notions and practices should not come  as a surprise. The Tantric world is permeated and fundamentally characterized  by ritual. Contrary to what some believe, tantrikas are not antiritualists or trans gressive mystical seekers of supernatural powers and liberation. They are first and  foremost super-ritualists, "specialists in intensified ritual." Ritual, however, cannot  be separated from the doctrine that accompanies and justifies it: in the case of  Hindu Tantra, the prevailing ideology is that of the pervasive presence of divine  power, sakti, a power conceived of differently in different Tantric systems, but  one that can be mastered and deployed ritually to gain mundane or supramun 

dane ends. These two aspects of the Tantric reality come together in the acary abhiseka, in which the guru is spiritually consecrated and is invested (thanks to  the mantras he ritually receives) with supernatural powers, powers of such inten sity that he is divinized.  

Some Tantric traditions, notably the dualist Saiva Siddhanta whose scriptures  are the Sanskrit Agamas, insist on the absolute and total efficacy of ritual. Such  is also the position of the Vaisnava tradition of the Pancaratra, despite the im portance given there to devotion to the Lord. Others, notably the nondualist  Saivas, consider that the principal element in the making of a guru is not the  ritual of the diksa, but rather the divine influx of power: the grace of God (anu graha) or the "descent of power" (saktipata).  

Thus, the Kashmiri philosopher Abhinavagupta (tenth to eleventh century)  contrasts the ritually initiated, "fabricated" (kalpita) gurus with those who are "not  fabricated" (akalpita) but spontaneously and directly illuminated (and hence ini tiated) by Siva's grace. This is a position, Abhinavagupta says, that was already  held by such earlier Tantras as the Brahmayamala and even of Agamas such  as the Kiranagama. The highest guru, according to him, is the one called "spon taneous" (svayambhu) because he is spontaneously and divinely schooled in all  the traditional sciences. Such a master is absolutely perfect (samsiddhika), omnis cient, and divine; he destroys ignorance and spreads bliss by his mere presence.  Illuminated by the light of intuitive knowledge (pratibham jnanam), he is some times called pratibhaguru. This guru, Abhinavagupta explains, is in fact initiated  by the "goddesses of his own consciousness" (svasamvittidevibhir diksitah). This  is interesting, since it identifies the powers and movements that sustain and an imate a person's spiritual, mental, and physical life with divine entities. This  perception of one's powers as identical with, or reflecting, a set of deities (the  Kalis), this conception of these "goddesses as the blissful, uncontracted awareness  which is within and behind one's individuality" (to quote Alexis Sanderson), was  taken over by Abhinavagupta from the Kashmiri form of the ancient Saiva Krama  tradition.  

An akalpitaguru, according to him, may also be ritually initiated, in particular  so as to learn (and be able to teach) certain doctrines or practices. He is then said  to be an akalpitakalpita ("fabricated and not-fabricated") guru. Such a master,  says Abhinavagupta, is really the god Bhairava. Continually deepening his perfect  knowledge of all the Tantras and religious treatises, following the teaching of his  own Master but also remaining constantly immersed in the light of divine Con-46 ANDRE PADOUX  

sciousness, he reaches such a degree of plenitude (purnata) that he is identified  with Bhairava, that fearsome form of Siva. The Brahmayamalatantra further  teaches that a person can be initiated and enlightened (that is, liberated) thanks  only to the effulgence or power (sphuratta) of a mantra. By means of this method,  says the Tantra, one may become an acarya in a month. This may be taken as yet  another example of the power ascribed to mantras in Tantric Hinduism. But the  Tantra explains that this sort of direct mantric initiation is obtained while one  performs a particular ritual of worship of the goddess Rakta: "Raktadevi initiates  progressively through the japa of her mantras. This however can be done only if  one has found such a guru as can transmit the mantra." Even divine action some times needs the help of human power. Here, however, the idea is to exclude the  possibility of obtaining a mantra by finding it for oneself in a text: a written  mantra, as is well known, is powerless.  

Emphasis on the divinity of the guru is proper to Hindu Tantric traditions. The  Buddhist Tantric conception is naturally different. Buddhist Tantric spiritual mas ters are also regarded as superhuman. But there seems to be more emphasis on  the strangeness or eccentricity, as well as the supernatural origins and extraor dinary feats and powers, of these "accomplished" beings (called Siddhas or Ma hasiddhas), than on their divine nature. In Tibetan Buddhism, they may be sprul sku, incarnate lamas, which also places them on a higher plane than that of  ordinary people. Their disciples as well must obey and serve them slavishly. The  sufferings and acts of self-denial of such disciples form part of the biographies of  the great spiritual masters (especially the Tibetan ones). The trials endured by  Milarepa as the disciple of Marpa, or of Naropa as the disciple of Tilopa are well  known. The tales are largely imaginary or allegorical, but their raison d'etre is to  underline the supernatural nature and powers of these exceptional, quasi-divine  beings. The Tantric guru is always held to be superhuman.  

The Kularnavatantra, edited by Arthur Avalon [Sir John Woodroffe] (Madras:  Ganesh, 1965) includes a long introduction, two chapters of which provide a  partial translation and commentary on chapters 12 and 13 of that work. The two  sections of verses translated below are based on that edition, from chapters 12  and 13, respectively.

On the Paduka of the Guru  

2. Listen, O Goddess, to what you wish me to tell you and which, when heard,  quickly fosters devotion.  

4. Better than millions of gifts, millions of ritual observances, millions of the  greatest sacrifices is the mere invocation of the holy paduka [of the guru].  

5. Superior to millions of mantras, millions of bathings at pilgrimage places,  superior even to the worshiping of millions of deities is the mere evocation of  the holy paduka.  

6. The paduka, when called to mind in time of distress, protects against all  evil and all calamity; it dispels the greatest fear as well as all harm or illnesses.  

7. The paduka, when remembered, dispels difficulty in thinking, moving,  speaking, intercourse, communication, or action. Indeed, memory, knowledge,  wishing, or giving are done by him alone who ever keeps the holy paduka on  the tip of his tongue.  

8. O Goddess! he who, full of devotion, freed of all evil, does the japa of the  holy paduka reaches immediately the supreme state of being.  

10. Immediately, O Goddess! he who devotedly does the japa of the holy pa duka attains effortlessly the [four aims of life: ] religious merit, wealth, pleasure,  and liberation.  

11. In whatever direction shine the lotus feet of the Lord, thereto one must  bow every day, O Dear One!  

12. There is no mantra higher than the paduka, no god superior to the holy  guru, no [valid] initiation other than that of sakti, no merit higher than that  accruing from Kaula worship.  

13-14. The form of the guru is the root of meditation (dhyana), at the root of  worship are the feet of the guru, the root of mantra is the word of the guru,  the root of liberation is the compassion of the guru. All actions in this world  are rooted in the guru, O Mistress of the Kula! The guru therefore is constantly  to be served with all marks of devotion.  

15. Fear, distress, grief, perplexity, delusion, error, and so forth exist only as  long as one does not take refuge in reverent devotion to the guru. 

48 ANDRE PADOU X  

16. So long as they have no devotion to a perfect master (sadguru), human  beings wander in samsara, suffering from all forms of pain and delusion.  

17. The glorious mantra that bestows the fruits of all accomplishments is  rooted in the grace of the guru. It leads to the supreme Reality.  

18. Just as the boon-conferring guru, satisfied and happy, gives the mantra, so  one must please him with devotion, even by offering him one's own life.  

19. When the best of gurus (desikottama) gives himself to the disciple, the  latter is liberated. He will not be born again.  

20. The disciple should strive to satisfy and honor his guru so that he may  always be pleased. For when the guru is pleased the sins of the disciple are  destroyed.  

21. Yogins, sages, gods such as Brahma, Visnu, and Siva bestow their grace  when the guru is pleased. No doubt about it!  

22. The disciple, directed by the compassionate guru who is pleased with his  devotion, is liberated from [the fetters of] action and gains liberation as well  as other rewards (bhuktimukti).  

32. He who devotedly recalls "My guru is Siva in the form of the Master, who  grants rewards as well as liberation," for him perfection is not far away.  

38. Why such exertions as those of pilgrimage, wherefore observances that  emaciate the body, when the pure service of and devotion to the guru [afford  the same fruit] ?  

46. Never regard the guru as a mere mortal, for to one who thinks so neither  mantras nor the worship of gods will ever give any boon.  

47. Those who associate the holy guru with ordinary [people] either in their  remembrance or in their talk - even their good actions will turn into evil, O  Dear One!  

48. Parents, being the cause of one's birth, are to be honored with great care.  Still more particularly is to be honored the guru, for he makes known what is  and what is not the sociocosmic Order (dharmadharma).  

49. The guru is the father, the guru is the mother, the guru is God, the supreme  Lord. When Siva is angry, the guru saves [from his wrath], but when the guru  is angry, nobody [can help].  

50. By mind, by speech, by action, do what is helpful to the guru. By doing  what is bad for him, O Goddess, one becomes a prey to calamity.  

51. Those who do not act properly toward the holy guru in body, wealth, or  vital power will certainly become worms or insects [in a future life]. 

T HE TANTRI C GUR U 49  

52. Death results from the forsaking of one's mantra, misery from forsaking  one's guru. To forsake both guru and mantra leads to hell.  

53. The body must be borne for the guru's sake. For him alone should one  acquire wealth. One must exert oneself in the service of the guru regardless of  one's life.  

56. When the guru is there, no austerity (tapas) is to be practiced, nor fasting,  pilgrimage, purifying bath, or anything else.  

59. He who worships someone else when his guru is present, O Ambika, will  go to a frightful hell; and such worship would be useless.  

60. To hold on one's head the lotus feet of the guru is not to bear a burden.  One must act as he commands, for the guru is command (ajha).  

78. Destruction results from the anger of the guru, harm from treachery to  him, and evil death from criticism of the guru, and the greatest ill from his  displeasure.  

79. A man may survive after entering a fire, or after drinking poison, or falling  into the hands of death, but not one who has sinned against his master.  

80. Where the holy guru is criticized, one must turn away one's ear, O Ambika,  and leave that place immediately, so that no such thing can be heard. One must  then invoke the name of the guru so as to counteract what has been heard.  

81. One must love those whom the guru befriends and respect his spouse and  family. His practice must never be criticized, be it Vedic, Sastric or Agamic.  

82. The holy paduka is the [disciple's] ornament. To remember his name is  japa. To do what he commands is ritual action. To attend obediently on him  is indeed to worship the guru.  

Guru and Disciple  

51-52. Siva is all-pervading, subtle, transcending the mind, without attributes,  imperishable, space-like, unborn, infinite: how could he be worshiped, O Dear  One? This is why Siva takes on the visible form of the guru who, [when]  worshiped with devotion, grants liberation and rewards.  

53. I am Siva without any form, O Goddess, imperceptible to the human  senses. This is why the virtuous disciples can worship [Me] in the form of the  guru.  

54. The guru is the the supreme Siva himself, manifestly perceptible as en closed in human skin. Remaining thus concealed, he bestows grace (anugraha)  on the good disciple. 

50 ANDRE PADOU X  

55-56. It is to protect and help his devotees that Siva, though formless, takes  on form and, full of compassion, appears in this world as if he were part of the  cosmic flow (samsara). Concealing his third eye, the crescent moon [on his  head], his energies, and two of his arms, he appears on this earth in the form  of the guru.  

57. Siva without his three eyes, Visnu without his four arms, Brahma without  his four faces, such indeed is what is called a guru, O Dear One!  

60-61. The guru is none other than the Eternal Siva. This is the truth. No  doubt about it. The guru is Siva himself . Who, otherwise, would bestow lib eration as well as other rewards? There is no difference, O Parvati, between  the guru and the god Sadasiva. He who distinguishes between them is sinful.  

99. Difficult to find is the guru who, when pleased, immediately affords the  treasure of liberation, thus saving from the cosmic flow.  

104. Many are the gurus who shine [feebly] like lamps in a house. Difficult to  obtain is the guru who, like the sun, illuminates everything.  

105. Many are the gurus well versed in the Veda, the Sastras, and so forth.  Difficult to find is the guru who has mastered the supreme Truth (paratattva).  

107. Many are the gurus who know bad mantras and medicinal herbs, but a  guru who knows the mantras given in the Tantric and Vedic traditions (aga manigama) and in the Sastras is difficult to find on this earth.  

108. Many are the gurus who despoil their disciples of their wealth. Difficult  to find, O Goddess, is the guru who destroys the sufferings of the disciple.  

109. Many on earth are [the gurus] who follow the rules of caste and stage of  life (varnasramadharma) and who know the kula practice (kulacara), but the  guru whose mind is free of all discursive thought is not easy to find.  

110. A guru is one whose mere contact brings about supreme bliss. Such a  guru the wise man choses, not another one. Verily, by the mere sight of him  one gains liberation.  

114. As blades of grass are blown away by a great wind, so the sins of the  disciple are destroyed by the gaze of the guru.  

115. As a lighted fire burns away all fuel, moist or dry, so by the compassion  of the guru are all sins destroyed.  

116. As darkness is dispelled at the sight of a lamp, so the mere sight of the  perfect master (sadguru) destroys ignorance.  

117. He who has all the proper characteristics, who knows all the precepts of  the Veda and the Sastras as well as the rules governing the ways [to liberation]  (upaya), he indeed is a guru. 

T HE TANTRI C GUR U 51  

121. Even [a guru] who does not have all the [proper] qualities is still a guru  [if he] knows the supreme Truth, for only one who knows the Truth is liberated  and can liberate [others].  

After having enumerated different kinds of gurus, the chapter ends as follows:  

129. Though gurus are numerous, only one who performs the full consecra tion (purnabhiseka) is to be worshiped. No doubt about it!  

130-32. Having found a holy guru endowed with all the proper qualities, one  who destroys all doubts and bestows knowledge, O Goddess, one should not  stay with another one. If, however, one happens to have a guru who has no  real knowledge and who causes doubts, no harm would be incurred by leaving  him. Indeed, as the bee eager for honey flies from flower to flower, so the  disciple eager for knowledge goes from master to master.  

133. Thus have I told you briefly the qualities of the guru and of the disciple,  O Mistress of the Kula. What else do you wish to hear? 

### 02 King Kunji's Banquet  

Matthew I. Kapstein  

The traditions concerning the Indian Tantric adepts known as the Siddhas ("per fected ones") have long fascinated scholars of the Tantric religions. This reflects  the great popularity of these traditions in the arts and literature of India, Nepal,  and Tibet, and the fact that several of the living Tantric communities, both Saivite  

and Buddhist, trace themselves back to the inspiration of the Siddhas.  Although some of the Siddhas were no doubt purely mythical personages, many  were famed teachers and adepts who lived in India during the last centuries of  the first millennium C.E. and the first centuries of the second. The tales concerning  the lives of all of them, however, are entwined in sacred legend, so that in most  cases it is very difficult to arrive at precise historical conclusions about these  figures. Several traditions speak of a collective grouping of eighty-four Mahasid dhas ("Great Siddhas"), and though the precise enumeration of the eighty-four  differs somewhat from one lineage to another, a Buddhist version of the Lives of  the Eighty-four Mahasiddhas, as compiled by the Indian adept Abhayadatta and  preserved in a Tibetan translation done close to the year 1100, has become the  most widely known source for the legendary accounts of their lives.  The Lives is itself only one part of a larger collection of Buddhist literature  relating to the Mahasiddhas that was introduced into Tibet during the same pe riod. Also important is a short verse collection, the Anthology of the Essential Re alizations of the Eighty-four Siddhas, compiled initially by an Indian teacher named  Viraprabha. This work parallels the Lives and has an extensive commentary re cording the oral commentary of Abhayadatta upon it. The three works just men tioned, however, do not yet constitute the totality of the collection. Unnoticed by  scholars so far is a peculiar text called the Garland of Gems, translated for the first  time below, which is also accompanied by a commentary attributed to the col laboration of Abhayadatta and his Tangut disciple Mondrup Sherap (Smon-grub shes-rab). This work, like the commentary on the anthology of songs, was cer tainly written in Tibetan, possibly on the basis of the Indian master Abhayadatta's  instructions, but it is not the direct translation of an Indian text. 

KIN G KUNJI' S BANQUE T 53  

The Garland of Gems presents itself as a summary of the systems of Tantric  yoga and meditation taught by the eighty-four Siddhas, though the commentary  in fact only mentions some of the eighty-four by name. According to the legend  of its origin, the Garland of Gems was first taught on behalf of a yaksini, a type of  female spirit who in this case is said to have haunted a cremation ground. The  efficacy of its teachings is accentuated by this tale, for it is claimed that by prac 

ticing them a tormented, inhuman creature achieved in the end a state of physical  and psychic well-being. The text was first promulgated among ordinary human  beings after the strange banquet hosted by a certain King Kunji, as recounted in  the first extract translated below. The actual content of the Garland of Gems is  consistent with later Tibetan Tantric accounts of the teaching of the Mahasiddhas,  and accordingly emphasizes instructions concerning the ultimate nature of mind,  often referred to elsewhere as the "Great Seal" (mahamudra), and the major tech 

niques of Buddhist Tantric yoga called the "six doctrines": the Inner Heat, or Wild  Woman, whereby one masters the subtle physical energies of the body; Appari tion, through which the illusion-like nature of ordinary experience becomes  known; Dream, in which one achieves the ability to explore consciously and to  transform the dream experience; Radiant Light, referring to the luminous dimen sion of the mind; Transference, the means to cause one's consciousness to leave  the body abruptly at the moment of death, and to seek rebirth in a pure realm;  and the Liminal Passage (bardo in Tibetan), which here refers primarily to the  state of consciousness in the course of migration between death and rebirth. The  first four enable one to attain enlightenment swiftly during this very lifetime, the  last two to achieve it at death.  

The most widely known part of the Buddhist Siddha literature, however, has  been Abhayadatta's Lives, which consists of an exotic collection of stories, not  exactly fairy tales, speaking of strange and eccentric saints. As an example, we  may summarize the first episode, which recounts the life of Luipa, the "eater of  fish guts." In this case, as in many others, the "name" of the Siddha is actually a  sobriquet, referring to an outstanding characteristic or, as in the case of Tantipa,  the weaver, the Siddha's occupation. "Pa," which is affixed to the names of many  of the Siddhas, is ultimately derived from the Sanskrit word for "foot" (pada) and  in this context means "venerable," that is, one whose feet are worthy of veneration.  

Luipa, it is said, was a Sri Lankan prince, and the reluctant heir to his father's  throne. After several failed efforts to flee the palace he succeeded at last, and  became a wandering ascetic in India. By chance one day, while begging, he en countered a prostitute who was in fact a dakim, a woman embodying enlightened  wisdom, and she, being clairvoyant, detected that despite his outward saintly  deportment, there was still a smidgen of pride in his heart. She poured some vile  slop into his begging bowl and he, disgusted, threw it out. At this the dakini  exclaimed, "how are you ever going to get enlightened, if you're still such a picky  eater?" Luipa, recognizing that indeed he was covertly preoccupied with mundane  judgments, resolved to uproot the last of his attachments, and dwelling near a  fishermen's settlement on the banks of the Ganges, he practiced austerities for 

54 MATTHE W T . KAPSTEI N  

twelve years while living on the entrails and other refuse discarded after the catch.  So it was that he eventually freed himself from all mundane patterns of thought,  and was able to transmute even the foulest matter into the deathless nectar of  gnosis.  

As we have seen above, the collection of which the Lives is one part also includes  various songs and teachings attributed to the Siddhas. The relationship, in any  given case, between a Siddha's life, song, and teaching is not always straightfor ward, but the verses attributed to Luipa do seem to correlate with his story, and  so may be taken to exemplify those cases in which such a correspondence is to  be found. At the beginning of Viraprabha's anthology he sings:  

When honey's smeared on the snout of a wild, mad dog,  

it eats whatever it meets.  

Likewise, when the guru bestows precepts on a luckless fool,  

his spirit is scorched.  

But the fortunate, who realize the unborn in whatever appears  

thereby destroy common thought.  

They become like mad battle elephants, swords tied to their trunks,  demolishing enemy legions.  

And the particular teaching attributed to Luipa in the The Garland of Gems,  translated below, is called the "the instruction that applies to all appearances you  meet." All of this seems to fit neatly together with the tale of his overcoming his  finicky tastes by adopting a diet of rubbish.  

Much of the modern scholarship concerning the lives of the Siddhas has fo cused either upon the quasi-historical dimensions of these traditions or upon  allegorical readings of them. Both approaches, to be sure, were in some sense  sanctioned by the traditional Buddhist schools in which the collection was known.  One author has gone so far as to tabulate a "lineage tree," arranging the eighty four Siddhas into a single complex geneology. This tendency to historicization  continues to inform Western interpretation, despite the observation, clearly artic ulated a half century ago by Shashibhushan Dasgupta, that eighty-four is a mys tical number and that the grouping of eighty-four Siddhas is "complete" only in  the sense that it fills out this mystical number. Accordingly, in Dasgupta's words,  there is justifiable "doubt about the historical nature of the tradition of the eighty four Siddhas." Dasgupta also provided a long and suggestive list of classifications  that use the number eighty-four in Indian religious traditions; I add here only  that, from a numerological point of view, the number eighty-four has the inter esting property of being the product of the sum and the product of three and  four:  

(3 + 4) X (3 X 4) = 84  

Thus, symbolically it encompasses the range of possible relationships obtaining  among the innumerable magical and natural categories involving threes and fours. 

KING KUNJI'S BANQUET 55  

That the number eighty-four is entirely arbitrary from a historical perspective is  further underscored when the various traditional lists of Mahasiddhas are com pared, even if we restrict ourselves to the lists found within only the Buddhist  

tradition; for there are a great many significant discrepancies among them.  If the tales and traditions of the Siddhas are to be regarded not as historical  but as constituting a mythic collection, then just what is this a myth of? Despite  the tendency to incorporate the traditions of the Siddhas into those sanctioned  by the mainstream monastic orders of Tibetan Buddhism, it is clear that margin ality and idiosyncracy are powerful themes; this, indeed, accounts for the appeal  these tales have had in the contemporary Western religious counterculture. The  quasi-canonical status of the tradition, the often enigmatic language of its poetry,  the eccentricities of the iconography associated with it, its apparently strong con nections with other medieval Indian religious traditions that arose outside the  bounds of high-status society, and similarly with such Tibetan Buddhist traditions  as the Kagyu (Bka'-brgyud) yogic lineages - all of this seems to reinforce the view  that this is a myth of freedom from convention, of the rejection of rigid norms.  But this interpretation is clearly simplistic, for the force of tradition has been to  normalize the apparently rebellious Siddhas, and to incorporate them and their  teachings within a program of well-ordered religious discipline. The tale of King  Kunji's banquet seems to underwrite just such a perspective, by freezing the  Siddhas in the form of statues worshiped by a royal patron. Perhaps we can speak,  then, of the institutionalization of idiosyncracy through the cooperation of myth  and normative practice. In other words, in the case of the Siddhas, a myth of  idiosyncratic freedom undergirds an enduring ethos of order.  

The Tibetan texts translated below are found in the great nineteenth-century  encyclopedia of Tibetan esoterica: 'Jam mgon Kong sprul Blo gros mtha' yas,  Gdams ngag mdzod: A Treasury of Instructions and Techniques for Spiritual Realization  (Delhi: N. Lungtok and N. Gyaltsan, 1971), vol. 11, pp. 9-11 ("King Kunji's  Banquet) and 92-143 ("The Garland of Gems"). Because the cryptic style of the  original does not lend itself to literal English translation, I provide a rather free  rendition of the verse text of the Garland of Gems. In the case of the commentary  accompanying the verses, I supply here an abridged restatement of the Tibetan  original, supplemented by my own occasional remarks intended to clarify the  meaning of the verses. For further clarification of the text as a whole, I have added  a topical outline.

King Kunji's Banquet  

In the western part of India, in Kantamara, a district in Saurastra [modern  Gujarat], the religious king Kunji governed his realm righteously. At some  point his mother took ill and was fast approaching death. The king lovingly  asked her, "Now it seems you will not live for long, Ma. For your benefit in  future lives, I will do whatever you command and will offer donations for the  worship of the community of monks, the brahmans, and the temples, and for  charity and so forth."  

His mother replied, "You needn't bother with the other virtues on my behalf.  Just host a Tantric banquet for the eighty-four yogins and yoginis who have

become Siddhas, and pray to them for my sake!" With these last words, she  died.  

The king then thought, "Those past Siddhas are no longer seen among men,  so how can I invite them? But I cannot violate mother's dying wish. Because  the Mahasiddhas are compassionate, all I can think to do is to pray." He prayed  one-pointedly, and the two gnostic dakinis, Kokali and Dharmavisva ["Dha 

madhuma" in the Garland of Gems], became visibly manifest and said, "We two  will help you! Let's invite the Siddhas and prepare a banquet hall!" The king  arranged a great hall for the Tantric feast, while the two dakinis, through their  miraculous abilities, journeyed to the various sacred lands in an instant to  invite the Siddhas. Luipa was the first to arrive, and the other Siddhas also  arrived momentarily, in their appointed order, and took their seats. The king  generously served up the delights of the banquet, and they remained assembled  in the Tantric feast for a long time. In the end, although the king asked the  Siddhas to remain for a while so that he could continue to worship them, they  would not permit this. Instead, each Siddha sang for the king one of his or her  own vajra-songs, called dohas, and then vanished into the unknown. The king  constructed images to represent each of the Siddhas, before which each one's  song was written, and there he worshiped them.  

At the same time, a scholar named Viraprabha, who was traveling far away  to the east, heard that the eighty-four Siddhas had actually come to be wor shiped by King Kunji, and he made haste to come there, but arrived a week  after the Siddhas had left. He grew disconsolate and prayed fervently for seven 

58 MATTHE W T. KAPSTEI N  

days, whereupon the two dakinis visibly appeared, and transmitted to him the  Garland of Gems, the very songs that had been sung at the royal feast, and other  teachings, together with the tales of the eighty-four. He meditated upon their  significance and thereby gained special realization, becoming himself a lord  among Siddhas. He also authored a book in which the various dohas were  collected together, and later he transmitted these teachings to the brahman  scholar Kamala. The latter taught them to the Siddha and hermit Jamari, and  he to the scholar from Magadha, Abhayadatta, who composed the collection  of the tales of the eighty-four Siddhas and the commentary on the dohas. All  of texts mentioned above were brought together and translated here in Tibet  by that same scholar and his disciple, the Tangut translator Mondrup Sherap.  

The Garland of Gems  

In the Indian Language: Ratnamala [-noma]  

In the Tibetan Language: Rin chen phreng ba zhes bya ba  

According to Tibetan custom, in order for future generations to recall the efforts  of past translators and scholars, the title must be given in both Sanskrit and  Tibetan. In this case, it is explained that because each of the teachings of the  Siddhas has many precious facets, they are like gems (ratnas), and because many  such teachings are strung together here, they form a garland (mala).  

Salutations to the Transcendent Lord of Speech [the bodhisattva Manjusri]

Manjusri, the bodhisattva of wisdom, is invoked before the beginning of the  verse text in order to remove obstacles to the understanding of the text as a whole.  

Introductory Verses  

1. Your black hair is piled in a topknot,  

Your eyes deep blue like the blue lotus  

Your body is convulsed in your terrible roar - 

To you, Acala, I bow in homage.  

Acala is one of the foremost divinities of Tantric Buddhism, and is depicted in  many forms, usually ferocious or wrathful, and wielding a sword. In later Buddhist  Tantrism he became particularly popular in Nepal and in Japan, where he is often  seen as a temple protector and is called Fudo.  

2. I will not set down here all that was seen and heard  

At the assembly of eighty-four Siddhas  

In the heaven of manifest delight, 

KIN G KUNJI' S BANQUE T 5 9  

That then was well practiced by Dhamadhuma;  

But I shall explain the Garland of Gems  

That was given as an instruction to the yaksini.  

Because those fortunate enough to encounter or even hear of the assembly of  the Siddhas become delighted by it, that assembly is known as the "heaven of  manifest delight." The dakini Dhamadhuma thoroughly mastered a great many  teachings that the Siddhas bestowed there, but here only the Garland of Gems,  which was taught on behalf of a yaksini, will be discussed. What, then, is the  story of that teaching?  

Once upon a time, in the cremation ground called Sama Grove (sa-ma'i tshal),  there lived a yaksini who was condemned by her own misdeeds to dwell there  feeding on carrion. In the northeastern quarter of the cremation ground there was  a great hollow tree, inhabited by a family of seven bears. A huge rhinocerous 

demon went to sleep there and fell over, crushing the tree and killing its inhab itants. At that point the yaksini arrived, killed the rhinocerous-demon, and found  the flesh of the dead brood of bears. An ogre, however, was attracted by the odor  of flesh and blood, and seeing that the yaksini had reached the feast first, became  greatly enraged at her. Flying above, he poured molten copper upon her, so that  she was horribly burned and suffered terribly. This was karmic retribution for the  suffering she herself had caused other beings during her previous lives. Two  dakinis, named Kokila and Dharmadevi [the "Dhamadhuma" mentioned above],  took pity upon her and healed her wounds with mantras, except for one place  where she had been burned right through to the bone. However, the two were  the disciples of the eighty-four Mahasiddhas, who at that very time were gathered  together in the pure land of manifest delight, where they recognized the yaksini  to be receptive to the Buddha's teaching. They therefore composed a short text,  the Garland of Gems, epitomizing their own religious instructions, and transmitted  it to the two dakinis, who in turn taught it to the yaksini. [In the commentary,  however, the text is presented as a teaching given in direct dialogue with the  yaksini.] By the power of this teaching she finally came to be fully healed in both  body and spirit, and went on to become a great dakini in her own right, named  Sumati.  

Luipa's Teaching: "The Instruction That Applies  

to All Appearances"  

The foregoing remarks serve as an introduction. The actual teaching of the Garland  of Gems begins with an instruction of Luipa, "The Instruction That Applies to All  Appearances You Meet," which was delivered to benefit the ailing yaksini.  When she requested this teaching, he said to her,  

"Your fault is not knowing your own nature. If you know that, you'll be freed  from appearances, not to speak of bodily appearances alone." 

60 MATTHE W T. KAPSTEI N  

"What's it to know your own nature?"  

"It is a luminous gnosis, in which the continuum of mundane reality comes to  an end."  

When she replied that she still didn't get the point, he said:  

3. In what is insubstantial and incessant,  

Without boundary or center, and thus pervasive,  

The fact of the matter is really profound,  

Like the fire of Malaya Mountain.  

Here "insubstantial" means that in the nature of things there is no substantial  being. For instance, though one may speak of a "sky-flower," nevertheless, no  such thing really exists, above and beyond the naming of it. Therefore, neither it,  nor its supposed attributes, such as color and form, can be said to exist substan 

tially. It is when the entire continuum of the attributions of existence, appearance,  emptiness, idea, mind, and thought comes to an end that we speak of "luminous  gnosis." Like the radiance of a precious gem, it is "incessant," and for this reason  is characterized as "without boundary or center, and thus pervasive." Like un 

compounded space, it embraces everything, from the highest heavens to the  depths of hell. And because the yaksini has the potential to realize her pain, her  mental activity, and her apprehension of appearances to be in fact that luminous  gnosis, "the fact of the matter is really profound." It is "like the fire of Malaya  Mountain" that incinerates all it encounters.  

The yaksini, however, did not understand this, and so asked the Siddha Lilapa  for clarification. He responded:  

4. You are as one born from the ocean of things,  

Longing to rest in the mire of things;  

But what is experienced in the absence  

Of the bee, nectar and flower?  

The second couplet refers to the conditions for realization. Just as a sweet taste  occurs when a flower, its nectar, and a bee come together, but not so long as they  remain apart, so too, so long as you have not yet realized gnosis and remain  clinging to bodily apprehensions, unable to detach yourself from objects, you will  not experience the blissful taste of your inherent nature. And until you experience  that taste, you will not be free of your pain.  

The Siddha Kokala then taught her how that understanding becomes firm:  

5. Like Brahma to the external world and its inner inhabitants,  Like timely warmth and yogurt culture,  

And like oil in mustard seed,  

If you really realize it, you'll be certain of it.  

Just as the creator-god Brahma knows the entire universe and all its inhabitants,  similarly the luminous gnosis, which is the nature of mind as taught by the guru,  pervades all that you may know. But once it is known, how is that knowledge to 

KING KUNJI' S BANQUE T 61  

grow firm? This is explained by the three examples that follow. "Timely warmth"  refers to the warmth that occurs in the spring, which spreads throughout the  natural world; so too, the individual who knows the radiant light of mind finds  that it spreads through the range of experience. And just as a small amount of  "yogurt culture" completely transforms a large quantity of milk, without ever  getting rid of the milk, in the same way radiant light transforms mundane con 

ceptual activity, without actually abandoning it. Similarly, as oil is present in a  "mustard seed," and only needs to be brought out, but not newly created, you  come to realize that the mind in its natural state is pervaded by its radiant light.  

But what is the fruit of such realization? To answer this question, the Siddha  Camaripa was the next to speak:  

6ab. In that which is inevident, invisible, and clear,  

That space itself is revealed.  

This refers to the body of reality, the dharmakaya, which is like space, and so  "inevident, invisible, and clear." Thus, it is not to be thought of as an entity or a  nonentity, or as intellect, mind, or thought. But just as space, though not itself  shaped or colored, provides a clearing in which sun, moon, and stars, as well as  clouds, mists, rainbows, and more become manifest, so too in the invisible space  of the dharmakaya, there is an incessant outpouring of compassion, taking form  as the Buddha's bodies of rapture and emanation.  

To this Saraha added these verses:  

6cd. The body apprehended by no one is most beautiful,  

Like a treasure-vase, a wishing gem, or a jewel.  

It is in fact the nature of mind, free from the conceptions of apprehended object  and apprehending subject, that is here described as "most beautiful."  

Virupa's Teaching: "The Empty City"  

Then master Virupa sang of an instruction entitled "The Empty City":  

7. As for the city that is entirely empty,  

Ask your self: who is the creator  

Of body and speech in the three realms, the three spheres?  The self-nature of the self is nothing;  

It rests within no bounds whatsoever.  

The "city" refers outwardly to the three realms, or three spheres of the world,  and inwardly to the three spheres of body, speech, and mind, as well as to past,  present, and future. As all of this depends upon a concatenation of causes, and  does not exist independently, the entire city, whatever we conceive it to be, is  empty. To establish this, review its possible causes in turn, and ask your self who  its creator might be. You must ask your self, for you must also examine the reality 

62 MATTHE W T . KAPSTEI N  

of that self: it, too, is empty, devoid of self-nature. Perhaps you will conclude that  all there is is emptiness, but that is not so. In the final analysis, one can speak  neither of emptiness, nor nonemptiness, nor both, nor neither - "it rests within  no bounds whatsoever."  

To affirm the meaning of this, Dombipa sang:  

8. In the city that is emptied of everything  

Where is any substantially existing thing?  

This may be understood without further comment. Goraksa added:  

9. In the city of appearance, sound, and thought,  

Owing to apprehended objects, or to the apprehending of them,  The unhappy silkworm is ensnared in its own saliva.  

You'll find happiness when, without apprehending, you let go.  

The appearances and sounds of the world are imputed through conceptual  activity - in truth, nothing goes beyond conceptual activity, so that this is a "city  of thought." As you bind yourself therein, it may be exemplified by a silkworm,  wrapping itself up in its own saliva. But if you let go, and abide in the natural  condition of reality, you'll find happiness. Tantipa then said:  

10. Without renunciation, without possession,  

If you come to know, you'll not enter the city.  

But like Nanda and the gemstone light,  

You'll find the city to be supreme bliss.  

When you have abandoned both acceptance and rejection, and become free of  bewilderment, you no longer enter the city of bewilderment, but neither do you  hold to not entering it as if that were a hard fact. Instead, bewilderment itself  discloses the nature of reality, so that it becomes the city of supreme bliss. Then,  like Nanda, the king of the serpents (nagas), who perceives the wish-granting gem  that is invisible to all others, you will see that the city of thought is the city of  bliss.  

Saraha's Teaching: "Remembrance Alone"  

Following Virupa's instruction on the blissful city, Saraha again sang to the yaks ini":  

11. When someone speaks of any phenomenon,  

That speech is an act of remembrance.  

So is it not also the faculty of remembrance  

That speaks even of nirvana?  

This is the teaching of the great brahman Saraha's "Instruction on Remem brance Alone": all acts of speech are bound up in remembrance. This is the case 

KING KUNJI' S BANQUE T 63  

whether one speaks of samsara or nirvana, tranquillity or insight, meditative equi poise or what follows after meditation, appearance or emptiness, and so on. But  what follows from that?  

12. Whatever appears - earth, water, fire, or wind - 

Simultaneously occurs within emptiness.  

The splendid appearance of gnosis  

Occurs in remembrance alone.  

Although all those phenomena are bound up in remembrance, at the moment  of their appearance they are simultaneously innately empty. Thus, all appearance  is the appearance of the gnosis of emptiness. In this way, there is no independent  phenomenon of remembrance, but it is, rather, indivisible from the appearance  of gnosis. Being indivisible, they are one: this is what is meant by "remembrance  alone."  

The Siddha Sabari then sang:  

13. If you do not know the conjunction of sun and moon,  Things are as many as waves in the sea.  

When just that which is unique occurs,  

It is not possible to find division here.  

Here, the sun symbolizes appearance, or method, and the moon emptiness, or  discernment. If you do not understand the conjunction of these, things appear as  multiplicity, like waves in the sea: despite the underlying union, conceptual acts  of remembrance become manifold. But when the essential nature of remembrance,  which is unique, and no different from the natural state, occurs, then "it is not  possible to find division here."  

To this Caurahgi added:  

14. There is not even a particle of fault here.  

It does not arise through composition.  

That is to say that the natural state of reality is entirely free from all independent  acts of remembrance, which are bound up with conceptual activity. The realiza tion of "remembrance alone" is not a conditioned phenomenon, dependent upon  causal composition.  

Then Vinapa, too, sang:  

15. The mountain of conceptual thought  

Sinks into the sea of nonconceptualization.  

As the subject is an appearance in the sphere of reality,  

Where can there be objective conceptualizations?  

The remembrance of reality becomes like a vast ocean, into which all indepen dent acts of remembrance dissolve. When The appearance of the subject is known  to be just reality, there is no conceptualization of objects as real entities.

Minapa's Teaching: "Elemental Food and Clothing"  

Following Saraha's instruction, master Minapa conferred an instruction on feeding  and clothing oneself with the elements:  

16. The bodily vessel becomes elemental light,  

A melting stream of divine ambrosia above.  

In the mass of reality's light,  

Conceptions of the six aggregates are exhausted.  

Primarily, this refers to the creative visualization of the deity. At the start of  such meditation, the bodily mansion becomes like a vase, filled with the light of  the elements: from the seed-syallable yam comes fire-wind, like a solar orb, red  in color and half a mile in diameter. Owing to its agitation there appears the red  ram, from which fire radiates to the extent of the wind. From this steam and mist  arise, red in color: this is the fire-water, but it is contemplated as being of the  nature of light. From its condensation there appears the yellow syllable su, from  which is projected fire-earth, to the same extent as those mentioned above.  

Atop that mansion of elemental light, you then contemplate a white hum which  is in its nature a divinity embodying the essence of mind, radiating light, and  from which there is a melting stream of ambrosia. It dissolves into the elements,  intermingling thus with the bodily vase. Mind itself, in essence a divinity, of the  nature of the elements, now dissolves into light, having emanated in the form of  a hum. Present as the mass of reality in the vase of light, it is like the self-luminous  orb of the sun - concentrate upon this. The conceptual activity of the sensory  fields reaches cessation herein, and if you examine the senses themselves, they  are realized to be like lamps within a vase of light. The sign of contemplative  success is an experience of outer warmth, and in this way one is clothed by the  elements, while inner awareness is nourished by this contemplation, so that one  is thus fed.  

The yaksini, however, was unable to achieve this contemplation of elemental  food and clothing, at which point the exalted Nagarjuna sang to her:  

17. The varied conceptions of the six classes of beings  

Have arisen through the accumulated power of errant desire.  Through the power of knowledge which turns that around  You awaken as Buddha, so that all desires are fulfilled.  

The beings who inhabit the three realms of the world may be embodied in any  way whatsoever, according to the diversity of their conceptual activity, and  through the accumulated power of their perverse desires and thirsts. Thus, the  yaksini experienced her body and its pains as she did, but this would certainly  be changed to bliss if she had the power to realize the nature of mind to be a  mass of light, a solar orb.  

To this master Santipa added his instruction on the "six views, outer and inner,  which turn ephemeral cognitions around": 

KING KUNJI' S BANQUE T 6 5  

18. The appearance of objective conditions is ceaseless,  

Just like bubbles in water.  

This is reversed by the antidote that follows meditation,  

That is just like a staff in the water.  

Sensory objects belonging to the six fields of sight, sound, taste, odor, bodily  feeling, and thought arise incessantly. These ephemeral objects continue to arise,  like bubbles in water, and so long as ephemeral appearances thus continue to  arise they won't be stopped by the mounted spear-bearing cavalry of ephemeral  cognitions (which, however forceful and impressive, have no power to stop them).  Such is the view of the six outer objects.  

To grasp the six objects, however, as independently existing things is an er roneous view, which is reversed by a cognition following meditation, which rec ognizes ephemeral occurrences to be of the nature of reality. That cognition,  which cuts through all sensations, is like a staff that passes through water. This  antidote, indeed, becomes gnosis, and is referred to as the "inner six views" (for  it applies to the same six fields of experience and cognition mentioned above).  

In the first instance, the ephemeral states are afflictions that should be re nounced. Then they are renounced by gnosis, the antidote following meditation,  which moves like a knife through the water. Finally, owing to that, what is to be  renounced and its renunciation are realized to be no different - there is gnosis  alone, known here as the "inner six views."  

The Teaching of the Two Dakinis  

After that, the two dakinis encouraged the yaksini to seek the attainments of the  Tantric divinities through five practices which they asked the Siddhas to impart  to her: master Khagarbha's abbreviated rites of Lord Acala; Kanaripa's rites of the  Mother of Wisdom; Dombipa's rites which combine the tantric divinities Cakra 

samvara and Hevajra; Caloka's rites of Amitayus, the buddha of longevity; and  Naropa's instructions on the hundred-syllable mantra of purification and repen tance. The yaksini practiced these instructions, but desired quick results and so  seized on object and subject as real. When the longed-for attainments were not,  therefore, forthcoming, she complained that there were no such attainments to  be realized, that the divinities were nonexistent, and that to persist in reciting  mantras really pissed her off.  

The two dakinis replied, "All those who have gone before have realized the  attainments. If you have not, it's only because you've failed to purify your own  continuum of being."  

"I still don't understand what this 'continuum of being' business is about."  To explain it, they said:  

19. That which possesses the seed of beauteous youth  

Abides pervading all beings.66 MATTHE W T. KAPSTEI N  

This is grasped where the best faculties appear,  

In the appearance of a unique act of gnosis.  

20. This is the shifting shape of clouds in the sky,  

The reflection appearing in a mirror.  

When you examine this, just so,  

No purpose is gained by the appearance of obscuration.  

It is enjoyed through the power of secrets.  

These two verses teach two topics, called "the little nail of the creative visual ization of the deity" and "the methodical precept of symbolic significance." Con cerning the first, "beauteous youth" characterizes the visualized deity whose body  is not of the coarse elements and is therefore free from the aging process. Because  there are no flaws owing to false imputations, the deity is beautiful. "That which  possesses its seed" is that which resembles it, has the potential to engender it,  that is to say, all beings of the six classes, who are thus pervaded by it, without  regard to class or status. Those of "best faculties," in this context, are those who  recognize the various forms of the deities to be the magical projection of mind,  the unique appearance of gnosis, but not an independently existing god. The  deity, pictured in the mind, is the body of rapture, whereas the unfabricated mind  itself is the body of reality. The two bodies of rapture and emanation, appearances  of that single gnosis, may appear as anything, ceaselessly. If you know this, the  creative visualization of the deity is mastered.  

Verse 20 then treats the second topic, "the methodical precept of symbolic  significance." Here, the sky and the mirror are symbols for the body of reality,  while clouds and reflections are indicative of the bodies of rapture and emanation.  Obscuration, or ignorance, serves no purpose with respect to the appearance of  these two bodies of the Buddha. To dispel such obscuration, the individual who  is cultivating the path must adhere to the appropriate Tantric vows, and thus the  result may be "enjoyed through the power of secrets."  

The Teachings of Tilopa  

The foregoing teachings hammer home the little nail of the creative visualization  of the deity, so that now the essential instructions, the little nail of the subtle  channels and vital energies, may be taught. The dakinis gave many instructions  on the channels and energies to the yaksini, but however much she practiced,  though her past pain was at once relieved, she became disturbed because she  could not achieve bliss. She then turned to Tilopa for further instruction.  

On the Vital Energies  

Tilopa's first teaching to her was this:  

21. The seal which clarifies gnosis 

KING KUNJl' S BANQUE T 67  

Is solely impressed on the vital points of the body.  

That apparitional machine  

Develops the force of the faculties.  

In respect to the clarification of gnosis, these paths are taught in the way of  secret mantras: there is the path which transforms the ground, so that by realizing  conceptual activity to be of the nature of gods and goddesses, the modalites of  gnosis are clarified in visualization practice; and there is the path of passion, which  is dissimilar in that it relies upon the seals, or vital points, of the body, and so  focuses upon the realization of the body's subtle channels and vital energies. Then  there is the path of liberation, which determines gnosis to be mere apparition,  and the great path of liberation, which determines that gnosis itself is not and  that this is no further gnosis, and that there are no afflictions or conceptualizations  and that this too is no further gnosis - it is like a flower in space.  

Now, then, what is "the seal which clarifies gnosis"? In this verse, this refers to  the Wild Woman, the inner heat that rises below the navel, relying upon which  the significance of gnosis comes clear. In cultivating it through exercises that make  use of the body's channels and energies, the body becomes like an apparitional  mechanism, developing the force of the sensory faculties. Tilopa added this  example:  

22. Like a banana tree,  

But with flesh, bone and marrow,  

Its growth is generated  

Just so by the channels and winds.  

Just as a banana tree, depending upon the growth of its roots, trunk, and so  on, finally produces its fruit, so in this case, it is the channels and energies within  a body of flesh and bone that give rise to the appearance of gnosis, the triple body  of enlightenment. Because that is the goal of the instruction on the body's vital  channels and energies, Tilopa then conferred his precepts on the ultimate view  and meditation upon it.  

On the Ultimate View  

He sang:  

23. In that which is causeless and without result,  

All is clearly revealed.  

There is no example, no designation.  

In what is without separation, what clarification is needed?  It is not generated by errancy or detour;  

Not straying, it is opposed to unmoving passivity.  

Natural, luminous gnosis is the final significance of the view. It is the skylike  body of reality, which is not engendered by any cause, and is therefore without  any result. Nevertheless, though not a causally compounded result, in its cease-

68 MATTHE W T . KAPSTEI N  

lessness the two resultant bodies of rapture and emanation are "clearly revealed."  And in its essential nature, the skylike radiant light of mind can neither be ex emplified nor designated.  

So, then, can no experience be cultivated of it?  

There is an experienceless cultivation of experience, meditationless meditation,  incessant absorption, a result that is never to be attained, but from which one is  never separated. Hence, "in what is without separation, what clarification is  needed"? It does not drift off in errancy, or wander into any detour, or stray into  apathy, or remain fixed should you seek to freeze it in immobility.  

On Integrating Radiant Light with the Apparitional Body  

The foregoing teaches the ultimate view of luminous gnosis. Its meditative cul tivation, so that its realization becomes inseparable, is taught in the remainder of  the text. Here, the view is that mind is radiant light, body is apparition, their  connection is revealed in dream and in the liminal passage from death to rebirth,  and the samadhi taught here is the transference of consciousness and the "pen etration of the city." The following verses emphasize these teachings, discussing  them in relation to five topics: liminal states, types of embodiment, potential  disclosure, intermingling of the teachings, and their relevant connections. The  first concerns the realization of radiant light during the liminal state between birth  and death, that is to say, during this lifetime.  

24. During the liminal passage from birth until death,  

With respect to conceptions of the body of karmic maturation,  Desire is purified in luminousness - 

This is the amazing instruction of the guru.  

The liminal passage from birth to death is the period during which all sorts of  conceptions become concretely manifest, so that one is embodied in the "body  of karmic maturation." But conceptual activity may be disclosed as luminous in  nature, and this luminosity in turn may be intermingled with the emotions and  passions, purifying them. How so? On the path of transformation one holds the  conceptions to be gods and goddesses, while on the path of desire one engenders  bliss while relying upon the subtle channels and fluids, and on the path of lib eration engenders bliss relying upon the Wild Woman; but here, on the path of  great liberation, one does not hanker after those sorts of bliss at all, but realizes  them to be luminous and so intermingles luminousness with passion. Owing to  what relevant connection may these teachings be realized? This is the amazing  instruction of the guru!  

On the Yogas of Dream and the Liminal Passage  

The yoga of the dream is to be mastered during this lifetime. It is summarized as  follows: 

KING KUNJI' S BANQUE T 69  

25. There are the preliminaries and the main practice:  

[The latter includes] apprehension and refinement,  

Training in apparition, until one abandons fear,  

And meditation that does not step beyond the nature of reality.  

As for the preliminaries, the individual who embarks upon this path must not  be lacking in karmic propensities, or have violated the Tantric vows, or be without  merit, or be disrespectful to the guru; otherwise, he or she will not succeed in  grasping his or her dreams. For this reason, the preliminary practices are those  of repentance and purification, such as the hundred-syllable mantra, and devotion  and worship directed to the guru and the Three Precious Jewels.  

The main practice then has four parts: "apprehension," in which you learn to  grasp your dreams, to become aware when you are dreaming; "refinement,"  whereby you learn to transform your dreams, and to travel freely within them;  "training in apparition," through which you realize the truthlessness of dreams,  and so come to abandon all fears; and, finally, knowing that dreams are the  bewildering projections of mind, you apply your guru's instruction to whatever  thoughts arise, and so cultivate "meditation that does not step beyond the nature  of reality."  

This is to be practiced during this life, and pertains to the liminal passage of  the dream, which is described in this way:  

26. In the liminal passage of the transformations of consciousness,  One is impelled by the body of latent dispositions.  

The relevant preparation is actualized dreaming,  

Wherein ignorance is dissolved in radiant light.  

One applies oneself with fervent devotion.  

Of the five topics mentioned earlier [verse 24], the liminal passage is here that  of the dream, the body is that of latent dispositions, that which is to be disclosed  is the potentiality of dreaming, which is to be intermingled primarily with the  obscuration of ignorance as its antidote, while the relevant connection is formed  through mindfulness and fervent devotion. In sleep itself one comes to realize the  luminous nature of mind, so that sleep partakes of the essence of bliss and emp 

tiness, giving rise to the experience of radiant light.  

The liminal passage between death and rebirth, then, is taught in the following  verse:  

27. When this body of karmic ripening is destroyed,  

[There remains] the mental body, with its latent dispositions,  Desire should be disclosed as radiant light,  

And attachment to parents should be abandoned.  

Here, the liminal passage is the liminal passage of the possibilities of existence;  the body is the mental body; radiant light is to be disclosed and then intermingled  with the obscuration of aversion; and the relevant connection is formed by the 

7 0 MATTHE W T . KAPSTEI N  

potential parents who are thus abodes for rebirth, for which reason "attachment  to parents should be abandoned."  

The mental body, between death and rebirth, unhampered by the physical  body, is propelled by its confused dispositions. Those who have accumulated  positive dispositions through meritorious action may nevertheless recollect the  divine, or recall the true nature of things, and so be freed from the path of evil  destinies. As in the yoga of the dream, one should not be bewildered by incessant  apparitions, but attain instead the luminous body of reality.  

The Transference of Consciousness  

The foregoing verses have summarized the yogas of the dream, the liminal pas sage, apparition, and radiant light. Tilopa's final teachings concern samadhi, the  transference of consciousness and the "penetration of the city." In order to realize  these, one must cultivate mastery of the vital energies and radiant light, as indi cated below:  

28. Time, bodily exercise, and object of concentration - 

These are the first application.  

The essential point of the Wild Woman is said to be the four vital  winds,  

And these are explained as four radiant lights.  

At appropriate times, when the vital winds circulate through the central chan nel, one adopts the vajra posture as a bodily exercise, and concentrates upon the  movement of the energies in relation to the four cakras at the crown, throat, heart  and navel. The essential teaching of the inner heat, or the Wild Woman, then  stresses the fourfold control of the breath. When proficiency in the inner heat is  achieved by day, radiant light is grasped in four ways by night: there is the natural  radiant light, which is the purity of all phenomena; the meditational radiant light,  arising in the contemplative experience of the yogin in union with his consort;  the radiant light of sleep, when coarse mental activity comes to a halt in deep  sleep; and the radiant light of death, arising when, during the liminal passage,  the bodily elements are deceased.  

29. In general, the transference of consciousness, a special form of yogic exer cise, is said to cause the consciousness of the dying individual to depart suddenly  from the body through a forced opening at the crown of the skull, and to travel  immediately to a pure land, often the Sukhavati [the "Pure" or "Happy Land"]  realm of the Buddha Amitabha, in which enlightenment can then be swiftly at tained. The "penetration of the city" is an especially high-powered version of this,  permitting one to project one's consciousness into the recently deceased corpse  of another. The yaksini to whom Tilopa taught this technique soon achieved  mastery of it, taking possession in this way of the body of the yogini Sumati.  According to Tibetan tradition, the actual technique was lost not long after it was 

KING KUNJI' S BANQUE T 71  

transmitted in Tibet during the eleventh century, and it has not been successfully  practiced since. The yoga of the transference of consciousness, however, remains  a fundamental practice of Tibetan Buddhism, and is widely practiced in connec tion with Tibetan funeral rites.  

The verses in passage 29 in which The Garland of Gems discusses these tech niques are, unfortunately, almost indecipherable and even the commentary fails  to clarify the text at this point. For this reason these verses are left untranslated  here. Perhaps one who prays earnestly to the eighty-four Siddhas will once again  encounter the two dakinis, and so come to recover this passage from the heaven  of manifest delight.  

Concluding Dedication  

30. May the full realization of the entire teaching,  

Bestowed for the sake of the yaksini,  

And well practiced by Dhamadhuma,  

Bring all creatures to the stage of perfection!  

The small text of the instructions of The Garland of Gems is now concluded. 

### 03 Interviews with a Tantric Kali Priest:  

Feeding Skulls in the Town of Sacrifice  

June McDaniel  

Skulls are widely used in Bengali folk Tantra. They empower buildings and  grounds, like the relics in early and medieval churches. They are buried in tem ples, under the altar or in a corner, and they turn the building into sacred ground.  They are also buried at the foot of sacred trees, and they make ordinary ground  into an empowered meditation seat.  

Although skulls and images of death are normally inauspicious in Hinduism,  certain skulls bring luck and fortune in meditation. Skulls give protective energy  (sakri) and support the sadhu in his efforts. They are often painted red, to show  that they are alive and auspicious, and to protect them from mold and the Bengali  weather. They are ironic images, which represent death yet encourage the spiritual  rebirth of the holy man or sadhu. Skulls are not old bones, but relics that mediate  the supernatural (alaukika) world, calling down the goddess Kali to help the  practitioner. Skulls are really not dead but alive, companions and friends of the  sadhus. They are inhabited by earth-bound entities who seek spiritual knowledge  rather than pleasure, but were never educated in this field during their lives.  

Skulls give their power, and this is the sadhu's offering: he may become guru  to the dead. He can teach them the way to the heavens, and initiate them with  empowered mantras, the keys to the kingdom. Spirits are said to cluster around  meditating sadhus, but the sadhu will only give mantras to those spirits who bring  their skulls to him. They travel through the midnight air, carrying their skulls to  offer, and the ones he accepts belong to the spirits who will be initiated. The  sadhu takes the power from the skulls. This strengthens him in his own quest for  infinite wisdom (brahmajnana), for one needs power (sakti) to hold brahmajnana.  Without enough power, the Tantric sadhu could go insane, or he may have only  glimpses of his goal but be unable to maintain the state.  

Sadhana (spiritual practice) with skulls is rarely seen today, but it is associated 

INTERVIEW S WIT H A TANTRI C PRIES T 73  

with certain locales, especially those with a background of death and sacrifice.  The town of Bolpur in Birbhum (West Bengal) was named for the large number  of sacrifices performed by one of its kings. According to the legend, centuries ago  the great king Raja Surat had a vision of the goddess Kali. She asked him to  sacrifice one hundred thousand goats to her (some versions say it was buffaloes),  and if he did this, his dreams would be fulfilled. He did indeed sacrifice these  goats, and gave the town its name (bali-pur, "town of sacrifice"). Since that time,  there has been temple worship of Kali in the town.  

There are several Kali temples in Bolpur, and one of them is on the edge of  town, near the woods, with a large cremation ground nearby. This is the Kali  Temple of the Dry Lake, a temple is dedicated to Daksina Kali, who is a benevolent  form of the goddess worshiped by householders. She is also called Bhairavi Vais 

navi, showing that she is a Tantric goddess with such Vaisnava qualities as com passion and the ability to bestow happiness. Within the temple, there is a large  statue of Daksina Kali, with black skin and a smiling face, with her two assistants,  Dakini and Yogini, flanking her. There are also statues of the Sakta Siddhas (per fected beings) Vamaksepa, Ramakrsna Paramahamsa, and his wife Sarada Ma.  

Behind the statues on the altar is a row of human skulls, painted red.  Daksina Kali is merciful to her devotees. Renouncers and sadhus worship more  powerful forms of Kali, called Smasana Kali (Goddess of the Burning Ground)  and Varna Kali (Kali of the Left Side, or Kali of the Forbidden). They offer her  meat and wine, flesh and blood, placed in a skull. At this temple, offerings of  meat and wine are made to Kali's assistants, Dakini and Yogini, but these are only  offered outside the temple.  

The priest or purohit of this temple is Tapan Goswami, whose Vaisnava name  reflects honors shown to his ancestors. He is a practicing Sakta, who worships  Kali and meditates upon her. His practice, however, includes many older ele ments.  

Tapan was born in small village about twenty kilometers from Bolpur, where  his grandfather was a respected temple priest and Tantric sadhu. He came from  a Sakta family.  

My family's goddess in the village was Uluicandi. She came from the earth, in the  form of a stone. She was found a thousand years ago. When there was no rain in the  village, my ancestors would bathe the stone in the pond, and rain would come. They  worshiped her under a neem tree, and she had a small shrine there. She was originally  a house goddess, but then her worship was opened to the village. Later my ancestors  had a statue (murti) made, and it was immersed each year, and a new statue made.  They worshiped her every day except for the [festival] time of Kali Puja, when a  pitcher (ghat) was worshiped instead.  

However, village life is primarily agricultural, and during his childhood a  drought came and brought famine. All of the crops failed. The family then moved 

74 JUNE MCDANIEL  

to Bolpur, which at that time was surrounded by forests. In those days, the temple  was not easily accessible to visitors. As Tapan states:  

I came to Bolpur when I was six years old, and my father began to work as the priest  of this temple. At the age of about ten or eleven years, I began to visit the temple at  night, secretly. I was kept from going there in the daytime. But I could get the keys  to the temple, and I went there at night, even though often I was afraid. 1 felt that  the Goddess looked with favor upon me.  

Here, we believe that on the new-moon night, people should offer incense and  candles to the Goddess. When I opened the temple door one new moon night, I  found that many types of offerings (prasad) were there. I ate them, because I was  hungry, but then I was afraid that people would be angry at me, and I thought of  not returning. But I had such a great longing to return, that I could not stay away,  and after a few days I came back again.  

He spent his childhood attracted to the Goddess but fearful of her power. One  night, when there were visitors to the temple, he saw a cake suddenly materialize,  rise in the air, and fly toward him. He took this as a sign of the Goddess's power  and her gift to him, and he became more and more curious about her.  

As he grew older, he began to visit many renunciant sadhus and sannyasis,  especially those performing Tantra sadhana. He asked them many questions about  ritual practice, and about the nature of Kali. When he was twenty-one years old,  he met a sadhu who taught him about Tantra sadhana; however, he was not  initiated. He wandered to different places in West Bengal; he studied for a while  at the Ramakrishna Ashram in Suri, then spent time in a village, then attended  Vishvabharati University in Shantiniketan. During his years at Vishvabharati, he  spent his spare time doing ritual practices to the Goddess. After he graduated, he  worked in Dubrajpur, but the job did not interest him, and he spent his spare  time with the sadhus meditating on a sacred hill nearby. He left and returned to  his own village; his father taught him techniques of ritual temple worship, and  he learned to awaken the Goddess in the statue with rice and durva grass, and to  line her eyes with black eyeliner (kajal). His father told him to work at the Kali  temple in Bolpur.  

His relationship with the Goddess was not an easy one. He was angry at Kali  because she allowed many difficulties and uncertainties in his life, and would not  solve his financial and family problems. However, in the end they made peace,  and the Goddess was willing to help him. He said: "When I used to do the evening  ritual, I would feel a cold wind blowing behind me, and it would extinguish the  candles. I would shiver and my hair would stand on end. I would hear the wind,  and know that there was power (sakti) in it. I felt it was the Goddess's presence."  

She would visit him many times, even though he argued with her. When he  came into the temple one night with his left arm broken (due to family fighting),  the Goddess was there. Though they disagreed, his arm was miraculously healed,  and it no longer looked twisted.  

His major religious teacher was his grandfather, Ratneshvara Goswami, who 

INTERVIEW S WIT H A TANTRI C PRIES T 75  

helped him during his childhood. He is still in awe of his grandfather's power,  and told a story about him:  

An interesting incident happened many years ago. When my father was just a child,  he was very ill, and he was finally declared dead by the doctor. My grandfather took  him into the forest. There were hundreds of jackals and vultures surrounding him,  but no animal came near or tried to attack him. My grandfather went into a meditative  trance, and was full of devotion for the Goddess. After three or four days, my father  began to move, and he regained his life and his strength. The Goddess saves people  in her many forms - Durga, Kali, Tara - but it is my belief that my father was saved  by the intervention of Kali.  

Tapan said that his grandfather was a powerful tantrika, who could cure people  from deadly diseases and snakebite. The grandfather had practiced Tantric rituals  alone in the mountains, and had practiced the pancamakara rituals (the five Tan tric "sacraments," all of which are words beginning with the letter M) with a  temporary wife. He had a guru who guided him, and he had great devotion to  the Goddess, which has continued in the family.  

After his grandfather's death, Tapan continued to communicate with him. The  spirit of his grandfather would come to visit Tapan in his dreams and visions,  instructing him in ritual and relationships with the spirits. He says that his grand father's spirit has chosen to dwell in his favorite meditation place, his ritual seat,  which is placed over five buried skulls at the foot of a large tree in the woods  near the temple. His grandfather created this "five-skull seat" (pancamundi asana)  and spent much time there during his life. When Tapan wishes to communicate  with his grandfather's spirit, he sits on this ritual seat and meditates there.  

Tapan has been possessed by his grandfather. In Indian tradition, the guru is  like a god, and being possessed by a god is a desirable situation. Tapan knows  when he is coming:  

He comes to me like the wind, and I can hear the sound of his wooden shoes. Once,  I was sitting here before the Goddess, and I heard the shoes and felt the wind at my  back. It put out the candle. It was my grandfather's spirit, and he entered my body  and I felt great joy (ananda). I found myself chanting many mantras. I stayed con 

scious, and could see everything, but he was there too. He had told me that he would  come that evening. The mantras made me feel full of power, and his presence was a  powerful thing entering me. Once some people came and had cigarettes with some  drug in them, and I felt myself becoming unconscious. I called on my grandfather  for help, and he came to me and possessed me.  

Visitors have been a problem: "Many people have come here and tried to meet  my grandfather in his subtle body. He was annoyed when some tantrikas wanted  spiritual powers (siddhis), and built their own pancamundi asana. There should  never be more than one at a sacred site (pitha) at a time. I speak with him often,  but he would not speak with those people."  

Although Tapan was close to his grandfather, he was not as close to his own76 JUN E MCDANIE L  

father, who only taught him formal ritual worship (puja). He had to learn spiritual  practice on his own, by studying with the various sadhus he could find, and was  never officially initiated. He learned on the road, and in his travels. He performed  Tantra sadhana in the mountains, as his grandfather had done, but after he mar 

ried and became a temple priest he limited his practice to more traditional wor ship, which he called Vedic sadhana. He felt that safeguarding his grandfather's  property allowed him to fulfill his grandfather's "unspoken dreams," so he left  his Tantric practices in the mountains.  

I began to meditate seriously, perfecting my knowledge and ritual practice. As I did  this, I saw that I began to gain new power (sakti). I realized the power of sadhana,  and that if any person could do it properly, he could gain perfection (siddhi). But it  is difficult in daily life to balance family and spiritual practice. Families do not tend  to encourage and inspire sadhana, and neighbors don't understand it; they look down  on people who perform puja. This discourages practice. They are only interested in  the Goddess when they are sick or in need: then they will worship. Otherwise, they  stay aloof. They only want immediate gains and blessings. I think that true sadhana  can only be done in isolation, away in the mountains.  

However, he did retain one one Tantric-style ritual, the feeding of skulls, as  taught to him by his grandfather. Behind the Kali statue in his temple is a long  line of bright red skulls, who are given offerings. He describes the ritual as follows:  

The Goddess is normally invisible before us, but through sadhana, we can see her.  One ritual that I perform here is the feeding of skulls (mundake khdoya nao). Generally,  skulls like puffed rice, though some like fried lentils, curries, or wine. After perform ing a sacrifice (bali), I feed them with raw meat [in this case, "feeding" means offering  a plate of food before each skull]. The feeding is accompanied by a ritual fire (homa)  and sacrifice (yajna). After the feeding, I bathe them in ghee, yogurt, milk, and honey,  and then I arrange them for worship. Sometimes I do this when I need more mental  balance or physical strength.  

Skulls are useful, because the person's soul often stays with the skull. The soul  can predict the future, and help the sadhu. People used to do the corpse ritual (sava sadhana) and sit on the dead body of a virgin girl. She would then become Kali, and  the body would come back to life and talk. My grandfather did sava-sadhana, but  people today are afraid of it - if you make one mistake, you die or go insane. This  sadhu in orange that you see roaming around here in the burning ground did sava sadhana wrongly, and he was made insane by it. But he will return to sanity one of  these days.  

I feed the skulls on the altar, and they help me. I learned the skull-feeding ritual  from my grandfather. When the skulls are fed, they are pacified and they become  protectors. Then they are strong enough to fight off the evil souls (atmas) who wish  to distract or harm the sadhu. When negative spirits (bhutas and pretas) try to disturb  the sadhu's meditation, then the good souls fight the bad souls and keep the sadhu 

INTERVIEW S WIT H A TANTRI C PRIES T 77  

on the right path. Sadhus often have helpers. Sometimes sava-sadhana is performed  with a woman, who is called the uttara sadhika. She has great skill (adhikari) and  helps the male through meditation if he is distracted by evil spirits. When the sadhu  draws a circle around himself to protect him from these spirits, she is within the  circle. Sometimes the sadhu may invite his guru in subtle form to watch over him  and help him.  

Today, it is widely believed that there are no ghosts, but really there are souls who  do not die. They are always around us. Sometimes they may enter into our physical  bodies, and cause problems or even tragedies. It is only by sadhana, by dedication  to the Goddess, that we gain control over them. Then they can work for our benefit.  We become immune to fear, hate, and intense desire with their help. I show them  loyalty, and they guard me.  

The skulls in this temple mostly come from people who died in epidemics, es pecially cholera epidemics. Large numbers of people used to die, and there was no  effective system of cremation at that time. Corpses would lie on the roadside or in  the forests.  

Under the altar (vedi) of this temple there are 108 skulls buried. Some altars have  1,008 skulls. Skulls awaken the Goddess, and make her present here. Male gods have  stones (Silas) or lihgas [of Siva], but goddesses have skulls. Some skulls are used for  pancamundi asana [a ritual in which the practitioner sits on a seat in the midst of  five skulls, generally of different types of animals and persons]. People use the skulls  of a low-caste man, a jackal, a tiger, a snake, and a virgin girl (kumdri). They must  be young, and die suddenly by violence. Nobody wants the skulls of people who  died of disease or old age. Some tantrikas have a special relationship with the Doms  [low-caste people who traditionally burn the dead and deal with corpses] who work  in hospitals. These Doms notify them of appropriate deaths.  

Tapan compares the skull-feeding ritual with the corpse ritual (sava-sadhana)  because in both cases a dead object becomes a vessel for a living presence through  ritual. The souls from the skulls are also like the Tantric consort or uttara sadhika  in that they assist in ritual practice. Although the female consort can help the  Tantric practitioner overcome the power of instinct by the use of mantra and  mudra at the correct times, the souls can help the practitioner battle evil spirits  and temptations in his meditative visions.  

The Goddess is more powerful than the souls, and comes to visit and help  more rarely. Tapan calls the Goddess "Ma" (Mother).  

Ma has given me many favors. I remember once at night, I dreamt of a little girl  (whom I believe was Ma) who came to help me. At that time I had little money and  was renting a very small room. The girl came to me and took me to a new house for  rent in my neighborhood. 1 awoke the next morning, and followed the path that we  had taken in the dream-vision. I saw a house that looked exactly like the one I had  seen. There did turn out to be a room for rent there, a spacious room that I could  afford. So I believe she really did help me. Once she appeared as an old woman, 

78 JUN E MCDANIE L  

perhaps eighty years old, and she patted my head, which was on her lap. At that time  I was under much stress - my sadhana was not smooth, and 1 was disturbed by many  bad events, which frightened me. But Ma saved me, and she gave me her blessings.  

She can also help at death, as can the guru.  

The Goddess gives blessings during life, and after death she can also help. She does  not help directly, for such things are determined by karma. Those who did evil on  earth are kept in hell (patala) in the forms of jackals or snakes, and they cannot leave  immediately. If they didn't do much evil, they may move about their past family and  friends in nonphysical (aprakrta) form.  

But if the person dying had a true guru, then he could act as a mediator for the  person to reach heaven (svarga) or Kailasa [the mountain abode of Siva], and Kali  can help to show the way. If one wishes to reach the kingdom of the gods and  goddesses, it is necessary to worship them.  

It is difficult to describe. You see, in this world everything is both difficult and  easy. It depends upon how you approach it. If a person has a proper guide, if he is  given much instruction and experience, if his guru watches him closely, then nothing  is difficult to attain. But the qualities (gunas) inherited from previous lives are also  important. Without the proper qualities, one cannot perform sadhana. If a person  was educated in this area in his previous life, then he could guide himself automat 

ically, and would not need anybody else.  

Tapan has worshiped Kali in a variety of ways.  

There are many forms of Tantric sadhana. There are three major styles (bhavas): the  sattvika, rajasika and tamasika bhavas. The sattvika bhava is devotion (bhakti), and  that is the best path to follow. The tamasika bhava can give one the presence of the  Goddess, but it does not last long. It stays for a little while, and then it ceases. It is  very brief, and very fickle. Devotion lasts longer. One cannot get really close to the  Goddess without devotional love. Only bhakti justifies Tantra.  

I have practiced both Vedic and Tantric sadhana. But I do not call myself a tan trika - I don't take liquor, bhang, ganjika [hashish] and that sort of thing. Tantra is  a dangerous path - there is much possiblity of insanity and brain damage. The Tantric  path to liberation is fast and easy (sahaja), but it always has risks. The Vedic path is  longer, but the risks are fewer. I think that the feeding of skulls is the first stage of  practice, where one learns to control ghosts and ghouls (bhutas and pretas), and one  gains immunity to snakebites, and dedication to the Goddess. Then the Goddess  comes to protect her devotee, and vision comes, as well as telepathy and the ability  to know the future.  

He does not call himself a tantrika because tantrikas have a bad reputation in  West Bengal. They are popularly portrayed as madmen, perverts, cannibals, drug  addicts, and alcoholics. However, his practice does have a heavy Tantric flavor,  which he renames as Vedic and devotional. He justifies this by saying that his 

INTERVIEW S WIT H A TANTRI C PRIES T 79  

ultimate goal is devotional, so his practice can be called devotional. Tantra is only  a stage of worship.  

Tapan has dedicated himself to his life as a priest and Sakta devotee:  

I inherited this temple and burning ground, and now they are my property. I have  given my village land and shares in the lakes to my brothers. I want to fulfill the  wishes of both my father and grandfather. I have been here since 1979, for fifteen  years. Ma developed the temple, and I have been her mediator. I have also been  inspired by a woman renouncer, a sannyasini named Sangadevi, a distant relative of  Rabindranath Tagore. I will be forever obliged to her. She was a great help to me. I  hope that the temple will grow, and that more people will come to worship the  Goddess.  

However, he finds it a hard life, and does not want his son to follow in his  footsteps. He wants him to work in an office in the city.  

Really, sakti sadhana is becoming obsolete today because nobody teaches it. I do not  want my own son to be a Sakta sadhu. I will teach others, but I will not teach him.  I want him to work in an office. I had to go through much suffering in this practice,  and I want to spare my son. Learning about sakti sadhana is predetermined; if it is  his karma, he will learn it somehow. If it is in his blood he will do it, and find a guru  of his own. I want him to do worship, but not sadhana. It is a difficult life, and much  suffering is involved. I had only my grandfather to help me.  

His comments about Tantric goddess worship (sakti sadhana) becoming obso lete are quite accurate, according to my observations. Very few people are willing  to admit that they even practice, let alone teach it. As families are becoming more  nuclear, the importance of the ancestors and grandparents decreases; as com munism and Westernization spread through the villages, traditional religious be liefs die away. What remains are Vedanta, traditionally the province of the higher  and more educated castes, and devotional bhakti, which is understandable to the  Christians who possess money and can provide jobs. These approaches have not  yet been subject to attack. Tapan states, "Now the atmosphere here is against  tantra sadhana, and people are afraid, because sometimes people who do ritual  practice are beaten by goondas [bullies or criminals, often hired by political  groups]. Maybe tantrikas can manage in a deserted forests or cremation grounds,  but if anybody knows about the practice, there is trouble."  

It seems that these attackers harass the sadhus as part of an organized attempt  to rid West Bengal of people viewed as social parasites and troublemakers. Prac titioners from several areas of West Bengal have described the harassment that  they have suffered from the Communist "Anti-Superstition Clubs" in the elemen tary and high schools, and from other groups whose affiliations are not advertised.  However, the worship of the Goddess in Tantric style continues sub rosa: "But  people believe in Sakti, even with communism. Many Communist leaders go to  tantrikas and astrologers to find out what the results of an election will be. I have 

80 JUNE MCDANIEL  

had Communists come here to this cremation ground, though they tell their  followers not to come here, that it is superstition. They tell them this because  they are afraid that the illiterate people will get power from the Goddess, and  take it away from them. They want to keep the power for themselves." Such a  situation makes him wonder about the future of Tantric practice. Tapan states: "I  think that worship of Kali will survive, but there will be fewer members. I think  that in fifty years there will be no gurus left, and the practices will all turn shal lower and more superficial." Tapan's own long-term goal is universal and devo 

tional: "What I want to do is stay at the beck and call of Ma, lay down before her  feet, give her offerings and serve her, and also run my family and know about  the outside world. Then my vision of her will be clear instead of fuzzy, and I can  perform service to the world."  

Maintaining the older Tantric traditions in the face of hostility from the forces  of communism and Westernization is difficult for tantrikas, and many have gone  into hiding. Others have claimed to be devotees, bhaktas, or Vedic scholars, as a  way of protecting themselves from attack. Few tantrikas are wandering sadhus  today; most have some job and status and perform Tantric sadhana privately. The  Nababharata Press has published a number of Tantras in Sanskrit with Bengali  translation, so that non-Sanskritists (usually meaning non-brahmans) can practice  the rituals. There are also small Tantric circles, in which people study texts, and  other small underground groups that practice rituals.  

For virtually all the tantrikas I interviewed, however, the dimension of Tantra  that focuses on the conquest of death and transcendence of this world is more  important than the sexual aspects that have been emphasized by many Western  writers on Tantra. It may be that such a focus is regional, and that West Bengal  is one of the few Tantric regions that has emphasized death and its symbolism as  the major path to the Goddess's paradise. With the focus on death rituals, it is  appropriate that the Tantric aides to transcendence are ghosts, who become help ers and protectors on the paths to Kali's heaven.  

Research for this article comes from fieldwork in West Bengal, from 1993-1994,  on a Senior Scholar Fulbright Research Grant. The data in this biography come  from visits to the Bolpur Kali temple and to Tapan Goswami's house. The inter views were conducted in Bengali, as Tapan spoke no English.

### 04 A Parody of the Kapalikas in the Mattavilasa  

David N. Lorenzen  

The Mattavilasa is a one-act comic farce written in Sanskrit and Prakrit and at tributed to a Pallava ruler of south India named Mahendra-varman, who ruled  from his capital at Kanchi from about 600 to 630 C.E. The principal character in  the play is a drunken Kapalika adept named Satyasoma.  

The Kapalikas or Kapalins are one of the earliest mentioned sectarian groups  of Tantric adepts. Unfortunately no texts survive that can unambiguously be as signed to Kapalika authors. We have, instead, many texts written by their op ponents who criticize or parody Kapalika beliefs and practices, and a few inscrip tions that record donations to or from Kapalika adepts.  

The Mattavilasa is one of the oldest works that features a Kapalika adept. As  such, it has undoubtedly influenced many later portraits. One cannot, however,  assume that the Kapalikas found in Sanskrit literature are simply fictional stereo types. The inscriptions prove that the Kapalikas really did exist, and many ele ments of their literary portraits correspond to what we know about Tantric reli gion from other sources. Reading between the lines of parodies such as the  Mattavilasa, then, we can arrive at a plausible picture of the nature of Kapalika  beliefs and practices.  

A central feature of Kapalika practice was their Great Vow or Mahavrata. To  fulfill this vow, the male adept would obtain his livelihood by begging for alms  with a skull bowl. Since the Sanskrit word for skull is kapala, this made him a  Kapalika or Kapalin, while the performance of the Mahavrata made him a Ma 

havratin. The rationale for this Great Vow is found in a myth about the gods Siva  and Brahma. Although the details vary in different versions, the key episode is a  quarrel between the two gods about who is the most powerful. Siva, in his anger,  cuts off the fifth head of Brahma. Since Brahma is the archetypal representative  of the social class of the brahmans, this means that Siva has committed the major  crime of killing a brahman (brahma-hatya). To atone for this crime, Siva has to  wander about as a Kapalin for twelve years, using Brahma's skull as his begging  bowl. 

82 DAVID N. LORENZEN  

In the Mattavilasa, the action centers around the Kapalika's attempts to find  his lost skull bowl. When he falsely accuses a Buddhist monk of having stolen it,  the monk displays his own bowl, which has a quite different shape and color.  The Kapalika's female companion, Devasoma, laments that their skull - which  was once "endowed with all the auspicious marks and was as holy as the skull of  Brahma" - has become black and ugly. The Kapalika consoles her with the  thought that his penance, like that of Siva, can make it pure again: "Our master  Siva, who wears the crescent moon, was freed of the sin that arose when he cut  off the head of Brahma through undertaking this Great Vow."  

We have no information about how the human Kapalikas obtained their skulls,  but it is most likely that they found them in cremation grounds. In a few sources,  however, Kapalikas are said to engage in human sacrifice. This seems unlikely,  but the Kapalikas' association with cremation grounds and other inauspicious  places is in keeping with the ritual practices of more extreme Tantric ascetics.  The basic aim of wandering about in such places was to overcome the duality of  pure and impure, and the fear of death, by constant contact with impure places  and things such as cremation grounds and corpses. This constant association with  impurity would also force the adepts to learn to endure the scorn and disgust of  persons who were still tied to the rules of proper social behavior.  

Other social rules that the Kapalikas and other Tantric adepts purposely trans gressed concern sex and food. In literary works such as the Mattavilasa, the Ka palikas are often described as hedonists addicted to sexual play with beautiful  female companions and to drinking liquor and eating meat. In the Mattavilasa,  the Kapalika Satyasoma's lovely companion Devasoma is presumed to be his sex ual partner and also attracts the lustful glances of the Buddhist monk and the  Pasupata ascetic. Together Satyasoma and Devasoma also enjoy the meat kabobs  that they receive as alms in the skull bowl and the liquor that they drink from  the same vessel.  

From what we know about Tantric religion, it is unlikely the Kapalikas were  simple hedonists. Some Tantric adepts did engage in extramarital sexual inter course and the consumption of foods prohibited to upper-caste Hindus, such as  meat and liquor. Such behavior was, however, displayed in the context of a con trolled ritual, not as simple hedonistic enjoyment. In the best-known ritual, the  adept took the five prohibited things whose names begin with the letter M: liquor,  meat, fish, parched grain, and sexual intercourse (madya, mamsa, matsya, mudra,  maithuna). The female partner in the act of sexual intercourse is usually described  as a low-caste woman who is not the male adept's own wife. The basic aim of all  this, as in the case of the association with cremation grounds and corpses, was  to rise above the duality of the pure and the impure through the transgression of  the rules of proper social conduct.  

One other aspect of the ritual act of sexual intercourse is often suggested in  Tantric sources. The ritual is regarded as a reenactment of the sexual intercourse  between Siva and his wife, the goddess called Parvati or Uma. The bliss of this  union is compared to the bliss of liberation or moksa, and the Tantric adepts  were expected to recreate this divine bliss in their own acts of ritual intercourse. 

A PARODY OF THE KAPALIKAS 8 3  

The theological system of the Kapalikas is often called Soma-siddhanta, the  doctrine of Soma. Several commentaries on another Sanskrit drama with a Ka palika character gloss the Soma of Soma-siddhanta as implying "Siva united with  Uma" (sa-Uma = soma). In fact, we have no way of knowing the nature of the  doctrines of Soma-siddhanta, but the name appears both in literary texts and in  inscriptions. In many sources, Soma-siddhantin, like Mahavratin, is another title  given to the Kapalikas. In the Mattavilasa, the word soma appears in the names  of both Satyasoma and Devasoma. It is also barely possible that the name also  suggests some sort of connection with the ancient Brahmanical worship of the  intoxicating sacred drink called soma.  

The physical appearance of Kapalika adepts is only hinted at in the Mattavilasa,  but other sources give more detailed descriptions. One of the most interesting is  from an inscription from Andhra Pradesh dated about 1050 C.E. It records a  donation by a Brahman (vipra) named Somi-bhattaraka who was the abbot of a  local SaiikareSvara (Siva) temple. The inscription calls him an expert in Soma 

siddhanta and a Mahavratin. He is described as "sprinkled with ashes; adorned  with the six insignia; and holding a khatvahga club, a skull (kapala), damaru and  mrdahga drums, and a trumpet." The six insignia are not listed, but the south  Indian Vaisnava theologians Yamunacarya and Ramanuja identify the six insignia  of the Kapalikas as two different kinds of earrings, a necklace, a jeweled crest,  ashes, and the sacred thread. They add the skull and khatvahga as secondary  insignia. The khatvanga consists of a pole about fifty to seventy-five centimeters  (twenty to thirty inches) in length, on which a complete skull is impaled.  

It is impossible to know how the Kapalikas were organized as a religious group,  but their association with a specific vow, a specific doctrine, and a special dress  code suggests some definite institutional tradition. By the thirteenth or fourteenth  centuries, however, whatever organization they once may have had apparently  had already disappeared. The Kapalikas survived mainly in the literary and reli 

gious texts of their opponents as stereotypical villains, buffoons, or heretics.  

The translation given below follows the text, Mattavilasaprahasana, edited by T.  Ganapati Sastri (Trivandrum: Government Press, 1917). More recent editions are  available, but all seem to be based on this one. Here and there, I have added a  short phrase or extra stage direction to explain things that might not be imme 

diately obvious to readers. The translations of the numbered verses use English  rhymes and/or meters to mark them off from the prose text. In the original, the  women, the Buddhist, and the madman all speak in different varieties of Prakrit  rather than in Sanskrit.  

One additional point concerns two somewhat confusing references to the Ka palika that appear in the text shortly after verse 20. He is called first a Great  Brahman (mahabrahmana) and then a Great Pasupata (mahapasupata). At least one  translator has assumed that these terms should refer to the Pasupata and not to  the Kapalika. In fact, the term Great Brahman is commonly used to refer to the  untouchables who help officiate during the highly polluting rite of cremation. The  term Great Pasupata is evidently a similar ironic title. 

84 DAVID N. LORENZEN  

Another point easily missed is the confusion of myths and legends in the mad man's speech just before verse 19. Such mixed allusions will be lost on most  modern readers, but they must have amused the cultured audience of Mahendra varman's court.

Whose dance reveals beauty through intense emotion,  

Whose power moves the cosmos, of infinite wisdom,  

Who is also the silent spectator watching the show,  

May he grant you fame that fills the entire earth. (1)  

Ah, at last I have found a suitable way to please my older wife, who has been  out of sorts ever since I appointed myself a younger wife. Today the royal  assembly finally appointed us to put on a public show. I must go tell her the  news, [looking behind the scenes]. My dear, please come here.  

Actress: [entering, angrily] Have you at last come to play the drunken games  of adolescents?  

Director: It is as you say.  

Actress: Then you should go play with her to whom you wish to make love.

Actress: Were you told to do this?  

Director: Yes, I was. What's more, if you join us you will be well paid.  Actress: You must be really pleased about this.  

Director: My dear, aren't you pleased as well? If the assembly is satisfied by  your performance, it will reward you generously.

Actress: What play are you about to present?  

Director: The one you just mentioned, the farce called "Drunken Games."  Actress: It seems that my anger has spoken for me in this matter. Sir, who is  the poet who has composed this work?  

Director: Listen, my dear. In the lands ruled by the Pallava family there was  the mighty scion Simhavisnu-varman. Using many different tactics, he won  a wide circle of vassals. In courage, he was the equal of Indra. In generosity,  he outdid even the god of wealth. The author is his son, King Mahendra 

vikrama-varman, a man who has conquered all personal vices and is dedi cated to providing for the welfare of others.  

Now, when the Kali Age is here,  

And lofty virtues disappear,  

Wisdom, compassion, and honesty,  

Art, generosity, truth, and beauty,  

Dignity, firmness, and modesty,  

Seek refuge with this virtuous king.  

As, when the universe began,  

The countless fragments of creation  

Sought refuge with the Primal Man. (3)  

His eloquence is a mine  

Of priceless gems, a presence  

That brings praise to songs  

Of good but lesser talents. (4)

Director:  

And so, the Kapalika, with lovely wench and skull,  

Finds shame under the spell of alcohol. (5)  

[The two exit. The Kapalika then enters with his female companion.]  

Kapalika: [acting drunk] Devasoma, my love, it's true. The power of changing  form at will is won by means of penance. The proper performance of the  Great Vow has made you irresistibly beautiful:  

Your soft laughter and gentle sighs,  

Your falling garlands and flowing hair,  

Your playful smiles and dancing eyes,  

Your moist cheeks and lazy stare. (6)  

Devasoma: My lord, you seem to be saying that it's 1 who am drunk.  Kapalika: What did you say?  

Devasoma: I'm not saying anything.  

Kapalika: Is it possible that I'm drunk?  

Devasoma: My lord, the earth is spinning all around. I think I'm falling. Please  hold me up.  

Kapalika: I've got you, my love, [trying to support her and jailing] Somadeva,  my love, are you angry at me? Every time I try to hold you up, you move  away.  

Devasoma: Hah! It must be this Somadeva who gets angry and moves away,  even when you bow and scrape before her.  

Kapalika: Aren't you Somadeva? [thinking] No, you're Devasoma.  Devasoma: If you love this Somadeva so much, you shouldn't call her by my  name.  

Kapalika: My dear, this was just a simple slip of the tongue. I'm drunk. No  offense to you was intended.  

Devasoma: How convenient that it's not you who's to blame.  Kapalika: How can I let vile drink get control over me? All right. All right.  Starting from today, I will stop being a slave of alcohol.  

Devasoma: My lord, please don't interrupt your penance by breaking your holy  vow because of me. [falls at his feet]  

Kapalika: [happily raising her up and embracing her] Dhrrna dhrrna, homage  to Siva. My love,  

Drink up until intoxication,  

Look deep into your lover's eyes,  

Wear fancy clothes from every nation:  

Long life to the god who found  

So fine a path for our salvation. (7) 

A PARODY OF THE KAPALIKA S 87  

Devasoma: Is it proper to speak in this way? The Jain saints describe the path  to salvation in quite another way.  

Kapalika: Dear, their views are completely mistaken.  

The Jains argue that each effect  

Resembles the cause from which it came.  

But against this they also expect  

That the bliss of our eternal salvation  

Comes from penance and its pain.  

These fools defeat this curious claim  

With their own logical argumentation. (8)  

Devasoma: May their sins be ended.  

Kapalika: May their sins be ended. There is no point even to revile these sin ners. They torment living beings by making them remain celibate, tear out  their hair, refuse to bathe, eat only at certain hours, and wear dirty clothes.  Even mentioning them makes me now want to wash out my mouth with  liquor.  

Devasoma: Then let's go off to another liquor shop.  

Kapalika: My love, let's do it.  

[Both walk about.]  

Kapalika: Ah, the city of Kanchi is incredibly beautiful. The sounds of drums  mix with thunder from the clouds that sit on the top of the tall palaces; the  flower markets create their own spring season; the rustle of young girls  moving about announces the immanent victory of the God of Love. Likewise,  

The infinite, incomparable bliss  

That wise sages first discovered  

Is now as close as one could wish.  

For we have added a special measure,  

No need to abandon the life of a lover  

This bliss includes all sensual pleasure. (9)  

Devasoma: My lord, just like the goddess of liquor, Kanchi is irreproachably  sweet.  

Kapalika: My love, just look. This liquor shop equals the majesty of the sac rificial enclosure. Here the flag pole equals the sacrificial post; the liquor  equals the soma; the drinkers, the priests; the liquor glasses, the soma cups;  the snacks such as meat kabobs, the various oblations; the drunken chatter,  the sacrificial formulas; the songs, the sacrificial hymns; the liquor vats, the  sacrificial ladles; the thirst of the drinkers, the sacrificial fire; and the owner  of the shop, the sponsor of the sacrifice.  

Devasoma: And the alms we get here will be the offering to Rudra.  Kapalika: Ah, the dances of these drunken games create such a beautiful, con fused uproar. The dancers move to the rhythm of the drums, gesture, shout, 

HO DAVI D N. LORENZE N  

flirt, lift up their shirts with one hand, and lose the beat for a second as they  hike up their falling garments.  

Devasoma: Ah, my teacher is a true connoisseur.  

Kapalika: When poured into glasses, the goddess of liquor puts jewels to  shame, reconciles angry lovers, and gives courage to youth. She is the very  soul of pleasure. What more can I say?  

It's just not true what they claim  

About the way the fiery ray  

From Siva's eye burned to ashes  

The body of our god of love.  

What really happened I prefer to think  

Is that Siva's penance was so intense  

The heat produced could not be controlled,  

So when love came too near to the flame  

He melted like wax, and ever since  

Has fueled the fire of our desire. (10)  

Devasoma: This is true, my lord. Siva is devoted to the world's welfare and  would never destroy it.  

[Both drum on their own cheeks.]  

Kapalika: Madam, please give us alms.  

[From behind the scenes.] My lord, here are some alms. Please accept them.  

Kapalika: I accept them. My love, where is my skull bowl?  Devasoma: I don't see it anywhere.  

Kapalika: [thinking] Hm, I guess maybe I forgot it in the liquor shop? Oh well,  we'll have to go back and see.  

Devasoma: My lord, it is against our rule to not accept alms that have been  offered with respect. What do we do now?  

Kapalika: We will have to resort to the rule for emergencies and accept them  in this cow horn.  

Devasoma: So be it. [He accepts the alms. ]  

[Both then walk about looking for the skull bowl]  

Kapalika: How can it be that even here we cannot find it? [acting depressed]  Listen, all you Mahesvaras, have any of you here seen our alms bowl? What  did you say? You haven't seen it? Ay, I'm ruined. My penance is broken.  How can I still remain a Kapalika? Alas,  

My spotless skull was a very dear friend.  

With it in my hand I drank and was fed  

And used it at night to pillow my head.  

Its loss is a hurt that just won't mend. (11) 

A PARODY OF THE KAPALIKAS 89  [Falls and beats his head on the ground. ]  

Let it be. The skull is merely a symbol. I can still keep the title of a Kapalika.  [stands up]  

Devasoma: My lord, who could have grabbed the skull?  

Kapalika: My love, I suspect that it was stolen by a dog or by a Buddhist monk  for the meat kabobs that were in it.  

Devasoma: To find it, then, we're going to have to search the whole city of  Kanchi.  

Kapalika: So we will, my love.  

[Both walk about. Then a Buddhist monk enters with a bowl in his hand.]  

Buddhist: Ah, the house of the lay devotee and merchant Dhanadasa provides  the most magnificent charity. There I obtained these abundant morsels of  all sorts of rich smelling, tasty fish and meat. Now I'm going off to the royal  monastery.  

[walking about, he says to himself] The compassionate Lord Buddha grat ified the community of monks with teachings that instruct them to live in  mansions, to sleep on well-constructed beds, to eat in the morning, to take  well-flavored drinks in the afternoon, to chew betel leaves mixed with five  perfumes, and to wear comfortable clothes. But what I haven't seen are the  rules for taking a wife or drinking liquor. Is it possible that the Omniscient  One did not envision this? I suspect that these tired, evil Buddhist elders  removed the rules about women and liquor from the holy books out of their  jealousy of us young folk. Where can I find an unmodified original text? If  I find it, I will gratify the community by making known to all the complete  words of the Buddha.  

[He walks about.]  

Devasoma: My lord, look. Look at that fellow in the red robe scurrying about  in the middle of this royal road filled with crowds of happy people. He is all  hunched over, looking this way and that, and moving as if he's scared of  /'something.  

Kapalika: My love, you're quite right. And his hand is inside his robe as if he  is hiding something.  

Devasoma: My lord, let's go and grab him and find out.  

Kapalika: So be it. ]approaching] Hey, monk. Stop!  

Buddhist: Who's calling me? [turning and looking] Ay, it's the evil Kapalika  who lives at the temple of Ekamranatha. Well, I have no intention of being  the target of his drunken violence, [goes off in haste]  

Kapalika: Aha. My love, we've found our skull. Did you see him run away in  fear when he saw me? This is clear evidence that he is the thief. [Quickly  cutting him off, the Kapalika stops htm.] Hah! Where will you go now, you  bastard? 

90 DAVI D N . LORENZE N  

Buddhist: Kapalika, please don't. What's this? [aside] Hm, this female devotee  is really beautiful.  

Kapalika: Listen, monk. Show me right now. I want to see what you have in  the hand hidden beneath your robe.  

Buddhist: What is there to see? It is only a begging bowl.  

Kapalika: That's precisely what I want to see.  

Buddhist: No, Kapalika, please don't. It is proper that this bowl should be kept  hidden.  

Kapalika: Aha, then it was for the sake of hiding things that the Buddha first  taught you to wear such ample robes.  

Buddhist: This is true.  

Kapalika: This is the relative truth. But I want to hear the absolute truth.  Buddhist: Enough of this mockery! The hours for begging are over. I have to  go. [He sets off.]  

Kapalika: Ha, bastard, where are you going? Give me the skull.  [He grabs the end of the monk's robe.]  

Buddhist: Hail to the Buddha!  

Kapalika: What you should say is "Hail to Kharapata!" He's the one who wrote  the sacred book of thieves. Or was the Buddha even more an expert in this  topic than even Kharapata? Why's this?  

The ideas he stole, that thieving Tathagata,  

From the Upanisads and Mahabharata,  

He brazenly claimed as original thinking,  

While foolish brahmans stood there blinking. (12)  

Buddhist: May your sins be ended.  

Kapalika: How is it possible that the sins of a well-behaved ascetic like myself  not be ended?  

Devasoma: My lord, you look tired. This cherished skull is not going to be  easy to obtain. You should drink some liquor from this cow horn in order  to recover your strength before you get into a fight with him.  

[Devasoma gives some liquor to the Kapalika. ]  

Kapalika: [drinks] My love, you too should remove your fatigue.  Devasoma: Thank you, my lord. [drinks[  

Kapalika: This Buddhist has offended us. But sharing is the chief thing in our  own doctrine. Let this teacher have the rest.  

Devasoma: Whatever my lord commands. Take this, Sir.  

Buddhist: [aside[ Ha, how easy it was to get a good result. But this is so sinful,  and a big merchant might see me. [aloud] No, no, madam. This is not proper  for us. [licks the corners of his mouth]  

Devasoma: Go to hell! What makes you so smug?  

Kapalika: My love, his mouth is watering so much that his words, so opposed  to his desire, can barely be understood. 

A PARODY OF THE KAPALIKAS 91  

Buddhist: You still have no compassion.  

Kapalika: If I had compassion, how could I be an ascetic free of passion?  Buddhist: One who is free of passion should also be free of anger.  Kapalika: I'll be free of anger if you give me what belongs to me.  Buddhist: And what's that?  

Kapalika: My skull!  

Buddhist: How your skull?  

Kapalika: "How your skull?" he says. But this is quite appropriate.  

If you are really a son of the Buddha,  

Who wrongly tried to insist  

That visible things, huge and imposing,  

Do not in fact exist,  

Even earth, mountains, rivers, and ocean,  

What could stop you from denying  

The skull you hold in your fist? (13)  

Deyasoma: My lord, He'll never give it back with such gentle treatment. Let's  just go and grab it from his hand.  

Kapalika: Let's do it, my love. [They do their best to grab it]  Buddhist: Go to hell, you evil Kapalika! [He pushes him with his hand and kicks  him with his foot.]  

Kapalika: How's this? I've fallen.  

Devasoma: [to Buddhist] You're a dead man, son of a slave girl! {She tries to  grab him by the hair, but since he has none, she falls.]  

Buddhist: [aside] How wise was the Buddha when he foresaw the need to have  a shaven head, [aloud] Get up, sister, get up. [He helps Devasoma to get up.]  Kapalika: Look at this, Mahesvaras. This evil monk named Nagasena is grab bing the hand of my sweetheart.  

Buddhist: No, brother, I'm not. Our rule is to help those fallen into distress.  Kapalika: Is this yet another rule of the Omniscient One? Wasn't I the first  one to fall? But let it be. It doesn't matter. Now your head is about to become  my skull bowl.  

[All of them make a big uproar.]  

Buddhist: Help, help!  

Kapalika: Look, Mahesvaras. This evil so-called monk first robs me of my skull  bowl, and then he calls for help. Let it be. I too can make a scandal. Sacrilege,  sacrilege!  

[A Pasupata then enters. ]  

Pasupata: Satyasoma, why are you calling for help?  

Kapalika: Ah, Babhrukalpa, this evil so-called monk Nagasena has stolen my  skull bowl and doesn't want to give it back.  

Pasupata: [aside] In this matter I should act like the Gandharvas and try to get  the girl for myself. 

92 DAVI D N . LORENZE N  

The barber's wench who I quite fancy  

This Buddhist rogue has lured his way  

Offering her coins from beneath his robe,  

As if tempting a cow with a fist of hay. (14)  

But I will now defeat my rival by inciting this pimp against him. [aloud]  Nagasena, is it true what he said?  

Buddhist: My lord, How can you say this? It is a Buddhist precept that one  should abstain from taking what is not given. It is a precept that one should  abstain from false speech. It is a precept that one should abstain from sexual  intercourse. It is a precept that one should abstain from taking a life. It is a  precept that one should abstain from eating at inappropriate times. I take  my refuge in the religion of the Buddha.  

Pasupata: Satyasoma, such is their moral code. What can you reply?  Kapalika: Well, our code is that one should not tell lies.  

Pasupata: Both these codes are quite appropriate. But how can we decide the  case?  

Buddhist: What possible motive can there be for one who takes the Buddha's  word as his authority to grab a bowl full of liquor?  

Pasupata: A disputant cannot win a case by mere affirmation.  Kapalika: When we have direct evidence, what is the point of disputation?  Pasupata: What sort of direct evidence?  

Devasoma: My lord, he has the skull in his hand hidden inside his monk's  robe.  

Pasupata: You heard what she said.  

Buddhist: This so-called skull doesn't belong to anyone else.  Kapalika: Let us see it then.  

Buddhist: There! [He shows it]  

Kapalika: [sarcastically] Look, Mahesvaras. Look at the injustice perpetrated  by the Kapalika and the excellent conduct of this Buddhist monk.  Buddhist: It is a Buddhist precept that one should abstain from taking what is  not given. [He again recites the precepts. ]  

[Both the Kapalika and Devasoma dance. ]  

Buddhist: What's this? When he should be ashamed, he dances instead.  Kapalika: Hah, who's dancing? [looking all around] He thinks he sees dancing  in the display of my delight, like a flower swaying in the wind, at once again  seeing my lost skull bowl.  

Buddhist: My lord, why don't you take a closer look at this bowl. Tell me, what  color is it?  

Kapalika: What do you want me to say? Do you think I can't see? This skull  is blacker than a crow.  

Buddhist: Then you yourself admit that this is mine and not yours. 

A PARODY OF THE KAPALIKAS 93  

Kapalika: What I really admit is that you know how to change its color.  Look . . .  

Once your robe was as white as chalk,  

As bright as the silk of a lotus stalk,  

And didn't you slyly make it one  

With a tint as red as the rising sun? (15)  

And besides . . .  

Since you are stained, inside and out,  

With a blood-red hue,  

How could my skull not acquire  

The same stain too? (16)  

Devasoma: Ay, I'm ruined! How terrible! How did this skull get such a changed  condition by coming into contact with stained cloth? Endowed with all the  auspicious marks, it was as holy as the skull of Brahma. It shone like the  full moon and was always full of liquor. [She weeps.]  

Kapalika: My love, don't cry. It will become pure once again. The sacred scrip tures say that great beings have their faults removed through penance.  

Our Master Siva, the god of the crescent moon,  

Once undertook the vow called Mahavrata  

To free himself from the heavy sin that befell,  

When he cut off one of the heads of the god of creation.  

Likewise, Indra, king of the thirty gods,  

Once killed the three-headed son of mighty Tvastar  

But managed to get the burden of his sin removed  

Through the merit of a hundred sacrifices. (17)  

Babhrukalpa, is this not so?  

Pasupata: This is what the sacred Agamas declare.  

Buddhist: Sir, if I changed its color, who made it this shape and size?  Kapalika: Did you Buddhists not spring from the lineage of Maya?  Buddhist: For how long do I have to curse you? Here, you take it.  Kapalika: Did not the Buddha himself perfect the supreme virtue of generosity?  Buddhist: Now that this is over, where will I find refuge?  

Kapalika: Isn't your refuge the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sahgha?  Pasupata: I am unable to decide this case. We will have to take it to the court.  Devasoma: My lord, if we do this, it's goodbye to the skull.  Pasupata: What do you mean?  

Devasoma: This Buddhist has behind him the wealth of many monasteries. He  can fill the mouths of the officials of the court at will. But we are servants  of the poor Kapalika, whose wealth is merely a snake skin and ashes. With  what wealth do we enter the court? 

94 DAVI D N . LORENZE N  Pasupata: This isn't so.  

The law, like the palace, has strong foundations,  

Upright, solid, polished, and firm,  

The one good pillars, the other good persons. (18)  

Kapalika: Enough of this! A person who obeys the law need not fear anything.  Buddhist: [to the Pasupata] My Lord, you should lead the way.  Pasupata: So be it.  

[All of them walk about. Then a madman enters. ]  

Madman: This evil dog! You've grabbed the skull full of meat kabobs and run  away with it. Son of a slave girl, where are you going to go? Now, he's  dropped the skull and is coming running to bite me. [looking in all directions]  I'll break his teeth with this stone. Why have you left the skull and run  away? Crazy, evil dog, do you dare to get angry even with someone as brave  as me? The ocean has mounted the boar of the village and flown up to the  sky. It has conquered Ravana and has seized by force Indra's son Timingala.  Ay, castor oil tree, what did you say? "It's not true. It's not true." Is not this  cloud, with its hands as long and wide as a club, my witness? But why should  a person like me, whose bravery is renowned throughout the three worlds,  need any witnesses? This is what I'm going to do. I'll eat the leftover morsel  of meat that the dog bit into. [He eats and then looks confused.[ Ay, ay, I've  been killed by tears. [He weeps and looks.] Who is this who's beating me?  [He looks.] Evil dog, I am the nephew of someone important, as Ghatotkaca  was the nephew of Bhlmasena. Besides . . .  

My belly is full of a hundred demons  

In many guises, shapes, and sizes,  

And from my mouth come flying out  

Giant snakes and a hundred lions. (19)  

Why are they harassing me? Be kind, be kind to me, my young lords. Don't  harass me because of this morsel of meat. [He looks ahead. ] This must be  my teacher Suranandin. I'll go up to him. [He runs.]  

Pasupata: Ay, this madman is coming toward me.  

His robe is tattered and secondhand,  

His hair a wild and tangled mess,  

Around his neck a withered garland,  

His body covered with dust and ash.  

Above his head are crows and hawks,  

ready to scavenge whatever they can  

It looks as though before us walks  

A garbage heap in the form of a man. (20)

Madman: I'll approach this one. [He approaches.] My lord, please accept this  skull obtained from an excellent dog belonging to a Candala.  Pasupata: [looking with disdain] Let this be accepted by a more worthy person.  Madman: Great Brahman [approaching the Buddhist], please do me this favor.  Buddhist: [indicating the Kapalika] This Great Pasupata is more worthy.  Madman: [Approaching the Kapalika, he places the skull on the ground, circu mabulates, and falls at his feet. ] Great saint, please do me this favor. This  homage is for you.  

Kapalika: My skull!  

Devasoma: So it is!  

Kapalika: By the grace of god I have again become a true Kapalika.  Madman: You son of a slave girl, may you eat poison. [He grabs the skull and  goes off]  

Kapalika: ]chasing after him] This servant of Death is stealing my life itself!  Help me you two!  

Both: As you wish. We'll be your helpers.  

[All try to stop the madman.]  

Kapalika: Stop you, stop!  

Madman: Why are they stopping me?  

Kapalika: Give me my skull and be gone.  

Madman: You fool, can't you see that this is a gold bowl?  

Kapalika: Who would ever make a gold bowl like this?  

Madman: I tell you, this is a gold bowl made by the bastard of a goldsmith  who wears golden clothes.  

Buddhist: What are you saying?  

Madman: It's a gold bowl.  

Buddhist: Is he a madman?  

Madman: "Madman. . ." I keep hearing that word. Take this and show me the  madman. [He hands the skull to the Kapalika. ]  

Kapalika: [grabbing the skull[ He's over there hidden behind that wall. Go  quickly and follow him.  

Madman: You have been most kind.  

[The madman hastily exits.]  

Buddhist: It's a miracle! I have been saved by the success of my opponent.  Kapalika: [hugging the skull]  

Unbroken penance for years I suffered,  

And devotion to Siva alone I offered.  

Now the madman has gone away  

And you, my skull, are back, hooray! (21)  

Devasoma: My lord, when I see you today, looking like the evening reunited  with the moon, my very eyes rejoice.96 DAVI D N . LORENZE N  

Pasupata: How lucky you are.  

Kapalika: Is this not a good result for all of you?  

Pasupata: [aside] What's true is that those who have no fault need not fear.  Today this monk escaped from the mouth of the tiger, [aloud] Now that I  have been made happy by the success of my friend, I will go and wait for  the evening worship at the eastern temple of the Lord. And starting from  today. . .  

May the quarrel that once bound you two together  

Now become the source of mutual love  

As once it was when Kirata fought with Arjuna. (22)  

[The Pasupata exits.]  

Kapalika: Honorable Nagasena, if I have done you any offense, I hope you will  forgive me.  

Buddhist: Need you even ask? What can I do for you?  

Kapalika: If I have your forgiveness, what thing better than that can I request?  Buddhist: It is time for me to go.  

Kapalika: I hope I will see you again.  

Buddhist: May it be so. [He exits.]  

Kapalika: Devasoma, my love, let us go also.  

[Epilogue]  

May the sacred fires always lift up to heaven  

Oblations offered on the people's behalf.  

May the brahmans serve the Vedas and cows give milk,  

May the people be happy, each intent on his dharma.  

May King Mahendra subdue his enemies' power  

And rule for as long as the sun and moon exist. (23)

Here ends the farce entitled Drunken Games 

### 05 A Trance Healing Session with Mataji  

Kathleen M. Erndl  

Bimla Devi, or Passu Mataji (Respected Mother from village Passu) as she is called  by her clients and devotees, is a female trance healer living in a village near  Dharamsala, Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh. She is regularly possessed by the  Hindu Goddess Vaisno Devi. Mataji maintains a small temple attached to her  home, where three days a week she goes into trance and, as the Goddess Vaisno  Devi, answers questions and offers cures for people. Those who come, mostly  women, consult her for a variety of problems including mental and physical  health, family relationships, employment, and spiritual concerns.  

Possession by many types of deities and spirits, benevolent and malevolent, is  widespread among women and men throughout South Asia. Divine possession  by goddesses, primarily among women, is prevalent in the northwest part of India,  which includes Kangra, as well as in some other areas. The Sakti or divine power  of the goddess enters into (or "plays," khelti hai) and temporarily blots out the  consciousness of the human medium. While in this possession trance, the me 

dium speaks with the voice of the goddess. Afterward, most people, like Mataji,  have no memory of what they said in trance, and they return to their "normal"  state of consciousness. By word of mouth, these women begin to attract followers  who come to them for help with problems and address them as Mataji, a term  that not only means "mother" in the ordinary sense, but also "goddess." There is  a transformation that takes place through repeated possession, such that the  woman becomes more and more "goddess-like," more and more divinized. Some  of these Matajis have adopted a renunciant lifestyle and have become gurus in a  broader sense, teaching meditation to their devotees, building ashrams, and giving  discourses on bhakti (devotion) and other spiritual paths.  

I learned the details of Passu Mataji's life, a sketch of which I give here, from  her and some of her devotees. She was born around the time of Indian indepen dence (1947), the youngest of six children to an impoverished family of the  Giraths, a low-caste cultivating community of Kangra. She has no formal educa tion and has never learned to read or write. As a child, she never played with 

98 KATHLEEN M. ERNDL  

other village children but only with another little girl who was always with her,  but whom only she could see. When she told her mother about this little girl,  her mother became concerned and brought her to a healer, a harijan (untouchable  caste member) who made "tantra-mantra" on her and gave her holy water and  cardamon. After that, she "went crazy," and a wandering holy man came by her  house, saying that the Goddess had wanted to come there, but that it was con 

taminated. Her parents arranged a marriage for her when she was very young and  tried to send her off to her husband's home at about age twelve. When she was  placed in the palanquin, the Goddess entered into her and said, "don't go there.  Stay here and build a temple for me." She followed the Goddess's order and some  years later, again ordered by the Goddess, moved her temple and residence to its  present location in another village. She never married again, and characterizes  herself as "not a householder," though she does maintain a household and has  brought up several relatives' children. She is also active in the local women's  organization.  

In practical terms, Tantra has as much to do with the fulfillment of mundane  desires as with soteriological aims. The powers gained through Tantric practice  can be used for both worldly (bhukti) and spiritual (mukti) purposes. In the non dualist ontology of Tantra, these two are part of the same reality. Mataji and her  devotees are part of a broadly based grassroots religious expression, a kind of  "folk Tantra" that connects the more formal textual and esoteric Tantric traditions  with exoteric village religion.  

I present below a transcription, with a few explanatory comments, of a trance  session I recorded during field work in 1997. The original language was primarily  Hindi with some Punjabi and the local Kangri dialect, with an occasional English  word thrown in. I have not attempted to show this mix of languages in my  translation. Indian languages allow for a much greater degree of ellipsis than is  possible in English. Indirect constructions, omission of subjects and/or objects,  gender-neutral pronouns, interchangeability of singular and plural in colloquial  speech, all contribute to a discourse of vagueness that is highly appropriate to a  trance session in which information of a personal and often delicate nature is  being conveyed to devotees in a public arena where it can be overheard by ev eryone present. In my translation, I have preserved as much of this ambiguity as  English usage will allow. Mataji's linguistic register is at times highly colloquial,  at times highly formal. In order to give some sense of the flow of language in the  performance context, I have purposely not deleted the frequent repetition of stock  phrases and formulas in Mataji's trance speech. Typically, she will describe the  problem, tell the cause, prescribe a remedy, and predict the outcome. Mataji, like  other healers in the area, focuses on a personal object, such as an item of clothing  or jewelry, that belongs to the person seeking help and that is placed in front of  her at the start of the session. The reader will note that Mataji's diagnoses fall into  several categories, including sorcery (jadu tona, opari), the evil eye (nazar), and  astrological influences (graha) such as that of the inauspicious planet Saturn  (Sani), whose day, as in the West, falls on Saturday. In the case of sorcery, she 

TRANC E HEALIN G SESSIO N 99  

will never pinpoint the evildoer by name but will answer questions concerning  gender, caste, place of residence, and status within the family. The three most  common cures are cardamon seeds, holy water, and threads of three, five, or  seven colors (or sometimes plain black). When eaten or worn, these simple  blessed items carry the Goddess's Sakti (power) and function as amulets to neu 

tralize negative forces and protect against further harm. Other cures include mak ing donations, offerings to a deity, or the performance of specific rituals.

A Trance Healing Session with Mataji  

It was a chilly Sunday morning in February 1997. By eleven o'clock, about a  dozen people were seated on the veranda outside the temple. This number would  gradually swell to over fifty, as people continued to drift in. Because it was a  holiday, there were more men present than there would have been on a weekday,  about one-third of the total, and more school-age children. The devotees ranged  from Dharamsala professionals to landless laborers from neighboring villages. The  temple door was open, exposing the red-clad and garland-bedecked image of  goddess Vaisno Devi. As devotees arrived, they would wash their hands at the 

100 KATHLEE N M . ERND L  

nearby tap, approach the Goddess with folded hands, and bow in front of her.  After a few minutes, Mataji emerged from an adjacent building, wearing an or ange-red flowered salwar-kameez, red shawl, and a red stocking cap on her head.  She greeted me, as well as a middle-aged man who went inside with her. She  called me in a few minutes later to sit next to her. She said something about a  tape recorder. I had been there several times before without recording anything  and asked if this time I could use it. Both she and the man readily agreed. I said  that if anyone objected, I would turn it off. The man said no one minded. But I  said that since people were asking personal things, that if someone objected, I  would turn it off while that person was there. Mataji agreed, but, in fact, no one  seemed to mind. The people outside, who had been sitting in a line along the  wall, turned and sat lined up in rows facing the temple. Mataji started out by  leading a devotional song to the Goddess, after asking someone outside to bring  the dholak (a drum) and chaine (a tong-like percussion instrument) from inside  the house. People from the congregation had already placed their "question" items  and offerings of money on the floor in front of her. Those who came later entered  the temple, touched her feet, placed their things in front of her, and took a seat  outside. The congregation sang several devotional songs, a few of which are trans lated below, for about half an hour, after which Mataji gradually went into trance,  her head and body shaking to the beat of the music.  

Song (repeated many times)  

Give us darsan, Vaisno Mata  

The whole congregation has come  

With cries of "Victory," we have come  

Give us darsan, Vaisno Mata  

Mataji begins "playing," her body shaking in time with the music, her hair flying  around her face, her eyes glazed over. The devotees sing a new song, welcoming  the appearance of the Goddess.  

Song (repeated many times)  

Riding on a yellow lion,  

Look, the Mother-Queen has come.  

O, Mother we've built a temple for you  

We wave the chowrie before you.  

Look, the Mother-Queen has come  

The Lion-rider has come  

The Gracious One has come.  

The five Pandavas built a temple 

TRANCE HEALIN G SESSIO N 101  

Arjuna waved a chowrie  

Look, the Lion-rider has come  

Riding on a yellow lion, the Mother-Queen has come.  

Body decorated with a beautiful gown, O Mother  

A saffron mark adorning her brow  

Look, the Mother-Queen has come  

Riding on a yellow lion, the Queen-Mother has come  

The Flame One has come.  

O Mother, we offer betel leaf and nut, flags, coconuts, and songs.  Look, the Mother-Queen has come  

The Gracious One has come  

My Mother has come.  

Song (repeated many times)  

Now she's come, the Lion-rider  

Now she's come, the Lion-rider  

Now she's come, the Gracious One  

Now she's come, the Gracious One  

Get darsan now, devotees  

Now she's come, the Lion-rider  

Now she's come, the Lion-rider  

Say: Victory to the true court!  

Mataji, still in trance, stops shaking and begins to speak. The singing stops im mediately. She is now fully possessed by the Goddess and signals her presence  by saying something that sounds like jay kares, jay karakand," a phrase that no  one, including her close devotees and Mataji herself, could decode beyond the  word jay, which means victory and is part of such slogans as "victory to the  Mother." I have translated this utterance, which punctuates all of Mataji's trance talk simply as "victory." She will point out one by one the items devotees have  placed in front of her, make the diagnosis, and prescribe the remedy, until all the  questions have been answered. Each devotee approaches Mataji in turn when her  or his item has been selected, touches her feet, engages in a brief verbal exchange,  then steps away. Each will return at the end of the session to receive the blessed  articles that Mataji has prescribed as remedies. The middle-aged man, referred to  below as her "Helper" steps in from time to time to pick up the items and call  devotees inside.  

QUESTION ONE  

Mataji: Victory! Victory! Devotees, for I have come. Victory! The one with the  red cloth is here to ask . . . 

102 KATHLEE N M. ERND L  

Helper: Whose red cloth is this?  

Woman: It's mine, Ji.  

Mataji: Victory! Victory! Victory! Devotees, you want to ask about your dis tress.  

Woman: Yes,JT.  

Mataji: Victory! Because you want to ask, "Why is there this distress; what is  the matter?"  

Woman: Yes,Ji.  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, you have already been to doctors. Even so, there  has been no improvement. Therefore, you want to ask, "Why is it like this?  What is the reason? Is it my own fault or is it someone else's doing?"  Woman: Yes,Ji.  

Mataji: Victory, victory, O devotees, victory! There's pain in your head. Vic tory! Pain in your stomach. Victory! Your body feels as though someone has  beaten it. You don't feel like eating. You don't even feel like talking to any one. You think, "I should leave everything and go off somewhere. I should  just go and sit somewhere alone." For this reason, you want to ask, "Why is  this? What's the reason? Is it my own fault, or is it someone else's doing?"  Woman: Yes,JI.  

Mataji: Victory! Innocent daughter, this is a mighty enemy's doing. Because  of this, you have already wasted your time in so many doctors' houses. Even  so, there has been no cure. For this, take a five-colored string, cardamon,  and holy water. It's the enemy's might! It was fed to you in your food. The  one who fed you is a widow. Victory! Next question . . .  

QUESTION 2  

Mataji: Victory! The cloth in the middle . . .  

Helper: This one? {picking up one of several pieces of clothing]  Mataji: In front of it; the second one you lifted up.

Mataji: Victory! Have you come to ask about your distress?  Man: Yes,Ji.  

Mataji: Innocent son, how much distress have you borne for three years? In nocent son, you have already wasted time in so many doctors' houses. There  is pain in your chest. Victory! It is also as if a load has fallen on your mind.  You don't ever feel like talking with anyone. You don't even feel like eating  your food. Your heart says, "I should leave everything and go off somewhere  and sit alone." For this reason, you want to ask, "Why is this? What is the  reason? Is it my own fault or someone else's doing?" Innocent son, there  had also been a quarrel over property.  

Man: How many years ago, Ma?  

Mataji: Victory! Victory! Innocent son, five years have passed. 

TRANC E HEALIN G SESSIO N 103  

Man: Five years?  

Mataji: Why not? Victory! For this, innocent son . . . Victory! The one who  did it is a woman. The one who made and brought it is a man. This deed  has been done by those of low caste. For this take cardamon, holy water,  and a seven-colored thread.

Man: Yes, Ji.  

Mataji: Innocent son, the reason is . . . Victory! It's because the one who did  it has put you through an ordeal.  

Man: Is the one who did it one of us [a relative] or an outsider?  Mataji: Victory! It's an outsider, not a relative.  

Man: Is it someone from here or from back there?  

Mataji: Victory! Someone from back there, not from here.  

Man: What's the cure, now?  

Mataji: Innocent son, for this, take some cardamon, and you can drink holy  water.  

Man: Mataji, will there be any happy outcome from this?  

Mataji: Innocent son, why not? But you must first reap some impure fruit.  Man: All right, Mataji, whatever has happened to me, has it born fruit yet?  Mataji: Innocent son, it is best.  

Man: Mataji, will there be good fortune?  

Mataji: Why not? After this is over, you will definitely benefit. Victory! Vic tory! Next question . . . The handkerchief. . .  

QUESTION 4  

Helper: Whose handkerchief is this?  

Mataji: The one you started to pick up . . . Victory! Victory! Victory! Have  you come to ask about your health?  

Woman: Mataji, it's not myself I'm asking about.  

Mataji: You're asking about someone else. You've come asking about health  and work. Why are you troubled?  

Woman: Mataji, it's about my child. It's about his studies.  

Mataji: Why are you troubled? What is the matter?  

Woman: He can't focus his mind.

Mataji: Innocent daughter, I am Kanyakumarl, the Virgin Goddess. I can figure  it out for myself. Victory! How much trouble he's gotten into! Innocent  daughter, he embraces knowledge then breaks away from it. Now he doesn't  even want to look at it.  

Woman: Yes, Mataji, it's just like that.  

Mataji: Victory! Sometimes he feels like this: "I'll leave everyone and go and  sit alone."  

Woman: Yes, that's it, Mataji.  

Mataji: Darkness has come over his eyes. So, you want to ask, "Why is this  happening? Is it our fault, or is it someone else's doing?" Victory!  Woman: Victory to the Mother!  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, the reason for this is the action of a mighty enemy.  Woman: Mataji, he's quarrelsome . . .  

Mataji: He's been uprooted from knowledge. For this, give him cardamon, holy  water, and a three-color thread. And, innocent daughter, make a book do nation on Tuesday.  

Woman: To whom, Mataji?  

Mataji: To anyone.  

Another Woman: To anyone. Give a book to a child or to a poor person on a  Tuesday during the month of Jyestha [May-June] or any Tuesday.  Mataji: Any Tuesday of any month. Victory! Take a three-color thread, car damon, and holy water. Victory!

Mataji: Innocent daughter, your legs are numb and as if lifeless.  Woman: Yes,JI, Mataji.  

Mataji: Sometimes you can't even tell if they're on the ground or in the sky.  Because of this, you want to ask, "Why does this happen? What's the matter?"  Woman: Mataji, the pain is terrible.  

Mataji: Victory! Sometimes when you put your foot on the ground, it feels as  is your leg is breaking, the right leg.  

Woman: Yes, Mataji.  

Mataji: Victory, victory! Below the knee, there is a lot of pain. Innocent daugh ter, the reason is the bonds of karma pressing down on you. For this, take  a black-colored thread. You'll get happiness.  

Woman: Mataji, will my legs get better?  

Mataji: Take some pure oil, put on the thread, then after eight days, apply the  oil.

Woman: Yes, Ji.  

Mataji: When he comes into the house, it's obvious that he wants to go away.  And it's as if the people at home are enemies. But he'll sit and talk with  outsiders in a friendly way, as though they were family. Therefore, you want  to ask, "Why is this happening? Is it one's own fault or someone else's do 

ing?" Innocent daughter, this is a mighty enemy's doing. For this, take some  cardamon. Victory! In the back, there is a cloth . . .

Mataji: Victory! It's a question about a boy. You want to ask about his future.  Man: Yes, Ji, Mataji. He doesn't focus his mind on his studies.  Mataji: Victory! Innocent son, with him it's, "If it's to be done today, then I'll  

do it tomorrow. If it's to be done tomorrow, then the following morning."  That's the way it is with him these days. Therefore, you want to ask, "Why  is this going on with him? What is the reason? Is it one's own fault, or is it  someone else's doing?" Innocent son, the reason for this is that it's a mighty  enemy's doing.

Mataji: Victory! Victory! Innocent son, I am Kanyakumarr, the Virgin God dess, I can speak for myself. There will be a little obstacle, but he will defi nitely obtain work. . . . Next question . . . Victory! A watch on this side . . .  

QUESTION 24  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, you want to ask about your future, whether your  future will be bright or not. Innocent daughter, it will be bright. Victory! 

112 KATHLEEN M. ERNDL  

Innocent daughter, your studies are a bit shaky. Innocent daughter, offer a  flower at the time of twilight. You will have good fortune. . . . Ahead, there's  a checked handkerchief . . .  

QUESTION 25  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, you want to ask about your distress. You want to  ask, "Why am I experiencing distress; what is the matter?" Victory! For,  innocent daughter, the affairs of the household were going on as usual, but  all of a sudden, there is this. That's why you want to ask, "When things have  been peaceful, why has an obstacle befallen us? Must we continue to bear  this difficulty, or will we again have peace?" There is affliction in your home;  there is no prosperity.  

Woman: Yes, Mataji.  

Mataji: It comes from one side and goes off in another. One can't tell where  it's coming from or how it's snatched away. Therefore, you want to ask, "Is  this our own fault or someone else's doing?" Victory! Innocent daughter,  this is an enemy's might over your household. Innocent daughter, there is  no shortage of money coming into the house, but no one knows how it is  all spent.  

Woman: Yes,JI.  

Mataji: Victory! Sometimes it seems as though someone is walking around.  Whenever you lay your hand on a cooking pot, it becomes empty. Innocent  daughter, the harijan caste's mountain spirit has been cast upon you. That's  why there is no brightness in your work.  

Woman: Mataji, who cast it on us?  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, the casters are from nearby. They're not from far  away. They're of your own caste.  

Woman's husband: Are they from our very house?  

Mataji: They're from your very own caste. They work in a job. Have an eighty four-part fire sacrifice and recitation done. Take cardamon and holy water.  Woman: Mataji, will it be all right?  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, why not? .. . In front, there's a "wide bangle" ques tion . . .  

Woman's husband: Mataji, for how many days will we have to do the sacrifice  and recitiation?

QUESTION 26  

Man: Mataji, will the work I am doing turn out well or not?  Mataji: Victory! Innocent son, why not? Even this month has gone well.  Man: Mataji, this month has gone very badly.  

Mataji: All right, innocent son, just yesterday something came up. 

TRANC E HEALIN G SESSIO N 113  

Man: Mataji, nothing came up with anybody yesterday.  

Mataji: What do you mean, nothing came up? Didn't something happen with  a certain man?  

Man: Yes, Ji. There was a little something. Mataji, what will come to pass with  him?  

Mataji: Innocent son, there will be good fortune.  

Man: Mataji, my aunt has received a letter. What will happen to her?  Mataji: For the time being, nothing.  

Man: Mataji, should we hold out hope or not?  

Mataji: For now, there's nothing.  

Man: Oh, misfortune.  

Mataji: Innocent son, there will be good fortune. . . . Next question, handker chief . . .  

QUESTION 27  

Mataji: Victory! You want to ask about your distress. Victory! You also want  to ask about work, and you want to ask, "Will the work I am doing turn out  well or not?" Innocent son, what a misfortune has happened! You are also  having trouble getting a position. Innocent son, victory! No one has done  anything or sent anything to you. This is the astrological influence of Rahu  [dragon's head] and Saturn. In the midst of this there has been and will be  trickery by friends and quarrels with your kinsmen. Innocent son, make a  bundle of mustard greens, a bundle of sesame seeds, and a bundle of wheat.  Make these three bundles, and you will have good fortune.  

Man: Mataji, when will there be a result?  

Mataji: Innocent son, there will be a result in March or April. You will get a  position. . . . Next question . . . this cloth . . .  

QUESTION 28  

Mataji: Victory! Victory! Innocent daughter, you want to ask about your fu ture. And you want to ask why you are having difficulty concerning your  future. Innocent daughter, your attention is not fixed on your studies. Vic tory! If work comes up in the morning, you leave it until evening, and in  the morning the same thing happens again. Innocent daughter, the evil eye  has been cast on you. Innocent daughter, for this take a three-colored thread,  cardamon, and holy water.  

Girl: For how many days?  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, for eight days. Victory! It will definitely bear fruit.  

QUESTION 29  

Mataji: A "leaf question.  

Helper: Who put this leaf here? 

114 KATHLEE N M. ERND L  

Mataji: It belongs to a woman wearing a Coca Cola-colored suit. [A middle aged peasant woman wearing a brown outfit steps forward.] It's a question  about the household. You want to ask a question about an animal of the  household.  

Woman: Yes.  

Mataji: Victory! Victory! Innocent daughter, there is the disappointment of  "white water." [ This is an infection that prevents a cow from conceiving. ] There fore, you want to ask, "Will the hope that we have held out be fulfilled or  not?" Innocent daughter, the cow's womb is softening. For this, take black  neem leaves and holy water and give them to her. The "white water" will go  away. . . . On this side, a silver ring . . .  

QUESTION 30  

Mataji: Victory! Victory! You want to ask about distress; you want to ask why  this distress is occurring.  

Woman [who has already asked a question] :Yes, Ji.  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, I have already given you a remedy. Do it, and you  will have good fortune.  

Woman: Mataji, this is a question for someone else.  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, you want to ask about distress. Victory! There is  pain in the stomach, pain in the head, nervousness. The right side of the  body is numb.  

Woman: Yes,JI.  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, someone has bound her with coercion. Victory!  For this, give cardamon, holy water.  

Woman: Mataji, who has bound her with coercion?  

Mataji: The binder is from another jat, from another caste.  Woman: Should we give it [the cure] to her now?  

Mataji: Why not? There will be good fortune. Devotees, I am gone!  

Mataji shudders and then relaxes. Her eyes gradually refocus as she takes a few  deep breaths, straightens her clothing, and smooths her hair. She smiles at those  around her and begins to greet the devotees who have lined up outside. She  knows many by name and inquires about their family members. One by one they  come into the temple to collect the items she has prescribed. She dispenses the  cardamon seeds in small newspaper-wrapped packets and cuts the threads in  neck-length sizes. The holy water, which earlier in the day has bathed the stone  Goddess image, has collected in a small chamber underneath. Mataji scoops up  some of this water, mixing it into a bucket of tap water. She then taps it with a  flower while reciting a mantra under her breath. At Mataji's direction, the helper  uses this water to fill containers that devotees have brought. Mataji distributes  prasad (consecrated offerings) of candies or bananas to everyone. Some of the  devotees circumambulate her temple or visit the adjacent temple to Lord Siva. 

TRANC E HEALIN G SESSIO N 115  

Some stay awhile to chat with her, ask advice, or seek a blessing for their chil dren. Others leave monetary offerings. A family that has traveled some distance  unpacks their lunch and sits down to eat on the veranda. When everyone has  left, Mataji tidies up her temple, says a prayer to the Goddess, and retires to her  own quarters.

### 06 The Consecration of the Monastic Compound at  Mount Koya by Kukai  

David L. Gardiner  

Although Japanese Buddhism is probably best known in popular circles for its  rich tradition of Zen teachings and practices, from a historical perspective it is  plausible to contend that no form has had more of a pervasive impact on the  overall development of Japanese religion than the esoteric or Tantric Buddhist  schools known in Japan as mikkyo ("secret teaching"). Mikkyo was first formally  represented in the Tendai and Shingon schools founded in the early ninth century,  but its roots are discernible in the eighth century and its branches, to continue  the metaphor, extend throughout virtually all the subsequent schools that  emerged in the Kamakura period (around the thirteenth century), in particular  in the Zen, Pure Land, and Nichiren schools, where its presence bore significant  and recognizable fruits. Among the variety of ways mikkyo seems to have influ enced religious expressions other than those formally identifiable as Tantric are  the inclusion of elaborate rites with a profusion of liturgical paraphernalia, the  employment of dharanis or mantras in recitation of prayers, and the utilization  of some form of painted mandala diagrams. In addition to these more concrete  instances, one might add the basic religious paradigm that mikkyo offered, which  encompassed elements such as the perfect identity of practitioner and Buddha (in  body, speech, as well as mind) and the generally affirmative view of the ordinary  world as being a manifestation of the sacred body of the Buddha.  

Kukai and Mount Koya  

Kukai was the founder of the Shingon school, which has long stood as the most  exclusively Tantric form of Buddhist practice in Japan. Shingon means "true  word," and is derived from the Chinese"translation of the Sanskrit word mantra.  Although the Tendai and other Buddhist schools incorporated Tantric elements 

120 DAVI D L. GARDINE R  

into their study and practice, the Shingon school prides itself on being less eclectic  than any other. The two texts translated below chronicle ceremonies associated  with Kukai's founding of the monastery named Kongobuji (Temple of the Vajra  Peak, named after the Vajrasekhara sutra) on Mount Koya. Of the various mon 

asteries at which Kukai lived and worked, none held as much significance for him  as Kongobuji. The temple complex, together with the surrounding community of  Koyasan that occupies the top of Mount Koya, has remained as an important  center for Japanese religion for nearly 1,200 years. Koyasan is located two hours  south by train from Osaka in the hills of Wakayama prefecture. It continues today  to draw around one million tourists a year, many of whom perform a pilgrimage  to Kukai's tomb, where many believe the master (some call him a saint) still sits  in meditation awaiting the future Buddha, or to the gravesite of a relative - for  the mountaintop houses probably the largest, and surely the grandest, cemetery  in all Japan. Mount Koya is one of Japan's greatest holy spots and, because it has  served for many centuries as a thriving religious center, it stands as a repository  of a fabulous cultural and artistic heritage.  

The first text below touches briefly on Kukai's relation to the mountain. It notes  that after he had returned from studying esoteric Buddhism in the Tang capital  of China for two years, he sought far and wide for a suitable location to build a  monastery devoted to its practice. In a letter he wrote in 816 C.E. requesting the  Japanese emperor to bestow the land to him, he indicated that he came to know  the area when he had passed through it during his younger peripatetic days as a  mountain ascetic practitioner. Although it is accurate to say that he founded the  monastic compound of Kongobuji, it would be misleading (though in accordance  with popular legend) to assert that Kukai "discovered" Mount Koya as a holy spot.  The mountains of Yoshino just to the east had for generations been favorite  grounds for practitioners of various spiritual disciplines, and it is clear that Mount  Koya had seen the footsteps of many a seeker. Kukai indicates in his writings that  he may have employed some geomantic methods for discerning that it was a suit able location for a monastery. Yet it is also evident that the simple facts that it is a  large basin of approximately four square miles at the top of a three-thousand-foot  peak, with good running water and sufficient distance from the urban life of either  Nara or Kyoto (a few days' travel away), were all points in its favor.  

The two texts translated below chronicle rites that mark the establishment of  the grounds as a monastery. The texts themselves are not dated, but other reliable  documents that can be dated, and that are likely to have been produced shortly  before and after these rites, indicate that the rites must have taken place in 818  or 819. In his 816 letter requesting the emperor to permit him to use the mountain  for a monastery, Kukai indicated that there were not enough religious centers  situated in quiet mountains in Japan. He cited the scripture Dainichi-kyo (Mahd 

vairocana-sutra) as recommending isolated mountain spots as ideal for the practice  of meditation. A text dated one month after Kukai's request purportedly docu ments the emperor's permission to build a center, but the authenticity of this  letter has been called into question on several points. Nevertheless, various cor-

CONSECRATIO N AT MOUN T KOYA 121  

respondences reveal that Kukai dispatched some of his disciples to the mountain  in 818 to begin to construction there and that he intended to follow them shortly  afterward. Letters he sent to acquaintances in Kyoto and elsewhere reveal that he  resided on the mountain for about eight months from the winter of 818 until the  summer of 819, and it is likely that the present texts were composed during this  period. This was twelve years after he had returned from his studies in China.  

When Kukai returned in 806 from Tang China, where he had studied as a  Japanese government-sponsored "foreign student," he was not well known in  court circles. It took several years for him to develop contacts with important  senior monks (such as the Tendai founder Saicho), influential court officials, and  eventually the Emperor Saga, whose interest in things that were vogue in Chinese  literary and cultural circles is legendary. Before establishing his center on Mount  Koya, he did manage the affairs of a few temples near the capital, such as the  Jingoji on Mount Takao. Jingoji served Kukai well, as it was an older temple with  strong connections to established court families. While residing there he per formed two very significant initiation ceremonies into Shingon Tantric practice,  which scores of well-known monks and lay aristocrats attended. This allowed him  both to gain some repute as a new specialist in an attractive tradition, and to  gather some able disciples. But it seems that for many years Kukai desired to build  a place far from the busy life of the capital that would be dedicated solely to the  training of students in Shingon practice. In fact, a letter survives in which he tells  a friend of a vow that he had made en route back from China to do just that. It  appears that when his ship had encountered a severe ocean storm, he had prom ised the gods that if he were allowed to arrive safely in Japan he would generate  great benefits in the world by establishing a center devoted to the practice of the  Tantric Buddhism he had learned in China. Other letters also indicate that his  building of the complex at the top of Mount Koya was indeed an expression of  his commitment to realize this vow.  

The construction of the Kongobuji monastery, however, did not proceed  quickly. Its distance from the capital, coupled with Kukai's many responsibilities  there, permitted neither the procurement of supplies nor the management of labor  to run smoothly. By the time of Kukai's death in 835, it is not likely that more  than a few buildings had been completed: a stupa, a worship hall, and a residence  for monks, From 823, Kukai became engaged in supervising the completion of  the Toji temple in the capital. The construction of this important temple at the  southern entrance to Kyoto had languished for several years, and the invitation  to Kukai to revitalize the project was both a clear indication of his growing rep utation and a stepping stone to other obligations in the capital. His correspon 

dence reveals that, as his duties in Kyoto expanded due to his newly found prom inence, he felt frustrated at becoming increasingly distanced from his dream to  build a center on Mount Koya. In 832, he led Kongobuji's first large ceremony  of offering to the Buddha, known as the mandoe or ceremony of ten thousand  lamps, a ritual that had a long tradition in major Japanese Buddhist temples of  Nara. Soon afterward he pleaded with the court to be released from his respon-

122 DAVI D L . GARDINE R  

sibilities in the capital - he had recently been appointed in Kyoto to the high ranking position of a chief supervisor of monks - in order that he might return  to his retreat at Mount Koya. One of his reasons for requesting retirement was  his ailing health, and indeed it was not long after his return there in 834 that he  passed away, on the mountain, in the third month of 835, at the age of sixty-two.  The supervision of the construction was left to his disciple Shinzen, who made  much progress during the next twenty years.  

The Consecration Rite  

The particular ritual for which these texts stand as our introduction is known in  Japanese as kekkai, meaning "to bind a realm." The Japanese term is derived from  the Chinese translation of the Sanskrit sima-bandha. Buddhist texts on vinaya, or  monastic rituals and regulations, apparently used the term in non- or pre-Tantric  contexts to refer to the prescribed rules serving to formally separate the monastic  community from lay communities in terms of such categories as spatial demar 

cation and restrictions regarding clothing and food. In Japanese history, kekkai  has generally denoted the divisions between monastic and lay territory. There are  signposts known as kekkai stones that stand at the entrance to some temple  buildings (especially ones set aside for assiduous contemplative practice), which  frequently contain the engraved admonition that women, alcohol, and garlic are  not permitted beyond the sign. The term may also refer to the railing (commonly  wooden) within a temple building that separates the altar, on which Buddha  images usually stand, from the surrounding space for worshipers. The kekkai thus  demarcates sacred and profane space, and might be considered in the Japanese  context to circumscribe an area in which the healing/saving power of deity is seen  to be concentrated.  

These two texts were most likely recited as prayers before or during the con secration rites. Furthermore, much in the way that the Shinto tradition recites  norito (formal prayers to a diety) under similar circumstances, the texts are ad dressed to deities in the form of announcements of what will transpire. The core  of this announcement, however, is the actual invitation of the deities to enter the  realm under consideration, thereby sacralizing and protecting it. The kekkai rite  described by Kukai for the founding of Kongobuji declares the bounded realm to  be an area with a radius of seven ri, or approximately two to three miles. Although  some scholars have noted that this distance seems to fit quite naturally with certain  geographical features of the area surrounding Mount Koya, it is also a distance  that has some precedence in Buddhist literature. Chinese translations of the bi ography of Sakyamuni Buddha give an account of how the naga (a serpentine  deity) king Mucilinda made a gigantic umbrella-like covering that protected the  Buddha, which extended for a radius of seven ri (about two miles). There also  exist Chinese Tantric texts that describe rites aimed at protecting an area desig nated by the same distance. Some kekkai rites performed in Japan prior to Kukai's 

CONSECRATIO N AT MOUN T KOYA 123  

day were known as "binding the realm of the nation" (kokudo kekkai), and seem  to have had a protective purpose, albeit less explicitly related to Tantric texts and  deities than was Kukai's kekkai. Most Japanese encyclopedias note the rites Kukai  performed for Kongobuji in their entries for kekkai. The Shingon tradition rec 

ognizes three types, or scales, of kekkai. The largest is the "binding the realm of  the nation," and some scholars say that the rites in the texts below fall into this  category because of the vast area they designate (this interpretation implies that  "nation" might simply indicate "land"). The two other kekkai rites are for a temple  building and for an altar within such a building.  

In Indian Buddhist Tantric ritual, the term sima-bandha sometimes referred to  "binding" the area of a horizontal mandala platform, which was often constructed  on a raised earthen surface. Pillars known as kilas were inserted into the circum ference of the platform and a multicolored thread was tied around their tips to  create a ring around the platform. There were also rites known as sima-bandha  that purified a given area by expelling evil forces from the ground level, the air  above the ground, and even from the area beneath the ground. Kukai's texts follow  a similar pattern because their central aim seems to be the elimination of obstruc tive spirits from the area and the invitation of helpful ones to stay. It is worthy  of note that the native Japanese Shinto tradition also uses the word "binding"  (musubi) to refer to the demarcation of sacred space.  

Related Texts and Deities  

Apart from their overall purpose, and the fact that the second ceremony took  seven days and involved a number of deities named by him, we have little concrete  knowledge about the actual rites performed by Kukai. The primary deity of the  second text is Kundali, who is called a "knowledge king" (vidydrdja in Sanskrit,  myoo in Japanese); Kukai indicates that he will rely on a "Kundali rite" for this  consecration. There are a variety of Chinese texts containing rites that center on  this deity, including one written by Amoghavajra, the great Tantric adept of the  Tang dynasty who instructed Kukai's master Huiguo. Kundali is said to manifest  a fierce or wrathful appearance and is known as a destroyer of obstacles. In the  Buddhist Tantric symbol system, he is often connected with Vajragarbha Bodhi sattva as well as Ratnasambhava Buddha, and is associated with the southern  direction.  

A number of other deities are mentioned in the second text, including Sakya muni Buddha, Avalokitesvara, and the Medicine Buddha from the Buddhist tra dition; the non-Buddhist Brahma and Indra; other unnamed heavenly beings (ten  in Japanese, a common rendering of the Sanskrit deva), and a variety of Japanese  spirits, most notably the souls of the imperial line and the ancestors of members  of the court. The rite targets in particular the enemies of the Buddha-dharma  known as the vinayakas, who are depicted as potential obstructors to the spread  of Kukai's Shingon practice, in opposition to the aforenamed deities, who are 

124 DAVI D L . GARDINE R  

called upon as protectors. The vinayakas are commonly portrayed in the Buddhist  literature as opponents of the Dharma. Twice Kukai repeats the phrase that the  vinayaka, who destroy the true Dharma, and other maleficent spirits should get  out of his newly established grounds to the distance of seven ri.  

The Mandala  

Because both texts refer to the Shingon Buddhist mandala, the concept needs  some elaboration. The first text begins with a proclamation to the "oceanlike  assembly" of the two great mandalas, which are the Diamond and Womb Realms.  These mandalas are often represented in colorful painted form with intricate geo 

metrical designs that incorporate myriad deities. In short, the mandalas are visual  representations of two simultaneous, overlapping aspects of the enlightened mind  variously described either as emptiness and form, wisdom and compassion, or  subject and object. Essential to a proper understanding of these mandalas is the  recognition that they are symbols for actual realities - pictorial embodiments of  dimensions of the experience of a buddha. They represent a dimension of awak ening from which a practitioner is guided, from the buddha's side so to speak - and toward which s/he developes through spiritual aspiration and specific meth 

ods. In essence, the Shingon practitioner is taught to believe that the mandala  represents an as yet unmanifested dimension of his/her own experience: an origi nal buddhahood residing within. Thus the painted form, together with the vi sualizations, prayers, and ritual gestures of the contemplative regime, serve as a  catalyst to this potential manifestation, which could be described as an inner  transformation. The mandala can thus be understood both as a means and an  end of religious practice. Kukai's use of the term mandala focuses on its role as  a description of the sacrality or sacredness of the world of enlightened experience,  a sacrality that manifests when the true purity of one's mind is realized. At the  same time, one can say that the sacrality of a geographical realm is also a potency  that already resides within the land, which is made manifest in conjunction with  an individual's own spiritual realization. Speaking of the mandala in both of these  senses - as both catalyst and aim - Kukai writes in the first text of his "trans mission" of the esoteric Buddhist teachings (which are also called a mandala) to  India and then ultimately to Japan, that "Mafmvairocana Buddha, the great com passionate one, enjoying for himself the taste of the equality that is enlightenment,  was saddened by the plight of the beings in the six realms of rebirth. And so it  was that the thunder of his wisdom that is one with reality trembled throughout  the Dharma realm, and the secret mandala was thereby transmitted to our world."  

When later in the text he mentions how he "safely returned [from China] with  the two mandalas of the Diamond and the Womb realms," it is to the actual  paintings on cloth that he refers. A little later he again mentions them by saying  that he intends to "establish both the great mandalas" on Mount Koya. But here  it seems that he is indicating not so much the paintings, nor even their trans 

mogrification into the statues inside stupas that did take place on the mountain, 

CONSECRATIO N A T MOUN T KOYA 125  

but rather more significantly the actual engagement in the practice of the reali zation of these sacred realms of experience within the practitioner. It was this  practice at the heart of the Shingon tradition that Kukai wished to establish at  Mount Koya. And so it was natural for him to regard a location that was dedicated  to such noble aims as a sacred space.  

But the concept of the sacred space of the mandala can extend beyond that of  just the immediate religious precinct of Mount Koya. It is equally likely that Kukai  believed that by "establishing the two mandates" at Kongobuji he was creating a  

sacred center for all of Japan, thereby consecrating the entire land by his act. The  area around Mount Koya was already in Kukai's time a popular site for practi tioners of asceticism, but its transformation into a major center of esoteric Bud dhist practice from the early ninth century onward represented the emergence of  a remarkably visible "power spot" in Japan. Earlier sacred mountains of Buddhist  history easily come to mind: China's Tian-tai and Wu-tai mountains, as well as  the holy Grdhrakuta in India where the Buddha himself is said to have preached.  In the case of Wu-tai shan, where the Tantric master Bu-kong (Amoghavajra)  established a center for a national cult of the bodhisattva of wisdom Manjusri, we  may see something like a model for Kukai's vision for Mount Koya, which became  one of Japan's most sacred mountains. An irony in this case might be that, instead  of a heavenly bodhisattva such as Manjusri serving as the focus as in the case of  Wu-tai shan, at Koya, beside some interest in a cult devoted to the future Buddha  Maitreya in which Kukai himself displayed some zeal, the main object of worship  assuring the locale's sacrality became the holy relic of Kukai's own body, which  many faithful still believe remains in meditative equipoise today.  

The second text focuses on the "Assembly of the Dharma Altar," where Kukai  states that for one week he would, in order to consecrate the realm, offer worship  to the buddhas of all directions (throughout the reaches of the universe) and to  other deities. The title of this text indicates that it was written for the kekkai of  the "altar place" (danjo), an expression that connotes the platform on which  various deity statues are placed as a three-dimensional mandala. In this case  the meaning of mandala is more concrete. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the  sense here of an altar as a horizontal platform for the mandala, which was  the original style in early Tantric Buddhism in India, may resonate better with  the broader spiritual sense of mandala, in both a visual and a somatic (because  three-dimensional) sense, than does the vertically hanging painted form. It is also  noteworthy that in spite of the second text's apparent focus on consecrating an  altar, the area said to be "bound" by the rite consists nevertheless of a radius of  seven ri.  

Conclusions  

The esoteric Buddhist rites to which these texts refer, related as they are to the  consecration of religious space, may in some sense be considered magical or at  least apotropaic, a term that indicates the warding off of evil forces by ritual 

1 2 6 DAVI D L. GARDINE R  

means. But equally characteristic of these and similar esoteric Buddhist rites is  the invocation of beneficial forces to protect the realm. It is commonplace to  acknowledge the extent to which the emergence of Buddhist Tantra introduced  entirely new rites into the repertoire of Buddhist monastic specialists. Nonethe 

less, we know that the historical Buddha affirmed the existence of spiritual beings,  whether of the heavenly or ghostly realms. Biographies also report that part of  his daily routine included the teaching of deities that came for instruction in the  Dharma. We also know that he acknowledged the effectiveness of particular in 

cantations (pantos) for protection against harmful animals. But we do not possess  any accounts of his performing rites like the ones Kukai documents here, whose  aim is to invoke and expel spiritual forces from the sahgha residence. However,  without going back to the lifetime of the Buddha, a period for which we have  little historical evidence, it is possible to confirm that certain beliefs inherent in  Kukai's rites, in particular those regarding the efficacy that monastic rituals may  have over the spirit realms, can be traced to an early stage in Indian Buddhism.  We know, for example, that monks (even the more scholastically trained, learned  ones) often performed and sponsored rites to benefit the spirits of their ancestors.  Recent research reveals that, contrary to a common scholarly misconception that  the practice of ancestor veneration entered Buddhism only after the religion had  been transported to China, and equally contrary to the normative textual descrip tions of monastic regulations, Indian Buddhist monks engaged in rituals that  aimed to "manipulate" spiritual beings and ancestors. Thus, regardless of whatever  Buddhist monks may have written about what they ought to have been doing,  we can verify that they did perform rituals for the benefit of spirits.  

Kukai also wrote many texts contained in the Shoryoshu (a collection of his  miscellaneous writings from which the present texts are taken) that commemorate  rites performed on behalf of persons recently deceased. However, the rites dis cussed in the present texts include references not only to ancestral spirits - in  this case of the imperial family and members of the court - but to a variety of  "heavenly" beings (many of Indian origin), as well as to autochthonous spirits of  Japan. In fact, in all of Kukai's writings that document rituals, those translated  below appear to be the only two in which he mentions such spirits. There must  have been some great significance to the fact that it was only in the consecration  of the monastic compound at Mount Koya that he chose to call upon such spirits  for aid. One explanation for this may be found in the striking parallels between  these rites performed by Kukai and similar rites for the consecration of an area  that are central to the native Shinto traditions that he surely knew well. This  significance is clearly mirrored today in the presence on Mount Koya, at the heart  of the compound near the central Great Stupa, of a large shrine dedicated to the  local deity known as Koya Myojin, where rites continue to be performed on a  daily basis. It is justifiable to conclude that the symbolic and cosmic acts of  consecration and invocation are to be renewed on a continual basis, albeit perhaps  on a smaller scale.  

The two documents translated below are preserved in a collection of Kukai's 

CONSECRATION AT MOUNT KOYA 127  

writings known as the Shoryoshu (sometimes read Seireishu). In most printed edi tions, they correspond to the texts numbered 99 and 100. The Shoryoshu is a  collection of over one hundred poems, letters, documents commemorating rituals  (as in the present case), and other miscellaneous materials. Although the Shoryoshu  does not contain any of Kukai's major doctrinal works, many of its texts portray  esoteric Buddhist theories as refracted through the lens of actual practice, thereby  revealing how Shingon Buddhism took shape in its initial stages, during his life time. The Shoryoshu is thus an important historical resource for understanding  the concrete means by which Kukai propagated Shingon Buddhism. The trans lations here are based on texts 99 and 100 of Katsumata Shunkyo's Kobodaishi  Chosaku Zenshu, vol. 3 (Tokyo: Sankibo Busshorin, 1968), pp. 392-96. The earlier  Chinese source from which much of the language in Kukai's second text derives  is located in Taisho vol. 18, text no. 901, p. 813c. Kukai's later ritual writings  bear a great similarity to various texts found in this same Taisho vol. 18.

Text of Declaration for the First Consecration at the Founding of  Mount Koya  

The sramana (monk) Henjo Kongo (Universally Illuminating Vajra) respect fully declares to the buddhas of the ten directions, to the oceanlike assembly  of the Two Great Mandalas, to the five kinds of devas and the heavenly and  earthly divinities of this land, as well ay to the various spirits of earth, water,  fire, wind, and sky of this mountain:128 DAVI D L. GARDINE R  

That which possesses both form and consciousness is necessarily endowed  with Buddha nature. Buddha nature and Dharma nature pervade the entire  Dharma realm and are inseparable: this body and that body are of one essence  and so are equal. One who has awakened to this truth always roams freely in  the realm of the five wisdoms of Mahavairocana Buddha, whereas those lost  and unaware are constantly sinking in the mud of the three realms of desire,  form, and formlessness that comprise samsara. Mahavairocana Buddha, the  great compassionate one, enjoying for himself the taste of the equality that is  enlightenment, was saddened by the plight of the beings in the six realms of  rebirth. And so it was that the thunder of his wisdom that is one with reality  trembled throughout the Dharma realm and the secret mandala was thereby  transmitted to our world. It was passed on to Vajrasattva, to Nagarjuna and  down to the present without a break in continuity. Vajrabodhi and Amogha vajra came east, bearing their staffs from India to China, and transmitted the  esoteric teaching in order to liberate all beings. And yet, here across the broad  ocean in Japan, worthy vessels of this teaching had yet to appear and so the  teaching remained hidden in the secret palace of Mahavairocana without being  transmitted to our land.  

Fortunately, due to the power of the grace of the Buddha and the forces that  mature beings for spiritual work, I was able to travel to Tang China in 804,  whence I safely returned with the two mandalas of the Diamond and the Womb  realms and over one hundred scrolls of Vajrayana scriptures. Still, people in  Japan were not ready and the time was not right. Month after month passed  in rapid succession and it is now more than twelve years since I returned. At  last, since our devout sovereign has taken it upon himself to help promote this  teaching, we are in need simply of a place to practice. I have searched far and  wide and am convinced that Mount Koya is a most suitable location. The  sovereign, deciding to spread this teaching, has granted the mountain for this  purpose. The location was deemed proper after careful divination in all direc tions. Thus will a monastic complex be constructed on this land bestowed by  the sovereign.  

And so, in order to repay above the kindness of the buddhas by spreading  the esoteric teaching, and to augment below the resplendence of the five kinds  of deities by liberating sentient beings, in sole reliance upon the secret teaching  of the Vajrayana, I wish to establish both the great mandalas of the Womb and  Diamond realms. With reverence I beseech all the buddhas to rejoice in, and  all the devas to protect, my efforts here and ask that all virtuous spirits vow to  help realize my wishes.  

To the east, west, south, and north, and in the four intermediate directions,  as well as above and below, within a circumference of seven ri: all maleficent  spirits and deities within this area, each and every one, get out of my sacred  ground. All beneficent deities and spirits in this area, those who can bestow  advantage, may reside as you please. 

CONSECRATION AT MOUNT KOYA 129  

Further, I request that from all directions, may the five kinds of devas, the  deities of the five elements of earth, water, fire, wind, and sky, together with  the revered spirits of the emperors and empresses of the court since its incep tion, and all the divinities of heaven and earth: may all these serve as sponsors  of this place of religious practice. I most humbly beseech that all spiritual  presences offer their protection day and night to help to realize this wish.  Respectfully declared.  

Text of Declaration for the Consecration of an Altar at Mount Koya  

I respectfully declare to all the buddhas, Prajfta, vajra-devas, and all the visible  and invisible spirits still bound in the paths of karma: I hereby declare that  this is my land. I will now set up, for seven days and seven nights, a great  assembly on the Dharma altar. There I will worship all the buddhas, world 

honored ones, in the ten directions of the Dharma realm; Prajna-paramita; the  many bodhisattvas with their followers, and I will firmly establish the teaching  that is hard to comprehend and which is the repository of all esoteric dharmas.  By thus availing myself of the superior power of these teachings, I will perform  rites to protect myself and these sacred precincts.  

In the east, west, south, and north of this compound, in the four intermediate  directions and above and below, all the vinayakas who destroy the true Dharma,  maleficent spirits and deities, every single one here: get out of the area of my  sacred precincts, to the distance of seven ri. If there be beneficent deities and  spirits who protect the true Dharma, who will bring advantage to my Buddha  Dharma, you may remain in this compound as you please.  

Before an image of the Tathagata in this compound, with one mind in har mony with the Dharma, many monks will maintain the practice of the Buddha  dharma, repay our gratitude to the four benefactors (of parents, kings, sentient  beings, and the Three Jewels), and bring vast benefits to all beings. In reliance  upon the rites of Kundali bodhisattva, for seven days and seven nights we will  perform the ceremonies for establishing the sacred boundary, undergo repen tance and engage in worship.  

Within this monastic compound, to the east, west, south, and north, in the  four intermediate directions and above and below, all the vinayakas who de stroy the true Dharma, maleficent spirits and deities, every single one here: get  out of the area of my sacred precincts, to the distance of seven ri. If there be  beneficent deities and spirits who protect the true Dharma, who will bring  advantage to my Buddha Dharma, you may remain in this compound as you  please.  

With the sincerest of hearts I invoke the palace of the Three Jewels, our most  revered teacher Sakyamuni Buddha, the greatly dignified and powerful divine  heart mantras, the excellent protector and liberator Avalokitesvara, Vajra Kun-

### 07 Praises of the Drunken Peacocks  

Richard H. Davis  

Near the head of the Mahuar River in Madhya Pradesh, in the small backwater  village of Rannod, sit the ruins of an ancient Hindu monastery built sometime in  the tenth century C.E. On a wall of the veranda, carved on a stone tablet, a lengthy  inscription praises the community of Saiva monks who built and inhabited this  monastic retreat in medieval times. The poet speaks of the Saiva lineage called  the "Drunken Peacocks" (Mattamayura) as a stalk, "free of knots, its strong  branches spreading widely." The poetic figure is historically apt, because other  inscriptions from the same period found in many different parts of the subcon tinent speak of more ascetics and teachers linked to the same lineage. The  Drunken Peacocks appear to have been a broadly dispersed, celebrated, and in 

fluential group of religious specialists in early medieval India of the tenth and  eleventh centuries.  

Here I translate selections from three inscriptions praising the Drunken Peacock  lineage. The first is from Rannod, ancient Aranipadra, about five miles from Kad waha, which archeologists believe to be the ancient Mattamayura, the "Town of  Drunken Peacocks." Filled with the remains of some fifteen medieval Hindu tem ples, the hamlet of Kadwaha was probably the capital of a minor dynasty of  Calukya rulers in the tenth century, and became the prime seat of the community  of Saiva sages who derived their name from the town. The other two come from  monasteries located about 200 miles to the east, in the villages of Chandrehe and  Gurgi, along the Sona River in eastern Madhya Pradesh. In the tenth and eleventh  centuries, this area was controlled by the Kalacuris, a powerful dynasty of rulers  based in Tripuri, near present-day Jabalpur. As the inscriptions tell us, Kalacuri  kings persuaded eminent teachers of the Drunken Peacock lineage to resettle in  the Kalacuri dominion, where the monks were treated royally. A poet named  Devadatta composed the Rannod epigraphical poem. The inscription at Chan drehe was composed by one Dhamsata, a Kalacuri court poet, Damodara wrote  it out, and Nilakantha engraved it into the Temple porch stone on Friday, February  10, in the year 973. The praiseworthy poet Madhu wrote the Gurgi poem a few  years later. 

132 RICHAR D H. DAVI S  

Courtly poets like Devadatta, Dhamsata, and Madhu speak in the intricate and  highly laudatory rhetoric typical of medieval Indian inscriptional verse. Most often  the poets direct their tributes toward kings, but in the examples here they single  out religious specialists for special praise. Hyperbolic as the inscriptions may be,  they nevertheless allow us to retrace some of the activities and travels of these  Saiva monks and to reconstruct a kind of collective portrait of this remarkable  lineage. The poets describe the mythical origins of the lineage and its transmission  from teacher to pupil, in disciplic succession over many generations. They praise  the ascetic practices and virtuous conduct of the Drunken Peacocks, and their  knowledge of Saiva teachings. Most important for the court poets, these monks  also come to interact with kings and queens. Drunken Peacock preceptors teach  and perform rites like Saiva initiation for Hindu rulers, and in return receive the  royal patronage that enables them to construct temples and substantial stone  monastic centers. Of course, it is also thanks to their intimate relations with  royalty that we have these contemporary accounts of the Drunken Peacocks, for  court poets celebrated only those religious specialists the court deemed worthy  of royal favor.  

The preceptors of the Drunken Peacock lineage adhered to the medieval Hindu  school of Saivism known as Saiva Siddhanta, the "completed" form of Saivism.  By the tenth century it had become conventional to speak of four main categories  of Saivas: Pasupatas, Kapalikas, Kalamukhas, and Siddhantins. Of these, the Pa 

supatas appear to be the oldest distinct school. Followers of Siva as Pasupati, the  "Lord of All Creatures," the Pasupatas most often followed a renunciatory regimen  of yogic practices along with certain special vows such as bathing in ashes, and  conduct that was often intentionally provocative to orthodox sensibilities. More  unconventional still, the Kapalikas named themselves after the skull each carried  as begging bowl, much like the one attached to Siva's hand after his slaying of  the god Brahma. Kapalikas tended to frequent cremation grounds, and used meat,  wine, and other noramlly polluting substances in their propitiations. The Kala mukhas, "black-faced" Saivas, constituted a branch of Pasupatas prevalent mainly  in southern India. Of the four schools, Saiva Siddhanta was the most respectable  according to standards of ordinary Indian society. Followers of the Siddhanta  based their practices and their theology on a group of texts called the Agamas,  revelations of Siva himself (see Davis 1991). Like their fellow Saivas, they prac ticed yogic austerities, and they were closely affiliated with Siva temples, which  became prominent in the religious life of early medieval India. As the inscriptions  of the Drunken Peacocks indicate, these Siddhantins were respectable enough to  compete successfully with other long-established groups of religious specialists  such as Vedic brahmans for royal support. The monks of the Drunken Peacock  lineage gained their name from the monastic center Mattamayura, apparently,  and not by emulating the kind of wild behavior we might expect of inebriated  peacocks.  

All things must have a beginning, and an eminent medieval Hindu lineage of  sages required a suitably ancient and holy source. In the Rannod inscription, 

THE DRUNKE N PEACOCKS 133  

Devadatta provides a brief origin myth. Once in the Pine Forest, a famous Him alayan hermitage, the orthodox god Brahma approached Siva with all due devo tion at the completion of a sacrifice. Siva was so pleased by this sign of respect  that he initiated Brahma. This act of divine favor, claims the poet, engendered  the line of Saiva ascetics later to be known as Drunken Peacocks, as a fruit might  contain a seed that grows into a far-reaching tree. The inscription goes on to trace  a number of teachers of the lineage, culminating with the sage Purandara, who  initiated King Avantivarman of Mattamayura. Thus Haridatta traces the lineage's  trajectory from forest retreat to royal capital, from the mythical interactions of  gods to the worldly domain of kings and priests.  

All the Drunken Peacock inscriptions describe interactions between sages and  rulers. The Rannod inscription narrates what can be taken as a paradigm for  proper and respectful reciprocal relations between ascetic preceptor and king.  King Avantivarman hears about Saiva initiation and immediately travels to visit  Purandara at his ascetic retreat. The king shows his profound respect to the sage  and finally persuades him to travel to his own domain. When the sage has been  resettled, the king asks to receive Saiva initiation (diksa), the most significant and  efficacious ceremony in the Agama system of ritual. Purandara performs the rites,  and the king subsequently becomes successful in all his endeavors. As a gift for  his guru, the king offers Purandara the "essence" of his kingdom, and Purandara  utilizes some of these royal resources to construct a great monastery in the capital  city, Mattamayura. Subsequently he builds a second monastery, identified as a  "retreat for ascetics," some distance from the capital at Rannod, on whose veranda  this account was inscribed. The remains at Mattamayura and Rannod are among  the very earliest Hindu monasteries archeologists have identified.  

Although most inscriptions portray relations between sages and royalty in an  equally ideal light, an inscription found in the Mattamayura (modern Kadwaha)  monastery (too fragmented to be included among the translations here) allows us  to see some sensitive points in these interactions (see Mirashi and Shastri 1968).  An emperor named Hariraja visits the monastery to receive an audience (darsana,  literally, a viewing) with the pontiff, probably Sadasiva, second in disciplic suc 

cession after Purandara. However, Sadasiva first makes diplomatic enquiries into  his identity: "Who is this king, who seems so full of life?" Only after an officer in  the royal retinue has assured the sage of the king's pure descent within the Pra tihara clan - the Pratiharas being the most powerful dynasty of northern India in  the tenth century - does the sage agree to confer Saiva initiation upon Hariraja.  The king then tries to give Sadasiva some of the royal elephants, apparently, as a  preceptor's gift. Understandably Sadasiva considers this inappropriate, and forces  the king to make repeated offers before he finally acknowledges that "villages  would satisfy me." The annual revenue from agricultural villages, of course, could  support a community of monks in a way that no elephant, no matter how distin guished, possibly could.  

More intriguing, the Kadwaha inscription also seems to describe a magical  vendetta carried out by Dharmasiva, Purandara's successor, against an intrusive 

1 3 4 RICHAR D H . DAVI S  

local ruler. King Gobhata comes to Dharmasiva's hermitage and apparently causes  the death of one of the monks. Giving way to rage, Dharmasiva arms himself with  magical weapons and emulates the god Siva in his destructive capacity. For Saivas,  Siva is simultaneously the agent of creation and destruction, the one who brings  new worlds into being and who also annihilates them when their time has run  out. Here, the poet tells us, Dharmasiva defeats his enemy completely, as Siva  destroys the world at the end of the eon. Unlike Siva, Dharmasiva apparently dies  in his effort, for the next verse compares him to the sun sinking behind the  western mountain as his successor, like the moon, rises to dispel the ensuing  darkness. The Kadwaha inscription is too dilapidated for us to reconstruct this  event fully, but we are left with a fascinating fragmentary glimpse of a seemingly  weaponless ascetic gaining revenge on a king who had failed to observe proper  decorum toward religious seekers.  

The inscriptions from Gurgi and Chandrehe trace one branch of the far-spread ing Drunken Peacock lineage. As Dhamsata tells us in the Chandrehe eulogy, one  of Purandara's successors at Mattamayura was Prabhasiva, who became famous  far and wide as "crown jewel" among Saivas. So esteemed was he that the Kalacuri  ruler Yuvarajadeva declared him "master of all ascetics" and managed to bring  him some two hundred miles to his own kingdom, where at great expense he  constructed a monastery to accommodate the sage and his students. Yuvaraja deva's wife Nohala had much to do with this invitation, for she was apparently  granddaughter of the king Avantivarman initiated by Purandara, and she appears  in other inscriptions as a great patroness of Saiva institutions. Prabhasiva and his  followers constructed more monasteries and temples, making the Drunken Pea cock lineage a powerful religious presence throughout the Kalacuri kingdom.  

The Kalacuri branch was not the only limb growing from the Drunken Peacock  stalk. During the early medieval period, religious figures affiliated with this mo nastic order appear in inscriptions found in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Or issa, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamilnad, as well. The Drunken Peacocks were evi dently at the center of a mobile pan-Indian network of Saiva Siddhanta teachers  and ascetics.  

Although it is difficult to discern the sages described in these inscriptions as  distinct individuals, one can see in the laudatory poems a collective portrait of  the Drunken Peacocks as a distinctive community of religious specialists, differing  from other religious figures who receive royal favor. During the early medieval  period independent Hindu kings, members of the royal courts and other wealthy  elites patronized worthy religious specialists by giving them land, gold, and live 

stock, and by setting up religious institutions like temples and monasteries for  them. They did so, in the typical phrase, to acquire merit for themselves and  others, or as the poet Madhu puts it, "to gain the great fame that comes from  serving the good." But there were many who claimed the mantle of the good.  Kalacuri inscriptions, for example, honor orthodox Vedic brahmans, courtly brah 

man ministers, and Pasupata yogins as well as the Saiva Siddhanta sages of the  Drunken Peacock lineage. All are described as virtuous, but their virtues differ. 

THE DRUNKEN PEACOCKS 135  

The sages of the Drunken Peacock lineage are, first of all, ascetics. They are  renouncers who have left their homes and families. We do not hear of their caste,  clan, or parents, as we do in inscriptions praising orthodox Vedic brahmans.  Drunken Peacocks trace their genealogy from guru to disciple, in spiritual suc 

cession, rather than from father to son. As renouncers, they practice sexual con tinence, and the poets often remind us that the sages have extinguished all sexual  desire through their austerities. They also fast or otherwise restrict their diets.  Even as a young child the precocious ascetic Prabodhasiva eats only fruits, roots,  seeds, and greens. In addition to these bodily abstentions, the Drunken Peacocks  practice yoga and meditation. In meditation they especially focus their minds  upon the god Siva. They seek to "perceive" Siva or visualize him in meditation,  rather than seeking to gain a state of objectless contemplation, as in classical yogic  meditation. These ascetic practices are collectively known as tapas, a key term in  these inscriptions that I have generally left untranslated. The poets envision tapas  as a source of brilliant, fiery energy (often called tejas) that emanates outward  from the ascetic. Like those other energy sources, fire and the sun, tapas produces  both heat and light: it burns up impurities and sins and it dispels the darkness  of ignorance and delusion.  

Although the Drunken Peacock sages are renouncers, they are not as rigorous  in their ascetic regimen as Pasupata ascetics like Bhavabrahman, who appears in  another Kalacuri inscription (Mirashi 1955: 186-95). Whereas Drunken Peacocks  sleep securely in their monastic retreats and receive regular stipends from their  land holdings, Bhavabrahman wears only a loincloth, makes his bed on a heap  of ashes, eats only scanty alms, and is "addicted" to his practice of yoga. His yoga  is the classical eight-limbed yoga outlined in Patanjali's Yogasutras. The Drunken  Peacocks seem less attached to the full scope of Patanjali's prescriptions, and more  flexible in adapting specific yogic techniques to their own needs. Bhavabrahman's  Pasupata austerity may place him farther from the hand of royal favor than the  Saiva Siddhanta sages of the Drunken Peacock lineage, for when he builds a Siva  temple near the Kalacuri capital, he does not rely on gifts from the king, but  rather obtains the necessary resources by begging.  

Second, the Drunken Peacock sages are knowledgeable teachers. They under stand the great doctrine of Saiva Siddhanta, which they have acquired through  meditation on Siva and through study of the Agamas. The poets often compare  the sages' knowledge and their beautiful elucidation to such sources of illumi nation as the sun and the moon, in their capacity to overcome darkness and  ignorance. Like Tolstoy's proverbial hedgehog, the Drunken Peacocks know only  one thing, but they know it very well. The poets seldom praise the Saiva sages  for their mastery of other traditional Indian disciplines of knowledge like gram mar, or for knowing other genres of religious texts such as the Vedas. Compare  this focus with the foxlike comprehensiveness attributed to Somesvara, an ortho dox brahman who served as minister at the Kalacuri court: "He never felt doubt  when it came to the Vedas. His knowledge of grammar was complete, he sur passed all reason in his logic, and he was not bad in his understanding of the 

136 RICHAR D H . DAVI S  

Tantric path either. He was first in Vedanta, and adroit when it came to remem bering poetry" (Mirashi 1955: 305-9). Somesvara also knew about painting, mu sic, the evaluation and care of elephants and horses, and the science of gemology.  The Drunken Peacocks would respond to the challenge of such autodidacts by  asserting the sufficiency of the one doctrine they did know. As Devadatta says of  Purandara, "Even today scholars expert in worldly ways have still not refuted his  teachings."  

The inscriptional poets praise the Drunken Peacock sages for their good and  pious conduct. Here the sages follow ideals of conduct largely accepted by ordi nary Indian society, as well. They are selfless, benevolent, and pure. The personal  purity of the sages seems to emanate outward from their persons and act auton omously on the world. When Prabhasiva walks from Mattamayura to the Kalacuri  kingdom, his footsteps "purify the earth" along the way. Notwithstanding their  name, the Drunken Peacocks do not engage here in deliberately provocative or  challenging behavior, as Pasupatas or Kapalikas might.  

The Agamas divide their teachings into four main rubrics: yoga, theology,  proper conduct, and ritual action. In Agama texts the section on ritual is often  the most extensive and detailed, reflecting the great emphasis Saiva Siddhanta  placed on the efficacy of ritual activity. In the Drunken Peacock inscriptions we  hear surprisingly little about rituals performed by the sages - with one exception.  The sages repeatedly perform the rite of initiation (diksa) for kings. The Agamas  consider initiation to be the most potent of all ritual acts. There are two (or more)  levels of initiation, suitable to aspirants at different stages of attainment. The first  is "common initiation," which awakens the initiate to the knowledge and presence  of Siva and brings one into the Saiva community. The Agamas convey esoteric  knowledge; only those who have undergone this common initiation may learn  their teachings. More advanced seekers may subsequently undergo "liberating  initiation" (nirvanadiksa), a much more ambitious ceremony that is said to burn  up all one's fetters, as a blazing fire consumes a heap of cotton. According to  Saiva Siddhanta, only those who have been initiated in this way may attain the  highest degree of final emancipation from all worldly impurities. The initiation  that kings receive in these inscriptions is common initiation. Anything more  would be inappropriate for rulers who continue to exercise sovereignty in the  everyday world. This initiation is powerful enough, however, to bring them suc cess in all their endeavors. The Saiva sages who perform the royal initiations, on  the other hand, have necessarily undertaken liberating initiation, as well as a  supplementary "preceptor's consecration," which together confer on them the  capacities to act as preceptor and priest for others.  

For their great religious attainments, the sages of the Drunken Peacock lineage  receive great fame (kirti). The poets seem particularly fascinated by the charisma  of these religious specialists, and describe it with many hyperbolic tropes. The  reputation of the Drunken Peacocks shines forth to reach all people in the world.  Note here again the use of light imagery, to evoke the glittering, glowing, ema 

nating quality of celebrity. It is also reflected figuratively in their feet, glowing in 

THE DRUNKEN PEACOCKS 137  

the beams of light that radiate from the gems set in the crowns on the heads of  kings who bow before them. Here the poets turn a common Indian act of eti quette, where a powerful political figure bows to show respect for a religious  teacher, into an elaborate image of the universal fame of the Drunken Peacocks.  According to the Chandrehe inscription, even the residents of heaven get into the  act of celebrating Prasantasiva's glory.  

Fame and glory bring us back to the king and court, for it is the fame resulting  from their spiritual practices that first brings these sages to the attention of  political authorities and court poets. The collective narrative of the Drunken Pea cock lineage begins far from such royal centers, in the forests and caves where  Saiva ascetics initially practice austerities and meditate on the god Siva. Once they  come to royal notice, however, their lives may well change. Kings bow, propitiate,  flatter, and ultimately persuade them to resettle in or near the royal capital. New  associations with the elite allow the sages to receive substantial resources in the  form of preceptors' gifts and royal land grants. They construct temples and mon asteries, and increasingly take on administrative roles as priests and preceptors in  these new religious complexes. The institutionalization of the Drunken Peacocks  offers great opportunities for the promulgation of Saiva Siddhanta. It enables the  sages to transmit the teachings of the Agamas to a wider audience, to maintain  disciplic succession by training new monks, to worship Siva in temples on a  much grander scale, and to be available to the royal family for special spiritual  counseling.  

For some of the Drunken Peacocks, however, such responsibilities must have  interfered with the simpler, purer ascetic practices with which the lineage began.  We hear of preceptors like Prasantasiva who build special retreats for adepts  (siddhas) and ascetics far from the madding crowd, where he could meditate  peacefully on Siva and converse with his more austere Saiva cousins, the Pasu 

patas. I end these selections with the poet Madhu's celebration of Prasantasiva's  happy retirement in his spiritual retreat, while his disciples carry on the public  works in the Kalacuri capital.  

The story of the Drunken Peacocks, then, reflects an ambivalence toward  worldly conventions and court life, a theme that runs through much Indian re ligious literature. The Drunken Peacocks are renouncers, but respectable ones.  They move from the periphery to the royal center, but are then tempted to return  to the more peaceful margins. They interact successfully with royalty, and use the  patronage that comes their way to construct considerable religious institutions,  but in the final reckoning a sage like Prasantasiva appears happier conversing  with Pasupata yogis than with courtiers and kings.  

Were the sages of the Drunken Peacock lineage Tantric? When the Kalacuri  minister and scholar Somesvara refers to his understanding of the "Tantric path,"  was he referring to the Saiva Siddhanta teachings of his religious competitors?  Much depends, of course, on how broadly or narrowly one defines the term  "Tantra." It is clear that, among the four Saiva schools of early medieval times,  the Pasupatas and the Kapalikas were the most direct precursors (in style, if not138 RICHAR D H . DAVI S  

necessarily in theology) to later Saiva tantrikas such as the Nath Yogis and the  Siddhas. By this measure, Saiva Siddhanta and the Drunken Peacocks appear on  the conventional side. On the other hand, these sages distinguished themselves  from Vedic brahmans and orthodox religious categories. They relied on the Aga 

mas revealed by the god Siva, not the Vedas, as their primary textual authority.  Through ascetic practices they sought to harness for themselves special super normal energies or powers. They used initiation as a central act in their ritual  system, and initiation acted as a necessary condition for receiving the esoteric  teachings of the Agamas. Finally, the system outlined by Saiva Siddhanta em ployed many of the ritual actions that formed the basis for later Tantric practice - mantras, mudras, the imposition of powers onto the body (nyasa), meditative  visualization, and the like. However we define Tantra, though, the collective por trait offered by these and other inscriptions of a far-flung community of sages  and teachers who initiated kings in Saivism and constructed monasteries to house  their many disciples may give us a revealing sense of the diversity among the  nonorthodox religious specialists wandering and teaching throughout India in  early medieval times.

Inscription at Rannod (Aranipadra)  

Composed by Devadatta (ca. Tenth Century)  

6. Once upon a time in the lovely Pine Forest  

Brahma performed a sacrifice following every rule.  

Then he approached with devotion the One 

THE DRUNKEN PEACOCKS 139  

Who can be perceived only through firm devotion  

And He who knows every rule, Siva granted him grace.  

7. The holy fruit of that rite was the seed of great happiness  For from it arose a perfect new line of sages,  

A tree whose strong limbs spread far and wide,  

A flawless raft for us to cross the passions within.  

8. In that line was born the sage who lived in Kadamba Cave  Like the Moon come to earth, rising daily, a form honored by all.  From him came that Indra among sages,  

The pontiff of the Conch-shell Monastery.  

9. By defeating desire, Terambipala was equal to the Highest Lord Siva.  Next came the head of Amardaka Tirtha, a sage of great austerity and  learning.  

10. After him the guru Purandara, as weighty as the Guru Siva,  Became head sage in the learned line.  

Even today scholars expert in worldly ways have still not refuted his  teachings.  

11. That worthy sage glowed with unthinkable luster, bright as the sun,  Scattering his elevated words like rays beaming out from the eastern  mountain.  

When good King Avantivarman heard his lovely teachings  on the subject of initiation  

He immediately arranged to have that sage brought here.  

12. King Avantivarman went to see the ascetic in Upendrapura,  honored him profoundly,  

Somehow or other brought him to his own territory  

and again he worshiped him.  

13. The wise king requested and received complete Saiva initiation.  As gift to the preceptor  

He offered the essence of his own realm  

and so achieved success in his own lifetime.  

14. With a portion of his bounty the sage built a celebrated monastery,  equal to Mount Meru,  

Fit for those true gems, the good sages of the royal town  

known for Drunken Peacocks.  

15. Once again that Indra among sages, matchless in virtue,  built a splendid monastery,  

A retreat for ascetics, known as Aranipadra, and consecrated it.

Inscription at Chandrehe  

Composed by Dhamsata, 973 C.E.  

1. In his cloud of twisted tangled hair  

Black with hissing snakes and thundering  

with the waters of the never-dying Ganges,  

Flashes lightning from his forehead-eye.  

Like moonbeams raining from his crown  

his necklace of skulls gleams like a wreath of campaka flowers.  That Siva rules!  

2. White as a parade of swans it spreads across the face  

of one dressed in elephant hide.  

Then, for an instant shadowed by the blue of his neck,  

it suddenly regains its glow,  

The luster of the moon emerging from a cloud.  

May Siva's smile bring you good fortune!  

3. The great snake's hood bows down as the bowl of Earth spins,  turned by nimble feet dancing a quick step.  

The elephants of the quarters flee.  

The Cosmic Eggshell whirls without end, twirled by his long arms  to the dense beat of the damaru drum.  

May Siva's wild dance bring you delight!  

4. And may the holy line of Drunken Peacocks purify the three worlds,  as does the Ganges!  

In that line was born Purandara, ascetic and teacher of kings.  His pupil was Cudasiva, bright  

as the flame of a lamp burning on the fuel of tapas  

to dispel the black pitch of impurity,  

He stood on the path of liberation.  

5. After that lord of the Madhumati came Prabhasiva. He piled up great  tapas  

Until he was crown-jewel among all Saivas. Many rulers honored him.  King Yuvarajadeva declared him Master of All Ascetics.  

He purified the very earth with his feet.  

6. Then came his pupil Prasantasiva, a veritable Moon.  

Pure, he showed his true form in a battle to dispel the dark.  He made good Saivas blossom as the Moon does the lotus.  The radiance of his fame brightened the whole face of the sky.  

7. He lived on fruits, roots, and bulbs.  

Wherever his feet left tracks he purified the earth. 

THE DRUNKE N PEACOCKS 141  

This friend of sages built the Ashram of Peace, known well by the  people,  

Where the Sona River meets the foot of Bee Mountain, covered in  priyala thickets.  

8. In Indra's court celestial singers and dancers rejoice.  

Nandi the bull drops his instrument to please his shaggy master.  The charioteer of the sun playfully shakes his hair, drops the reins,  And sings praises from on high.  

So was the ascetic's eternal glory celebrated in the gardens of heaven.  

9. Then followed Prabodhasiva, best in the class of all his pupils  As Parasurama was best among Siva's.  

Defeating every rival, he projected his glory in every direction.  Giving money to the virtuous, he made Earth his debtor.  

10. Like the god Kumara he kept his hand busy  

feeding the high flames of sacrificial fire  

as Kumara feeds his peacock,  

He always avoided the company of women as did the young Kumara,  The force of his power was proclaimed by a proud king  

as Kumara showed his dart to the high Kraunca Mountain,  

He was devoted to Siva, enemy of Kama, as Kumara is his beloved  son,  

And he accomplished all his divine duties just as Kumara did.  

11. He went through all the Agamas. He saw God in ritual and  meditation.  

He ate only fruit, radish, seeds, greens, and lotus root.  

Imitating his teacher, he did tapas on the river banks.  

Even as a child he amazed the world.  

12. He resembles the rising sun:  

Kings light his feet with their crowns, as the sun's first rays  glisten on mountain peaks.  

He destroys ignorance, as the sun breaks up the darkness.  

Starting from dawn everyone praises him, as they do the sun.  What more can I say?  

Now he has risen to full glory, his brilliance spreads across the three  worlds!  

13. Digging up a great multitude of heavy stones, splitting them up,  spreading them out,  

He struck a path through the mountains, over streams and rivers,  Through woods and thickets, as Rama did across the ocean.  A wondrous deed, this great work among the great  

spreads wonder through the world. 

142 RICHAR D H . DAVI S  

14. The ashram at night: Breezes cooled  

With waterdrops from the Sona, the sky echoing  

With lions' roars, clouds of black bees hovering on mountain peaks,  And from the glow of luminous herbs people become fearful of  lightning.  

15. Here troops of monkeys kiss the lion cubs  

A fawn drinks from a mother lion's breast  

Rivals set aside their hatred, for  

In the groves of ascetics every mind is pacified.  

16. Near the temple of his teacher, Prabodhasiva built a monastery  High and wide as a white cloud, as is his own glory.  

And near the mountain that peaceful man dug a tank,  

Clear as a river, and a well with lots of water.  

17. With time the well Prasantasiva made here  

Had collapsed and filled with fallen wood.  

But devoted to his teacher Prabodhasiva fixed it up again,  With a charming pattern of heavy stones, and dug it deep.  

18. Mehuka was an initiate, famed on earth as a leader of good people.  He had a son, Jemka. From him, in Amarika's womb, came the poet  Dhamsata  

Who composed this poem of praise, bound with big letters.  

19. Wandering through twists in Siva's matted hair, waters stumbling  over rock cliffs  

In the Himalayas, leaping in a wave to Earth, cleansed, thanks to  Bhagiratha - 

As long as the Ganges, river of gods, flows to the ocean, master over  all rivers,  

So long may Prasantasiva's fame remain firm on earth!  

20. Renowned and intelligent Damodara, son of Laksmidhara, brother of  Vasudeva  

Wrote out this poem of praise in elegant letters.  

By order of Superintendent Suraka, Nilakantha inscribed it  On the fifth day of the bright half of Phalguna, in the [Kalacuri]  year 724.  

Inscription at Gurgi  

Composed by Madhu (Late Tenth Century)  

1. Dreadful with the echoing shrieks of birds covering the earth  Terrified, thinking it the end of the world, as  

the strong arms of demon Ravaha, lord of Lanka, 

THE DRUNKE N PEACOCKS 143  

Shake and pile up crystal rows of Himalayan peaks - 

May the Lord who lives on the mountain peak  

Who by himself created this earth  

and wears the moon as his crest  

Increase our joy!  

2. "Nandin, who is this that has entered Siva's home?"  

"I think she must be the Goddess."  

"Wrong, for I am not she and she is not me.  

Tell me, Siva, who is that in your tangled hair?"  

"Silly woman! It's the enemy of the gods, taking your beautiful form!  Look, I've thrown him down before me."  

"With what weapon?" Defeated by Parvatis sharp reply, silent - May Siva protect us!  

3. The best of teachers of impeccable conduct,  

Peacocks dance and shriek in drunken joy when  

out of season clouds appear  

arising from billows of thick smoke from constant sacrificial  offerings,  

Circles of dazzling light  

from the big glowing gems in the palace windows  

mock the world of heaven - 

In all the world the Madhumati River is the home of the Siddhanta  sages.  

4. There in former times godlike ascetics, the turnings of their minds  stilled by vows,  

Came down and taught their pupils the great flawless doctrine of  Siva.  

And even today their fame glows like the moon, whitening the earth,  Celebrated by all, delighting the excellent scholars as the moon  pleases the breeze.  

5. In this great line of Saiva sages arose the most esteemed Cudasiva.  With his blazing splendor he burnt up sin as a forest fire burns dry  grass.  

His fame, most radiant, which came from gaining perfection in  knowledge  

And meditation on Siva's two feet, wandered through  

the palace of the three worlds.  

6. His pupil was the wise sage Prabhasiva, worthy of praise  in all the three worlds,  

Whose footstool glowed with the beams from the jewels in the  crowns  

on the bowed heads of every king. 

144 RICHARD H. DAVIS  7 King Mugdhatuhga's son Yuvarajadeva, who knows good conduct,  Brought him here on account of an innate trust  

And made him take a monastery built with endless wealth,  In order to gain the great fame that comes from serving the good.  

8. His pupil was the esteemed sage Prasantasiva  

Where all desirable virtues willingly made their sole abode.  He became known throughout the world for his flawless tapas  And the power of his nourishing knowledge.  

9. Enticed by the tapas he had collected so long  

Goddess Fortune desired to join her body with him,  

who always turned his face from pleasure to seek the Highest.  But when she received his command to serve others,  

She dwelled faithfully in the homes of good people dear to him,  Like a devout wife who follows the vow of absolute truth.  

10. Supported by the stake of his beneficence, sprinkled with the water  Of his gleaming knowledge, protected all round by the power of his  spreading tapas,  

The tree of plenty made up of his fame grew in time until  It forcibly filled the whole hollow of Brahma's egg, this universe.  

11. North of the temple glittering like Kailasa's peak built by  Yuvarajadeva  

He too built a temple for Siva. People thought it a rival  

For the tip of Mount Sumeru, and all three worlds called it a  marvel - 

A stairway of his own fame leading up to heaven.  

12. In the shrines connected to the main temple  

That learned man of far-flung fame placed Parvati,  

Siva and Parvati together, and six-faced Skanda.  

At the gates he posted Ganesa and Sarasvati.  

13. And after he had satisfied seekers of wealth with gifts of burnished  gold  

He built a place for the Siddhas, away from the temple on the Sona  River bank.  

Yogis enter there and - inner commotions curbed in discipline,  peaceful,  

Undeterred in meditation, clear in mind - 

they go straight to the land of the liberated.  

14. For the complete rest of those whose minds are intent  On staying at a holy place the sage built a retreat for ascetics  on the banks of the holy river Ganges. 

THE DRUNKEN PEACOCKS 145  

Those who live in Varanasi, who love to worship Siva, after they visit it  Consider the ocean of worldly existence, though weighty, to be as  slight as the water in a cow's hoofprint.  

15. The generous master of yoga sat still in solitude, tasting inner joy,  His firm mind fixed meditating on the Firm One, Siva, at the center  of his heart,  

And passed the days with those virtuous self-deniers  

Wise in the Pasupata philosophy of the Self.  

16. Meanwhile, his pupils by their own lights lit things up as brightly  as all the rays of the sun - 

Daily enlightening those who had fallen into the deep darkness,  Their fame ripening as they served others with the gift of vision,  the splendor of their commands carried by kings on their heads - They moved about honored by the best sages and the people. 

### 08 Precepts for an Emperor  

Allan G. Grapard  

The document translated here represents the views of Kukai (774-835) on ritual  and power, and gives insights into his articulation of the relationship between  esoteric Buddhism and the imperial cultic system of Japan at the beginning of the  Heian period (794-1185). This document was written for an important occasion:  Emperor Heizei (774-824), who had withdrawn from public life in 809, asked  Kukai to confer upon him Shingon precepts, and to grant him an initiatory unc 

tion (kanjo) normally reserved to practitioners of esoteric Buddhism. Kukai did  so in 822. This was the first, but not the last time* that an emperor requested  initiatory rites. As a matter of fact, such rituals became, during the medieval  period, a regular part of enthronement rites.  

In order to understand the conditions that guided the relations between power  and ritual during the Heian period and thereafter, it is necessary to emphasize  two issues. First is the way in which Japanese Buddhist ecclesiasts of the two  major lineages of Tendai and Shingon esotericism cultivated good relations with  the leaders of the Fujiwara house and the imperial family. From their inception  and for much of their history, both Tendai and Shingon were geared to the elite,  without whose political and economic support they might have faltered and dis appeared. The relationship that was to evolve between these Buddhisms and the  leading houses of Heian Japan was one of reciprocity: the aristocracy needed  legitimacy, as well as relief from what it thought were certain obscure causes of  disease and otherwordly causes of internecine and exterior unrest; on the other  hand, Buddhist schools needed economic and other forms of support for their  institutions and to uphold their own claims to legitimacy. Saicho (767-822) had  been successful in restoring a modicum of communication between Buddhist  institutions and the imperial state after the debacle that had led to the abandon ment of the Nara (Heijokyo) capital and the creation of the Kyoto (Heiankyo)  capital in 794. Kukai was instrumental in making esoteric Buddhism the main  intellectual and ritual operative of the elite. One important step in that direction  was his establishment of esoteric initiation and the taking of precepts as the late-

PRECEPT S FOR AN EMPERO R 147  

life counterpart of autochthonous rites of enthronement. Kukai established eso teric Buddhism at court by positing himself as the ritual guarantor of imperial  legitimacy, by making esotericism the practice of aristocrats during the last years  

of their life, and by assuming responsibility for funerary rites.  The second issue is the place of ritual in Heian culture. Ritual was obviously  more than rule-governed activity serving to bond sacerdotal and policy-making  functions, institutions, and people. Even though sacerdotal authority and policy making power were supposed to be merged in the imperial person, it seems that  there was generally, at the social level, a perceived opposition between purity and  power; and that ritual may have served either to annihilate or minimize the pol luting aspects of the use of power and violence, especially in the context of ter ritorial expansion and maintenance. This motif seems to undergird some of the  passages in the texts presented below. Of greater importance, however, is the fact  that Heian culture was marked by the development of a ritual economy of power,  by which the legitimacy of the rulers was grounded in ritual codes and laws  (elaborated in 859 in the Jogan-gishiki, and further developed in 967 in the Engi shiki), which were applicable to (Shinto) shrines in the entire country under im perial rule, and which stipulated what rituals should be performed where and  when, and at what price - a price to be exacted from local governments and the  general labor force. In the case of Buddhist temples, Shingon and Tendai both  developed large-scale rituals to be performed on the levels of the state, aristocratic  houses, and individuals. Heian Japan thus evolved into a highly ritualized state,  in which both shrines and temples played a sometimes complementary, some times competitive, role. In other words, ritual was considered a powerful activity  in both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, as well as in policy-making circles.  The overall institutional framework within which these rituals were performed  was named kenmitsu taisei (exoteric-esoteric regime) by the late Japanese historian  Kuroda Toshio; its goal would have been the establishment of the Heian period's  leading ideology of mutual support between Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines  on the one hand, and, on the other, the imperial power structure (obo-buppo)  through the maintenance of institutions and rituals for the protection of the im perial and aristocratic houses ruling the country (chingo-kokka). This arrangement  manifested itself materially through grants of landholdings to shrines and temples,  which the Buddhist temples and shrines associated with them used to establish  themselves as major economic and political powers. In this set of arrangements  and institutions, esoteric Buddhist rituals became dominant, and left such a deep  mark on Japanese culture during and long after the Heian period that to ignore  them would lead to gross distortions in our understanding of that culture as a  whole. Needless to say, the type of rationalization provided by Kukai in the text  below was responsible, in part, for the success of this feature of Japanese cultic  and political history.  

By Kukai's time, Buddhism had already become a tool of imperial ideology in  China and Korea, and it would not have been accepted by Japan's Heian court if  it did not provide, on the one hand, a comprehensive system for analyzing the148 ALLAN G. GRAPARD  

human condition and, on the other, a beneficial political arrangement between  the emerging imperial state and Buddhist institutions. For reasons yet to be de termined, Kukai felt a need to place Buddhist rather than Shinto shrines at the  service of interests of the imperial house and its surrounding aristocratic houses.  He also wished to convince his contemporaries that esotericism was a compre hensive world of symbols and an effective ritual system. There is no question that  the overwhelming concern of the early ninth-century courtiers was to establish  the supremacy of the imperial house, as seen in the establishment of Chinese law,  the definition and codification of autochthonous ritual, and general support for,  but control of, Buddhism. Kukai's thought and activities fit this concern in the  sense that he saw Buddhism as supportive of the imperial system in two ways.  First, he posited the emperor as a manifestation on earth of the cakravartin, the  universal monarch discussed in a number of Buddhist scriptures, apocryphal and  otherwise. Second, he arranged for Buddhist rituals of protection of the imperial  lineage to be performed in the imperial palace, and encouraged individual aris tocrats to have various Buddhist rituals performed for a vast array of reasons and  situations.  

One of the ways Kukai established Shingon esotericism in ninth-century Japan  was through an emphasis on lineage. This satisfied a number of parties: the state  with its intrinsic interest in state-sponsored historical records and genealogies,  and several Buddhist schools' interest in grounding the legitimacy of new state 

ments in (mainly fictitious) genealogies. The emphasis on lineage thus worked to  locate new schools in the overall understanding of varied and often contradictory  Buddhist doctrines and practices, and formally to establish normative access to  new knowledge and ritual, as well as to legitimate secret transmissions from mas 

ter to disciple. Kukai wrote several documents on his lineage, and mentions it  and his place therein in the document translated below; by initiating a retired  emperor, Kukai co-opted him, so to speak, and thereby attempted to assert the  supremacy of esoteric Buddhist ritual. Secrecy and lineage became integral parts  of the transmission of knowledge and practice in relation to power, and this  system remained in place, both in and out of Buddhist esoteric circles, for better  or worse, for nearly one thousand years.  

One of Kukai's central concerns is visible in his lifelong efforts to position  Shingon at the apex of the various Buddhisms in existence in his time, both for  the elite and other members of the society in which he lived. Nowhere is this  more evident than in his most important and lengthiest work (still untranslated),  the Ten Stages of the Mind (jujushinron), in which he applies the doctrine of ex 

pedient devices or skillful means (upaya in Sanskrit, hoben in Japanese) to suggest  that Shingon esotericism was at once the matrix and culmination of all Buddhist  schools, as well as of Confucianism and Taoism. In this and other works, includ ing the document translated below, Kukai ranks eight schools of thought and  practice in terms of two major analytical concerns: the depth and complexity of  their philosophical achievements, and their appropriateness to radically different  types of human psychological and intellectual tendencies and abilities. It may be 

PRECEPTS FOR AN EMPEROR 149  

argued that this double analytical concern dominates all of Kukai's works; it is  the central feature of his earliest work comparing Confucianism, Taoism, and  Buddhism, as well as of his latest works.  

In the document discussed here, this analytical concern manifests itself as a  discussion of the relative merits and applicabilities of the "eight schools of Bud dhism," which in Japan were more or less institutionalized by 822. These are the  Ritsu, Kusha, Jojitsu, Hosso, Sanron, Tendai, Kegon, and Shingon schools. Ritsu  (vinaya in Sanskrit) refers to the disciplinary rules transmitted to Japan by the  Chinese monk Ganjin (Jianzhen, 688-763); Kusha (abhidharmakosa-sastra in San skrit), refers to the abhidharma set of philosophical, cosmological, and cosmo graphic considerations set forth in the document of the same name; Jojitsu (sat yasiddhi in Sanskrit), refers to a commentary that went largely ignored in Japan.  Hosso refers to the so-called "idealistic" school of Yogacara Buddhism that orig inated with Asahga and Maitreya in India; in Japan, this school was based in the  Kofukuji temple, the private institution of the Fujiwara aristocratic house. Sanron  refers to the three treatises said to have been authored by Nagarjuna, the central  figure of the philosophy of emptiness that in fact forms the core of the various  schools of Mahayana Buddhism. Tendai is the Chinese school based on the Lotus  Sutra and its Chinese commentaries, imported by Saicho (767-822). Tendai was  so influenced by Shingon, however, that one came to speak of two esotericisms,  the Shingon-based Tomitsu, and the Tendai-based Taimitsu; these two sets of  esoteric thought and practice were closely related. Finally, Shingon ("spell," man tra in Sanskrit) is the name given to the school established by Kukai in the early  ninth century.  

Although he made it clear that he saw fundamental value in each of the schools,  and different sets of people for whom these schools' teachings and practices would  be appropriate, Kukai insisted that Shingon was both superior to and inclusive  of all of them. Kukai was not, of course, the originator of this type of ranking and  competitive assessment of Buddhist schools; known in China as pan-jiao ("doc 

trinal critique"), this practice had its origins in India. It subsequently evolved in  China, within complex social and political circumstances, in order to demonstrate  which school of Buddhism the emperor was to sponsor as the main guarantor of  his legitimacy. Kukai simply imported and refined the technique, using it to fur 

ther his desire to convince his audience of the validity of his argument, that is,  that Shingon was to be the principal philosophical and ritual arm of the imperial  state. Although it is clear that esotericism prevailed, Shingon alone did not. Im portant questions with regard to this comment cannot be answered without fur ther examination of the subtle and important differences between Taimitsu and  Tomitsu esotericisms, and of their sponsorship by competing political factions.  Japanese scholarship is, in this respect, seriously lacking, in that it is usually  

dominated by modern but thoroughly outdated sectarian concerns.  Kukai was well aware of the traditional distinction between the three parts of  the Buddhist canon (the so-called Triple Basket consisting of teachings, discipli nary rules, and commentaries). He insisted, however, on a division into five parts 

150 ALLAN G. GRAPARD  

that resulted in the separate treatment of a corpus of treatises on wisdom (prajna)  and of esoteric treatises and formulas (dharanls). He thus speaks in the document  translated below not of a triple basket but rather of a quintuple system (the "five  storehouses" or "containers"), in a move to assert the autonomy and legitimacy  of esoteric teachings and practices.  

Esoteric Buddhist traditions emphasize the transmission of doctrines through  series of secret initiatory unctions (kanjos), but accord greater importance to ritual  practices considered to be the main vehicle for attainment of buddhahood in this  body, that is, in the present lifetime. The Triple Mystery of body, speech, and  mind is a set of technologies of the self ("the great self of no-self," muga no daiga),  which consists of physical practices of control of the body, practices related to  speech (the utterance of mantras and dharanis, and their corresponding medita tions), and highly ritualized meditative practices based on a number of esoteric  documents.  

These practices are subsumed under the umbrella of the "four types of man dala," graphic representations of the parallel structures of the cosmos (the body  of the buddha Mahavairocana) and of sentient beings. The four types of mandalas  are dai mandara, or painted mandalas that represent deities; sammaya mandara,  or convention mandalas, in which the various deities are represented by various  ritual emblems; ho mandara, in which the deities are represented by their seed  syllables (bijas) and corresponding sounds; and katsuma mandara, in which the  deities are represented separately in various forms and by symbols identifying  their varied functions and virtues. Mandala-based ritualization of the body,  speech, and mind were thus held to transform common passions into their  corresponding wisdoms, leading from the illusory notion that commoners and  buddhas are different to the realization that people ensconced in passions are  not separate from the Buddha. This highly organized and structured realm of  practices that engaged the entirety of being obviously drew imperial and aristo 

cratic support.  

The text translated below comprises four separate parts. The first part offers  definitions of Shingon's main characteristics: that the Body of Essence of the  Buddha does preach; that the doctrine of the Three Mysteries is central; and that  Shingon has its own precepts, which the retired emperor is about to take upon  himself. This is followed by a description of the lineage of transmission of these  teachings, that of the so-called Eight Patriarchs, to legitimate Kukai's own posi 

tion. In the second part, Kukai outlines the differences between exoteric and  esoteric Buddhisms, which differences account for the different types of precepts.  He then discusses the eight schools of Buddhism in existence at the time, and  stipulates that the precepts to be taken at this point are the samaya ("pledge")  precepts particular to Shingon. Kukai then discusses the various meanings of the  Sanskrit term samaya, which is variously interpreted as equality, original vow,  removal of obstacles, and attainment of awakening. The third part outlines the  categories of canonical texts, classified by Kukai as the "five storehouses": sutra  (scriptures), vinaya (codes of conduct), abhidharma (philosophical treatises), pra-

PRECEPTS FOR AN EMPEROR 151  

jna (wisdom literature), and dharanis (esoteric formulas, bearers of wisdom). Ku kai then discusses the eight schools of Buddhism current at his time, enumerating  the different types of texts that form their basis, thereby characterizing the schools'  tendencies and audiences. He uses this discussion to clarify the position of Shin gon precepts within the overall framework of Buddhist teachings and practices.  Finally, in the fourth part, Kukai analyzes the Shingon precepts and emphasizes  that practitioners of esoteric Buddhism are to develop four types of mental  achievement: the confident mind, the great compassionate mind, the critical  mind, and the awakened mind. Kukai then defines the term "precept," discussing  two of its features: vinaya (discipline) as control, and sila (morality) as calm.

Precepts for an Emperor  

1.  

Lest one be endowed with the legs of the asura, the eight-yojana-deep [seventy one-mile-deep] oceans shall remain unfathomable; and lest one be endowed  with the wings of the phoenix, the wind-blown summits of the nine mountains  shall remain forbidden to sight. As the wide and solid earth will be reduced to  cinders, so the mighty billows of black clouds will be dispersed by raging gales.  Only upon the appearance of a great dragon does the wish-fulfilling gem pro duce its treasures. Should it be taken improperly, even the miracle drug [con cocted by] the Universal Sovereign will turn to poison. What then should be  said of the rare possibility of hearing the treasury of the Mysteries of Shingon,  since they transcend the three categories of self-substance, self-aspect, and self function? And what of the difficulty inherent in gaining the Adamantine Bud dha precepts that transcend the ten stages leading to bodhisattvahood? 

152 ALLAN G. GRAPARD  

Who but members of the lineage of the Universal Monarch and the great  bodhisattvas could unite the five wisdoms in their heart-minds and realize the  Triple Mystery in their bodies? Under the insightful gaze of a doctor, a hundred  poisons are as good as medicine, just as in the light of the Buddha's wisdom  all living beings appear as buddhas. The corporeal nature of all living beings  and the realm of essence of all buddhas are originally of a single flavor and are  not distinct. However, those living beings who do not awaken [to this truth]  are subjected to pain during their long slumber, while the buddhas are fully  awakened and reside permanently in a state of bliss.  

In disclosing the doctrine of Shingon, the Buddha showed the right way to  those who are lost, so that all living beings might immediately awaken to their  Buddha mind and swiftly return to the original source. That is why it is said  in the Kongochogyo [Vajrasekharasutra, Taisho 865]:  

The storehouse of dharanis and mantras contains the ultimate secret teach ings of the Tathagata [a title for the Buddha]; it contains the doctrine of self awakening, its attendant knowledge, and the practice leading to its dem onstration. Furthermore, it is the samadhi ("concentration") gate through  

which all bodhisattvas must pass in order to receive the incommensurable  meanings of the pure precepts of the Buddha; it is the location at which,  ascending the platform of the ocean-assembly of all tathagatas, they will  receive the various degrees of initiation and, transcending the triple world,  will acquire the teachings of the Buddha. When all causes are collected, they  will immediately bring together wisdom and broad virtues and, reaching the  "awakening without superior," attain the point of no possible return. Having  left all the gods and demons behind, with absolutely every passion, fault,  and obstruction dissolved in each moment of thought, they will come to  realize the quadruple body of the essence of the Buddha. This is known as  the Buddha of Self-Nature."  

. . . It is also said in the Rokuharamitsukyo [Taisho 261], "All the teachings  of the Buddha are contained in the five storehouses." Of these five store houses, the sutra-pitaka is tantamount to milk, while the dharani-pitaka is  tantamount to ghee. Furthermore, it is said in the Kongochogyo, "The Bud dha's metamorphic body achieved awakening in the kingdom of Magadha  in the land of Jambu-dvipa and expounded the teachings of the Three Ve hicles to the various bodhisattvas, sravakas ["auditors," persons who attain  emancipation while listening to the Buddha], pratyeka-buddhas ["lonebud dhas,"who attain emancipation as a result of causal factors], and common  folk he met. He would now employ teachings conforming to their minds,  and then teachings conforming to his own. Those who, according to their  capacities and in congruence with the expedient devices, put his teachings  into practice - they shall gain the fruit available to men and gods. Or, ob taining the fruit of liberation of the Three Vehicles, they will - either by  advancing or retreating - obtain the realization of buddhahood upon com-

PRECEPTS FOR AN EMPEROR 153  

pletion of ascetic practices over three incommensurable periods of time, at  the level of "awakening without superior." Born in a royal palace, extinct in  the sala grove, the Buddha bequeathed his body as relics. Those who build  stupas and revere him will gain the wonderful reward available to men and  gods, and shall initiate the course whose end is nirvana.  

The above segment interprets the sermon of the Buddha in his body of bliss,  residing in the heavenly palace of akanistha, in the fourth ecstasy at the summit  of the realm of form. The proof thereof is visible in all bodhisattvas who have  completed the ten stages and in all tathagatas who fill the all-pervasive realm  of essence. That Buddha jolts his own heart-mind into awakening; therefore,  this [interpretation] is different from the demonstration of the immediate  "awakening without superior."  

The Buddha of Essential Nature thereupon released, through emanation  from his heart-mind, an incommensurable number of bodhisattvas, all having  one and the same diamond nature. Encountering that cosmic buddha, they  acquired the various degrees of initiation. Expounding the doctrine of the Tri 

ple Mystery one by one, these bodhisattvas approached Mahavairocana and all  the tathagatas, and requested the teaching of empowerment. The venerable  Mahavairocana then declared,  

As members of the Supreme Vehicle, in the future and for an incommen surable number of [time-]worlds, you shall be enabled to achieve both mun dane and extra-mundane completions in the course of your lifetime.  

Having thus received the Tathagata's behest, all those bodhisattvas revered  the buddha's feet. Circumambulating Mahavairocana, they then withdrew, each  to his original quarters in the cosmos where, becoming five-storied stupas,  these bodhisattvas held forth the banner of the teaching. And thus, whether  by vision, by audition, or by penetration of the five circular mandala platforms,  they became proficient in extracting the karmic obstructions of sentient beings  who wander about in the wheel of transmigration. Seated in the midst of five  lunar circles, they moved from one buddha to the next, revered him and re 

ceived his teaching, and thereby gained the "awakening without superior" and  produced the confirmation of "no more rebirth." This is similar to the diamond  that cannot be crushed. Such is the Assembly of Mahavairocana. Thus did they  become the symbolic body of Mahavairocana. Each bodhisattva, each diamond,  residing in its own deliverance, residing in its own concentration - and all  residing in the power of the vow of great compassion - thus assists all sentient  beings, far and near. Either by vision or by audition, all fully confirm their  concentration and realize the immediate completion of all virtues and wisdoms.  

This Mahavairocana tathagata, in his physical body in the realm of essence  as well as in his quadruple body of essence in which the five wisdoms are  realized, resides together with an assembly of vajrasattvas [thunderbolt-beings]  and buddhas as numerous as specks of dust, either within the palace of the 

154 ALLAN G. GRAPARD  

realm of essence or in the heart-mind palace of [the bodhisattva] Samanta bhadra, and unceasingly expounds the secret storehouse of Shingon, the  Unique Diamond Vehicle.  

A long time ago, following the extinction of the tathagata Sakyamuni, there  lived a great master named Nagarjuna; he was initiated by [the Master of Mys teries] Vajrasattva and thus gained access to the teaching of mysteries. His  disciple Nagabodhi received these teachings from Nagarjuna. Nagabodhi lived  for over nine hundred years and had more than thirty faces. He resided in  southern India, where he spread those teachings. His disciple Vajrabodhi trans mitted those teachings to China when he arrived there in 720. His superior  disciple Amoghavajra went to India between 742 and 746 to study under Va jrabodhi, gained [access to] the Kongochogyo and the Dainichikyo [scriptures]  as well as to the five kinds of mandalas [forming the Diamond mandala], and  then returned to China. Three emperors were initiated by him: they took the  Buddha precepts and entered the practice of the Triple Mystery. Among Amo ghavajra's disciples, eight received his dharma seal [confirmation]. One of those  was Huiguo of the Qinglong-si [temple], versed in the teachings of the two  [mandala] realms and in no way inferior to his master's style. He bestowed the  precepts to Emperor Dezong and to an imperial prince, and granted them the  initiation. Huiguo was the seventh patriarch, the acarya [supreme master] of  the transmission of the doctrine. As for my humble self, I was fortunate enough  to live in a peaceful world and to have developed a thirst for the Buddhist  teachings. Living under the august protection of this sacred court and resting  upon the compassionate power of the great master, on the thirteenth day of  the sixth month of the year 805, I took the Buddha's samaya precepts in the  Initiation Hall of the Eastern Hall of the Qinglong-si [temple] in Chang-an,  and was granted initiation into the five parts of the mandala. [Subsequently]  undertaking a lengthy voyage, I forgot the brevity of existence and, throwing  my life, precarious as a bubble, onto the seething waves of the ocean, I brought  the two mandalas and more than one hundred scrolls of scriptures of the  Diamond Vehicle back to Japan, hoping thereby to repay my debt to the court.  Favored by chance again, I was greeted by this imperial court, a manifestation  on earth of the buddhas and a court that follows the enlightened policy of a  cakravartin. Thus, in the year 806 I was able to present the court with the two  mandalas and a number of scriptures. Due to my own lack of a sense of urgency,  however, seventeen years have already elapsed since that time. However,  Heaven sometimes grants human desires, and due to a favorable convergence  of circumstances I now face the dragon-face of the emperor and thus realize  my humble wish. Simultaneously feeling exultation and sadness, it is is difficult  to remain poised.  

When reflecting upon the topic, it is clear that the present emperor has  reached such an exalted status as a result of karmic conditions that developed  long ago, and because the consequence of those conditions came to fruition in  the lifetime preceding the present one. It is because compassion has not ex-

PRECEPTS FOR AN EMPEROR 155  

hausted itself and because all living beings are here that he now manifests  himself in this domain and exerts himself for the salvation of all. At the present  juncture this [retired] emperor has withdrawn from public affairs and has set  his mind to wu-wei [non-interference]. In order to protect the stronghold of  the Buddhist teachings (dharma) he now temporarily displays his capacity for  investiture in the Buddhist code (dharma) and, out of compassion for all living  beings, deigns to listen to a sermon pronounced by an unworthy commoner.  Is it not cause for joy that today the four classes of ecclesiasts, as well as the  great and small of this world, have come to see the emperor and his son the  imperial prince take these Buddha precepts so that they may quickly reach the  stage of the buddha?  

I thus humbly formulate the following vow. . . .  

II.  

This heart-mind of ours is greater than the Great Void; the buddha that is  inside this self of ours transcends the realm of essence. Even the metaphor of  the number of specks of dust in the universe is ill-suited to describe the number  of temples; even the metaphor of the brilliance of the sun and moon is inade 

quate to express the radiance of the cintamani [wish-fulfilling] gem. There is  no need for practice, since the pure awakened one is present within from time  immemorial; there is no need for meditation, since the essence (sattva) of  innate awakening is already naturally obtained.  

The godhead endowed with the five wisdoms stands atop our neck, and the  four types of mandalas are comprised in our four limbs. The principle of utter  suchness and the wisdom of absolute emptiness cannot be separated from one's  body, in the same way that if one were to cut its feet off, one could not advance,  or if one were to cut its hands off, one could not grasp anything. Ah, wonderful  indeed are the mandalas, wonderful indeed this Triple Mystery of ours! But it  is precisely there that violent winds surge and stir immense waves on the ocean;  it is there that dark clouds evolve and kick stunning dust storms into being.  The tigers of empty dreams crowd every corner of the triple world, while the  flowers of illusion shed their radiance in the homes of the four classes of beings.  Foolish attachments to a self conceived either as a source or as an agent of  being push their roots ever deeper into the heart, while the illusions of mate rialism and being further obscure our consciousness with their thickening fo 

liage. Three types of foolish attachments cast their shadow to hide the light of  the great sun, while the illusory thought of a true being as permanent, blissful,  pure, and autonomous cloud the moon of awakening. Deeply ensconced in a  sleep from which we fail to awaken, we dwell in the raging fires of the triple  world. As a consequence, the twelve causal factors never cease to spur the  wheel of transmigration, while the five aggregates (skandhas) and their ensuing  eight types of frustrations never tire of their illusionist tricks. Father and son  go on engendering father and son, and body-minds go on reproducing body-

156 ALLAN G. GRAPARD  

minds that appear and disappear. The suffering of birth, the suffering of death,  the pain of aging, the pain of disease, the frustation of poverty, the frustration  of wealth - these six types of suffering constantly threaten us, while hell awaits  us all. When even the gods know no peace, what might be said of the human  condition?  

It is because the compassionate father of great awakening has clearly appre ciated this situation that he dispenses antidotes for the types of disease we  suffer from, that he devises method upon method to show how lost we are and  to show us the way back to the original source. Just as there are distinctions  between weak and strong poisons, so there are distinctions between shallow  and deep doctrinal medicines. The vehicles, be they double or triple, are offered  according to situation, just as the rafts of exoteric and esoteric doctrines are  offered according to merit. But they are offered. Such is the reason for which  the types of precepts vary structurally, in accordance with types of doctrine.  As Nagarjuna stated, "There are five types of precepts: men-and-god precepts,  Sravaka precepts, pratyeka-buddha precepts, bodhisattva precepts, and samaya  precepts."  

The precepts taken today are those of this final fifth category. The [conven tional] ten good precepts are similar in the five classes outlined above; they  merely vary in depth, according to the breadth of the issues. Furthermore, just  as there are four and ten types of distinctions in the sravaka and bodhisattva  precepts, there are distinctions in the samaya precepts [taken today]. However,  their meaning varies even though their name remains the same. Thus, although  the four types of precepts offered in the sravaka and bodhisattva categories are  here as usual, they have a different meaning in the present case, to which we  will return. [However,] let it be clear that it is not only the precepts but also  the corresponding wisdoms that change accordingly.  

If one is speaking of vehicles, there are five. If one is speaking of schools,  eight offer different directions. These are: Ritsu, Kusha, Jojitsu, Hosso, Sanron,  Tendai, Kegon, and Shingon. The Ritsu school prevents harm from the seven  factors that issue from body and speech: its four introspections lead toward  the ultimate goal in which the body is reduced to ashes and knowledge extin 

guished. The Kusha school discusses the concept of the true existence of the  three temporal worlds, whereas the Jojitsu school teaches the emptiness of all  phenomena (dharmas). Their aim is to realize arhatship, the goal of the Lesser  Vehicle. The three preceding schools form the Lesser Vehicle. The Hosso  school teaches the concepts of the eight forms of consciousness and the triple  nature, proposes in a wonderful fashion the principle of consciousness-only  without objects of perception, and broadly develops a universal doctrine of  causation. It establishes a vertical hierarchy of fifty-two degrees, and expounds  the view of three incommensurable units of time. The Hosso [teachings] thus  put an end to those who are foolish enough to dispense with the law of cause  and effect, and to those ignorant people who are led astray by the objects of  perception outside the mind: they are a balm that soothes all living beings that 

PRECEPT S FOR A N EMPERO R 157  

are bursting with arrogance, and are [collectively] known as the doctrine of  the samadhi of great compassion of [the bodhisattva] Maitreya. The Sanron  school excels at teaching the principle of the eight negations, and in a won derful fashion lays all false opinions and views to rest. It affords insight into  what it calls the unique truth of nonproduction, whence it develops the concept  of middle path of absolute and relative truths. This doctrine may be compared  to a violent fire that consumes the three poisons and the four demons, or to a  raging wind that disperses the clouds of false reasoning. It ranks as a superior  medicine capable of sweeping away all attachments of body and mind, and of  loosing all inner and outer obstacles. It is also known as the practice of the  Mother of the Buddha of Wisdom, or of the samadhi [concentration] of [the  bodhisattva] Maitreya. The Tendai school offers the teachings of the Unique  Vehicle and of the Triple Introspection, brings forth the concepts of four teach 

ings and of undivided suchness, and reaches its wonderful culmination in the  concepts of a single thought-moment, triple truth, and mediate idealism. It is  grounded in the foundations of the Lotus Sutra and of the Treatise of Middle  Introspection, and is centered on Mount Tiantai [in China, and Mount Hiei in  Japan]. It is known as the practice of Avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva of great  compassion. The Kegon school is wonderfully apt at expounding nonobstruc 

tion in the Realm of Essence, and discusses at length the concept of harmo nization of fact and principle. It thus annihilates the disease in which phenom ena (dharmas) are conceived of as having an unchanging nature, and prescribes  the medicine of nondistinction between mind and Buddha. Should one attempt  to define its practice, it might be called the practice of the samadhi in the realm  of essence of [the bodhisattva] Samantabhadra. The various teachings of the  schools outlined above are as so many decrees from the Law (dharma) King,  issuing from his governmental offices. They expand in depth and breadth, and  display great limpidity and radiant effulgence; they are miraculous remedies  applied in accordance with the occasion by Sakyamuni, the emperor of the  Buddhist law (dharma) and king of medicine.  

The code (dharma) that is about to be sworn to at the present moment is  the Secret Mandala performed by the tathagata Mahavairocana, who resides in  the mind palace of the adamantine realm of essence, and who manifests himself  as the five tathagatas, who represent as many wisdoms in their quadruple body 

form, together with their many inner cohorts. The tathagata Mahavairocana's  attributes are virtues as numerous as the grains of sand in the desert, of which  none whatsoever is lacking. That is why he also receives the name of mandala,  which has the following meanings: incomparable flavor, unsurpassable savor,  and perfect circularity. Those who are to enter this vehicle must first abide by  these precepts. These are named samaya, and the teaching is called mantra  [Shingon]. The term samaya is Sanskrit; in its Chinese rendition it means  original vow, equality, acquisition.  

The term equality refers to the triple equality, since it indicates the equality  of the triple mystery of body, speech, and mind. It is also known as the Three158 ALLAN G. GRAPAR D  

Parts, which refer to the Buddha, the Lotus, and Diamond. All buddhas of these  Three Parts possess the four types of mandala and the quadruple body of es sence. All these divine entities are equal to one other and there is no distinction  of increase or decrease, of superiority or inferiority between them. That is why  one uses the term equality. These divine entities exist in an incommensurable  number; and this incommensurable number of buddhas all exist within a single  being. This doctrine holds that one must fully contemplate all these buddhas  within [oneself], and then go on to contemplate the buddhas within other  living beings. It is in order to contemplate the buddhas within himself that the  Buddha exerts himself in the contemplation of the Triple Mystery, and it is for  the sake of other living beings that he practices according to that vow.  

The term "original vow" indicates the lack of distinction that the Buddha  maintains between himself and all other living beings. It is for this reason that  he formulated this great vow, and that he practices compassion accordingly.  This vow consists of the Four Incommensurables and the Four Acquisitions.  It is of benefit to all living beings and saves all forms of life. This makes him  the father of all living beings, something to keep in mind.  

The term "acquisition" means entrance into the self and entrance of the self.  The buddhas of oneself, numerous as specks of dust, easily enter the self of  others; while the buddhas of another self, numerous as specks of dust, easily  penetrate one's own mind's buddhas, and thus in complete reciprocity carry  out the functions of acquirable and acquired, of potential and realization. If  one meditates on this principle, one acquires the universal mind.  

Furthermore, one may propose an interpretation based on linguistic  grounds. The term sa-ma-ya refers to the Three Treasures, namely, to the Three  Parts. The term sa refers to the various doctrinal truths. Truth is something  that can be gained only through meditation in the practice of the samadhi of  great compassion of [the bodhisattva] Avalokitesvara. The term ma refers to  that which the self cannot gain, namely, emptiness. Emptiness is another name  for the tathagata who does not promote false reasoning - [that is, the bodhi 

sattva] Maitreya - and it is known as the practice of great wisdom. The term  ya means vehicle, but refers to a vehicle that cannot be boarded. The vajrasattva  of primordial being is without beginning or end, and knows neither production  nor destruction; its nature is constant and equal to the void. Since it neither  comes nor goes, who could board it? Its course has already been run. This is  why it is termed "unboardable vehicle." The three virtues delineated above form  the attributes of the tathagata Mahavairocana. Mahavairocana's physical attrib utes are all subsumed under these three syllables, and it is in order to reveal  this that the term sa-ma-ya is used. Should one grasp this concept and chant  these three syllables, one will acquire absolutely all of the tathagata Mahavai 

rocana's virtues and wisdoms. Expand on these concepts. I have been unable  to offer them in a compact form. Of all the doctrines of the Greater Vehicle, this  doctrine is the most venerable and the most noble. That is why it is stated in 

PRECEPT S FOR A N EMPERO R 15 9  

the Rokuharamitsugyo and in the Shugokokkyo: . . . [these two quotations are  missing in the original].  

III.  

However imperceptible the dragon's breath may be, it can instantly stir the  clouds of the entire universe into motion; and small though the eye may be, it  can at once perceive immense depths and horizons. And what can one say of  the asura's legs, able to fathom the depths of the ocean; or of the wings of the  phoenix, able to carry it to immense heights? But these are still unconsequential  metaphors: when it comes to evaluating the bodhisattvas' production of the  mind of awakening, or the mental preparation of the vajrasattva whose heart mind comprises the entire realm of essence and who treats all living beings as  if they were the object of his fourfold duty, what can one say? They extract  suffering from all living beings and replace it with pleasure. The extraction of  suffering cannot be effected without correct practice, and it is impossible to  grant pleasure without correct teaching (dharma). The terms "correct practice"  and "correct teaching" cover practices and doctrines that are manifold by virtue  of the multiplicity of occasions [for which they are appropriate]. The means  to deal with situations and occasions vary accordingly. There are five major  means to grasp the end and return to the origin. As is stated in the Daijorishu rokuharamitsugyo, immeasurable are the treasures of doctrine the tathagatas  have at their disposal:  

Five broad distinctions can be made. First comes the sutra-pitaka; second,  the vinaya-pitaka; third, the abhidharma-pitaka; fourth, the prajna-pitaka;  and fifth, the dharani-pitaka. The sutra-pitaka is intended for those who  enjoy ecstatic introspection in the forests. The vinaya-pitaka is for those who  enjoy living in cities and monasteries, who are interested in proper form,  who wish to harmonize themselves and hold on to the correct teaching. The  abhidharma-pitaka is for those who do not enjoy the above two and prefer  to polish the aspect of nature, or for those who enjoy the examination of  deep principles. The prajna-pitaka is either for those who, not enjoying any  of the above, distance themselves from attachments and false reasoning, and  who, swiftly reaching a state of nondiscrimination, enjoy abiding in calm ness; or it is for those who, not enjoying any of the above, quickly cut off  all passions and enjoy exiting from the round of transmigration and who  thereby attest to the body of essence. Finally, the dharani-pitaka has been  devised by the Buddha for those who break the quadruple injunction for  monks; the octuple injunction for nuns; for those who perpetrate the five  major sins; for those who ridicule the Vaipulya sutra corpus, and for icchan tikas ["willful ones" who never attain awakening] and other similar beings.  The five storehouses [of doctrine] as described above are classified along the 

160 ALLAN G. GRAPARD  

five stages of production of ghee: the sutras are like milk, . . . and the dhar anls are like ghee. Ghee is the most wonderful and delicate of all flavors and  is able to cure disease in the same way as the dharanis. Dharanis enable one  to destroy all obstructions to the cutting off all passions, to the swift reali zation of happiness and wisdom, and the witnessing of the immediate real ization of the body of essence.  

Thus five categories are established to classify the teachings expounded by  the Buddha. As for those teachings that are expounded by bodhisattvas and  men, there are eight schools: first, Ritsu; second, Kusha; third, Jojitsu; fourth,  Hosso; fifth, Sanron; sixth, Tendai; seventh, Kegon; and eighth, Shingon. The  first three make up the Lesser Vehicle; the next four constitute the Greater  Vehicle. The last one is called the Diamond Vehicle of Mysteries. . . . Thus the  first seven schools constitute exoteric Buddhism. It is possible to suggest that  their contents range from shallow to deep; nevertheless, these are teachings of  various manifestations of the Buddha, medicines granted according to situa tions. Thus the great king of medicine dispenses his cures according to the  type of disease and in virtue of the type of recipient. That is why the precepts  vary in accordance with these categories of teachings. And this is why Nagar juna stated, "There are five types of precepts: men and gods precepts, sravaka  precepts, pratyeka-buddha precepts, bodhisattva precepts, and samaya pre 

cepts." The precepts to be taken presently are the samaya precepts.  

IV.  

The twelve hundred herbal cures and the seventy-two kinds of medicinal prep arations have been devised out of compassion for the ills of the body, just as  the wonderful teachings (dharmas) in twelve parts and eighty-four thousand  stanzas were expounded to relieve kindly the ills of the mind. Since the ills of  the body are many, there is no panacea; and since the affections of the mind  are manifold, the teachings found in scriptures are not universal. Thus the  World-honoured One dispenses various drugs to cure equally varied kinds of  afflictions. The five virtues of Confucianism and the five prohibitions form the  basic medicine geared to the indigent child; the six practices and four intro 

spections are best for that indigent one. The 250 precepts, the four introspec tions and the eight powerful concentrations, the twelve causal factors and the  twelve practical vows (dhutas) allow one to take evasive action from the human  self and to affirm concentration {sanmai) - to keep the Dharma to oneself, and  thereby attain nirvana. These are soothing teachings for the sravakas, and a  remedy for the pratyeka buddhas. Beyond these, the causation of compassion,  the introspection of consciousness to fight illusions, the practice of the six  perfections, and the application of the four means of conversion enable one to  accumulate such deeds for three incommensurable periods of time and thereby  gain the fruit of the four wisdoms: such are the medicines of the Great Vehicle. 

PRECEPT S FOR A N EMPERO R 16 1  

Yet beyond gaining emancipation through rejection of the no-self, gaining  insight into the unborn and awakening to the essence of mind - activities such  as these enable one to wield the eight negations and cut through the eight  errors, whereas rejecting the five attachments empowers one to expunge the  five great prejudices. The four types of language thus lead beyond language  and enable one to penetrate the realm of noninterference, while the nine types  of perception are laid to rest: these are wonderful techniques that enable one  to awaken to the unborn character of the mind. Or, contemplating one's own  heart-mind in the middle of a lotus blossom, one reaches the point of unity  between wisdom and the object of the senses. The three truths are harmonized  and thereby shed light on the six types of immediacy; these are like acupunc ture and cauterization, and lead to the unique heart of the way of truth. What  then is to be said of the relationship between the realm of essence and Indra's  net? One who contemplates one's heart-mind's buddhas, and realizes that gold  and the lion are not separate and that waves and wetness are one, thereby  delineates the intricate patterns of the doctrine of the six aspects and ten mys teries. One then perceives the distinctions between the five teachings and the  four vehicles, realizes at once the correct awakening, and confirms the buddha  fruit at the end of three lifetimes. That is, namely, the buddha fruit of the heart mind of ultimate no-self-nature. All these wonderful doctrines cure the various  affections of the mind in an undescribable manner. Such is the nectar ex 

pounded by the manifestations of the Buddha for the sake of others.  

The samaya Buddha precepts to be granted presently are those of the Shingon  mandala teachings expounded by the body of essence of self-nature of Maha vairocana. Should there be any good man or woman, monk or nun, or men or  women of pure trust who should wish to board this vehicle and practice ac cordingly, they should first produce four types of mind. The first is the con fident mind, second the great compassionate mind, third the critical mind, and  fourth the awakened mind.  

First, the confident mind is produced so that one may be empowered to  maintain strong resolve without faltering. There are ten meanings to the term  "confidence": purity, so as to purify and render the mind clear and bright;  resolve, in order to fortify the nature of the mind; joy, in order to cut short all  frustrations; lack of disdain, so that negligence might be abandoned; equanim 

ity, in order to hold the same attitude in all situations; respect, in order that  the venerable ones not be the object of spite; acquiescence, in order that one  not react aggressively to words or actions; praise, in order that all actions be  the object thereof; indestructibility, in order that the mind may remain set; and  love, in order that the great compassionate mind may appear.  

This great compassionate mind is also called the mind of the vow to practice.  The so-called external ways and Two Vehicles do not give rise to it; however,  bodhisattvas do produce it in such manner that when they look at all beings  without exception in the realm of essence, they think that they are in fact  looking upon themselves. The mindset of a good person puts others before 

162 ALLAN G. GRAPARD  

oneself, and puts oneself after all others. Elsewhere, when looking at the three  periods of time, all a compassionate mind sees are the four debts of gratitude,  whose objects have fallen prey to the three evil destinations and thereby end lessly suffer. However, a good person regards all and anyone as his father, or  regards himself as their disciple. Who therefore is in need of salvation but  oneself? That is why one must produce the great compassionate mind. Great  compassion is good at dispensing cures, whereas great wisdom is good at re moving pain. . . . Though there are ten thousand distinctions in doctrines and  

medicines, their basis is formed by the eight vehicles described above.  As already stated, depth of treatment and speed of recovery vary with the  types of afflictions and situations; it is in order to be able to decide which  among many teachings is correct that one must develop the third mind, the  critical mind. This is also called the mind of deep wisdom. How does one reach  a judgment? It is like a superior man who, wishing to return to the home of  his heart-mind through the practice of the Dharma, first requires a choice as  to what kind of vehicle he will use. Should he desire to come to a decision  concerning the superiority of certain modes of transportation, he should not  rely upon the knowledge of the common man, of the Two Vehicles, or even of  the bodhisattvas of the ten stages. He should rely solely upon the teachings of  the Tathagata.  

The Tathagata has clearly expounded those differences. One should therefore  rely on his predictions and knowledge in order to reach a judgment. Com moners are engaged in producing a karma based on the ten defilements; they  are enmired in the three poisons and the five types of desires and, what is more,  ignore that they will be subjected to the sufferings of hell. This is why a Shingon  man of knowledge does not become attached to pleasures. As far as the doctrine  of the human vehicle for commoners is concerned - although it may be said  that it instills belief in the law of cause and effect, and that it entices one to  practice the five constancies and the five precepts - it must be emphasized that  that is still a totally human cause and does not grant the joy of rebirth in  heaven. Thus, one should not be attached to [its] pleasures. The vehicle of  external ways, which allows rebirth in heaven, grants the pleasures of the  twenty heavens that span the space between the residence of the four heavenly  guardians at the bottom and the realm of nonthought at the top. Nonetheless,  it still leads to the hells, and is unable to release one from transmigration.  Thus, one should not be attached to [its] pleasures. The next vehicle enables  one to exit the triple world; nonetheless, it is really of an inferior order. Is it  not, in fact, unsatisfactory for those auditors (sravakas) who must pass either  three lifetimes [if intelligent] or sixty kalpas [if foolish: a kalpa is an extremely  long period of time], or seven or eight lifetimes just to take vows; or [for the  pratyekabuddhas] four lifetimes [if intelligent] or eight kalpas [if foolish] of  practice? Thus, one should not seek [its] pleasures. The two doctrines of the  Great Vehicle require that one forget about life and grant his wife and children  to others, and that one enter the ten thousand practices of the six perfections 

PRECEPT S FOR AN EMPERO R 163  

for a duration of three great incommensurable periods of time. The unbeliev ably great cosmic stone is high and wide and difficult to encompass, and the  heart-mind is frail and therefore eager to retreat and unable to advance easily.  Knowing that as a rule for every ten steps forward one takes nine steps back ward, how can one persist? The "way similar to reality" wipes away the mind's  filth and enables one to penetrates the realm of purity, and by harmonizing  the realms of perception and wisdom it allows one to attest to suchness; none theless, it is still representative of the pleasure of knowing that one is on the  path to truth and purity, and it therefore does not permit entry to the diamond  storehouse. Thus, one also avoids this sort of path. It may be said that the mind  of ultimate no-self-nature harmonizes with the realm of essence and attests to  the body in the three periods of time, and that it is comparable to Indra's net  and allows gain of the great unique body of essence; nonetheless, it is still the  cause of realization of buddhahood as incipient buddha. It is not possible to  complete the realization in the five aspects or the fourfold mandala. One should  not take this path either, because it seems to suggest that nonrealization is  realization, and that nonarrival is arrival.  

In this manner, basing oneself upon the teachings of the Tathagata and form ing the supreme wisdom, one is able to choose the best of all vehicles, and  thereby give rise to the mind of awakening. Should one board any of the pre ceding vehicles and tread these paths, however, one will not be able to realize  the pure mind of awakening. That is why the bodhisattvas of Shingon transcend  these various stages of the mind and give rise to the mind of awakening, and  practice such awakening. It is because they know the distinctions between the  vehicles that they produce the critical mind of profound wisdom.  

As far as the term "mind of awakening" is concerned, there are two major  distinctions. First is that which is potential, and second is that which is fictive.  In the case of the potential mind, imagine someone who wishes to do either  good or harm: first, he must have such an intention, and then he must perform  an act. Those who are in quest of the mind of awakening are not unlike persons  in this situation. Or take the case of a madman. . . . Thus it is clear that [mad 

men] are like drunken people who find themselves in the prison of the triple  world, and that, overcome by sleep, they lay themselves down in the bushes  of the six destinations. How could they possibly board the vehicle of super natural powers and swiftly return to the decorated seat of original awakening?  

The fictive mind of awakening is the body of the inexhaustibly beautiful  Diamond realm. The quadruple body and the fourfold mandala of Mahavai rocana are coexistent with all living beings, with which they forever share  absolute equality. However, people fail to realize this [truth] because the five  obstacles obstruct the way, or because the three delusions block their view like  a dense fog. If one meditates on the radiance of the sun and of the moon,  chants the mantras, is empowered by the triple mystery, and is versed in the  wonderful technique of the mystic hand gestures (mudrd), then the rays of the  universal sun will shine forth, and all obstacles of ignorance will instantly 

164 ALLAN G. GRAPAR D  

dissolve in the ocean of mind. Ignorance will instantly become knowledge, and  poison will become cure. The divinities of the seven parts of the diamond and  of the three parts of the womb mandalas will appear together in their circular  perfection, and buddhas and bodhisattvjjs as numerous as the specks of dust  in the desert or as drops of water in the ocean will spontaneously surge forth.  To establish residence in this meditation is called the samadhi of mysteries.  

The various tathagatas take these three - the compassionate mind, the criti cal mind, and the samadhi mind - and make them their precepts, which they  never abandon, even for a single moment. Why should these be called precepts?  There are two kinds of precepts. The first one is vinaya, which translates as  "control." The second is sila, which translates as "purity" and "calm." When  the Buddha sees living beings, he sees himself or the four objects of gratitude.  That is why he refrains from killing. When he contemplates living beings, he  sees his own body; that is why he does not steal their property. When he sees  living beings, he sees the objects of gratitude; that is why he does not think ill  or insult. . . . Since a buddha practices the compassionate mind, he naturally  stays away from the ten evil deeds. To stay away from the ten evil deeds is,  namely, the [semantic value of] precept as control. And since he stays away  from the evil mind, his mind is pure and calm; that is the precept of sila. It is  also called the precept of benefiting animate beings.  

Finally, when one looks at the preceding nine stages of the mind with pro found wisdom, it appears that they have no self-nature. It is like the winter  freeze that flows away with the thaw of spring, or like a piece of flint that  disappears as it produces fire. All phenomena (dharmas) are born of causes,  and therefore have no self-nature. That is why, ultimately, the resident of the  first stage, though he be one-sided in his evil mind, can become a resident of  the second stage if he comes into contact with the teachings of a good friend.  . . . It is because all these stages have no self-nature that one can go from one  to the next. Should one use wisdom to look at everything, then one naturally  avoids evil, practices only absolute good, and benefits all living beings. These  precepts are complete and perfect. It is the same for the samadhi of mysteries:  [armed] with these precepts, those who board this [Adamantine] Vehicle can  control their own body-mind and convert other living beings. Such are the  Buddha precepts of samaya of mysteries.

### 09 Raising Snakes in Bengal

Raising Snakes in Bengal: The Use of Tantric Imagery  in Sakta Poetry Contests  

Rachel Fell McDermott  

What is Tantra in Bengal? The Sanskrit Tantras important to the region since the  fifteenth century list several central elements: selection of the proper teacher;  initiation; mantra repetition; fire worship; construction of mystic diagrams (yan tras); image worship; the honoring of young girls as embodiments of the Goddess;  cremation-ground rituals performed to gain mastery over death; and the notorious  "five M" ritual, in which wine, fish, meat, a type of intoxicating grain, and sexual  intercourse (these are the makaras, all of whose Sanskrit and Bengali names begin  with M) are used in controlled ritual circumstances - either literally (the hero's  way), through comestible alternatives (the bestial way), or by enjoying mental  substitutes (the divine way). Meditative techniques are also crucial to Tantra. The  most famous of these is kundalini yoga, or the practice of raising the serpent  power through the seven lotus-shaped spiritual centers in the body (cakras) to  the top of the head, where she unites with her consort Siva. Each of these cakras - muladhara (at the base of the spine), svadhisthana (at the genitals), manipura (at  the navel), anahata (at the heart), visuddha (in the throat), ajna (between the  eyebrows), and sahasrara (at the top of the head) - has a different number of  petals, with letters of the alphabet engraved on them, and is assigned a resident  god, goddess, animal, element, one-syllabled mantra, and sound to be enjoyed as  one passes through it. These lotuses are strung on a subtle channel called the  susumna, "the path of knowledge" or "the path to liberation." Flanking it are two  more channels, the ida to the left, symbolized by the moon, and the pingala to  the right, which represents the sun, whose influence is said to be poisonous,  causing attachment to the senses. Especially significant are the beginning, middle,  and end points of the journey: the muladhara, where the serpentine kundalini  lies coiled three and a half times around the Siva linga, waiting to be awakened  and induced to enter the door to the susumna; the anahata, where the Goddess  is installed and visualized in the heart; and the sahasrara, where Siva and Sakti, 

168 RACHE L FELL MCDERMOT T  

often as male and female swans, make love, dripping nectar for the tasting. It is  here that the soul achieves liberation and attains the blissful status of Lord Siva.  Often Tantric practitioners will meditate on special seats erected over the buried  skulls of five "unclean" beings (jackal, snake, dog, bull, and sudra). A final cate 

gory of Tantric arts relates to the tantrikas superhuman skills: he can cure with  charms and protective mantras; prognosticate via astrology; and even attain mas tery over nature through special powers. Because of these sometimes eccentric  rituals, and the philosophical principle that worldly enjoyment can be a means  to spiritual realization, Bengalis have often viewed Tantra as the upside-down  path of the mad.  

Although each of these topics is praised in the Sanskrit Tantras, they are not  emphasized uniformly by Bengali tantrikas. This chapter investigates what Tantra  has meant to a tradition of Bengali Sakta poets who utilized its themes for their  own purposes. What has been maintained, what ignored, and why?  

The tradition of "Syama Sangit," or songs composed to the black goddess Kali,  began in the middle of the eighteenth century with a gifted poet and devotee of  the Goddess, Ramprasad Sen (ca. 1718-1775). In more than three hundred po ems of praise, petition, complaint, self-exhortation, and meditative contemplation,  he set the standard for the genre, and his literary followers - over two hundred  as of the present day - have continued his lead in style and content. Two of his  most famous heirs, Kamalakanta Bhattacarya (ca. 1769-1820) and Mahendranath  (Premik) Bhattacarya (1843-1908), mirrored his achievement not only in their  composition of Sakta poetry but also in their religious lives; like Ramprasad, they  too are famed as Tantric adepts. All three have also inspired a hagiographic tra 

dition, Ramprasad since the 1850s, Kamalakanta since the 1880s, and Premik  since the 1920s. Contemporary poets continue to add luster to the tradition, with  new poetry collections and recordings appearing every year. One especially fine  example is a man whose pen name is Dinram. Although the introductions to his  published work contain almost no information about him, his literary output  demonstrates that even if he is not a practicing Sakta, he has mastered the imagery  superbly.  

I take these four poets as representative of the Syama Sangit tradition; together  they span two and a half centuries and include three men who are household  names in Bengali Goddess-worshiping contexts. Although the Tantric images,  valences, and messages of their poetry are of primary interest here, one must not  forget the hagiographic lore that has grown up, particularly around Ramprasad  and Kamalakanta - and that "interprets" for us the Tantra of the poets' compo 

sitions. Such stories, when placed beside the poems they are meant to "explain,"  demonstrate the disjunction between poetry and commentary.  A caution: Tantric themes, though important to the Sakta poetric genre as a  whole, never touch more than fifteen percent of any poet's total output. This is  true even of Ramprasad and Kamalakanta, the two figures whose Tantric procliv ities are most famed. Far more common are Kali-centered poems of adoration,  supplication, and self-abnegation. Indeed, many poets omit Tantric themes alto-RAISIN G SNAKE S I N BENGA L 169  

gether from their compositions. But the fact that contemporary poets like Dinram,  a retired government employee, still incorporate Tantra into their work is evidence  of its continued importance - even if it is ignored or feared by most.  

Is the Snake Charmer's Son a Fool? Tantra's Redeeming Features  

The most obvious Tantric influences on the Sakta poets are the dhyanas, or icon ographic descriptions of the various forms of Kali, to be visualized in or just below  the heart cakra. The Sanskrit Tantras enjoin the adept to construct a jeweled alter  in a temple of jewels underneath a wish-filling tree, on an island in a sea of nectar,  and to establish the deity there for meditation. As so depicted, Kali kills demons  on the battlefield and then stands triumphantly on the chest of Siva, also referred  to in the poetry as the Great Lord (Mahadeva), the slayer or bewitcher of Lust  (Madana or Kama), and the enemy of the demon Tripura (Tripurari). She is  beautiful - a bejeweled sixteen-year-old - and her vision grants liberation (poem  1). This emphasis upon the installation of Kali in the heart, or mind's eye, is  consistent with the biographers' characterizations of the poets: Ramprasad, Ka 

malakanta, and Premik were said to be proficient in meditation, which they per formed on their five-headed Tantric meditation seats.  

Sometimes the Goddess is not a static icon but an active partner with Siva in  erotic love making (poem 2). Watching this is so intoxicating that it befuddles  the senses and opens the final door for the rising kundalini (poem 3). The poet's  demeanor changes, too; he becomes mad, like Kali's crazy Bengali devotees Ra 

makrsna and Bamaksyapa (poem 4) - and like the Goddess herself, who is pro nounced a crackpot for mating in the poet's head (poem 3) and blighting the  creation with her injustice. You must have been on drugs, complains Dinram,  who vows to be compassionate to the victims of her caprice, while nevertheless  refusing to leave her (poem 4).  

What about real sexual union? And the five Ms? In spite of the scope given to  Siva and Sakti in the sahasrara, Bengali Sakta poetry makes almost no reference  to the fifth M. This is true of all poets, from Ramprasad to the contemporaries of  Dinram. Indeed, by their stock denigration of the "six enemies" (lust, anger, greed,  delusion, pride, and envy) and the "three strands" (goodness, activity, and ig 

norance), the poets display their mistrust of earthly passions. With the exception  of a poem by Ramprasad on cremation-ground rituals (poem 5), there are no  poems in the entire Sakta corpus on external rites - whether exoteric deity wor ship or esoteric rituals involving the five Ms. On the contrary, a common theme  in the poetic literature is the uselessness of physical rites, which cannot aid in the  task of raising the kundalini to the city (a common image for the sahasrara) where  there is no darkness, sleep, or unconsciousness. Expecting to find happiness from  the world is like marrying a widow (poem 6). However, one can use the world  to liberate oneself from it. Like the waterpoured into the ear to induce it to drain,  or like the grandson Knowledge who kills the grandparents Worldly Attachment 

170 RACHEL FELL MCDERMOTT  

into whose family he was born (poem 6), Tantric philosophy encourages a careful  recourse to earthly enjoyments. Hence the importance of the teacher, Srinath, or  the Lord.  

Although the poetry of Ramprasad, Kamalakanta, and Premik is thus strikingly  lacking in references to ritual practice of any sort, the legacy of the biographic  tradition is less clear. All three men were known as Tantric practitioners, and one  can still visit the sites of their five-headed seats. However, all three were also  householders. Although Kamalakanta is depicted as a man who learned the five  M practice at Tarapith, a famous Tantric temple in Bengal, his biographers are  quick to point out that he only engaged in the ritual with his wife, and never  ejaculated. Premik deliberately gave up his overt Tantric practices - even ceasing  to use his five-headed seat - when he began to have children, and counseled his  followers to live a spiritual life within the acceptable confines of worldly expec tations. Hence the poets' lack of interest in ritualized sex accords with the ori 

entation of the Bengali tradition as a whole, which has a stake in representing its  tantrikas as practicing the "divine" or internalized path. From such a perspective,  watching Siva and Sakti in union is the equivalent of engaging in the fifth M  oneself.  

If ritual is not the main focus of the Sakta poets, let us turn to what is: the  intricacies of kundalini yoga. A few poems describe the entire upward journey,  but most focus on a single lotus. One example we have already discussed: the  heart lotus, where one enshrines one's chosen deity and worships her according  to prescribed iconographic descriptions. Another is the ajna lotus, where the three  subtle channels, ida, pihgala, and susumna, come together in a plait between the  eyebrows. This confluence, called the tribeni in Bengali, is said in the poems to  be a spiritual Kasi (Varanasi); "bathing" in its waters brings the highest spiritual  cleansing and pleasure.  

All four of our Tantric poets write about the merits of immersion at this con fluence. One representative sample by Ramprasad is an extended metaphor about  pilgrimage, except that the destination is not a physical site. The horse of the  mind pulls the six-wheeled chariot of the body (a reference to the first six lotuses  of kundalini yoga), with the soul for a charioteer and the two- syllabled Goddess,  Ka-li, as a passenger. Coursing past the five senses and their objects, impelled by  the five vital breaths, the soul reaches Tribeni Ghat, where he refreshes himself  (poem 7).  

This type of poem has an odd history in the biographic literature. In Rampra sad's corpus it acts as a proof-text for a story in which the poet plans a trip to  Kasi, but gets only as far as Tribeni - a town in northern Bengal - when the  Goddess tells him that she is pleased with his efforts and requires him to go no  further, since all pilgrimage places lie at her feet. The biographers have external ized the theme of the poem and devotionalized the moral, never hinting at the  embedded poem's Tantric implications. The strain between poetry and biography  is still more pronounced in Kamalakanta's case. He too writes poems on bathing  at Tribeni, and his biography contains an almost exact copy of Ramprasad's pil-

RAISIN G SNAKE S I N BENGA L 171  

grimage story. But the poems are not used as proof-texts. It is tempting to con clude that the narrative cloak created by Ramprasad's biographers to obscure the  meaning of the Tantric poems took on such a life of its own that later interpreters  missed the connection between story and poetry. Premik's biography contains no  reference at all to pilgrimage, internal or external, though he too composed poems  on the subject of the Tribeni bath. As poets become less famed and the knowledge  of Tantra less widespread, stories necessary to "translate" Tantric allusions for a  devotional audience decrease in frequency.  

The lotus that receives the most attention is the sahasrara, where the kundalini  meets her mate. The bliss experienced here by the aspirant is encapsulated by  two unusual images: inebriation and moonlight. In translating both through a  narrative venue, the biographic literature is once again at odds with the poetry it  is aiming to illuminate.  

All four poets compose songs on divine drunkenness. In a kundalinr yoga  context, the nectar or honey in question drips from the citrini, a narrow channel  within the susumna, the entrance to the final ascent for the kundalini at the  sahasrara. Generated by the blissful sport of Siva and Sakti in union, it is the  drink for which the aspirant thirsts (poems 8 and 9). Real drunkards are not  tantrikas, but those intoxicated by the sense objects, and the truly spiritual can  tell the difference. Ramprasad hints, however, that his erratic behavior may be  more than just a spiritual trope; in defending his right to be "unrespectable," since  the Goddess cares for the insane, he may also be justifying the use of wine in a  religious context (poem 8).  

Indeed, it is possible that these poems contain veiled clues to the first M.  Ramprasad and Kamalakanta not only devote songs to the subject of inebriation  but also inspire their biographers to frame stories to justify their unconventional  behavior. Both are accused of wine drinking by respected men - sometimes de 

picted as Vaisnavas. Ramprasad defends himself by singing about divine nectar.  Although the poem does not make explicit mention of the juice dripping from  the sahasrara, it is clear from other poems in the corpus that this is his intention.  No commentator or biographer ever warns the reader that this is what is being  referred to, and prefers instead to let the poem be read as a devotional reference  to the nectar of Kali's name. Kamalakanta too is defamed as a drunkard, but  instead of singing a song in his defense, he takes the jug of wine he has been  caught with and turns it into milk. Although there are songs in his repertoire that  demonstrate his familiarity with the "wine" dripping down from the thousand petaled lotus in the head, none is ever attached to this story. The masks created  for Ramprasad's Tantric poems have once again, with Kamalakanta's life story,  gained their independence. No biographer tells the reader that the poets may be  defending the actual use of wine in a Tantric ritual, or that they are definitely  promoting the idea of drinking divine ambrosia in the sahasrara.  

A third example of the disjunction between poetry and legend also concerns  the sahasrara: the rising of the full moon. In kundalini yoga, the difference be tween the darkness of ignorance, as experienced in the muladhara, and the light 

172 RACHE L FELL MCDERMOT T  

of consciousness, as realized in the sahasrara, is explained by comparing the new  moon, where all is dark, to the full moon, where light brightens everything. Thus  when the poets exclaim that they have arrived in a city where the moon always  shines, dripping nectar; where there is neither night nor sleep; and where op 

posites cease, they are referring to the topmost cakra (poem 10). Ramprasad and  Kamalakanta's biographers either did not know this or tried to conceal it in a  common story. Both poets are challenged by irreverent contemporaries as to what  day of the lunar cycle it is. When they reply, "the full moon," they are ridiculed  for their ignorance; it is, they are told sneeringly, the new moon. No matter. That  night both perform a miracle of self-justification and cause the full moon to rise,  out of season. Poets like Premik and Dinram who are familiar with this Tantric  moon imagery continue to use it in their compositions, though Premik's biogra phers feel no need to explain it away by recourse to his planetary prowess.  

The Sakta poets also use kundalini yoga imagery to exhort spiritual awakening  through homey metaphors. The poet is a snake charmer learning his duties (poem  11). His body is a boat, where the kundalini is the mast (poem 12), or a house  where the sleepy mistress lies around with her man (poem 13). Alternatively, the  kundalini is homologized to elements of popular festivals. For instance, Dol, the  Vaisnava fair in which Krsna and Radha are rocked back and forth on a swing  and showered with red powder by their devotees, is used to describe the motion  of Kali seated on the platform of the heart lotus, held by the ropes of the three  subtle channels (poem 14).  

In sum, Bengali Sakta poets are selective in their appropriation of Tantric  themes. Meditation is central; human teachers, external rituals, the five Ms, yogic  powers - almost none of these make their way into the poetry genre. It is the  biographers who are far more intent on the poets' supernatural powers: their  abilities to command rivers, change the properties of liquids, and control planets.  The fact that the events in these stories bear such a striking resemblance to kun 

dalini yoga imagery leads one to conclude that the poems came first, and were  transformed by the contexts into which they were placed. Did the biographers do  this purposely or not? We may never learn. One indication, however, that the  earliest writers may have known what they were doing is a comment by ISvar 

candra Gupta, Ramprasad's first biographer in 1853. After quoting one of Ram prasad's most explicit poems about the raising of the kundalini, Gupta says; "A  sincere tantrika, with a deep feeling for spiritual matters, will appreciate these  immortal songs; no one else will be able to do so. This subject is extremely  difficult. There are only one or two great souls left who can grasp the significance  and concealed meanings of certain of Ramprasad's poems, in order to explain  them; nowadays almost all such people have disappeared" (Isvar Gupter Racand bali 2:23).  

Whatever the intention of our poets and their interpreters, three things are  certain today. First, poets writing in the genre continue to draw upon Tantric  metaphors and language. Second, the average person continues not to understand  such poetry, and even if the modern biographers do, they tend not to explicate 

RAISIN G SNAKE S I N BENGA L 17 3  

it. Sakta anthologies routinely omit poems on kundalini yoga, and recording stu dio employees freely admit that Syama Sahgit does not sell as well as Vaisnava  songs - both because the imagery is so abstruse and because the vision of Kali or  the kundalini copulating with Siva does not fit with the majority view of the  Goddess as Mother, or Ma. Third, although one does not know whether the  evidence preserved in the Sakta songs represents the whole of the poets' Tantric  activities - one suspects not - one can understand the reticence an adept might  feel in revealing everything in his poetry. Besides, although the literal use of ritual  substances like wine, meat, and sex might awe the outsider, Bengali or Western,  the tradition itself devalues it. Meditation takes precedence because Bengali Tantra  places the "divine path," the path of mental worship, highest in the spiritual  hierarchy. Sanskrit Tantras describe a range of Tantric injunctions. Bengali poets  leave records that - although in an upside-down language - do not ultimately  compromise their respectability.  

The poetry translated below is taken from four anthologies, referenced in abbre viated forms: Kamalakanta Bhattacarya, Syama Sangit, collected by Nabincandra  Bandyopadhyay and Bripradas Tarkabagish Bhattacarya (Calcutta: Barddhaman  Maharajadhiraj Mahtabcand Bahadur, 1857), hereafter SS; Mahendranath Bhat tacarya, Andul Kalikirtan o Baul Gitdbali, 7th ed.

### 10 The Wedding of Siva and the Goddess
The Wedding of Siva and the Goddess  

in the Kulalikamnaya  

Teun Goudriaan  

In our endeavor to understand the Hindu scriptural tradition in its astounding  variety, we have to set up a number of distinctions as guidelines for our analysis.  But such distinctions should not be understood as so many watertight compart ments, because these hardly ever exist in Hindu religiosity. Two instances of such  analytical preliminaries are the distinction between "ideology" and "practice" in  the Tantric traditions, and that between "Tantric" and "Puranic" religiosities or  literary traditions. The translated Sanskrit text presented below, Kulalikamnaya  3.1-39 (this is the main version of the Kubjikamata Tantra [KMT]), provides.a  good illustration of their relative validity. It contains a version, admittedly unique,  of one of the best-known myths of the Epic-Puranic religious tradition; and it  firmly connects mythological timelessness with the psychosomatic realization of  spiritual truth and power which is the goal of Devi's rebirths  

We translate Devi by "the Goddess"; the title Devi is very frequent in the Tantras  as a name and a means of address. At first sight, the heading "Devi's rebirths"  seems paradoxical, because the gods cannot die, and especially Devi, being the  tangible manifestation of eternal Power, cannot be held to undergo death or re 

birth. But in mythology this theological truth is not always respected. On the  contrary, there are several mythological (and ritual) references to death and re generation of divine beings (see, among others, Marglin and Mishra 1991). With out a doubt, the most important tradition about the succession of Devi's earthly  existences is the mythological cluster around her death as Sati and successive  rebirth as Parvati. The religious historian might be tempted to explain the paradox  as follows: Devi's different existences are systematizations of different, even con tradictory revelations about manifestations of Power within the realm of time. But  the same could be maintained about Siva or his manifestations, which are nev ertheless only seldom said to undergo rebirth. It would seem therefore that "re birth" is a typical prerogative of the feminine manifestation of the godhead - at 

WEDDIN G O F SIVA AN D THE GODDES S 185  

least in the mythological sphere, where it probably reflects the observation of the  recurrence of death and rebirth in the natural world. This state of affairs implies  that the union of God and Goddess, absolutely necessary for the continuance and  renewal of the world process, is periodically repeated - or rather, reenacted,  actualized.  

Sati and Parvati  

The Puranic authorities generally agree that in her last but one temporal existence,  Devi appeared as Sati, "the Faithful [wife]." She was born as one of the many  daughters of a primeval father named Daksa. All these women, like Sati, bear  allegorical names such as Sraddha (Confidence) or Khyati (Fame). We momen 

tarily follow the authority of the Visnu Purana (1.7), where we are told, quite  significantly, that Sati did not belong to the oldest group of thirteen who were  married off to the god Dharma; nor to a second group of eight who were destined  to become the wives of Brahma's sons. In fact, the name of Sati (and, by the way,  those of Svaha and Svadha) was undoubtedly appended to those of the original  group at a later time. The mythic compilers may have felt that the ideal of the  "faithful wife" was too important to be left out of this collection of allegories. Be  that as it may, Sati was joined in wedlock to Rudra-Siva. When her father on a  certain occasion organized a magnificent sacrificial ceremony but forgot to invite  her husband, she could not brook the insult. In a terrible rage she killed herself  by means of a yogic procedure, as related in Kalidasa's famous court epic, the  Kumarasambhava (1.21). The Kulalikdmnaya author does not refer to this prelude;  however, because of its extreme popularity, he cannot have been unacquainted  with it.  

The Puranas tell us how Siva, inconsolable over the death of his wife, began to  lead the life of a naked ascetic. In the meantime, Devi decided upon a new in carnation as the daughter of the divine mountain Himavant (the Himalaya) and  the fairy Mena or Menaka (Linga Purana 1.101.24ff.). Of special interest in con nection with the fragment translated below is the version recorded in the Parva tikhanda of the Siva Purana (2.3.1-20).  

Although the Goddess as Daughter of the Mountain is generally known as  Parvati, she is occasionally given other names. Kalidasa (Kumarasambhava 1.26)  informs us that Parvati was the patronym by which she was known to her relatives,  but that her mother Mena introduced another name, Uma, when she tried to  dissuade her daughter from asceticism: through a strained etymology, Uma is  explained to mean u ma, "Oh, don't (do it)." According to the Lihga Purana  (1.101.24f) however, the name Uma was already known to Brahma before Par 

vati's birth. In the literature, Uma Haimavati is mentioned much earlier, in an  early Upanisad (Kena Upanisad 3.12). According to the Ramdyana (1.35.17), Uma  was the usual name of Himavant's daughter. But these sources are silent about  another famous name of Devi, that of Kali or Kalika. In the Siva Purana, this name 

186 TEU N GOUDRIAA N  

appears in the present myth in a dual context. First, the Goddess is invoked as  Kalika by Mena, her future mother, who implores her to take birth as her daugh ter. Second, when this has been granted and the daughter has been born, she is  given the name Kali, along with other designations, by her father Himavant. Also  here, the variant Kalika (Blackie) occurs.The same name is prominent in the  Kulalikamnaya, especially in its first chapter, which deals with her premarital  encounters with Siva. Kramrisch (1981) records a remarkable explanation for the  girl's dark complexion from the Matsya Purana, which is generally recognized as  a relatively early Purana: Brahma purportedly ordered his eldest daughter Ratri  (Night) to enter the body of the pregnant Mena and provide the embryo with a  black color. However that may be, it is clear enough that it would be wrong to  associate the name Kali solely with the well-known fearsome apparition who,  bedecked with skulls and other gruesome ornaments, dances upon Siva's corpse.  

How Siva Becomes Her Husband  

When their splendid daughter approaches marriageable age, her parents consult  the sage Narada about the girl's future (here we continue to follow the Siva Purana  version). The sage notices an inauspicious line in her hand and concludes that  her future husband will be a naked yogin of shabby dress and devoid of family  relations. The parents are shocked at first, but Kalika is happy, because from this  description she recognizes her eternal husband Siva. She is more determined than  ever to win him back. This purpose coincides with the gods' project of causing  Siva to procreate a son. Only such a son, they know, will be able to destroy a  most dangerous demon who is about to conquer the threefold world. The demon's  name is usually given as Taraka. The Siva Purana (2.3.10) also records the origin  of another enemy of the gods, Bhauma, "Son of the Earth" - a reference to his  birth from a drop of sweat that fell from Siva upon the ground. In his battle  against the gods, Taraka is assisted by his general Kraunca (Siva Purana 2.3.16.14).  In the version found in the Kulalikamnaya (3.3), Kraunca himself is the world conquering demon; typical of this Tantra's different outlook is the fact that  Kraunca is here said to have been born from the Goddess' (and not from Siva's)  perspiration. This must have happened when she roamed the earth as a virgin in  order to install sacred centres of Tantric worship (as described in chapter 2 of the  text, see also below).  

In the meantime (we return to the standard Siva Purana version) Siva, still  overcome with grief and disgusted with the outside world, chooses to continue  his asceticism in the region of the Himalayas. Himavant goes out to welcome him  courteously; Siva accepts his greeting but expresses his desire not to be disturbed  in future. Nevertheless, Himavant (having noted Siva's poor condition) soon re 

turns with his daughter, whom he presents (with her full assent) as a housemaid.  Siva opens his eyes for a moment but closes them again immediately when he 

WEDDIN G O F SIVA AN D THE GODDES S 187  

sees her dazzling beauty. Slightly irritated, he requests Himavant to leave his  daughter at home on future occasions. But this is unacceptable to Kali, who  addresses Siva with philosophical argumentation, proving that he as the cosmic  Self cannot do without her as Sakti, eternal Power (Siva Purana 2.3.13.1-22).  Siva cannot refute her demonstration and has to acquiesce in her daily service.  All this is told with a Puranic prolixity that tends to obscure the dynamism of the  story. The Tantric version, as we shall see, is quite different.  

The course of events now moves more rapidly. The gods, realizing that the  time is ripe, send Kama (Love), assisted by his friend Vasanta (Spring) and his  wife Rati (Passion) - in verse 19 of the Kubjikamata Tantra version, a second wife,  named Priti (Charity) is mentioned - to Siva with the command to shoot him  with his flowery arrows. He manages to release but a single arrow: Siva feels its  impact and because he happens to have Parvati in full view, he is seriously assailed  by erotic passions. But he regains his self-control, and with a fiery glare from his  third eye opened ever so slightly, reduces Kama to ashes (this god too can die!).  The episode is one of the most widely known of Hindu mythology.  

The concerted attack on Siva's chastity having failed, Kali, in tears, returns  home. But she soon finds herself again, and decides upon a course of the most  terrible asceticism, the likes of which has never been experienced on earth (Siva  Purana 2.3.22.61ff.). All the world's creatures begin to feel its impact. Even cats  and mice live in temporary friendship. The gods, alarmed and once again fearing  destruction, approach Siva under Visnu's leadership to request humbly that he  marry Parvati. After some hesitation, the god, moved by their devotion, agrees.  The world is again saved, and everyone joyfully takes part in the marriage cere mony, in which the most important gods act as officiants. As a matter of course,  the rites are conducted according to the Vedic prescriptions. Visnu (and not the  bride's father, Himavant) takes it upon himself to give away the bride (Linga  Purana 1.103.45f.), and Brahma acts as the invoking priest (hotar). Contrary to  what one might perhaps expect in a Tantra, the Kulalikamnaya (3.25f.) has pre 

served these time-honored ritual details. In verse 25, Siva even complains (with  a show of self-pity) that he cannot marry because the requisite participants are  missing from the ceremony; but the gods provide a solution to this problem.  

At the end of this rapid survey, we cannot but note the paradox offered by the  myth in its different stages: is Siva won over by Kama's feat of archery, by Parvati's  asceticism, or by the gods' devotion? In the Kulalikamnaya version, the problem  is less prominent, although present between the lines. Here (KMT 3.18), it appears  that Kama is burnt only after Siva is already in Parvati's arms, when he, however  love-stricken he may be, catches sight of his attacker from a corner of his eye (a  masterly detail). But the god's passion is strong and the marriage seems unavoid 

able. On Devi's asceticism, the text remains almost silent, except for two brief  allusions (KMT 3.12 and 24). But then, the gods' devotion is again described  (KMT 3.21ff.) as the decisive factor by which the god's self-centered hesitancy is  finally put aside. 

188 TEUN GOUDRIAAN  

The Kulalikamnaya and Kubjika  

In the Kuldlikamnaya, the myth of the marriage of Siva and Parvati is retold and  adapted as a divine context for its description of meditation and yoga. In this  way, the text firmly proves its attachment to the classical Hindu religious tradition.  At the same time, it recognizes Siva as the Lord of Kula (KMT 3.31), that is, of  the "family" or "community" of those who follow the esoteric path and whose  aim is final release through realization of the identity of their own self, the guru,  Siva, and Sakti. But its most remarkable feature is its introduction of an original  conception of the Goddess characterized as Kubjika (the Hunchbacked).  

This cult of Kubjika (also called Kuja, in KMT 3.22; or Kubji, in KMT 3.31)  must be an old subtradition from within the Kula, one that seems to have been  limited to certain communities of Siddhas and yogins in northern India. Due to  historical and climatological circumstances, the manuscripts of its Tantras and  ritual guides have been recovered almost exclusively from Nepal. In this still  imperfectly known literary heritage, we find several explanations of the Goddess's  surprising deformity. The most probable view is that "hunchbacked" is an oblique  reference to the coiled form (elsewhere compared to a sleeping serpent) in which  she remains hidden in the lowest power center of the human body (the mula dhara; in the Kubjikamata Tantra, perhaps the second center, the svadhisthana).  It may also be a reference to her crooked, serpentine upward course within the  body of the meditating yogin. An attractive mythological explanation is offered  in a secondary text of the school, the unedited Kularatnoddyota (1.75-76): the  Goddess is so named because she huddled herself together out of shame when  Siva declared his love to her. This "down-faced" position might very well refer to  the "sleeping" position of the kundalini serpent mentioned above. Curiously  enough, the Goddess after her wedding is still suffering of her deformity and  professes to be ignorant of its origin (KMT 3.32). To the best of our knowledge,  the Puranic traditions (with the exception of a late and secondary passage in the  Agni Purana) know nothing of this theme.  

In any case, the Kubjikamata Tantra makes clear that the premarital phase in  the relationship of Siva-Bhairava and the Goddess Kubjika has not been without  obstacles. On the contrary, a serious altercation between the predestined lovers  has taken place, as described in the text's first two chapters. The bone of conten 

tion seems to have been the possession of the authorization to teach (ajna) and  the right to transmit teachings. The Goddess has even gone so far as to show  herself in a fear-inspiring form (KMT 2.4f.), which later becomes one of her  worshiped manifestations. While still a virgin - and therefore independent and  awesome - she had taken a trip around the world (in practice, India) to establish  sacred places devoted to her worship and populated by her manifestations. In the  view of this Tantra, it is only after this task has been fulfilled that she is ready for  her marriage with the god.  

When the newlyweds are happily sitting together on Mount Kailasa, the timeWEDDING OF SIVA AND THE GODDESS 189  

is ripe for Devi to question Siva on those matters that are of crucial importance  to the earthly practitioners of the Tantric path - in short, the further contents of  the Kulalikamnaya. In this way, our text conforms to the general pattern of Tantric  contextual anchoring. It must of course be realized that Devi poses her questions  merely out of compassion for these devotees, being herself the source and final  goal of all teaching. By her pretended ignorance, she even leaves herself open to  her husband's ironical remarks (such as in KMT 3.33).  

The first subject explained is the selection and excellence of the right guru  (KMT 3.38f.). Thereafter, the text proceeds with the exposition of mantras and  mudras (gestures) in chapters four through six, followed by a discussion of Kub 

jika's root mantra: the thirty-two-syllabled samayavidya (vidya being the type of  mantra directed to, and identified with, goddesses). In chapters 11-22, the bulk  of the Kubjikamata Tantra, Kubjika's aniconic manifestations (mainly phonic and  geometrical), as well as the yogic and meditative methods to realize these, are  described. The final three chapters contain additional matter of importance to the  Siddha's or yogin's way of life.  

In this way, all the practical teachings of Tantric ritual and yoga are embedded  in the context of the creative union of Siva and Sakti or Devi. But this erotic frame  does not refer to the sexual ritualism that the West has often considered, quite  unappropriately, to be the main feature of Tantra. There are no clear allusions to  such rituals in the Kulalikamnaya.  

A remark on the literary character of the Kubjikamata Tantra: most of the text  is in the Sloka meter. This is also the case in the translated fragment, except for  stanzas 17, 18, and 31 (which are in varieties of tristubh meter); and 19 (in arya  meter). The Kubjikamata Tantra's manner of presentation is often unsystematic,  incomplete, and at times even mystifying. The fragment translated below is no  exception. The descriptions of events, and especially the dialogues and other  fragments of direct speech, are allusive and evocative rather than factual. It is  therefore possible that the translation contains a few misunderstandings of a  speaker's intentions (for example, in verses 9 and 10). Moreover, the manuscripts  show up a great number of variants.  

The present translation of the Kulalikamnaya 3.1-39 is based upon the text pub lished in Goudriaan and Schoterman (1988). While translating, I have tried to  remain faithful to the idiosyncracies of the Sanskrit, undoubtedly at the cost of  the fluency of the English.

details of this difficult text are as yet imperfectly understood. A survey of the  Tantra's contents may be found in pages 110-30 of the introduction.  A general study of the Kubjika cult and its Tantric literature (which was written,  as far as we know, entirely in Sanskrit) does not yet exist. The reader may turn  to Jan A. Schoterman's pioneering study, The Satsahasrasamhita, Chapters 1-5  (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1982), pp. 3-16; or to Dory Heilijgers-Seelen's carefully  worded introduction to her The System of Five Cakras in Kubjikamatatantra 14-16  (Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 1994), pp. 1-12. The chapter entitled "The Panca cakra" in the same book (pp. 16-38), although difficult, is worth the trouble as  an introduction to the school's intricate microcosmic symbolism. Mark Dy czkowski's The Canon of the Saivagama and the Kubjika Tantras of the Western Kaula  Tradition (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1988), is of only partial  relevance. A still useful general treatment of Hindu Tantric doctines and practices  is Sanjukta Gupta, Dirk Jan Hoens, and Teun Goudriaan, Hindu Tantrism (Leiden:  Brill, 1979). For the Puranic accounts of Siva's and Devi's wedding and their  earlier relations, see Stella Kramrisch, The Presence of Siva (Princeton: Princeton  University Press, 1981), pp. 301-83 ("The family of Siva"), especially pp. 340- 83 ("The Lineage of Parvata, the Mountain"); the rich material is, however, poorly  organized. A selective reading of Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty's Siva, the Erotic As cetic (New York: Oxford University Press, 1973, 1981) provides an idea of Siva's  difficult character. A compendium of Puranic literature in general is Ludo Rocher,  The Puranas (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1986). Orthodox Hindu marriage ritual  is treated, rather technically, by Raj Bali Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 2nd ed. (Delhi:  Motilal Banarsidass, 1969), p. 153-233. An attractive (although somewhat re mote) article on the death and regeneration theme is Frederique Apffel Marglin  and Purna Chandra Mishra, "Death and Regeneration: Brahmin and non-Brahmin  narratives," in Diana L. Eck and Francoise Mallison, eds., Devotion Divine: Bhakti  Traditions from the Regions of India (Groningen: Egbert Forsten, and Paris: Ecole  Frangaise d'Extreme-Orient, 1991), pp. 209-30. The article is also useful as an  indication of the relationship between mythology and ritual, as well as of the  social background of different types of oral and written textual transmission.  

The Wedding of Siva and the Mountain's Daughter  

The Venerable Goddess said:  

1. Relate to Me, O Bhairava: how was the marriage realized  of You with Me; what was its cause,  

and what its object held in view?  

The Venerable Bhairava said:  

2. You, O fair Lady, [having roamed  

the earth, enjoying maidenhood],  

had reached again Your father's home; 

WEDDING OF SIVA AND THE GODDESS 191  

but as to Me: I was approached  

with respect by the throng of gods  

whose aim was to have Kraunca killed.  

3. And how that demon had been born,  

that I will tell You faithfully:  

from You, while traveling with haste,  

a drop of sweat fell down on earth.  

4. From that, a demon was born  

whose name was Kraunca; glorifying in strength.  

By him, the host of gods in seven worlds  

5. was put to flight: he was so mighty.  

They, then, retired to Brahma's place.  

But Brahma, at their head, went on  

to seek refuge at Visnu's side.  

6. He then conferred with Visnu thus:  

"What can we do, being put to flight  

by Kraunca, that powerful antigod;  

please, Lord, point out [to us] a way  

7. by which to crush him, Lord of the Bird!  

Because of this, I sought Your presence."  

But Hari spoke in answer thus:  

"No being is able to take his life  

8. if not Siva's and Devi's son.  

And why? He [Kraunca,] too sprang from that source."  

Considering this, the Grandfather Divine,  

[Brahma,] spoke thus: "[Siva,] that mighty Lord - 

9. Where does He live now [as an ascetic], far away  

from the Goddess's presence?" And he produced  

a laugh: "Does a protector act like this?"  

These were Grandfather's very words.  

10. [And he continued, warning them:]  

"Is He not full of power? his fire  

might rise; scorched by that burning wrath  

nobody who came with a request can live.  

11. You, dwellers in heaven, will be lost,  

laid low because of some presumptuous act!"  

Thus they were brought to realize  

by Visnu['s message,] intimated by Brahma. 

192 TEUN GOUDRIAAN  

12. But then, they spoke again and said:  

"A means should be devised right now!  

The Daughter of Mount Himavant  

sits there alone in concentration.  

13. The Lord's feet are her sole delight;  

the Lord Himself is not so far away."  

After these words, the famous pair  

of youths, called Spring and blameless Love,  

14. were summoned by the gods, and charged  

to charm the minds of God and Goddess both;  

and thus they did, after preparing flowers  

and sprouts, in short: all [Nature's gifts].  

15. Resounding with sweet melodies of cuckoos,  

teeming with swarms of bees restlessly humming;  

[Brahma] duly observed Spring thus appearing,  

and, with a voice steadied by his contentment,  

16. at that great moment he proclaimed this [message]:  

"the god of Love now hits the Fearsome One!"  

17. And He, staring with eyes filled to the brim  

by bliss, as He surrendered to his passion;  

fixing a steady gaze upon that maiden  

[and grasping her body,] He put her on his thigh;  

while She [also] was full of longing, as her hands  

were clasped around his neck. But even so,  

in tight embrace, He cast a glance aside, and saw.  

18. His mind aroused to shame, clouded by wrath  

- that cosmic fire, destructive of the threefold world - 

He wrapped [Love's] body in a flame. That god fell down,  dispatched within a moment by the Lover's lethal gaze.  

19. When Love was burnt, the source of their delight,  

his spouses, Charity and Passion, were reduced  

to wailing long and loud, and hard to bear!  

He saw them crying and [spoke]: "Forever gone  

is now your common spouse, henceforth  

the Bodiless; you both, please weep no more !"  

20. The three-eyed God thus meted out  

the punishment to Kama. Punishment or grace,  

Bhairava's wish becomes a fact. 

WEDDIN G O F SIVA AND THE GODDES S 193  

21. But then, when things had reached this stage,  

the throngs of gods together came;  

the sages, demigods, and perfect beings  

also arrived; Brahma and Visnu were presiding.  

22. These two, Hari and Brahma, praised aloud  

with divine songs and lauds, the Lord of Kuja;  

having thus satisfied Him, they spoke these words:  

"Oh God, we have a pressing need forward to bring:  

23. We lost [the blessing presence] of Your feet;  

we gods, Oh God, have fallen on evil days:  

pressed down are we by that impetuous being  

of violent nature, Kraunca; Oh supreme Lord!  

24. Protector, be benevolent to us, and by compassion - 

we mean to say, grant us security . . .  

Be kind, Protector, take the Goddess as Your wife,  

her state is pitiful, She mortifies herself."  

The Fearful One spoke:  

25. "Where is She now, whose daughter is She,  

who is her mother, who her [father and] father's father;  

who will give her to Me, to whom  

should I apply the wooing for her hand,  

what can I do, a lonesome being without relations ?"  

26. But Brahma answered Him: "I am the one  

to whom You can apply; I shall [on Your behalf]  

ask for her hand; the sacrificer is [her father]  

the Himavant; [Visnu] the Ruler is the acting priest."  

27. After these words, the Elder god  

ordered Vasistha, being the chief  

of sages: "quickly organize  

the marriage celebration rites!"  

28. The [sages] took their leave; they bore the order  

faithfully on their heads. A festive scene  

of wedding was prepared in costly style:  

29. most glamorous, with excellent forebodings,  

joyful and merry. From that time, every wish  

of these [participants] was realized completely.  

30. Now that the Fearsome's passion was aroused,  

the Cosmic Womb became the ever fertile source; 

194 TEUN GOUDRIAAN  

with the creation of a threefold world in view  

the God was then engaged in sexuality.  

31. While He was lost in all too greedy passion  

by fanciful varieties of love play, *  

intent upon the ritual production  

of what the Kula knows as "fluid of immortality,"  

that Lord of Kula, much attached to Kubja,  

was humbly questioned by his Lady, as follows:  

32. "By the love You made to Me, My body melted down;  but, Fearful Lord, my burden is heavy:  

this hunchbacked form of Mine."  

The Fearsome One spoke:  

33. "Goddess, expert in love play,  

fulfiller of many desires:  

today, You satisfied Me.  

Dear Lady, ask whatever You like,  

ask, even what may be hard to get."  

Verses 34-37 are omitted.  

The Venerable Kubjika spoke:  

38. "Be so kind as to explain to me, what is proper behavior; a Guru, how  [should he be, because] the realization of all [spiritual] aims is dependent upon  him alone.  

39. "[Such realization] comes to pass by his mantras and ritual instruction, by  his yoga; [in short,] his traditional authority. Dear Lord, please relate this all  in a relaxed manner, but [if possible] within one session." 

### 11 An Advertised Secret: The Goddess Taleju  and the King of Kathmandu  

Bronwen Bledsoe  

The text presented here is an inscription from Nepal, a praise-poem named Sar vaparadhastotra, which King Pratap Malla had hammered into the golden doors  of the temple of the Tantric goddess Taleju in the middle of the seventeenth  century. A public and literary text, the Sarvaparadhastotra offers a concise - if  difficult - instance of Tantra's deployment in one historically specific social  world.  

Mise-en-scene  

In late medieval Nepal, the temple of the goddess Taleju commanded the skyline  of the city-kingdom of Kathmandu, while her principal servants - rulers of a  dynasty named Malla - commanded the world of the Newar people. No structure  in the realm could be build higher than the goddess's imposing temple in the  royal palace at the heart of the mandala-patterned city-kingdom. The Tantric  goddess Taleju was literally and conceptually the most exalted being of the realm.  No one could miss the fact of the goddess's existence or her power, yet access to  her sanctuary was jealously restricted. Full initiation into the method of her wor ship amounted to consecration into kingship itself in the late Malla period (ca.  1600-1768 C.E.).  

And just who might this goddess named Taleju be? There is still no definitive  answer to this question, at least none openly spoken. The name may be derived  from the Newari tale, meaning high or upper, and the honoric suffix ju; thus, "the  deity of the high temple." Or, it may be a transformation of Tulaja, patron deity  of the great Maratha king Sivaji (1630?-1680). In this poem the king addresses  her as Kali, a fierce Saiva goddess with both exoteric and esoteric forms aplenty;  he also calls her Kalika, "little Kali." Both the latter name and certain details of  the poem suggest the authority of the Kalika Purana of Assam. Elsewhere King 

196 BRONWE N BLEDSO E  

Pratap addresses the goddess as Candika, Ambika, Uma, Durga, and Bhavani. No  doubt we are to understand that she is any and all of the Saiva goddess's many  forms. Informed scholarly speculation opines that her true esoteric identity is  Siddhilaksmi, high deity of the Northern Transmission of Kaula Tantra, but Taleju  is not called by that name in public. Just who she is for practical purposes emerges  from her supremacy in the kingdom, and her mastery over the king.  

Pratap Malla (reigned 1641-1674) was perhaps the most flamboyant king ever  to rule in Nepal. Local chronicles and oral tradition remember him as a great  tantrika, a pupil of several famous gurus, and a protagonist of Tantric duels and  deeds of daring. Pratap was a great self-publicist, particularly fond of elaborate  Sanskrit inscriptions, where he where he invariably signed himself "kavindra", or  poet-king. Pratap's favorite topic of conversation was the divine company he kept,  and his favorite conversation partner was the goddess he addresses in this poem.  

Politics and Tantra  

Kings had powers, responsibilities, problems, and potentialities that set them  apart from other mortals. With our modern presupposition of a clear division  between the domains of religion and politics, it might be thought that the proper  concern of kings would be the exercise of power in statecraft, in the sense of  administration and warfare. The historical record is, however, scanty on such  mundane matters. What texts of all types do choose to speak of is the continuing  quest of mortals to integrate their lived world with the worlds of the divine.  Nowhere was this quest of more consequence for society as a whole than in the  case of kings, for their extant words and works all indicate an overriding concern  with what might be called "cosmopolitical order." By this term I mean a social  and/or political order whose constituency was not confined to mortals but was  actively extended at every turn to include divine as well as human beings in a  single conceptual and practical frame.  

Constructing an inclusive cosmopolitical order around a Tantric deity involved  one major problem. Tantric knowledge and practices are by definition secret,  whereas political life must be public. How could Tantra be deployed for public  purposes without compromising its essential secrecy?  

In general, the Mallas negotiated this problem by recourse to what Robert Levy  has called "advertised secrets." This useful oxymoron breaks down as advertising,  calling attention to the existence and importance of private deities, plus secrecy,  maintaining resolute silence on particularities of content. Taleju's conspicuous yet  inaccessible temple is a prime example of the advertised secret rendered in ar 

chitectural terms. Royalty were not the only agents of the period to make use of  the advertised secret: Newar Buddhists and some brahman lineages had also taken  one or another variety of Tantric knowledge as the highest and most efficacious  form of truth. Their deities too were announced and concealed in special archi 

tectural structures; their initiations too authorized roles of privilege in society.  Kings had the responsibility to maintain continuities between sociopolitical 

AN ADVERTISED SECRET 197  

order on earth and an encompassing universe of divine powers. That is, they were  concerned with the lives of the gods, and with the lives of mortals defined as  servants of the gods. In the Kathmandu Valley, temples by the hundreds and  thousands were the principal sites for the articulation of cosmopolitical order, for  service to deities new and old generated complex networks of obligation and  privilege among mortals of all classes. Inscriptions on these temples constituted  a public and permanent discourse on relations of cosmic and mortal power. It is  probably true that only a small proportion of the king's subjects could read the  letters placed on display in inscriptions, and even fewer would have been able to  penetrate the stylized Sanskrit verse. But we should not doubt that most people  would have had a substantial understanding of what was being said. The king  was the foremost servant of the goddess; thus he was foremost among mortals;  therefore he should be served by all other mortals. This was the logic in force.  

The poet-king Pratap did not put the matter so bluntly. Inscriptions were tra ditionally a medium for display of Sanskrit literary virtuosity, and more than any  Nepali king, Pratap turned the subtleties and sophistication of Sanskrit poetic  convention to the articulation of power. His problem with respect to the Tantric  goddess was to speak of her without compromising the esoteric heart of the rela tionship. His solution, I suggest, was to preserve the intimacy of the king/goddess  dyad by overlaying its esoteric heart with a reformulation centered on exoteric  devotion. Within the frame of exoteric devotion, Pratap constructed his own  kingly persona by juxtaposing the special forms of knowledge of which he was  master with a posture of extravagant humility. Among these special forms of  knowledge was his understanding of the goddess's role in the realm as a whole:  she commanded not only him, but his city-kingdom, and ultimately the universe.  As an open and public production, the inscription is amenable to an exoteric  surface reading. But the poem's very construction - through display and con cealment, contrast and camouflage - invites penetration beyond its facade.  

Explicit Arguments and Counterevidence  

The overt message of Pratap's Sarvaparadhastotra, or "Hymn for the Forgiveness  of All Faults," is resolutely exoteric. It is quite possible to read past its esoteric  component with barely a pause. In mood, the poem is confessional rather than  perfection-seeking; goddess and practitioner relate as mother and child, without  hint of erotic charge. Its literary category is stotra, "praise," "eulogy," or "hymn."  Its genre in the conventional division of Indic religious modes is that of bhakti,  "devotion" or "participation." What the poet craves is an intimacy with the god dess that is profound but in no way secret. The poem's overall thrust and over 

riding tone are encoded in an insistent refrain, "O Mother, let my faults be for given! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious."  

The poem's explicit argument centers on the king's abject failure to accomplish  what he should have accomplished, namely, service to the deity - service in the  form of worship and knowledge, or at least exquisite eulogy. The obstacles to her 

198 BRONWE N BLEDSO E  

service, his lapses, and his inadequacies are inventoried and examined one after  another. The impossibility of achieving her grace through individual effort is  argued in the first half of the poem, which presents obstacles and inadequacies  by category. It opens with four strong verses on the impediments entailed in the  various stages of life: infancy, childhood, youth, and old age each constrains mind  and body in some way to prevent her worship. Then the king speaks of the failures  of paths (margas) and performative practices (vidhis). Orthodoxies include re 

vealed and "remembered" brahmanical wisdom, esoteric knowledge and practice,  simple acts of devotion performed by bodily and mental faculties - according to  the poem, the king has succeeded in none of these.  

One important result of the inventory of failures is to focus attention on Pratap  Malla. It is the figure of the poet-king, not of the goddess, that is carefully con structed throughout the stotra. The critical point in the poem's construction of  the king is the status of the faults or failings (aparadha) around which it revolves.  The word aparadha could be taken more strongly: "offense" or "outrage" is not  going too far. In large measure, the force of the poem derives from the tension  between the king's self-deprecation and the mass of internal and external evidence  to the contrary.  

Few of the poet's statements concerning his failings can be taken at face value.  Some are indeed rooted in human inevitabilities, as with the age-determined  constraints on mind and body. Most demand active interpretation. One clear  example is the king's apology (at verse 16) that the goddess's worship had not  been performed at her temple at festival time, through his "wrong-headed neg 

ligence." This is extremely unlikely, for the Festival of the Nine Nights (navaratri)  was and remains a great state occasion, hardly subject to lapse. Elsewhere (verses  11-12) Pratap exhorts his body's limbs and senses - ears, tongue, nose, thoughts,  spirit - to partake of her, and then laments that he did not do so. Again, one  must wonder if it were possible for him not to have performed these acts. What  Pratap must mean is that he has in fact done all of these things, and yet something  eludes him. Other portions of the poem, such as the difficult quasi-esoteric verses  (6-10), are hard to understand at all without supplying this sense of oblique  dissatisfaction. (My translation does so.) "Failings" or "faults" here serve to prove  discriminating excellence, in a way that boasting could not.  

The text itself offers evidence contradicting the poet's self-deprecation. The king  calls himself feeble-minded, yet he gives voice to keen sensibilities, and in poised  and polished Sanskrit verse. Speaking to the goddess, he calls himself a child, yet  his signature epithets outside the poem proper address mortals in proud and  magisterial tone:  

Thus ends the Sarvaparadhastotra composed by him who excels in all fields of ex pertise, including war, book-learning, and music, the ruler of great rulers, the lord  of Nepal, the great scholar, the lord of the circle of all kings, the supreme king of  kings, the most worshipful poet-king, Jaya Pratapa Malla.  

With regard to the goddess, the king is all humility; with regard to men, he is  all majesty. As he serves, so should he be served.A N ADVERTISE D SECRE T 199  

The king's expertise as a master of knowledge and as a master of men comes  into active play in the latter portion of the poem, where the stock refrain gives  way to specific inflections, and the deity's merits are moved to the fore. Particu larly significant is Pratap's account of the way the goddess pervades the polity  and integrates the world of mortals. Specific margas are still said to be inadequate:  the competing doctrines of Vaisnavas, Saivas, and Buddhists - among others - all miss the mark set forth as paramount; that is, they fail to truly serve her. Yet,  argues the poem, she is integral to each approach: the brahmanical Gayatri mantra  is the goddess personified; the Vaisnava goddess Laksmi and the Buddhist Vajra varahi are none other than she; she is even the abstract principle niyati ("neces sity") of the non-theist Mimamsa school of classical philosophy. Pratap knows  that "She is the One whom all margas serve." (We should note that the followers  of these other margas may themselves have known nothing of the sort.) She is  the one who pervades the city-kingdom and renders it auspicious, a sahkari na gari. The same phrase implies that she belongs to both the cosmic order of Siva  and its citizenry on earth. Pratap's knowledge of unity in diversity is ultimately  political, for it manages both to affirm and subordinate the contending views of  ultimate truth that flourished in his realm.  

And what of the poem's overt message concerning methods of approach to the  divinity? None of his many efforts has succeeded in bringing the king to the state  he desires, which is total intimacy with the goddess. The poem of devotion ap pears to be his last hope. Can we therefore take it that bhakti-style submission  was truly Pratap's preferred mode of relation to the goddess? More broadly, is  this really evidence that in late medieval Nepal, Tantra was thought to be a less  efficacious approach than emotional bhakti?  

Bhakti and Tantra  

Precisely what the Sarvaparadhastotra has to say on Tantric topics is unfortunately  not altogether clear. Published transcriptions of the poem present variously prob lematic readings, and direct access to the lettering on the golden doors is not  readily obtained. The three verses (6-8) that pertain directly to Tantra may have  been somewhat obscure in their own time, for the poet's intent seems to have  been simultaneously to display and to camouflage an initiate's special knowledge.  In modern times, the problem of construing technical terminology in an exoteric  framework is yet more difficult. From the number of points at which the poem  touches upon esoteric topics, it is clear, however, that among the paths of ap 

proach to divinity alternative to that of bhakti or self-surrender, it is in Tantra  that success might have been expected.  

The poem's final verses offer an important closing reflection on the goddess's  grace. Because tantrikas of all six Kaula schools of transmission (sadamnaya)  achieve success (siddhi) at her pleasure, so does Pratap hope that she will be  pleased with his poem of praise, and thus forgive every conceivable sin. The  juxtaposition of esoteric and devotional approaches makes the important sugges-

200 BRONWEN BLEDSOE  

tion that poetry is the sadhana (perfection-oriented practice) of the king - the  king as devotee, that is.  

The discussion in this paper has followed discursive convention in treating  bhakti as an approach to divinity distinct from other Indicforms of religious  practice. The bhakti mode is usually glossed as devotionalism, emotional in na ture, with humility and self-surrender as key stances. As such, bhakti is distin guished from Tantra's esotericism on the one hand, and the ritualism of profes sional liturgies on the other. More technically, the term bhakti - a derivative of  the verbal root bhaj, "share" or "participate" - refers to the project of mortal par ticipation in the very being of the deity concerned. In this sense bhakti may be  an important component of both Tantra and professional liturgies. The Sarva parddhastotra is, however, centered on emotion and devotion.  

Two other important contrasts between bhakti and Tantra are pertinent to the  question of what texts such as the Sarvaparadhastotra meant in late medieval  Nepal. The first is bhakti's amenability to aestheticization in self-consciously lit erary endeavors: Tantric texts typically have a different thrust and texture entirely.  Similarly, the sorts of intimacy that Tantra and bhakti respectively seek to establish  between worshiper and deity pertain to entirely different domains. Devotional  bhakti is appropriate to exterior and public contexts; esoteric Tantra is predicated  on privacy and concealment.  

My suggestion is that in the Sarvaparadhastotra - and throughout his inscrip tional career - Pratap Malla used bhakti as the public face of Tantra. The fact of  his relationship with the Tantric goddess was no secret; in important senses, it  was the pivot of late Malla kingship. But articulating that relationship in the verbal  medium and in the public realm required Tantra's paraphrase or overlay, and the  bhakti brand of intimacy was eminently suitable for purposes of display. Bhakti  added an exoteric and aesthetic dimension to the relationship without compro mising its secret core.  

This introduction to the Sarvaparadhastotra has tried to relate Pratap's inscrip tion to the lived social world of its particular time and place. All the evidence  indicates that the problem which most engaged agents of the period was that of  constructing the world of mortals for maximum interface with the worlds of  divinity. The problem for the late Malla kings was to deploy power ultimately  referable to Tantra for real-world political purposes. Pratap's poem makes it clear  that the knowledge that bound devotee to deity constituted the conceptual center  of the cosmo-political order realized in his realm. Far from being a free-floating  text, the inscription's situation as a physical object in the real lived world is also  highly significant. Emblazoned on the golden doors of Taleju's high temple in the  heart of the city, the inscription - like the temple itself - advertised the secret at  the pivotal point of the city-kingdom's life.  

If what is at stake here were only Pratap Malla's poems, or only the history of  late medieval Nepal, consideration of inscriptional texts would be tangential to  the greater study of Tantra. But the larger point is that Tantra in practice - real  historical practice - must always negotiate some interface with the public gaze,  for even in maintaining secrecy its practitioners shape the social world.

Transcriptions of the Sarvaparadhastotra have been published several times. Tran scriptions show significant variations, corresponding in part to the three times  Pratap had the poem inscribed at different sites, none of which is open to foreign  researchers. My translation follows the unpublished reading graciously supplied  by the learned Gurusekhara Rajopadhyaya Sarma of Kathmandu. The textual in tegrity of the inscription is best retained in the edition published by Yogi Nara harinatha et al. in Samskrta-sandesa 1 (Kathmandu, 1953): 26-30. Naraharinatha  transcribes the stone inscription Pratapa Malla had erected at the shrine of the  goddess GuhyeSvari in N.S. 780, or 1659/1660 C.E. More readily available is the  reading supplied by Gautamavajra Vajracarya in his Hanumandhoka Rajadarabara  (Kathmandu: Nepala ra Esiyali Adhyayana Sasthana, Tribhuvana-Visvavidyalaya,  1978), pp. 225-27'. This transcription is of the poem embossed on the doors of  Taleju's temple, in or near N.S. 792, or 1671/1672 C.E. At pages 208-9 of the  same work, Vajracarya presents an earlier version of Pratap's poem, carved into  the now-crumbling stone bath of an inner courtyard of the Kathmandu palace  between N.S. 772 and 773, or 1651-1653 C.E. Most problematic is the reading  of Taleju's doors by D. R. Regmi, in his Medieval Nepal, vol. 4. (Patna: the author,  1966), pp. 97-101. Regmi does not supply a date, but inserts the inscription in  sequence at N.S. 775.

Homage to the thrice-illustrious Kalika.  

1. The sort of anguish felt by the child, whose body is tortured by the garland  of flaming digestive fires producing waves of piss and shit, reborn from his  mother's cavernous womb as a result of past evil's excess,  

Can someone like me, or one still more simple-minded, describe it?  O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

2. In childhood's painful state - incapable of knowledge, in a body wet with  its own filth - one cries constantly because it is impossible to say what hurts,  and because one is greedy to drink milk,  

In this state, which is totally dependent on others, there is not even recol lection of the mother who makes suffering cease.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

3. Wealth and youth feed egoism, and that mind-set respects no one. I adored  sexual games with women, and became so enchanted with this foul adoration  that not for a moment did I adore you, the Primal One, the most deserving of  those who deserve to be honored.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

4. In the decrepitude of old age - which consists of diseases starting with  coughing, wheezing, and being bent over, when walking and breathing are like  punishment, and the heart finds pleasure only in eating - one's thoughts are  empty of her who is Made of Pure Thought,  

When I am sinking into Death's snare, befouled by my own filth, and worries  grow ever greater,  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

5. I was unawakened in yoga, I was inattentive to the commands of the Veda  and indifferent to the orthodox smarta path, I lacked the power to apply myself  to Samkhya metaphysics and the like, I had no ears to hear talk of governance  and conduct.

My thoughts lack focus even when turned to praise and reflection on you,  who are Speech Embodied.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

6. Located like the Supreme Siva at the Brahma-lotus atop the head, you were  never worshiped through mental acts, nor were you worshiped by means of  external rituals, such as those performed in the yantraraja by me, even though  my thoughts were pure,  

Though every act was faithfully performed, fire-oblations and the rest, still  none really reached you.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

7. In my material body composed of the five gross elements, and of Brahma  and other deities, I did not honor you - who are eternal in the form of mantra  and the Inner Sound, who are the Queen of Breath, who are Made of Pure  Thought - 

I did not honor you by means of the unparalleled sacrifice of evils cut like  animals with the sword of knowledge, because the blaze of desire and anger is  brighter than the sun and moon.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

8. She is that which moves in the element-free subtle body, and in the mind,  and in the essence of the self as known through insight; she is transcendent,  an extraordinary thing composed of bliss, whose own self consists of ultimate  truth,  

And yet she is hidden from me. I have not even for a moment managed full  consciousness of her subliminal presence.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

9. Dhata [Brahma] in the form of a lotus, Hari [Visnu] in the shape of a lion,  Sambhu [Siva] as a ghost - these gods who are portions of yourself serve as  your illustrious vehicles at particular times,  

But I am just a mortal who does not know single- and multi-forms at the  time of sacrifice.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

10. You merely fixed your gaze on the best of yogins and that Great Lord - scorcher of Madana, bearer of the trident, holder of the bow - became the Lord  of the Simple, for his heart was stolen away,  

So how shall I, of the dull and wandering thoughts, offer elegant verses of  praise to you?  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  11. Ears! Listen ceaselessly to the stream of goodly descriptions of her.

12. Feet! Go forth to circumambulate daily. Hands, do puja! Head, bow your self in reverence. Heart, do continuous japa. Spirit, go to the state of absorption  in her!  

But I, who am deeply corrupt, did not perform your worship by sharing in  Bhavani thus.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

13. Let her be served - by those who have realized that wisdom, wealth, land,  all forms of grandeur, immortality, and the like are but trifles made of fear,  mixed with a little happiness, and thus doomed to be consumed by Time,  

With body, speech, and mind let her be served - by those who have realized  that she and Sankara are One, for she is made of Endless Bliss, she is the  Woman of the Beautiful City, she is the blessed Sankari of our City.

Neither in fate, nor in the opinions of the Kapalikas and their like, nor in  the collected Vedic teachings, nor in the doctrines of the Vaisnavas, the Sau gatas, the Saivas, the Sauras, nor of those who put Ganesa first, nor in the path  of devotion to the guru, nor in the service prescribed by the Kaulikas who  teach the rules for your observances, with perpetual, occasional, and other rites,  In none of these is your worship accomplished.

### 12 Tantric Rites in Antal's Poetry  

D. Dennis Hudson  

"Shoot me into Krsna,"  

Antal told desire,  

and performed the rites that made it happen.  

The poet known as Antal, who called herself Goda, lived in the early ninth cen tury, in the deep south of the Indian subcontinent. She performed Tantric rites  of the Bhagavatas and described them in her poems, excerpts of which follow.  Bhagavata theology and the stories of her life will introduce them.  

Bhagavata Theology  

"Bhagavata" is the ancient name for the devotees of Vasudeva Krsna who believe  him to be the human manifestation of the brahman they name Narayana. Today  they are more commonly known under the less precise name of Vaisnava. Brah man, a neuter noun, signifies the infinite power of beginningless being and be coming. Narayana, a masculine noun, defines the brahman as "the abode (ayana)  of humans (naras)." The name Narayana means that the brahman in whom we  live and move and have our being, in essence, is personal in a manner impossible  to comprehend. Narayana is the Supreme Person (parama-purusa) of the Rg Veda  and is the Supreme Self (parama-atman) of the Upanisads. Narayana, essentially  formless, is the source of all consciousness and being whose innate power of  creativity (maya) produces all forms.  

The form Narayana first imagines through maya is Vasudeva-with-Laksmi in a  realm called Vaikuntha composed of a supremely pure mode of matter (suddha-

TANTRIC RITES IN ANTAL'S POETRY 20 7  

sattva) beyond our reckoning. The non-dual Vaikuntha is changeless, transcen dent to sun, moon, and fire, and any who reach it do not return to space and  time. Vasudeva-with-Laksmi (Tirumal) is the primordial "Father-Mother," the  highest mode of Narayana that beings can worship. Through maya, Vasudeva with-Laksmi makes formations (vyuhas) of himself to produce the cosmos and  us, and differing forms (murtis) to act for us and to be served by us. Notable  among these are three goddesses (devis) called Sri (kingship), Bhumi (the material  realm), and Candika-Durga (victorious conquest); three gods (devas) called Visnu  (pervading sustenance), Siva (destruction), and Brahma (emanation); and two  humans called Balarama and Krsna. All the while, however, the formless Narayana  at whose "center" Vasudeva resides with Laksmi remains imperishable, omni present, and unthinkable.  

The name Vasudeva repeats the meaning of Narayana, but more intimately. It  means "God (deva) in whom all things dwell (vasu) and who dwells (vasu) in all  things." Laksmi denotes his auspicious and properous sovereignty. With her,  Vasudeva is known as the Bhagavan, "Possessor of Glorious Excellences" by which  he-with-she acts to conceive the universe at the uterine "center." As the Bhagavan  in the form of Krsna said to his friend Arjuna, "My womb (yoni) is the transcendent  brahman, and I plant the embryo (garbha) in it; the arising of all living beings  comes from that, O son of Bharata. In all wombs, O son of Kunti, whatever comes  into being with a form, the transcendent brahman is the womb, and I am the  father who gives the seed" (Bhagavad Glta [BG] 14.3-4). Just as the fetus resides  within the womb of a pregnant woman, the universe resides inside God as if God  were a pregnant king.  

Perception of Vasudeva in Vaikuntha is the purest wisdom possible in Bhaga vata thought and the content of omniscient knowledge (jnana). In the end, how ever, this is Vasudeva's gift, normally given to those of undefiled consciousness,  which means that in the Kali Yuga few will receive it, for in our time, passion and  ignorance overwhelm everyone. Only by omniscient knowledge can anyone know  who he or she truly is and act accordingly; without it, a soul (purusa) will live  forever inside the wheel of time (samsara-cakra) at Narayana's "center," propelled  by a profound anxiety (bhayam) that will cause it to cling to ephemeral objects  for a security they can never give. Anxiety generates desire (kama), which, when  frustrated, produces anger (krodha), causing greed (lobha) to emerge. Desire, an ger, and greed are doorways to painful purgation and ceaseless wandering (BG  16.21-24).  

Nevertheless, Bhagavatas believe there is hope, for by means of maya, Vasudeva  appeared as Krsna very near the end of the previous age, the Dvapara Yuga. He  was born in the city of Mathura on the Yamuna River in northern India through  the warrior aristocrat named Vasudeva and his wife Devaki, who at the time were  imprisoned. Miraculously, Krsna escaped the prison to join his elder brother  Balarama in the household of Nanda, the chieftain of the cowherd village of  Gokula. Nanda and his wife Yasoda mistakenly thought Krsna would inherit the 

208 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

position of cowherd chieftain; he was therefore known as Gopala ("Protector of  Cows"), Govinda ("Lord of Cows"), and Govardhana ("Increaser of Cows").  Krsna and Balarama were human modes of the Bhagavan, but not equally so.  Balarama, the elder, embodied omniscient knowledge (jnana) and its indefatigable  power (bala); like the purity of insight, his skin was white. Krsna, the younger,  however, embodied the complete Vasudeva; like our deluded Kali Yuga percep tion of God, his skin was dark as sapphire.  

Krsna as son of Devaki appears briefly in the ancient and esoteric Chandogya  Upanisad of the Sama Veda, but the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata Purana (here after BP) develop that identity at great length. The epic Mahabharata, for example,  contains as its theological center the secret teaching that Krsna gave Arjuna after  he had abandoned his cowherd disguise: this is the famous Bhagavad Gita, "Song  of the Possessor of Glorious Excellences." There he revealed his identity and the  mysteries of our existence (BG 7). Along with Buddhists, Jainas, and Saivas in the  early centuries B.C.E., Bhagavatas spread throughout the Indian subcontinent, tell ing the story of Krsna and Balarama and establishing their worship. For those  who thought of Krsna only as a great hero and lover, his first name "Vasudeva"  was a patronym; but for those who believed him to be Narayana, it referred to  his true identity as God. By the ninth century C.E., the Krsna story and cult had  been in southern India for at least a millennium, and Antal, thoroughly immersed  in both, was intensely in love with the Dark Cowherd.  

Antal in History  

In her poetry, Antal calls herself Kotai ("Garland"), which in Sanskrit is Goda  ("She gives cows"). She lived in Villi's New Town, which she calls Putuvai ("New  Town") and is known today as Srivilliputtur; it lies about forty miles southwest  of the Pandya capital, Madurai, the "southern Mathura." New Town's newly con 

structed temple, facing east, housed a long stucco icon of Vasudeva reclining on  a huge snake in his form as Madhusudana, "Slayer of Delusion." That icon de picted the theme of maya at the beginning of the universe, which Goda and her  father Visnucitta creatively developed through their skill in ritual visualization  (dhyana).  

The Madhusudana story begins after the previous universe has disappeared  into the waters of darkness within Vasudeva's womb. Vasudeva has "eaten" the  universe, has kept it unmanifest in his "uterine center," and now at the end of  "night," it has emerged in the form of his first-born son, Brahma (BP 8.17-19).  Once awakened, Brahma's nature of purified Passion will enable him to reorganize  himself into the universe, following the guide of Veda or sacred knowledge. The  reclining icon in New Town's temple represented the last part of that primordial  night known as "Brahma's Hour" (brahmamuhurta).  

According to the story, this time when Brahma awoke in the lotus-womb, two  asura demons named Madhu and Kaitabha (Delusion and Passion) had stolen theTANTRI C RITE S IN ANTAL'S POETR Y 209  

Veda. To assist Brahma, Vasudeva became Purity (sattva) in the form of a person  with the head of a horse (Hayagriva) - a visual allusion to the mantras of Veda.  Horse-head then descended into the waters of darkness, tricked Deluded Passion  into leaving the Veda unattended, seized it, and carried it up to Brahma. While  the asuras were searching in the dark waters for their deceiver, Purity removed  his horse-head form and took on the form of a white-skinned man lying on a  snake and sleeping - a visual allusion to the mantras of Tantra. Yet Purity was  not really asleep, for he had allowed maya to envelop him in the "Sleep of Unified  Consciousness" (yoganidra), a state of complete awareness that only appears to be  sleep. When the asuras embodying Deluded Passion found him, they mocked his  white body and snake bed, and attacked. Immediately, Yoganidra released Purity,  who then arose, battled the asuras, and slew them on the thigh of his own white  body. Brahma was now free to express his undefiled passionate nature by trans forming himself into the universe for a new daytime. Thereafter, that form of  Purity was known as Madhusudana, "Slayer of Delusion."  

That cultic background explains why Goda made Yoganidra, "Sleep of Unified  Consciousness," central to her rites. After Brahma had emanated space and time,  Yoganidra appeared within it as Goddess Candika-Durga, famous for slaying  asuras with her spear, as told in the "The Glorification of the Goddess" (Devi  Mahatmyam). She embodied the Bhagavan's brilliant conquering power (tejas).  Yet Goda did not address Yoganidra as Candika-Durga, but as Pinnai, or as Nap 

pinnai, "the lovely Pinnai," a figure in Tamil Bhagavata tradition who was Krsna's  beautiful "cousin-to-be-married." Having entranced Krsna with her alluring  beauty, Pinnai lived with him as wife in his cowherd parent's house. Still, Candika Durga is part of Pinnai's identity. In Sanskrit poems, Pinnai is known as Niladevi,  the "Dark Goddess," but Tamil poems call her Aymakal, a name whose double  meaning is revealing. Aymakal can mean "Cowherd (ay) Goddess (makal)," who  is the cowherdess Pinnai; at the same time it can mean "Goddess (makal) who  Strikes (ay)," who is Candika-Durga. Pinnai plays a crucial role in both of Goda's  poetic works, and we shall return to her shortly.  

The historical account of Goda is slim, known primarily from her poems and  those of her father, Visnucitta. They belonged to a brahman caste called Veyar  that specialized in music and served in temples. In New Town, Visnucitta was  known as "Lord of Priests" (Bhattapiran), adept in the art of visualization and a  devoted servant of Krsna. He apparently provided garlands of fresh lotus for the  daily rites in New Town's temple, and he interpreted his own name, Visnucitta,  to mean "Whose mind is a temple housing Gopala" (Tirumoli 5.4.11). In one  poem, he identified himself with the Pancaratra Agama, the mixed Vedic and  Tantric liturgy of the Bhagavatas, for he said that his family lineage was branded  with the Wheel and Conch that the four-handed Vasudeva Krsna holds in his  back right and left hands, respectively (Tiruppallantu 6-7). That branding is a  Pancaratra rite of purification.  

The origins of the Pancaratra Agama remain obscure, but evidence points to  its presence by the third century B.C.E. in both the northern and southern portions 

210 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

of the Indian subcontinent. Bhagavatas who followed that Agama believed that to  supplement the rites of the Veda, which in theory are restricted to males of certain  classes, Vasudeva in his various formations (vyuhas) revealed the ritual knowledge  now contained in the texts (Samhitas) of the Pancaratra Agama. He addressed  that knowledge specifically to people living in the Kali Yuga, including females  as well as males, low castes as well as high castes, the innately "defiled" as well  as the innately "clean." Followers of the Pancaratra Agama believed that it pos sessed powerful mantric rites to "clean up" the impure, notably the "Man-Lion  Consecration" (narasimha-diksa) taught in the Satvata Samhita, perhaps the oldest  literary form of that tradition now available. Once cleansed, initiates could then  receive consecrations that gave them access to mantras, icons, mandalas, and  temples in their worship, all of which were believed to be based on the Veda.  

In contemporary India, the Sri Vaisnava tradition (sampradaya), which de scends from the famous eleventh- to twelfth-century acarya Ramanuja, follows  the Pancaratra Agama. Its initial consecration includes a purifying sequence of  rites during which the initiate is branded by the acarya on his or her shoulders  in imitation of Vasudeva Krsna. Once marked, that devotee is Vasudeva's purified  possession, a "slave" who in bodily form now represents the "master" to the world.  Such devotees, called prapannas or refugees, are then qualified to receive further  consecrations if they wish. Each consecration requires commitment to specific  disciplines of daily life and ritual practice (sadhana) to attain a specific religious  goal, for example worldly longevity and prosperity, or emancipation from time  and space altogether, or both.  

According to Goda, her father was a religious virtuoso, "the king of those in  New Town who do not swerve from the enjoyment (bhoga) of God." He followed  a ritual practice or sadhana focused on temple worship. As part of his offerings,  it appears, he sang and mimed the poems he had composed while absorbed  mentally in the inner visions (dhyana) they portrayed. Goda said that his behavior  stimulated others: "our Lord reclining on the cobra bed is wealthy and great, so  what can we mere humans do to reach him? But in Villi's New Town, Visnucitta  makes his deity come in a powerful way and then we see him" (Nacciyar Tirumoli  10.10). The numerous Tamil poems her father composed to the cowherd Krsna,  collected as the Tirumoli ("Auspicious Speech"), earned him the title, "Great Saint  Immersed in the Consciousness of God" (Periyalvar).  

Visnucitta projected onto the reclining Madhusudana another story about the  deluge of Brahma's "nighttime," this one concerning the seer and great scholar of  Rg Veda known as Markandeya (Tirumoli 1.1.6 and 2.2.6). The story appears in  Mahabharata 3.186-87 and a "corrected" version appears in the Bhagavata Purana  

12.9.20-34. One day, it says, while Markandeya engaged in visualization at his  ashram, God gave him an experience of maya. Markandeya suddenly found him self totally alone in the dark waters of the cosmic deluge, floundering, it seemed,  for years. Then he saw a shining baby boy lying on the leaf of a banyan tree,  sucking his foot. When he approached the leaf, the dazzling infant inhaled the  seer into his mouth. Suddenly inside the baby, Markandeya now saw the entire 

TANTRI C RITE S IN ANTA L'S POETR Y 211  

universe and his own ashram. The baby, of course, was Vasudeva, who had  "eaten" the universe and would, as a mature male, emit it again through his own  lotus-womb as his son, Brahma. Suddenly, the baby exhaled Markandeya, and  he found himself back in the dark waters. He realized he had met the brahman  of Veda in a manner beyond his own understanding of the Rg Veda and took  refuge in him. Suddenly again, Markandeya found himself back in his ashram,  meditating.  

Krsna's cowherd mother Yasoda had similar experiences. One day while she  was nursing him, Krsna yawned, and Yasoda saw all things, moving and non moving, inside his mouth (BP 10.34-37). Another time, Yasoda was told that her  little boy Krsna had eaten earth. She grabbed him, but Krsna denied it. He offered  to open his mouth to prove it, and when he did, she saw the universe inside. But  through maya, Krsna allowed her to forget (BP 10.32-45).  

Visnucitta's visualization of the reclining Madhusudana as the baby of the deluge  who was also the baby Krsna changed the icon's identity permanently. Today he is  known in Sanskrit as "He who reclines on the banyan leaf (Vatapatrasayi), and in  Tamil as "He who has the banyan leaf for his great palace" (Vataperunkoyilutaiyan).  Following in her father's liturgical footsteps, Goda then added another story of even  greater cultic impact.  

Antal in Hagiography  

The hagiography of Goda explains her vision of the reclining icon. It is longer  than the historical story, more widely known, and is the basis of her annual  marriage to Krsna in Srivilliputtur. Written down in the twelfth to thirteenth  centuries, it depicts Goda as so passionately and single-mindedly attached to  Krsna that she first compelled him to wake up from Pinnai's bed, and then she  compelled him to marry her. That is why she received the title Antal, "She who  rules Krsna." Their union was so literal, the story says, that after Visnucitta be 

trothed her to Krsna, he processed her in a palanquin northward to the island  temple of Sri Rangam in the Kaveri River. There she walked into the temple's  sanctum, climbed up on the altar, and disappeared into its long and reclining  stucco icon, known appropriately as "The Handsome Bridegroom."  

To explain how that could happen, the story says that Antal was an avatar of  Goddess Earth (Manmakal or Bhumidevi). At the beginning of the Kali Yuga,  Goddess Earth appeared as a newborn under a basil plant in the garden of the  New Town temple. Goddess Earth, who is maya as the material universe, is noted  for her patient separation from Vasudeva, in contrast, for example, to maya as  the prosperous kingship (Sridevi), who is always with him. In order to experience  union with him even while remaining separate, however, Goddess Earth took a  human form; it was a gracious act, for right at the beginning of the Kali Yuga she  exemplified the goal of uniting with God in perception while remaining separate  from him in body. Visnucitta found the baby, raised her as his daugher, but when 

212 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

she grew into sexual maturity, her extraordinay passion for Krsna revealed her  true identity.  

Antal, the story says, was highly skilled in the practice of visualization. Krsna  was no longer alive on earth, but out of her longing for him, she perceived Villi's  New Town to be his cowherd village, and the Madhusudana Temple to be the  house of his cowherd parents, and its sanctum to be his bedroom where he slept  with Pinnai. So adept was she, raised a brahman girl, that she lived like a cowherd  girl and even smelled of sour milk. Out of that transformed consciousness, the  story says, she composed her poems for the benefit of the Kali Yuga, the Tiruppavai  and the Nacciyar Tirumoli. Not surprisingly, the rites we find in those poems do  not avoid desire or burn it up, as ascetic renunciants might try to do; rather, they  stimulate desire, harness it, and use it to focus the five senses - with the mind as  sixth - on Krsna.  

The Tiruppavai and Communal Rites  

In Tamil, Tiruppavai (hereafter TP) means "Auspicious Pavai," and in Antal's poem  the term pavai has three referents: Yoganidra as Goddess Candika-Durga; the rites  performed for the Goddess during the month of Margali by unmarried girls; and  the vow (nonpu or vrata) those girls made to perform those rites for the thirty  cold mornings of the Margali month. That month, known in Sanskrit as Marga 

Sirsa, ends at the winter solstice day; Krsna had identified himself with it in the  Bhagavad Gita 10.35. The committed girls would arise in the cold before the dawn  of each Margali day, gather a drum and other ritual implements from the head man's house, go together to the river, bathe, and then fashion an image of the  Goddess from sand. As a group they would then worship her for practical benefits  in the year beginning with the winter solstice. For the sake of the land and its  people, they asked the Goddess for regular rainfall; for their own sake, they asked  for a good husband.  

Although the hagiography provides a rich theological interpretation of Antal's  poems, the history of Goda, thin as it is, provides insight into her profound genius.  Goda based the thirty stanzas of Tiruppavai on a Margasirsa temple ceremony  prescribed for Bhagavatas by the Pancaratra Agama. Onto that ceremony she vi 

sually projected the rites of the Goddess's bathing vow; she then visualized the  actors of that vow, herself included, as cowherdesses living in Krsna's village of  Gokula, far to the north, in the previous age. Out of that complex perceptual  patterning she spoke a poem believed by Sri Vaisnavas to contain the essence of  the Upanisads. It was so important to their famously learned teaching priest  (acarya) of the eleventh to twelfth century, Ramanuja, that he was known as the  "Pontiff Devoted to the Tiruppavai" (Tiruppavai-jiyar). Having spoken out of a  desiring consciousness focused on Krsna, her words now embody that conscious ness as mantras do the brahman; any adept singer of them will become immersed  in the consciousness that produced them. 

TANTRI C RITE S I N ANTAL'S POETR Y 213  

In early ninth-century New Town, we may reasonably conjecture, observant  Bhagavatas arose during the last hour of each Margali night, gathered at the tem ple's sanctum, and sang songs as they waited for the priest to open the doors.  They then addressed the newly awakened Madhusudana directly and offered him  songs in Sanskrit and Tamil, the special foods he enjoys, and their own loving  service. For thirty days they fed him, but fasted until the last day, when in his  iconic presence they gathered to eat the sweet milk-rice, rich with the ghee in  which he delights.  

Of those thirty days, the full moon was the most important, and the Tiruppavai  describes it. Goda envisions male and female Bhagavatas rising in the predawn  hour as cowherdesses gathering to worship the Goddess in the Yamuna River.  Those same Bhagavatas standing at the door of the temple's sanctum she sees as  cowherdesses at the door of Krsna's bedroom. She hears the songs they sing as  cowherdesses calling out to Pinnai to open the door so that they might ask Krsna  for the drum essential to their Goddess rites - for as the headman's son, he is its  keeper. When the priest finally opens the sanctum doors to reveal the awakened  Madhusudana, she sees him as Pinnai opening the bedroom door to join the  cowherdesses, who now admit to Krsna that they had really come for him - the  drum was merely a pretext. All they want is the desire to serve him as they would  serve a husband, but for "seven times seven rebirths," which means forever in the  wheel of time. In her last stanza, Goda says he fulfilled their request.  

Later commentators noted that the cowherdesses in the Tiruppavai do not go  off alone for solitary union with Krsna, but remain together; they unite with him  collectively, as if bathing together in the cool waters of his stunningly beautiful  presence. Here erotic imagery depicts communal experience as it does in the  famous "Dance of Delight" (rasa-lila) described in Bhagavata Purana 10.29-33.  Dancing in a circle in the Vrndavana forest, Krsna appeared to each cowherdess  as if he were with her alone, and yet they were all there together, united in their  focus on him. Shared love of the Supreme Male is the basis of human community,  Bhagavatas believe, for all souls in relation to God are like dependent females:  their own fulfillment comes from giving God pleasure in the way servants give to  a master, or polygamous wives give to a shared husband.  

The Nacciyar Tirumoli and Solitary Rites  

Equal in fame to the communal "Dance of Delight" is Krsna's special love for a  single cowherdess (BP 10.30). Later northern tradition knows her as Radha; earlier  Tamil tradition knows her as Pinnai. Apparently, communal "bathing in Krsna"  on the full moon day of Margali was not enough for Goda, who wanted to be  alone with him as a unique lover like Pinnai. Goda could not have literal sexual  union with Krsna, of course, because he was no longer alive as a man. He was  bodily present now in icons of wood ,stucco, stone, or metal; or in the teaching  priest (acarya) on ritual occasions; or in her own visualizations. 

214 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

Being adept in visualization, Goda sought solitary union with Krsna through  it. She sought the enstatic consciousness called samadhi. Her method was to  envision herself as Pinnai, Krsna's cousin-to-be-married as she grew in Gokula  from a child of about five to full sexual maturity at the age of twelve when Krsna  was sixteen. Out of those visions she produced the fourteen poems called the  Nacciyar Tirumoli (NT), "The Venerable Beloved's (nacciyar) Auspicious (tiru)  Speech (moli)."  

Of the fourteen poems of the Nacciyar Tirumoli, eleven consist of ten stanzas  and three of eleven. In the first poem, translated below, Goda describes the rites  of her ritual discipline (sadhana). She had begun the sadhana on the winter solstice  day, the first day of the month called Tai, immediately after the Margali rites of  the Tiruppavai. She continued it through the following month called Masi. Now,  she tells us, she is on the first day of the following month called Pahguni, when  the vernal equinox falls, and is looking forward to its full moon. Her sadhana  thus extends from the winter solstice to the vernal equinox, the period of slowly  increasing heat in southern India that matches the increasing heat of her passion,  felt especially in her swelling breasts, which "will go into no other mouth than  Govinda's" (NT 12.4) In the poem she begins her sadhana's climactic sequence  of daily visualizations, producing a poem out of the experience of each day except  for the last; the samadhi she attained on the full moon day apparently left her  speechless.  

In the first poem, Goda describes her rites as centered on a mandala, a cosmic  mapping, that she had ritually drawn on the ground outside the temple sanctum  during the month of Tai. In the meantime, she had laid a fire and had performed  appropriate rites for the season, including, it appears, commemoration of Siva's  burning of the God of Desire (Kamadeva), which made him bodiless. Any doubts  about Kama's reality thereafter, however, she banished, and used his name in 

scribed on a wall to represent his bodiless presence. By addressing Kamadeva  outside of herself, she addressed the passion inside her that propelled her toward  Krsna, who in these rites stood as an icon over three hundred miles to the north,  on the mountain called Venkatam. Her rites took her in processions on New  Town's streets (verse 6), involved priestly chanters and the leadership of her  acarya (verse 7), and her own fasting (verse 8). Her acarya appears in verse 7 as  Visnu in the form of a Dwarf, a small man who embodied the owner of everything,  including the initiate (BP 8.15-23); that is, the status of the acarya infused with  mantras during consecration (diksa) rites conducted at a mandala. In the rite, he  touches her body to divinize it, and she envisions this to be Krsna's loving touch.  

Goda's ritual focus on Kamadeva as "Churner of the Mind" (Manmatha) reveals  her Pancaratra liturgical context. Kamadeva derives from the Preeminently Mighty  Formation (Pradyumna-yyuha) of the Bhagavan. In Krsna's later life as ruler of  Dvaraka, this formation appears as his son and heir-apparent, Pradyumna, who  looked just like his father. Pradyumna was born to Rukmini, but he had a younger  half-brother named Samba, born to Jambavati. Samba embodied Skandadeva,  God of War. Pradyumna and Samba were Desire and Anger as Krsna's sons, which 

TANTRI C RITE S IN ANTAL'S POETR Y 215  

means they were expressions of Vasudeva Krsna himself. That is why Goda ad dresses both in the poem: desire for, and anger at, Krsna are modes of his "Pre eminently Mighty" Pradyumna presence.  

Goda's remaining thirteen poems describe her visualized journey to samadhi.  In the second poem, she introduces herself as the child Pinnai building sand  castles that the older Krsna - "Narayana praised with a thousand names who was  a man" - playfully kicks down (NT 2.1). Each poem captures a scene in Pinnai's  life as she swells, like the Pariguni moon, to full sexual maturity and intense desire.  In poem 3, her sexual maturation has begun: While she is bathing with other  cowherdesses in a pond, Krsna steals their clothes and teases them erotically. "We  won't do that," she says, "it's not right - You're a boy and you know these things,  don't be in such a hurry" (NT 3.2). Following the conventions of ancient Tamil  poetry, in poem 5, her breasts have swollen with pleasure and give her grief, and  she has already met her lover in secret; he penetrated her, stole her "bangle," but  did not show his face. In desparation she addresses a huyil bird in passages trans lated below. He has to marry her to save her honor, yet as time goes by, he does  not come, and so, in poem 13, she breaks into a rage: "If I see Govardhana, I'll  grab my fruitless breast by the root, rip it out, and throw it on his chest, and then  I'll be free of my burning" (NT 13.8). But she retreats quickly: "If only he would  take me to his superbly auspicious chest, then, if one day he looked me in the  face and told me in truth to leave, still it would be wonderful" (NT 13.9).  

Goda also weaves into her poems a pilgrimage route that she must have made  at least once by palanquin, oxcart, and foot. She begins her envisioned pilgrimage  at the temple in New Town, where the icon is sculpted reclining. Then she visually  moves northward to icons sculpted in various postures - sitting, reclining, or  standing - housed in the temple in Madurai, in the mountain temple of Alaga 

koyil, and in temples along the Kaveri River. For example, at the closed doors of  the reclining icon in Kumbhakonam, she says to her visualized companions:  

I was initiated into the vision of the Black God  

Krsna,  

And in my pure state,  

Don't stand there talking of his beauty  

as if pouring acid in a wound,  

Take the gold cloth from the room of the Bhagavan  

who doesn't know women's sorrow  

And throw it over me  

to end my withering.  

NT 13.1  

She completed her envisioned pilgrimage route in the Pallava capital of Kan cipuram, the last major stop before the Venkatam mountain about sixty miles to  the north. The pilgrims she would have met returning from the forest shrine  appear in her last poem as Pinnai's friends. As the selected stanzas translated  below illustrate, they tell her they saw Krsna walking in the Vrndavana forest 

2 1 6 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

toward which she is headed. The final stanza, moreover, makes it clear that she  would attain her goal, for it refers to a well-known story of Gajendra, the king of  elephants, caught by a "grasper" in the lake of ordinary sensual pleasure. After  struggling for a thousand years and near exhaustion, Gajendra remembered Va 

sudeva, mentally took refuge in him, and asked him to free him - not from  "grasping" sensual desire, however, but from ignorance. Instantly, Visnu ap peared, slayed the "grasper," and took the stout-legged "Indra of Elephants" to  Vaikuntha, never to return (BP 8.2-4).  

Despite the journey she embedded within her visualizations, Goda remained  at the mandala in New Town during the rites underlying her fourteen poems; she  traveled only in her consecrated and impassioned mind. She attained, we are told,  what all pilgrims seek, the end of ignorance and the emergence of omnisicent  knowledge (jnana), whose content is Vasudeva Krsna.

Excerpts from the Tiruppavai  

1. Margali month and the full moon,  

what a grand day!  

If you're going to bathe, let's go  

You well-adorned wealthy girls  

of the herders' town flowing with riches!  

The son of Nanda the cowherd,  

man of sharp spear and ruthless deeds,  

The young lion of Yasoda,  

her eyes full of beauty,  

He with the body dark like a cloud  

with red eyes,  

a face like the sun and moon,  

Narayana himself,  

Will give us the drum,  

And people of this land will praise us,  

So plunge in, everyone, O my Goddess.  

2. O you who live on earth,  

Listen to the deeds we do for our Goddess:  

We exalt the Transcender's foot,  

who sleeps lightly on the Sea of Milk,  

We don't eat ghee, we don't eat milk, 

218 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

Before daybreak we bathe,  

But we don't paint our eyes,  

We don't braid flowers in our hair,  

We don't do what isn't to be done,  

Nor do we spread evil words around,  

But we do give gifts and alms to the limit,  

And we ponder the path to life,  

Rejoicing, everyone, O my Goddess.  

3. The Exalted One grew tall to measure out this world,  And if we extol his name and bathe,  

saying it's for our Goddess,  

All the land will be free from harm,  

For with rains three times each month,  

carp will leap in fine paddy growing tall,  

spotted bees will slumber in blue waterlilies,  

milkers without qualm will enter, sit,  

seize swollen teats, and tug  

as bounteous great cows overflow their pots,  

Unceasing wealth will abound  

For everyone, O my Goddess.  

4. Ocean-deep Lord of Rain, hold back nothing,  

Plunge into the ocean, lift up its water,  

Roar and soar high with a body dark like the Deluger,  

Flash like the Wheel he holds,  

he with a lotus navel  

and shoulders of power and beauty,  

Thunder like his Conch curling to the right,  

And without delay  

like a rain of arrows shot by his Bow,  

Pour down on earth for its thriving  

So we may bathe in Margali rejoicing,  

Everyone, O my Goddess.  

5. Coming in purity to the Owner of Maya,  

hero of everlasting Mathura in the north,  

chief of the Yamuna pure and deep,  

jewel lamp blazing in the cowherd caste,  

child with a rope tied round his belly  

bringing radiance to his mother's womb,  

We scatter bright flowers and worship,  

We exalt him with our words,  

Ponder him with our minds,  

And, they say, our past faults,TANTRI C RITE S I N ANTAL'S POETR Y 21 9  

and even those yet to come,  

Will become like cotton in a fire,  

Everyone, O my Goddess.  

18. He is a bull elephant in rut,  

His mighty shoulders never flee,  

He is Nanda the protector of cows,  

And you are his daughter-in-law,  

O lovely Pinnai,  

Won't you with coiled and perfumed hair  

Open the gate, please,  

for cocks are crowing all around us,  

and look, on the madhavi bower,  

flocks of kuyil cry out over and over;  

So that we may sing the names of your husband,  

As you hold the ball in your fingers,  

Won't you come  

with graceful bangles tinkling  

And with with your red lotus hand  

Open the door,  

Rejoicing everyone, O my Goddess.  

19. A standing lamp burns,  

While stretched out on a smooth bed  

of the five finest qualities  

over a frame with tusks for legs,  

You rest, holding on your full-blown chest  

The breasts of lovely Pinnai,  

clusters of flowers blooming  

in her coiled hair,  

Speak to us, please;  

And you there with those long shadowed eyes,  

Won't you let your husband awake from sleep  

even for a moment?  

Look, can't you stand to be apart  

even for a second?  

That's not your nature, not your way,  

Please open up,  

Rejoicing everyone, O my Goddess.  

20. You led the thirty-three Immortals  

and dispelled their fear,  

Such strength is yours,  

please wake up;  

You are faithful, you are brave, 

220 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

You are the Uncorrupted who gives  

sorrow to your foes,  

please wake up;  

And lovely Pinnai, best of women,  

breasts soft, small like pots,  

mouth red, waist slender,  

O Sri,  

please wake up,  

Give us a fan,  

a mirror,  

your husband,  

So we may bathe this very moment,  

Open up, please, rejoicing everyone,  

O my Goddess.  

27. O Govinda, you always slay the enemy,  

for such is your sovereignty,  

And in praising you we shall take the drum,  

Receive your largesse,  

And with gifts the land extols - 

bracelets and armlets,  

rings and baubles for the ears,  

anklets and many other jewels - 

We shall adorn ourselves, dress in cloth,  

We shall be served milk-rice covered in ghee  

flowing down our elbows,  

And sitting together with you we shall be cooled,  

Everyone, O my Goddess.  

29. In the small hours of morning we come and serve you,  Praising your golden lotus foot and no other,  

Listen please to the meaning of this,  

for you too were born in the caste  

that grazes cattle for a living,  

so don't go on not taking our intimate service,  

Because, keeper of cows,  

Today isn't for taking the drum - 

Every day for seven times seven rebirths  

We will relate only to you,  

We will slave only for you,  

So please dispel any other desire we may have,  

Everyone, O my Goddess.  

30. The finely dressed girls with moon-bright faces  

Approached and revered Kesava,

who was Madhava  

churner of the sea of ships,  

And there received that drum,

whose garland is fresh and cooling lotus,  

While here whoever recites these stanzas

Will receive holy grace from wealthy Tirumal  

with four vast mountainous shoulders,

EXCERPTS FROM THE NACCIYAR TIRUMOLI  

POEM ONE  

1. The whole month of Tai  

I purified the ground  

and laid a graceful mandala,  

And from the first day of Masi  

I decorated the streets  

with fine sand and made them beautiful,  

0 God without a body,  

And wondering, "Will I ever live?"  

1 worshiped you and your younger brother - 

You can appoint me to the Lord of Vehkatam  

Whose hand holds the incomparable Wheel that spits hot fire,  can't you?  

2. I decorated the streets with fine white sand,  

I immersed myself in a pond before the sky grew light,  

I fed thornless branches into a fire,  

Enduring those things for you, O God of Desire - 

You can take a flower full of honey for an arrow,  

Write on it the unique name,  

"He the Color of the Ocean,"  

And shoot me into the singular target,  

"He Split the Mouth of the Bird,"  

can't you? 

2 2 2 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

3. Taking flowers of intoxicating sweet fragrance  

And the blossoms of coral trees  

I worshiped your feet three times a day,  

And when my heart burned and said, "He is not real,"  

I refused to say it and did not slander you at all - 

You can take a cluster of blooming flowers for an arrow,  

Write the unique name "Govinda" on it,  

And shoot me into the singular lamp,  

"The Mysterious and Wise Herder,  

Resident of Vehkatam,"  

can't you?  

4. I wrote your ancient name on a wall,  

Showed you auspicious flags with shark emblems  

And horses and ladies waving yak-tail fans  

And sugarcane war bows  

And gave them to you,  

Didn't you notice, O God of Desire? - 

Since 1 was young my full breasts have craved constantly  

and have swelled up,  

But I have resolved they are only for the Lord of Dvaraka  

And have been worshiping you,  

For you can make that happen quickly,  

can't you?  

5. My full and swelling breasts meant for the Supreme Being  Whose body bears the Wheel and the Conch  

Are like the food set aside by brahmans  

in the fire sacrifice  

for the gods dwelling in heaven - 

So if you say they are meant for a man,  

That would be like a fox that wanders in a forest  

who enters, licks, smells,  

and picks over the food,  

And I won't go on living,  

don't you see, Manmatha?  

6. Every day I appear on the street with handsome men  And young men and learned men  

And skillful reciters of hymns,  

Observing the days of Panguni perfectly,  

O God of Desire - 

So you should be gracious and make him  

who is the color of a black cloud  

and the color of the purple kaya flower  

and the color of the sky-blue karuvilai  

( 

TANTRI C RITE S IN ANTAL'S POETR Y 223  

Look at me directly with his auspicious eyes  

In his splendid face the color of a lotus,  

don't you see?  

7. I cook green paddy with sugarcane  

And I cook aval from fresh rice with brown sugar,  

And I worship you with the mantras of Brahmins with good voice,  O Manmatha - 

So you will give me the greatest glory in this world,  

The experience of the Thrice-strider  

who long ago measured out the land,  

Touching me with his auspicious hands  

on my lustrous belly and soft full breasts,  

won't you?  

8. With my body tarnished,  

My hair disheveled,  

My lips colorless,  

And eating only once,  

0 splendid and able God of Desire,  

Don't you notice the vow I endure? - 

Don't you see my lord,  

Only one thing is left to say:  

Be gracious in a way that crowns my womanhood  

And grant me this boon,  

"She will seize the feet of Kesava the Beloved."  

9. Worshiping three times a day,  

Venerating your feet,  

Tossing pure flowers in worship,  

1 sing your praise,  

Yet flawlessly I serve him alone,  

He whose color is the sea that surrounds the earth - 

And if I don't receive true life,  

I shall run wild  

and weep  

and wail  

and cry out "Mother!"  

And that will disgrace you entirely,  

don't you see,  

Just as if you had yoked an ox to the plow  

and worked it  

but never gave it food.  

10. By venerating the two feet of Lord Kama  

whose bow is sugarcane  

and whose arrows are flowers, 

224 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

And by saying,  

"The one there who ripped off the tusk  

of the incomparable roaring elephant  

and split the mouth of the bird,  

he the color of blue gem,  

set me aside for him,"  

Goda, daughter of Visnucitta,  

king of those who live in New Town  

where storied houses spring up in abundance like mountains,  Composed this garland of Tamil with desiring love,  

And those adept in reciting it will,  

without a doubt,  

Reach the feet of the King  

of those dwelling in Visnu's realm.  

POEM FIVE (EXCERPTS)  

1. Just because I take pleasure in the Lord of Spring,  

that man the color of black gem  

wearing a jewel crown,  

Is it right that I lost my bangle? . . .  

2. That spotless one holding a sparkling Wheel  

in his left hand  

Didn't show his body to me,  

But penetrated me  

And hurt me  

And all day as my life pours out,  

He dances about, watching. . . .  

3. I haven't see that hero coming anywhere. . . .  

4. O kuyil, my bones melt,  

The lids of my splendid spearlike eyes  

won't close,  

And many days now I've been tossing about  

in the sea of sorrow  

without the boat Vaikuntha,  

But you, too, know the ache  

a lover's separation gives,

## Traditions in Transition and Conflict

### 13 The Jain Monk Jinapati Suri Gets the Better  of a Nath Yogi  

Paul Dundas  

Perhaps more than any other Indian religious tradition, Jainism has placed a high  value on maintaining barriers of physical and moral restraint and self-discipline  in order to advance on the path to liberation. The entire regimen of the religion's  adherents, at least as ideally conceived, has been oriented toward the ascetic  quieting of the mind, body, and speech. The aim is to reduce and ultimately  eliminate the flow of karmic matter, which brings about both the soul's embod 

iment, whether in human or lesser form, and loss of its perfect qualities of bliss,  energy, and knowledge, with consequent entanglement in the time-bound world  of rebirth. Tantric practices have tended to flourish in India whenever a religious  establishment that claims a monopoly on purity of behavior has erected bound 

aries against what it perceives to be the encroaching dangers of society and nature.  The response that is generated would see true religiosity in radically experiential  terms, linked to the deliberate breaching or ignoring of these boundaries. From  this perspective, Jainism would appear to provide a classic scenario for the even 

tual emergence of a reorientation of its soteriological path that would fall within  the general sphere of Tantra. Even to those well informed about the dynamics of  South Asian soteriological traditions, however, it might seem strange to think of  medieval Jain monks as Tantric adepts.  

Here we should be clear about what is meant by "Tantra" in the Jain context.  Although some Jain teachers from the early medieval period onward did advocate  judging the external world in terms of the one true reality, the innermost soul,  and consequently downgraded workaday experience by reference to it, there can 

not be found within Jainism any serious claim that conventional social and moral  values should be turned upside-down by engaging in antinomian sexual and ritual  practices. Extreme forms of behavior indicating an attempted direct engagement  with some variety of unconditioned of unmediated reality seem to have been  advocated -only within those South Asian traditions that had nondualism as an 

232 PAUL DUNDAS  

ideological basis. The Jains, pluralist realists throughout their intellectual history,  have consistently rejected nondualism and its philosophical affine, monism,  whether of a Hindu or Buddhist provenance, as equivalent to idealism.  

However, the possibility of using sanctified language of a general Tantric idiom  in the attempt to gain worldly goals has never caused the Jains any difficulty, and  in common with the Hindus and Buddhists they cultivated an elaborate science  of mantra and yantra (mantrasastra) that enabled them, often with the aid of  tutelary deities, to participate within a performative world of magic and esoteric  ritual. Mantras and magic spells are, in fact, credited with great antiquity in Jain 

ism, having supposedly constituted the whole of the tenth section of the massive  Purva ("prior") scriptures that finally disappeared very early in the common era,  if indeed they ever existed at all. Legends also accrued around a number of man trasiddhas, or "mantra masters," named Revati, Rohini, Nagarjuna, Khaputacarya  and Yasobhadra who are given traditional datings that would locate them as living  from about the second century B.C.E. to the tenth century c.E. However, these  individuals, who are regarded as Jain exemplars in the practice of magic, have  little reality beyond legend; Nagarjuna, for one, also appears in a large number  of guises in Buddhist tradition. The early medieval literature prescribing correct  monastic behavior is clearly uneasy with the performance of magic ritual by Jain  monks, which suggests that this may have been a common practice. Unfortu 

nately, the trajectory of early Jain mantric practices cannot be precisely delineated  much beyond this. Nonetheless, it can be said that probably through a combi nation of the influence of the requirements of a burgeoning life-cycle and temple  ceremonial and increasing exposure to prestigious Saiva styles of mantric usage,  by around the eleventh century the Jains had evolved their own particular brand  of mantrasastra and attendant ritual. Monastic participation within this mantric  culture was no longer frowned upon. Indeed, the ability to manipulate magic  spells successfully and thus overcome human or divine opponents came to be  seen as one of the major ways by which a monk could bring glory to the Jain  religion.  

Jain use of mantras has, broadly speaking, been centred on alloforms or vari ants, often of some length, of the Pancanamaskara, "The Five Homages," a ben edictory formula of salutation to the omniscient saints, liberated beings, teachers,  preceptors, and monks, which was composed in the vernacular Prakrit language  and in its complete form perhaps dates from around the beginning of the common  era, although in Jain tradition it is reckoned to be eternal. From early medieval  times to the present day, Jain scholars have analyzed this mantra and speculated  on the nature of its power and its correlation with the constituent parts of the  human body. However, an important mantra that came to preoccupy medieval  Jains greatly (and that will be encountered in the passage translated below) has  only tangential connections with "The Five Homages," at least in external form.  This is the surimantra, a mantra from whose power the very continuity of Jainism  was regarded as deriving.  

Strictly speaking, the surimantra is the formula (once again couched in Prakrit, 

JAIN MONK, NATH YOGI 23 3  

not Sanskrit, as is normal in other Indian mantric cultures) transmitted privately  by a senior Jain teacher, or suri, of one of the Svetambara ("White-Robed") image worshiping sects to a pupil during the ceremony in which the latter is promoted  to that same rank. Many elaborate cloth paintings, called patas, exist with suri mantras inscribed on them within elaborate yantra-like designs that were pre sented to newly appointed suris to commemorate their promotion. One of the  regular obligations of a suri is to recite this mantra and meditate upon it every  night for the well-being of the members of his sect, both ascetics and lay followers.  Meditation upon the surimantra by the leader of a sectarian group was in the late  medieval period also a vital element in the location of an appropriately qualified  successor.  

Although the hagiographies of the post-eleventh-century Svetambara sectarian  leaders take care to hedge the surimantra around with secrecy, the medieval ritual  handbooks, or kalpas, show no reticence about recording the mantra's wording  and the ritual by which the powers located in it could be realized. Indeed, so  many different transmissions have been preserved that it is impossible to talk of  one central version of the surimantra, whatever claims to exclusivity the com 

peting sectarian traditions might have made. The kalpas describe how the mantra  was originally transmitted by Rsabha, the first of the twenty-four saving teachers,  or tirthahkaras, of this world age - and gradually became differentiated and di minished from its original length of three hundred verses, as the physical and  moral stature of humanity slowly but inexorably declined over vast periods of  time, until it was finally reduced at the very end of this world age to a mere two  and half verses in length.  

The earliest evidence for the surimantra simply links it to the ritual for teacher  consecration and image installation. By the eleventh century, however, it had also  become a crucial element of legitimation for the leaders of the various Svetambara  Jain sects (gacchas) that emerged at that time. By means of the surimantra, a suri  could demonstrate his authority within his sect by mastering through meditation  and ritual the various magic powers embodied in the mantra, such as curing  disease and overcoming enemies, and thus ultimately transform himself into the  latter-day equivalent of Gautama, the miracle-working favourite disciple of the  twenty-fourth trrthahkara, Mahavira. Although the result gained from the suri mantra ritual is not specifically stated to be enlightenment and subsequent free 

dom from rebirth, it can nonetheless be said that here Jain Tantra, normally  oriented toward material and worldly goals, becomes more soteriological than at  any other point.  

A typical example of the surimantra is divided into various sections, as many  as five, called prasthanas or pithas, each of which has a presiding deity. The first  section, standard in all transmissions of the surimantra, contains expressions of  homage (similar in form to those found in the Pancanamaskara formula referred  to above) to a variety of Jain advanced spiritual types and also a formally expressed  expectation of success in the ritual linked to the mantra. The next two sections  generally invoke the various labdhis, or magic powers, possessed by Mahavira's 

234 PAUL DUNDAS  

disciple Gautama and offer praise to the great warrior-ascetic Bahubali, the son  of the tirthahkara Rsabha, whose attainment of enlightenment without scriptural  knowledge seems to have provided an attractive model for those monks who saw  themselves as following the Jain path in debased times during which serious  learning was at a premium.  

The fourth and fifth sections usually contain strings of mantric language, Prakrit  combined with esoteric words such as meru, framed by the power syllable Om  and the ancient Vedic invocation svaha. These sections are more overtly oriented  toward spiritual attainments and the transformation of the suri into the equivalent  of Gautama. According to some monastic commentators, the fifth and most ad 

vanced section of the surimantra, called mantraraja, "king of mantras" (a desig nation that is often used by synecdoche to refer to the whole mantra) encompasses  and is equivalent to the preceding four sections. Contemplation of the mantra by  the suri was ideally to take place within a mandala-like diagram modeled on the  balustraded assembly hall where gods, humans, and animals gather to hear each  tirthahkara preach. The restrained and ascetic activities of fasting and confession  were necessary components of the accompanying ritual, thus marking it out as  specifically Jain. Making offerings in consecrated fires, indicative of a more general  Tantric idiom, is also advocated in the ritual handbooks.  

One of the Svetambara Jain subsects that placed particular emphasis on the  surimantra was the Kharatara Gaccha, which took its name from the epithet  "Sharpwitted" (kharatara) bestowed in 1024 C.E. by a king on one of its early  teachers after a victory in public debate. The passage translated below focuses  upon three of the suris of this sect, Jinadatta Suri (1075-1154), perhaps the  greatest leader of the Kharatara Gaccha, his successor Jinacandra Suri (1140- 

1166), known as Manidharin, "Jewel Bearer," because he had a precious stone in  his forehead (an attribute not fully explained by the chroniclers but possibly  connected with the narratives about the legendary mantrasiddha YaSobhadra, who  was similarly endowed), and his successor Jinapati Suri (1153-1220). The chron 

iclers of the Kharatara Gaccha are particularly concerned to portray these monks  as protectors and enrichers of their followers through their magical powers and,  in particular, as vying for supremacy with the yoginis who controlled some of the  major cities of western India.  

The cult of the yoginis, the sixty-four semidivine sorceresses and shape-chang ers, although of indeterminate origin (sixth century C.E.?), had become extremely  popular in north India by around the tenth or eleventh centuries. Benevolent  protectresses and agents of inner transformation when propitiated by their Saiva  votaries but malevolent and vengeful if crossed, these sorceresses were particularly  associated by the Jains with Delhi, called in the Kharatara Gaccha sources Yogi nipura, "City of the Yoginis," a dangerous place of the black arts. They are also  portrayed as having strongholds in the cities of Ajmer, Ujjain, and Broach. The  yoginis represent for the Jains a malign form of Tantric magic, as does the mys terious Nath yogi who appears later in the passage below as a stock representative 

JAIN MONK, NATH YOGI 23 5  

of a Saiva sect with which the Jains contested for local patronage in western India  for centuries and also at times achieved a kind of accomodation.  The early chronicler of the Kharatara Gaccha, Jinapala, who probably wrote  around the middle of the thirteenth century, refers only in passing to the perils  of Delhi and Jinadatta's conversion of the yoginis at Ujjain, and he says nothing  of Jinacandra's having had a jewel in his forehead. A cycle of traditional stories  quickly emerged, however, as the Kharatara Gaccha expanded its sense of identity  and history; it described how Jinadatta compelled the yoginis of Delhi to bestow  boons upon the sect and how the young Jinapati Suri won back his master Jin acandra's jewel through the power of the surimantra. Here we gain a glimpse of  Tantra as it was perceived to operate "on the ground" in medieval India, func tioning not as an esoteric and learned soteriology but as a magic weapon in the  struggle for sectarian dominance. A consistent theme in these narratives is the  ability through spells to paralyze an opponent. This is one of the "six acts" (sat karmani), a form of black magic common to most Tantric traditions, with the  other five being calming disease and inimical spirits, bringing others under one's  control, sowing dissension among one's enemies, causing psychological turmoil  in an individual so that he abandons his normal life, and killing. Jain monks saw  no moral difficulty in engaging in such magic.  

The following extract is taken from the third of three anonymous Sanskrit  chronicles or pattavalis, "Lists of the Holders of the Patta," which describes the  main events in the lives of the leaders of the Kharatara Gaccha up to 1617. The  term patta signifies the seal tied on the forehead of a traditional Indian monarch  at the time of his consecration and indicates the royal imagery with which the  Jains surrounded their great teachers. The style of this particular pattavali is  clipped and unembellished (although without the strong vernacularization that  characterizes much Jain Sanskrit literature of this period), and I have occasionally  smoothed it out. In the interests of providing a self-contained narrative, I have  also omitted the pattavali's descriptions of the miracles performed by Jinadatta in  the period prior to his death. Although according to Jain usage the title of suri is  incorporated into a teacher's name (for example Jinapatisuri), I have throughout  kept it separate.  

An equivalent narrative recorded by an earlier anonymous Prakrit chronicle  entitled the Vrddhacaryaprabandhavali, "Series of Biographies of the Old Teach ers," provides some explanations that amplify the version below. Thus we are told  that on his deathbed Jinadatta had forbidden his successors to travel to any of  the cities that fell within the influence of the yoginis. Jinacandra's otherwise odd  and ultimately fatal visit to Delhi is explained as the result of an earnest request  by the Jain community there. In addition, this same chronicle attributes the vin 

dictive behavior of the Nath yogi to his anger at the unwillingness of the Jain laity  to give him alms. It is noteworthy that, according to the second of the pattavalis  edited by Muni Jinavijaya, Jinapati magically summons his dead teacher Jinacan dra to help him against the yogi.

Kharataragacchapattavalisamgraha, Third Pattavali  

Once Jinadatta Suri went to Delhi where the sixty-four yoginis had their ritual  sites. He did not pay homage to them, and so in anger the yoginis thought,  "Let us bewitch him." Then a friendly deity, who traveled between the various 

JAI N MONK , NAT H YOGI 237  

worlds, visited Jinadatta and warned him, "There are yoginis living here who  will try to bewitch you. Be careful." During the night Jinadatta summoned a  layman called Mahanasi and said to him, "Get sixty-four fresh mats ready and  bring them here. There is an important task to be performed." The layman  brought the mats that night, and Jinadatta recited mantras over them. In the  morning, when the time came to expound the scriptures, he told another lay 

man, "Today sixty-four laywomen will come in a crowd. They will stand in the  south, the inauspicious region of death, wearing white clothes. You must give  them the mats to sit on." While Jinadatta was preaching, the women came as  he had said, and the layman gave them the mats, as result of which they all  remained rooted to the spot, for they were in reality the yoginis who had been  paralyzed by the power of Jinadatta's mantras. At the end of his sermon, Jina 

datta said to them, "Be off now, but come again tomorrow morning."  The yoginis were deeply embarrassed, realizing that Jinadatta was a reposi tory of great mantric power, and they asked that their offense be pardoned  before they left. Jinadatta said, "Give me something in return." So they gave  him seven boons, namely, that Kharatara monks would generally not be fools;  Kharatara nuns would not follow the normal worldly behavior of women; Khar atara monks and nuns would not die from snakebite; statements made by fol lowers of the Kharatara Gaccha would be efficacious; there would be no danger  to the leaders of the Kharatara Gaccha from lightning; witches (safeims) would  not enchant members of the sect; and all Kharatara laymen beyond Delhi would  be rich and learned. The yoginis asked for a pledge in return, namely, that if  any of the monks who succeeded Jinadatta as leader of the Kharatara sect  should come to Delhi, Ajmer, Bhrgukaccha, or Ujjain, the abodes of the yoginis,  then he should simply take food and then go, without staying the night. If,  however, he were to stay the night for some reason, then he should not take  food. With this stipulation, the yoginis went back to where they had come  from.  

Jinadatta Suri died at the age of eighty-four at Ajmer, where the lay com munity erected a funerary monument to commemorate him. Jinacandra Suri,  who had become a monk at the age of nine, had been personally installed by  Jinadatta as his successor at Vikramapura in 1149. He had a jewel in his head.  One day a powerful Nath yogi saw him and realized that the suri had only five  years to live. At a later time Jinacandra went to Delhi. The yoginis there said,  "He has ignored the command we gave to Jinadatta. Let us bewitch him." So  they came at night, but through the power of the Jain flag on the monastic  lodging house their witchcraft did not work. They then turned themselves into  mice and carried off the flag. Waking up, Jinacandra turned himself into a cat  and chased after them. However, they managed to bewitch him. In the morning  the teacher entered the death-fast and said to the layman Kocara, "There is a  jewel in my head. At the time of my cremation, put a bowl of milk near the  funeral pyre and the jewel will fall into it. Worship it at home and you will  gain unfailing wealth." But when Jinacandra died, Kacora forgot what he had 

238 PAUL DUNDAS  

told him to do. The Nath yogi, however, prepared a bowl of milk when the  cremation was taking place, got hold of the jewel, and went off with it. Kacora  saw this and argued with him, but the yogi would not give him the jewel.  

Jinapati Suri was appointed Jinacandra Suri's successor at the age of fourteen  by Acarya Jayadeva in 1167 at the village of Baweraka, where a great festival  was held by two laymen to celebrate the event. He had attained this rank not  long after becoming a monk as a boy. Jinapati then went off with five hundred  monks to the town of Hamsi in the vicinity of Himsar to the north of Delhi,  where the laypeople had gotten an image of the tirthahkara Parsva made and  had built a new temple to house it. At the time of the installation of the image,  the Nath yogi who had taken the magic jewel also came there. He knew that  Jinacandra had possessed magic power and wanted to see whether his pupil  Jinapati had it as well. To this end, he employed a spell to immobilize the  image that was near the temple so that it would not move from its position.  The yogi then challenged the Jains, saying, "I have immobilized the image. Let  your leader raise it up."  

At this, the senior monks became deeply despondent, for none of them had  any magic power, and as a result the installation of the image could not take  place. The laywomen, egged on by a nun, mockingly sang, "The new moon  doesn't shed strong moonlight, so what can this young teacher of ours know?"  Hearing this, Jinapati thought that his life was not worth living. But then he  looked at his surimantra yantra, with the "king of mantras" portion, three and  a half words in length, inscribed in the middle. He put it aside and recited the  mantra, at which Padmavats, the tutelary goddess associated with the tirthah kara Parsva, appeared to help him.  

In the morning, while the senior monks and preceptors were expounding  the scriptures, Jinapati went to the temple and played with the children who  surrounded him. The yogi once again announced that he had immobilized the  image. But then Jinapati threw magically consecrated powder on his head and  so immobilized the yogi in turn. The entire Jain community assembled and the  installation ceremony was carried out to the accompaniment of praise of the  power of its teacher, even though he was so young. The yogi said, "Let me go.  Have pity." Jinapati replied, "Hand over the jewel from my teacher's head that  you took in Delhi." The yogi did so and said, "My dear sir! Take this source  of magic. However, a spell of the sort I have employed with it only succeeds if  betel nut is used." Jinapati replied, "We Jains are not allowed to chew betel  nut, because it is the equivalent of flesh. I do not care whether the spell is  successful or not." Then the yogi spat betel nut from his mouth and said,  "Worker of magic spells! Go back to the underworld where you came from.  There is nobody else in this world who can possess you." And the jewel, the  source of magic, went straight to the underworld. 

### 14 Longchenpa and the Possession of the Dakinis  

David Germano and Janet Gyatso  

Lay communities of itinerant yogins and yoginis have been a vital dimension of  Tibetan Buddhist culture from at least the ninth century onward. These com munities were almost always irreducibly Tantric in character, in their ritual and  contemplative practices, their textual traditions, and the very structure of their  communal life. Although much of our information about early Tantric Buddhist  . communities in India and Tibet is fragmentary and heavily mythologized, detailed  biographical and historical narratives that emerged in in later centuries in Tibet  give a fuller portrayal of the nature of these communities, and afford us a glimpse  of actual male-female relationships. We have chosen to translate a depiction of  the fourteenth-century Tibetan saint Longchenpa's (Klong chen pa, 1308-1363)  ritual empowerment of a group of Tibetan yogins and yoginis into esoteric Tantric  practices. The action portrayed here occurred in the spring of 1339. The work is  signed by Longchenpa himself in the colophon and is specifically referred to as  his composition in his own catalogue to The Seminal Quintessence of the Dakinis,  which is the larger cycle of his texts in which it is found. It refers to him through 

out in the third person, however, usually calling him "the lama"; it is possible  that the text was actually recorded by a disciple on the basis of Longchenpa's oral  autobiographical account, or that Longchenpa actually wrote it in the third per son, a practice not unknown in this period of Tibetan autobiographical writing;  or, finally, that the text was recorded by a disciple some time after the events  reported in it. Whatever the case, it seems fair to conclude that the basic sequence  of events reported, at least in their bare outer appearance, in fact occurred, and  that the interpretations offered were current in the early community of Long chenpa's followers. This exceptional narrative offers much to ponder with regard  to the social dynamics of an esoteric Tantric community, to claims that were made  regarding the production of sacred Tantric scriptures, and to the transic practices  in which members of the community engaged, and which yielded extraordinary  performances that were then interpreted within the context of an elaborate system  of Tantric beliefs. 

240 DAVID GERMAN O AND JANET GYATSO  

The broader Tibetan Tantric Buddhist movements within in which Longchenpa  and his disciples participated are at least three in number. One consists of what  was by then the standard set of Indian and Tibetan scriptures and practices sur rounding the Tantric practice of deity yoga: the procedures in which people vi sualized themselves as Tantric deity/buddrta figures and participated in what was  thought to be those figures' experience. Another is the Seminal Heart or Nyingthik  (snying thig) form of the Great Perfection (rdzogs-chen) movement, which is a  Tibetan syncretic Tantric tradition consisting of Chan-like practices of formless  meditation combined with exercises that cultivated spontaneous visions of bud dhas. The third salient tradition that informs the account translated below is called  Treasure (gter ma). A few comments concerning this uniquely Tibetan Tantric  tradition of scriptural revelation will aid in understanding the distinctive concep tions about personal identity, time, and sacred scripture that lie at the heart of  the activities in which Longchenpa engages in the narrative to follow.  

The Tibetan "Treasure discoverers" (gter ston) were part of a movement in Tibet  that had its origins in the tenth to eleventh century in Tibet, alongside other  movements centered on the figure of the lotsawa, or translator. The discoverers  were often exceptional yogins and teachers who revealed special texts and other  objects that, they maintained, had mainly been concealed in the eighth- and ninth 

century imperial period of Tibetan history for the express purpose of being re vealed at the "right time" in the future. Furthermore, a distinction was made  between "Earth Treasures" (sa gter) and "Mind Treasures" (dgongsgter), the former  being actual material manuscripts recovered from the earth and the latter being  visionary revelations with no physical substrate. Regardless of the modality, how ever, Treasures usually consist of collections of works, most of which contain  instructions for special forms of Tantric practice. As discussed below, Longch enpa, in addition to being a renowned academic scholar, was also intimately  involved in the revelation of Treasure. He inherited the two main streams of  Treasure scriptures of the Seminal Heart - among the most important products  of early Treasure revelations, which derived from the eighth-century Indic saints  Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava, respectively - and went on to produce new  revelations that extended both and integrated them into a single stream. In es sence, the events that Longchenpa describes here trace out the process of how he  first came into possession of new Padmasambhava revelations entitled The Seminal  Heart of the Dakinis, and then gradually came to reveal - in a very distinctive  manner - his own exegetical revelations, entitled The Seminal Quintessence of the  Dakinis. This process most notably involved a series of encounters with women  who were understood to be possessed by certain Indic and Tibetan deities and  humans, all of whom play critical roles in authorizing Longchenpa's involvement  with these past and future revelations of the dakinis.  

Treasure discoverers typically display doubts about whether they are the person  who has been prophesied to reveal the Treasures that they have found, and  Longchenpa is no exception. He repeatedly checks the identity of his spiritual  informants to determine if they are indeed the rightful "protectors" of the Trea-LONGCHENPA AND THE DAKINIS 241  

sure. Most centrally, he asks questions about his own identity and prophesied  destiny. One of the main reasons why Treasure revealers like Longchenpa talk  about their self-doubt is precisely to demonstrate their care and caution in as suming the exalted role of scripture revealer. Many sectors of Tibetan Tantric  society had grave concerns about the validity of the Treasure tradition as a whole,  to say nothing of the authenticity of any particular individual's claim to have  found such ancient materials. Even in Tibetan society, in which most persons  firmly believed in reincarnation, many were skeptical of the claim that someone  could recall a special teaching that they had been entrusted - by a master such  as Vimalamitra, or more often, the "Precious Guru" Padmasambhava (circa 800  C.E.) - to bring to light five hundred years hence, in a future lifetime. Padmasam 

bhava is the Indian Tantric master who introduced Tantric Buddhism to Tibet,  and who is the source credited with of most of the Treasure texts in Tibet. Critics  went so far as to doubt that figures such as Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra  would have ever designated and then concealed special materials for future rev 

elation in the first place. It is important to remember that such critics of the  Treasure tradition were in many ways acting to protect the claims to legitimacy  of their own Tantric corpora. The Treasures were probably often formulated pre cisely as an alternative to the more mainstream Tibetan Tantric materials that  were transmitted in the large monastic institutions of central Tibet. In many ways,  then, we can understand that the situation in Tibetan Tantric religion in which  Longchenpa was participating was a conflict between Tantric corpora - between  the mainstream canonical Tantric texts and their commentaries and ritual cycles  and those introduced through the more unconventional modes of the Treasure  tradition.  

The Visionary Autobiography  

It is because of the Treasures' controversial claims of origins that their discoverers  often wrote detailed accounts, like the one by Longchenpa translated here, of  their individual odysseys to revelation. Often written as glorified diaries with  precisely recorded dates, the detailed events reported in such autobiographical  works served to "engender confidence" in the authenticity of the revelatory pro 

cess, and to convince their readers that the protagonists were in fact not the  charlatans that everyone, even the Treasure proponents themselves, believed  many so-called Treasure discoverers to be. Among the principal events that such  autobiographical accounts report - and again, we see many examples in the pres 

ent account - are the visions of the original concealers of the Treasure, including  Padmasambhava, his Tibetan consort Yeshe Tsogyel (Ye shes mtsho rgyal), and  other masters. Many of Longchenpa's encounters with local deities such as Remati  and Vajra Turquoise Lamp (rDo rje g.yu sgron ma) also attest to the authenticity  of the discoverer and the Treasure he is purporting to introduce, for such deities  are said to have been appointed to protect the Treasure during the period of its 

242 DAVID GERMAN O AN D JANET GYATSO  

interment, and to assist the appointed discoverer in locating it at the proper  moment. It is in this context that we are to understand the many passages in  which such deities speak directly to Longchenpa and give him information con cerning the history of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis as well as his own rela tionship to that history in the past, present, and future.  

Another type of experience that is typically reported in Treasure "autobiogra phies" such as this is the attainment of special Tantric meditative states. This  connected with one of the other principal Tantric founts of Longchenpa's expe rience, the Great Perfection tradition. States of Great Perfection insight might be  reported in any work of the "secret autobiography" genre; but the relevance of  these experiences to the Treasure narrative lies in the fact that Treasure discovery  is in fact closely related to those states themselves. Experiences akin to "the rain bow colored visions of radiant light" frequently referred to here are often singled  out as having been salient in that past moment in which the discoverer-to-be  originally had the Treasure implanted in this deep level of consciousness. That  initial concealment was made in a highly encoded form, which would have been  both covert and durable enough to remain in deep memory over many lifetimes  until the time for revelation was at hand. In order, then, to bring out the Treasure  in its fully unfolded form in that future moment, the discoverer needs to gain  access to that deep state of consciousness again; hence, his ability to realize such  states of consciousness serves to demonstrate that he is a person capable of re vealing a Treasure.  

The reader should also bear in mind the extent to which the Treasure tradition  is dependent upon the more general Tibetan belief that humans can be emana tions, or even reincarnations (tulkus; sprul sku), of past Buddhist masters. In  general, the buddhas' and bodhisattvas' mastery of the Buddhist principle of emp tiness is thought to allow them self-consciously to manifest "emanations" (sprul  pa) to different parts of the cosmos, in the service of the Buddha's teachings. In  the Tibetan Buddhist world, there is a more specialized belief that historical figures  who were religious masters could also reincarnate deliberately in the right place  and time to accomplish particular compassionate goals. These ideas underlie the  Tibetan institution of the tulkus, a word that literally means "the emanated body  of a buddha," but which in practice refers to the person who is discovered through  the distinctive practice of seeking out the young reincarnation of a recently de ceased saint, in order that that child be "reinstalled" in the religious community  that the old master had left behind. Alternately - and this is the case in the  selection translated here - adults can claim such a mantle for themselves later in  life. Thus we witness Longchenpa reincarnationally recreate himself before our  eyes, or at least before the eyes of the dakini.  

It is usually said that other "secondary conditions," beyond the discoverer's  mastery of the succession of his or her lives and memory of the one in which the  Treasure was first received, also contribute to the discovery of Treasure scriptures.  The discoverer will often be granted certain props, such as a fragment of a text  buried in the ground, or even a fascicle of writing handed to him in a dream. 

LONGCHENPA AND THE pAKINIS 243  

Once such materials are in hand, the discoverer is often unable to understand  them or decode them from their encrypted form. Advanced Tantric teachings and  practice are said to be necessary for one to be fully qualified to codify the main  Treasure scriptures, compose the necessary commentary texts, transmit the cod 

ified scriptures in a ritual Tantric empowerment, and finally teach their content  in detail. At an even more esoteric level, discoverers are often said to engage in a  form of sexual consort yoga as a means of accessing the necessary states of mind  for Treasure revelation and decoding. Although such practices are not referred to  explicitly in this text, it is quite possible that Longchenpa engaged in them during  the period he is reporting. In this context we should also understand the active  role of yoginis, who are possessed by female deities. These members of the larger  Tantric retreat community in which Longchenpa wrote and taught during the  years reported here seemed especially gifted for channeling the spirits of the  Treasure protectors and communicating their intimate messages, in esoteric form,  to the discoverer. In the account we read here, Longchenpa shows a certain dis dain for the revelation of Treasures out of the ground, and instead eventually  identifies his own authorial voice with the voice of his dakinl-mediated Treasure  inspiration. In other words, his extension of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis,  rather than being a revelatory core of other-voiced texts fleshed out by his own  compositions, reflects an inseparable unity of personal intention and transcendent  inspiration, a subject to which we shall return.  

The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis  

Beyond the general role of the feminine in Treasure revelation, The Seminal Heart  of the Dakinis, the tradition that Longhcenpa is engaged with here, has much to  do with the particular feminine roles. This is patent in the work's title: dakini is  an Indic term, translated by the Tibetan term Kandroma (mkha' 'gro ma), which  means "one who goes in space." It signifies a female spirit who can either be a  transcendent buddha or a vengeful demoness; in addition, the word can also  signify an historical female saint in Tibet. Seminal Heart is the name for a syncretic  Tantric tradition that came to be the most normative variant of the Great Perfec tion. What The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis Treasure did, in fact, was to bring a  greater focus, in its meditative practices, on the distinctively Tantric practice of  sexual yoga as integrated with the Seminal Heart. The latter include the belief in  dynamically active buddhas within the ordinary body which, when cultivated,  flow spontaneously out through the eyes and into the surrounding visual field.  As the rainbow-colored light gradually shapes itself of its own accord into man dates, the practice culminates in visions of pure lands.  

The Seminal Heart literature prior to Longchenpa consisted of three major  collections, all of which emerged, between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries  and through the revelatory processes of the Treasure movement, as Tibetan-lan guage literature. They are The Seventeen Tantras, The Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra, 

244 DAVID GERMAN O AND JANET GYATSO  

and the very The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis that is of principal concern in the  material translated below. The Seventeen Tantras are largely Tibetan syntheses, and  function as the primary texts upon which the other two collections are based. The  Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra is a three-volume collection that also contains a few  Tantras, but consists mostly of ritual, contemplative, and philosophical texts at 

tributed to Vimalamitra and other Indian teachers. Vimalamitra and his disciples  are said to have buried both The Seventeen Tantras and The Seminal Heart of  Vimalamitra as Treasure, where they remained until the late tenth or early eleventh  century, at which time their excavation began, a process that culminated in the  mid-twelfth century. It appears, however, that these texts were in fact largely  composed by their Tibetan discoverers themselves.  

In any event, the Seminal Heart tradition had little to do with Padmasambhava  until the early fourteenth century, when against the backdrop of the increasing  predominance of a larger revelatory cult organized around Padmasambhava, an  obscure Tibetan by the name of Tsultrim Dorje (Tshul khrims rdo rje, 1291- 

1315/1317) produced a two-volume collection known as The Seminal Heart of the  Dakinis. Although clearly indebted to its predecessors, its narrative frames claimed  that the collection had been authored by Padmasambhava in eighth-century Tibet  and concealed as Treasure by Padmasambhava's Tibetan consort Yeshe Tsogyel.  The important role of the Tibetan queen Yeshe Tsogyel in the burial of Treasure  is one of the reasons for which female consorts, not to mention female epiphanies,  play such an important role in the revelatory processes of the Treasure discoverers.  In particular, emanations of this supreme Tantric female consort are believed to  be essential in helping the discoverer decode the Treasure, since it was Yeshe  Tsogyel herself who encoded the Treasure in special "dakini sign-language" at the  moment of the Treasure's burial. Yeshe Tsogyel receives special attention in The  Seminal Heart of the Dakinis Treasure, inasmuch as it is she who originally re quested Padmasambhava to grant the many texts and teachings contained in this  Treasure.  

Another female figure in The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis is of paramount sig nificance for Longchenpa. This is the eighth-century Tibetan princess Lhacam  Pemasel (Lha lcam pad ma gsal) who, according to the story, died suddenly at  the tender age of eight in Samye Chimphu (bSam yas mchims phu), in the pres ence of both her father, the Tibetan Emperor Trisong Detsen (Khri srong lde'u  btsan, 742-c. 798) and Padmasamabhava. Padmasambhava explains to the griev ing emperor the karmic reasons for this sudden death - namely, her transgres sions of past lives - but then discloses that he has decided that the princess will  reveal his own Seminal Heart teachings in a future life. He proceeds to bring her  back to life in order to give her an initial transmission of those teachings: this is  The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis. Padmasambhava annoints her as Pema Ledreltsel  (Pad ma las 'brel rtsal), "The one with the Dynamism of a Karmic Connection to  Padma," That is, Padmasambhava.  

These events are central to the the fourteenth-century narratives of Tsultrim  Dorje, who claimed to be the prophesied reincarnation of the princess and thereby 

LONGCHENPA AND THE DAKlNIS 245  

the inheritor of the mantle of Pema Ledreltsel. However, following his stunning  revelations of 1313, when he was in his early twenties, Tshultrim Dorje himself  abruptly died under mysterious circumstances, in which an ill-fated sexual liason  with a woman and an inability to keep his Treasure revelations secret while he  mastered his own contemplative practice of their teachings were rumored to have  played a part. He left behind no institutional basis for the perpetuation of his  revelations, the first new Seminal Heart cycle in over a century. However, Long 

chenpa, following his reception of the older traditions of The Seminal Heart of  Vimalamitra in his early thirties, came into possession of this major Seminal Heart  work. How he came into possession of this cycle, the concomitant possession of  his female disciples by the dakinis who redacted, concealed, and guarded the  cycle, and Longchenpa's own eventual visionary extension of the tradition lie at  the heart of our story.  

Overview of the Translation  

The passages excerpted here mark Longchenpa's emergence as a teacher, trans mitter, and revealer of the Seminal Heart. When Longchenpa was in his late  twenties, Kumaraja, his principal lama, gave him an array of teachings that high lighted The Seventeen Tantras and The Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra. Longchenpa  followed these transmissions with a three-year period of retreat. At the opening  of our translated passage we find him emerging as a teacher of the Seminal Heart  in his own right, as he takes on a circle of disciples of his own. Not surprisingly,  he chooses the famous Chimphu Valley to inaugurate this new identity. Chimphu  is a retreat center in the mountains above Samye, the first Buddhist monastery in  Tibet, which also bears strong associations with Padmasambhava, who is believed  to have been instrumental in its construction. Samye was also the site of important  events relating to The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis, including the death and res surection of Princess Pemasel. Here Longchenpa began ritually to initiate a non monastic group of eight yogins and yoginis into the tradition of The Seminal Heart  of the Dakinis, after which he gave them detailed contemplative instructions on  the tradition's esoteric meditative system.  

Against the backdrop of these rituals, transmissions, and celebrations, Longch enpa and his disciples enter a spiritually excited state, which gives rise to a stream  of visions and states of possession in the group. The visions are often seen by  everyone present, but the possessions are performed exclusively by the women.  We can also note that the overwhelming majority of the visionary apparitions and  possessing spirits that enter into this exceptional milieu are female, whether they  be Buddhist goddesses, Dharma protectresses, or historical Tibetan women. The  possessions are characterized as the "descent" (babs) of the spirit into the yogini,  after which the latter begins to "perform" ('khrab) in the identity and voice of the  former.  

The first such spirit appears abruptly during an empowerment ritual. She iden-

246 DAVID GERMAN O AN D JANET GYATSO  

tifi.es herself as the Dharma protectress Ekajati, a famous wrathful female figure  particularly associated with the Seminal Heart tradition. Dharma protectresses are  generally depicted as indigenous spirits wrathfully subjugated by Padmasambhava  or other masters, both to prevent them from hindering Buddhist activities and to  bind them into the ongoing service and defense of Buddhism. They therefore have  a hybrid nature that retains traces of their origins in the violent and unpredictable  nature of certain older, non-Buddhist spirits, now reinterpreted in Buddhist eth ical terms. Indeed, such protectresses are often viewed as emanations of buddhas  or bodhisattvas, with their ferocity subliminated into a kind of playful creativity,  as we see here repeatedly. Ekajati chides Longchenpa on the quality of his per 

formance of the ritual, imparting nuanced revisions of the master's teachings and  actions. The other disciples present are skeptical and taken aback by the yogini's  daring actions before their respected guru, but he reassures them that she is  indeed possessed by an authentic and enlightened spirit, and also that he himself  has the knowledge and charisma to keep the performance under control. The  episode marks an important breakthrough for the small community, as its mem 

bers begin to recognize the special insights and information that these possessed  women are able to offer their teacher. These positive results reinforce the value  of what might otherwise have been viewed as dangerous - or inauthentic - trance  states.  

The next possession episode provides even more crucial information. A yoginl  is taken over by Vajra Sow (rDo rje phag mo, in Tibetan, Vajravarahl in Sanskrit),  one of the most famous Buddhist Tantric buddhas and Longchenpa's own per sonal deity. Vajra Sow tells him about the other Tibetan spirits bound into the  service of Longchenpa's teachings who have come to visit him as well, and also  reassures him about the current state of health of his teacher Kumaraja. She then  settles into an extended dialogue with him concerning his true identity. She begins  by revealing that Longchenpa's teacher, Kumaraja, is one of the prophesied cen tennial emanations of Vimalamitra in Tibet, which implies that Longchenpa had  received The Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra from Vimalamitra himself, in reincar nate form, just a few years earlier. Still more dramatically, she goes on to disclose  that Longchenpa is none other than the contemporary reincarnation of Tsultrim  Dorje, who was in turn the reincarnation of Princess Lhacam Pemasel, who had  originally received, from Padmasambhava, the very Seminal Heart teachings  Longchenpa now is transmitting. She thus identifies him as the principal heir and,  in fact, the original revealer of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis, the second great  stream of the Seminal Heart. As a consequence, she gives him the prophesied  names Drime Ozer (Dri med 'od zer) and, by extension, Pema Ledreltsel (Pad ma  las 'brel rtsal). The former, literally "Stainless Light Rays," comes to be one of  Lonchenpa's most important authorial names invoked in colophons, while the  latter, literally "The One with the Dynamism of a Karmic Connection to  Padma(sambhava)," is employed throughout Longchenpa's own subsequent com mentary, entitled The Seminal Quintessence of the Dakinis.  

Vajra Sow then discusses his present lifespan and his future lifetimes and Trea-

LONGCHENP A AND TH E DAKINI S 247  

sure revelations, and gives critical instructions on when, where, and by what  means the revelations would transpire. This passage thus works to accomplish a  momentous feat, namely, the recreation of Longchenpa into a authorized revealer  and teacher of the esoteric Seminal Heart of the Dakini, who in a future life would  attain buddhahood in the sacred land of Oddiyana to the west of Tibet. It should  be recalled that all of this self-transformation takes place in the very valley where,  in a distant past life, the subject in question had already been resurrected and  blessed as a dakini him/herself by Padmasabmhava.  

These grand claims, however, are undermined by two seeming contradictions,  which actually are noted by Longchenpa himself: Tshultrim Dorje's death date  (1315/1317) seems to have come after Longchenpa's birth date (1308), and the  prophecies in the Treasure cycle itself indicate that Tsultrim Dorje's next rebirth  will be in Bhutan, whereas Longchenpa was born in southern Tibet. As the passage  proceeds, we see the dakini ingeniously solving these problems. Her strategy turns  on a skillful interpretation of a seemingly irrelevant detail in the prophecy,  namely, that Tsultrim Dorje would, prior to rebirth, spend a "brief sojourn in a  pure land." This would seem to indicate that the few years' gap separating the  saint's death and rebirth would have been passed in a buddha's pure land outside  of the ordinary world system. The dakini, however, interprets the statement as  referring to Longchenpa's own life, in which he is immersed in visions of Buddhist  pure lands through his contemplative practice of the Seminal Heart. This renders  the prophesied Bhutanese rebirth as one yet to come. As for the incongruous  death date of Tsultrim Dorje, she exploits the obscurity of his life to push his  death date back by eight or ten years to 1307, just in time to coincide with the  conception of Longchenpa. This passage ends with Longchenpa in a state of in spiration, singing a Tantric song about the interior reality of the five Tantric  buddhas.  

The next major episode of possession involves a distinctively Tibetan Dharma  Protectress by the name of Vajra Turquoise Lamp (rDo rje g.yu sgron) who, again,  descends into a female disciple of Longchenpa. She first invites him to her domain,  which refers to the retreat place of White Skull Snow Mountain (Gangs ri thod  dkar) to which he would eventually repair and compose most of his major works.  The two then discuss various doctrinal and meditational points, reiterating the  nonconceptual, immediate, and even "nonmeditational" nature of the kind of  enlightened realization most valued in the Seminal Heart tradition. They also  review a range of pedagogical problems that relate to the transmission of certain  esoteric Tantric empowerments. She further reminds Longchenpa of a former  vision he had had of her, revealing that in reality she is Vajra Sow who has only  temporarily taken the form of Vajra Turquoise Lamp; in this way, this local Ti betan deity becomes identified with the famed Indic Buddhist goddess.  

In the course of their conversation, Longchenpa critically displays anxieties  about his own qualifications and about the necessity of teaching the Seminal Heart  at all: the teaching had already bean transmitted by one of the most famous  tulkus of the time, the third Karmapa Rangjung Dorje (Rang byung rdo rje, 1284-

248 DAVID GERMAN O AN D JANET GYATSO  

1339), as well as by a well-known Treasure finder Rinchen Lingpa (Rin chen gling  pa, 1295-1373). The deity again bolsters Longchenpa's sense of confidence. She  immediately dismisses his doubts, making a clever pun based on the dual sense  of lung as both "handle" of a vessel and "verbal transmission" in which a teaching  is ritually read out loud to disciples prior to its study. She thus implies that  Longchenpa's two perceived rivals are simply mouthing the words of the texts  without real comprehension - they are mere "handles" of a reality that only  Longchenpa fully "owns." Thus does the yogini, speaking in the voice of the  dakini, play a crucial role in reinforcing Longchenpa's sense of legitimacy and  self-worth for the throne of Seminal Heart transmission.  

Soon after this self-empowering exchange, Longchenpa commissions his most  trusted disciple, Ozer Gocha ('Od zer go cha), to retrieve the actual manuscript  of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis Treasure. Upon his return with the text, we  have another extensive possession episode that endures for several days, this time  by none other than Yeshe Tsogyel, the queen of Treasure concealment and the  principal dakini of the Treasure tradition. As on the previous possession, the  yogini-as-dakim intervenes in some of the ritual proceedings, at one point even  granting teachings and empowerments to the teacher, and engages in mysterious  symbolic actions and performances that are meant to impart an esoteric message  to her audience. She also reiterates the essential importance of nonattachment  and openness, pronouncing phat, a mantric utterance designed to cut off obsessive  thinking whenever such small-mindedness occurs. Again, the more cautious dis ciples are not sure how to take these strange and supremely self-confident female  performances, but the lama Longchenpa assures the doubting disciples of the  performances' worth.  

The inspired yogini proves her prescient powers in the next episode when she  is able to give a nuanced assessment of a deep meditative experience that Long chenpa has just had. She approves heartily of his perception - classic for this  school of Tantra - that beholds the apparitions of samsara and the visions of  nirvana simultaneously. Nonetheless, she is critical of a previous moment in his  experience when he had momentarily swooned. With its insistence on the ne cessity of engaging with all appearance, the Great Perfection tradition repeatedly  resists the temptation to retreat into a near-unconscious cocoon of formless medi tation. Rather, the meditator is advised to perfect the skill of "emanation" in order  to work most effectively in samsara and aid sentient beings.  

This esoteric guidance is followed by further ritual interventions and attempts  to bolster Longchenpa's self-confidence. There are a number of explicit references  to the dakini authorizing and announcing his enthronement or investiture as the  regal inheritor of Padmasambhava's legacy. She offers him the texts of The Seminal  Heart of the Ddkinis (evidently the copy that Ozer Gocha has just procured), along  with its transmission, though presumably in a somewhat condensed manner. In  addition, she is portrayed as guiding his hand, with help of Vajra Turquoise Lamp,  as he composes some explanatory notes associated with the Treasure, which  would appear to be an allusion to the seminal inspiration which at the end of the 

LONGCHENP A AND TH E DAKINI S 249  

text yields his own masterly extension of the Treasure entitled The Seminal Quin tessence of the Dakinis.  

In the next episode of possession, we witness the kind of repartee that often  ensues between the sometimes unruly protector deities and the Tantric lama.  Remati is another female guardian deity who descends, yet again, into an unspe cified yogini disciple, this time with a retinue of other female deities. She begins  by rebuking Longchenpa for his supposed lapses in devotion to her. However,  he eventually responds with a defiant dismissal of any need to be fully dependent  upon her. It appears that he is beginning to assimilate the messages of encour agement he has been receiving, and is no longer willing to value every channeled  message sent to him, especially those sent by less than fully trustworthy local  protector deities. Particularly interesting in this light is his explicit criticism of the  unqualified valorization of Treasures - particularly the material Treasures pulled  out "of the cracks of rock mountains" - and his claim to transcend any concern  for their revelation by himself, since he has "revealed the gateway to the Treasure  of radiant light within myself." This is a critical moment in which we witness not  only his own growing self-confidence in the face of these imposing dakinis who  descend suddenly into his world (and depart just as abruptly) but also his asser 

tion of his own authorial voice and its intrinsic value amidst the dramatic land scape of Treasure revelation and the channeling of sacred voices of the past.  

The final episode translated here shows the Tantric community engaged in the  celebratory rituals that are appropriate to the conclusion of a profoundly mean ingful retreat period. With the playfully magical assistance of Longchenpa, they  produce the customary pints of beer out of their meager resources and proceed  to become inebriated. In the midst of the festivities, Turqoise Lamp returns to  invite Longchenpa to her residence on White Skull Snow Mountain, and he has  to hold off the jealous intervention of Remati, who also reappears to take issue  with his impending move to that mountain retreat. Her dangerous nature is re vealed when she admits to taking a toll on the livestock of the northern Tibetan  pasturelands as her deserved tithe, but this unpredictable spirit nonetheless re mains part of the protective organization of Longchenpa's Treasure pantheon.  

The community begins to part company, many fulfilling Longchenpa's wishes  by promising to go into meditative retreat. The narrative also refers to certain  violations and disturbances caused by at least one member of the lama's circle  from eastern Tibet, but provides no detail on their nature. Longchenpa proceeds  to White Skull Snow Mountain located in the headlands of Shukseb, on the col  of which he builds his small hermitage, named Oddiyana Fortress (U rgyan  rdzong). This is to become his most favored hermitage, and he retreats there  continually over the final two and half decades of his life to write many of his  greatest masterpieces. Shortly after establishing the hermitage, at the urging of  the devoted Ozer Gocha, Longchenpa composes his own textual extension of The  Seminal Heart of the Dakinis, which brings to fruition the fragmentary inspirations  and multiple allusions to his own impending Treasure revelation that one finds  woven through his dialogues with dakinis at Chimphu. The seminal insights of 

250 DAVID GERMAN O AN D JANET GYATSO  

Chimphu thus become the three volumes of The Seminal Quintessence of the Dakinis  at White Skull Snow Mountain.  

Although the text's composition takes place amid a continuing flow of visions  and omens stemming from the dakinis, and represents the culmination of the  dakinis' and Padmasambhava's inspirations conveyed in the numinous headlands  of Chimphu, Longchenpa's account leaves no doubt that it is his own composi 

tion. Indeed, colophon after colophon of The Seminal Quintessence of the Dakinis  uses the language of Treasure revelation, but ultimately clearly ascribe its com position to Longchenpa himself, albeit in his reincarnational identity as Pema  Ledreltsel, "the one with the dynamic karmic connection to Padmasamabhava."  Unlike his previous life's revelations, which involved earth Treasures attributed  repeatedly in framing narrative and colophon to the literal authorial agency of  Padmasmabhava and Yeshe Tsogyel, Longchenpa in his present life discloses the  same bravado and self-assertion he had increasingly exhibited in the headlands  of Chimphu, in a literary form. He is the Treasure revealer and the author, thereby  incarnating a moment in which revelation and inspiration, reincarnation and in carnation, Treasures and compositions coincide on shifting registers. Never be fore, and perhaps never again, was the Tibetan Treasure tradition of channeled  authorial voices so exquisitely invoked and deconstructed, simultaneously, in the  same voice and the same texts. This multivalent identity, on authorial grounds,  of the possessed and the possessor constitutes the textual landscape on which  Longchenpa perhaps most adequately responds to the enigmatic possessions of  the dakinis, the result being a text of intertwined voices, human and dakini, past  and present, Tibetan and Indian, which mirrors the intertwining of dakini and  yogini at Chimphu.

in Treasure tradition. Janet Gyatso's Apparitions of the Self: The Secret Autobiogra phies of a Tibetan Visionary (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1998) provides  analysis of the significance of the Treasure cult, especially within the context of  autobiographical writing in Tibet. David Germano's Prophetic Histories of Buddhas,  

Dakinis and Saints in Tibet (Princeton: Princeton University Press, forthcoming)  offers a detailed study of the events surrounding the revelation of both The Seminal  Heart of the Dakinis and The Seminal Quintessence of the Dakinis, and their broader  social and philosophical significance.  

All but one of the literary collections referred to in the introduction are found  in The Seminal Heart in Four Parts (sNying thig ya bzhi) by miscellaneous authors  in eleven volumes (New Delhi: Trulku Tsewang, Jamyang and L. Tashi, 1971).  The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis (mKha' 'gro snying thig) by Padmasambhava con stitutes volumes 2-3; The Seminal Quintessence of the Dakinis (mKha' 'groyang thig)  

by Longchenpa constitutes volumes 4-6; and The Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra  (Bi ma snying thig) by Vimalamitra and other early Great Perfection Masters, vol umes 7-9. Finally, The Seventeen Tantras (rGyud bcu bdun) has been published in  a three-volume edition based on the Adzom Drukpa blocks (New Delhi: Sanje  Dorje, 1973).  

The Luminous Web of Precious Visions  

At the age of twenty-seven, [Longchenpa] encountered the glorious lord of  religion Kumaraja, from whom he obtained the empowerments, guidances, and  instructions for the esoteric Seminal Heart of the Great Perfection. The next  year [Kumaraja] gave him the seal of entrustment for the higher empower 

ments, along with their Tantras, scriptures, and esoteric precepts. [Long chenpa] then practiced contemplation for three years. At the age of thirty-one  he decided to leave at the conclusion [of the retreat]. At that time a traveler to  Nyiphu Shukseb (sNyi phu shug gseb) came to see him, and he was supplicated  by many disciples with the right fortune. Hence he gave them guidance on the  Seminal Heart of the Great Perfection. At that time the yogin Ozer Gocha  offered the lama a totally intact manuscript of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis,  which he had obtained after great hardships from Loro (Lo ro). [Longchenpa]  dreamt at the same time that the goddess Vitality Accomplishing Mistress (Srog  sgrub ma) hand-delivered the manuscript [to him].  

Then at the age of thirty-two in the following year, in the middle spring  month of the year of the earth female hare [ 1339], [Longchenpa] began giving  instruction in the esoteric Seminal Heart of the Great Perfection to eight male  yogins and female yoginis with the right fortune in the forest of Rimocen (Ri  mo can) at Chimphu valley. Upon the descent of blessings during his perfor 

mance of the nonelaborate empowerment, the glorious and great Mantra Pro tectress [Ekajatl] descended into on&of the yoginis, and she began to perform.  When everyone else became full of doubt, the lama said, "Because a dakini has 

252 DAVID GERMAN O AN D JANET GYATSO  

actually descended here [in her], get over your worries! I am a yogin who has  realized the single flavor of appearances and mind, and thus no obstacles will  ensue!"  

The yogini prostrated to the lama, and having gazed at the offering cakes,  she inquired, "Why haven't you included'the peacock [feather?]" He replied,  "I have conjured it mentally!" She in turn said, "What use is doing it mentally  in the symbolic doctrine? [that is, one needs the actual object to function as a  symbol in these teachings]. [Also] this [basin] isn't necessary." She then put  aside the basin from the platform atop the vases, and placed there three vases  linked together. Then when the lama performed the ritual in full detail, she  joined her palms together, said "excellent!" and kept nodding her head [in  approval]. But when [Longchenpa] left off the final letters in pronouncing the  word rigs, she said, "No, no! You should say rigs!" When he was reciting the  [mantra] letters - Om and so forth - she said, "Imitate me!" and proceeded to  sing the mantras in a sweet melody in Dakini language, connecting them with out mixing them up.  

During the eight words in the context of the main phase [of the ritual], she  made restitution for the omission of no-meditation, singing it as a song: "When  the intellect is free from meditation, joy! When meditation is free from the  intellect, how happy!" Saying that the offerings were of poor quality, and more 

over that nothing would ensue by means of them, she again sang a sweet  melody as an offering. When a large bowlful of ambrosia was presented to the  lama at the time of the ritual communion (ganacakra), she said, "This is the  sacrament of the dakinis, and thus must be relied upon no matter what!" She  thus invited him to consume all of it without remainder.  

At this time the yogin Rinchen Otro (Rin chen 'od 'phro) also saw the blue black Glorious Savior (dPal mgon po) with his complete set of ornaments.  Then special blessings of the dakinis occured right up until daybreak. There upon, until [Longchenpa began] the guidance [in the morning], the yogins  and yoginis sang and danced in a state of intense exhilaration. Their experi ences blazed with cognitive experiences of bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality,  all day and night. They entered a special visionary state that was neither asleep  nor awake.  

[The intervening passages describe further visions of various dakinis and other figures  who appear on the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth of the lunar month.]  

After a while [still on the twenty-fifth], one yogini also saw gathering cloud  banks of dakinis showering all over the land and space. Therefore [we] dedi cated the cakes of the feast offering to them. Then after a while, that yogini  was shaking her long tresses and had the experience of Vajra Sow with a dark  blue-colored body filling up the sky and then dissolving into [her]. Then she  began to perform [as the goddess].  

She said: "Its coming, its coming." [We] asked: "What is coming?" She re-

LONGCHENPA AND THE DAKINIS 253  

plied "Tomorrow morning obstacles are coming; if not then there will be many  high guests." [We] asked, "Who has come?" She replied: "The seven medicinal  goddess (sman mo) sisters have come. They are white, youthful in complexion,  wearing multicolored silk garments adorned with various gold, turquoise, and  jeweled ornaments, and are surrounded by immeasurable medical goddesses  as retinue. There are still more to come. Ode Gungyel ('0 de gung rgyal) has  come surrounded by many retainers similar in appearance - a black man with  a black horse, black cloak, black spear, and with his long hair forming a turban  wrapped around his head. There are still more to come. Nyenchen Thanglha  (gNyan chen thang lha) - a white man with white horse, and surrounded by  many similar retainers is here. Offer them torma!" [We] offered them torma.  

Then the yogini said, "I have come here newly - why don't you offer me a  torma?" [The lama] asked, "Who are you?" She replied, "I am the lama's per sonal deity, Vajra Sow." At that time [the lama] asked everyone, "What do you  see her as?" The yogin Ozer Thaye explained that he saw a dark blue woman  larger than the others, adorned with bone, and adorned by nets of jewels and  bones.  

Then the lama asked her, "Why have you come here? Is [my] holy lama  [Kumaraja] healthy?" The yogini replied, "Since tonight is a wild night, I have  come to spy on these karmically worthy disciples. Your lama is in excellent  health." [Longchenpa] then asked, "Well, if that's the case, since this year is a  dangerous point in his life, should we be worried?" She responded, "What  obstacles could there be to an emanation of the Buddha? It merely depends on  his perception of the needs of disciples. Don't you understand that [in him]  Vimalamitra has come to Tibet?" He then asked, "Then how long will he live?"  She replied, "He will live until the next year of the sheep. After that it is un certain, since [his life span ] depends upon his disciples."  

[Longchenpa] then asked, "Well, if that's the case, are you now urging me  [to act] for the welfare of others as the lama himself urged me to do [previ ously]?" She replied, "Yes, precisely!" He then inquired, "Should I stay in sol itude to accomplish the body of light, or bring benefit to sentient beings  through acting for the welfare of others? How much longer have I to live?" She  replied, "Though you could accomplish the body of light, you must benefit  sentient beings - much welfare to others will ensue. You will be able to live  for thirty more years beyond the present." At that point, the yogin Ozer Gocha  said, "Please stay for a long life!" The lama responded, "This dakini has no  obessive fixations - it may be that [my life span] can be calculated in terms of  days, months, and years, but I have no idea what that would be."  

Again, the lama questioned her, "How many Word Protectors (bka' srung)  do I have?" She replied, "Many! You have all of those of your lama, and in  particular Goddess Vajra Turquoise Lamp." He then inquired, "Where will I  benefit other beings?" She answered, "That will be in the southwest. To expand  on that, it will be in the areas of Dra(Grwa), Drachi (Grwa phyi), and Trengpo  ('Phreng po)." He asked, "Well, is it definite that I will benefit others?" She 

254 DAVID GERMAN O AND JANET GYATSO  

replied, "From this point onward much [benefit] will ensue. In your next life,  [you will bring] even vaster benefit than that to beings." [Longchenpa] asked,  "Where will my future life [transpire]?" She replied, "[Your activities] will be  very vast in the Lhodrak (Lho brag) region, and in the border areas between  Mon, Tibet, and India." He asked, "Will that be Mon Bumthang?" She replied,  "Precisely! The Guru is named Drimay Ozer." He then asked, "Is that [the  rebirth of Tshultrim Dorje] explained in The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis?" She  replied, "Yes, precisely! You're not mistaken at all!"  

He asked, "Well, if that's the case, am I now allowed to give the empower ments and guidance just as explained from The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis?"  She replied, "Since [these teachings] are yours, certainly!" He asked, "Won't  people come to see me as a charletan?" She replied, "What's the point in those  people's gossip? The fortunate ones will gather [around you] out of faith, while  those without the fortune wouldn't show up even if no one at all slandered  you. They would slander even the Buddha himself."  

I asked, "Well then, where should I disclose these sacred precepts of the  Seminal Heart? Should I disclose them at the site of the Goddess Vajra Tur quoise Lamp?" She replied, "Since this is a place where dakinis naturally gather,  you should disclose them up here." I asked, "Will I extract the Treasure at  Bumthang in this life?" She replied, "If you have three or four disciples with  exceedingly immaculate commitments, you will extract it." I asked, "Do I have  such disciples now?" She replied, "No. A Tantric practitioner named Karsang  who is slender and exceedingly beautiful will come. At that time you will  extract it."  

I asked, "And the Treasure letters?" She replied, "At that time a prophet will  manifest - you needn't ask." I asked, "And the rock moutains where the Trea sure is located?" She replied, "There are rock moutains on the eastern side near  the end of the valley where the central river in Bumthang flows to the south west. At their edge, at the border of the neck [of the mountains] running up  to its head [top], projecting outward like a sitar standing upright, there is some  swamp water coming hither. Atop that is [an outcropping] resembling a leaf  of a rhododendron flower. If you tie a rope to it and go twelve fathoms [up ward] , you'll find a square rock in the manner of a vessel. It has a triangular  crevice in its lower center, which is where [the Treasure] is."  

[Longchenpa] asked, "When will I meet the Great Master [Padmasam bhava] ?" She replied, "In the uplands of three valleys, in the lowlands of three  mountains, is a small rock formation facing southwest. Beneath the right corner  of the third rock mountain, you will meet him and he will give prophecies."  [He] asked, "When will I meet Vimalamitra?" She replied, "You have already  met him [i.e., Kumaraja]. [He] asked, "Does my realization reach the ultimate  meaning of the Seminal Heart?" She replied, "It is the ultimate."  

[He] asked, "What about other Treasures?" She replied, "In the northwest  border from here is an exceedingly high rock mountain - from its side resem bling spears' tips pointing upward in disarray, you will extract [Treasures]. But 

LONGCHENP A AND THE DAKINI S 255  

don't go there [now]." [He] asked, "Well, if that's the case, should or should I  not take out the Treasures of Tramo Rock Mountain in the east at present?"  She replied, "You have already taken them out [that is, The Seminal Heart of  the Dakinis, extracted in his previous incarnation]." The yogini Ozer Gocha  asked, "Where is Pagang Rinchen Dorje (sPa sgang pa rin chen rdo rje, another  name of Tshultrim Dorje)?" Saying "Pagang Rinchen," she was unclear for a  while. [He again] asked, "Master Rindor?" (sLob dpon rin rdor, a contraction  of Rinchen Dorje), and she replied: "Yes, yes. He is that one, he is sitting right  here." And she pointed her finger [at Longchenpa].  

The lama asked her: "It is said that after that birth he was to be reborn in  Bumthang. So how could that [rebirth] be me [since I was born instead in  southern Tibet]?" She replied, "[The prophecies say] that following that incar nation, he will be reborn in Bumthang after a brief sojourn in an Enjoyment  Body pure land, rather than being reborn directly there [in Bumthang]. Now  you [represent] that sojourn in an Enjoyment Body pure land." [He] re sponded, "Why do [you say] I now [represent] the sojourn in an Enjoyment  Body pure land?" She answered, "When Master Rindor took out the Treasures,  if he had kept them secret for several years and practiced, he would have refined  his skill [during that life] during a sojourn in a luminous Enjoyment Body  land for his own welfare, while benefit to others would have ensued through  the Seminal Heart teachings. Since in fact he didn't keep them secret, he wasn't  able to live out his full life span. Thus now in this birth your meditation and  practice of the rainbow-colored visions of radiant light should be understood  as that period of 'a brief sojourn in an Enjoyment Body pure land.' Others don't  understand how to interpret the intention of that statement, but in fact your  life right now is the intent of that prophecy."  

[Longchenpa] then asked, "At what point will I achieve [liberation] without  any remaining residue?" She replied, "If you meditate in solitude you will  achieve it in this current [life], whereas if you act for the welfare of others you  will be liberated within the [postdeath] intermediate state. Your emanation will  take rebirth in Bumthang, display many magical powers, and act for the welfare  of others. Then that emanation - surrounded by the five types of dakinis - will also depart to the land of Oddiyana, to the northwest of the Vajra Seat  (rDo rje gdan in Tibetan; vajrasana in Sanskrit) in Magadha, where he will act  as if becoming awakened into buddhahood."  

[He] asked, "Where did the Master Rindor die and how many years have  gone by?" She replied, "He died in Kek, since which thirty-two years have  passed [that is, 1307]." [He] asked: "Which Seminal Heart tradition will be  most beneficial for me to teach - The Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra or The  Seminal Heart of the Dakinis? And how long will each last?" She replied, "Both  will be beneficial, but the Vimalamitra will be more vast. The Vimalamitra will  last one hundred years, and the Dakini Seminal Heart will last five hundred  years, beginning from this year."  

At that time, she made prophecies concerning the lifespan and beneficial 

256 DAVID GERMANO AND JANET GYATSO  

actions of the [gathered] yogins and yoginis as well. After a while, the yogin  Ozer Thaye ('Od zer mtha' yas) had a vision of a white woman with multicol ored silk clothes, a silk turban, and adorned with gold and turquoises. He saw  her dissolve into the lama, who then stood up and said, "I will sing a previously  unknown vajra song." [Longchenpa] then "sang the following:  

I prostrate to and praise the Blissful One [Buddha] All Good consort  pair,  

Spontaneity which is primordially empty and originally pure!  

1. As the condition of reality which is Mind as such beyond all  elaboration,  

The very essence of the purity of ignorance right where it stands,  [Buddha] Vairocana exists internally, not externally - 

I supplicate the buddha affinity of the Blissful Ones:  

Inspire me with blessings to self-recognize as self-manifestations  The abiding reality of the unborn beyond all mental objects!  

2. As the mirror of the unceasing ground for the shining of awareness's  dynamism,  

The very essence of anger's liberation right where it stands,  [Buddha] Aksobhya exists internally, not externally - 

I supplicate the vajra affinity of the Blissful Ones:  

Inspire me with blessings to self-recognize as self-manifestations  The abiding reality of mentation in its empty radiance devoid of  grasping!  

3. As the sameness devoid of acceptance and rejection as well as  affirmation and negation,  

The very essence of the purity of pride right where it stands,  [Buddha] Ratnasambhava exists internally, not externally - I supplicate the jewel affinity of the Blissful Ones:  

Inspire me with blessings to self-recognize as self-manifestations  The sameness of abiding reality evenly pervading everything!  

4. As the complete realization of [all] subsiding in the expanse of bliss  and emptiness,  

The very essence of the purity of desire right where it stands,  [Buddha] Amitabha exists internally, not externally - 

I supplicate the lotus affinity of the Blissful Ones:  

Inspire me with blessings to self-recognize as self-manifestations  The abiding reality of dualistic apprehension subsiding in bliss and  emptiness.  

5. As the efficacious action of awareness's penetrating emergence and  self-liberation,  

The very essence of the purity of jealousy right where it stands, 

LONGCHENPA AND THE DAKINIS 257  

[Buddha] Amoghasiddhi exists internally, not externally - 

I supplicate the action affinity of the Blissful Ones:  

Inspire me with blessings to self-recognize as self-manifestations  The abiding reality of whatever manifests in its unceasing dynamic  flow.  

When dakinis deliver prophecies tonight  

On the tenth day of the waning half of the lunar month  

[A day in which the dakinis' influence is believed to be very strong],  This is a sign of the internal conjunction of auspicious factors  A sign of pure commitments among the faithful,  

A sign of the nonbiased emergence of welfare for the living,  

And a sign of traversing the ocean of cyclic existence!  

Joy! Happiness! A pure field,  

This world realm in its external environment of radiant light,  Is like arriving at the site of the Highest Heaven {'Og min, in Tibetan;  (Akanistha, in Sanskrit)  

With everything having the identity of gods and goddesses:  

I feel self-awareness transcends misery,  

I feel acceptance and rejection as well as affirmation and negation are  destroyed,  

I feel delivered from the treacherous path of hopes and fears,  

And I feel primordially free from the three fictive states of existence.  

Conceptuality in its projections and contractions subsides within the  five lights,  

And the visions of five lights subside into the primordial.  

Appearances and mind having the identity of the groundless Reality  Body,  

Even this life is blissful, the next life will be blissful,  

And through self-recognition, bliss will also be in the intermediate  state - 

Now I go from bliss to bliss.  

I offer this song as worship, O Three Jewels!  

Rejoice, O host of Dakinis!  

[Longchenpa] performed a dance, and then, after a while, up in the sky  opening, a red woman with jeweled ornaments manifested three times. Several  saw her and greeted her, after which she dissolved into the lama. When a white  woman also came in similar fashion and dissolved [into him], the entire land 

scape and space was seen to be filled with dakinis. . . .  

[Omitted sections describe the ensuing rituals and visions from the twenty-fifth through  the twenty-ninth of the lunar month, including many more dakinis as well as Padma-

258 DAVID GERMAN O AN D JANET GYATSO  

sambhava himself. This culminates in a yogim's vision of Padmasambhava and many  dakinis dissolving into Longchenpa, at which point he again sings a lengthy vajra song.]  

. . . The next day [the thirtieth] the yogins and yoginis in general saw im measurably many dakinis all over the sky. At twilight, the yogin Ozer Thaye  saw a woman with braided hair filling the sky, who said, "Present an offering  cake to me!" Then, after a while, everyone heard "kiki soso" ("hail," used in  addressing deities), roaring sounds, the sound of cymbals, thudding sounds,  and so forth, from all directions. After a while, [we] presented feast-offering  cakes, upon which the guests, who had previously manifested during the day time on the twenty-eighth, arrived.  

Rinchen Otro thus saw a dark blue woman dissolve into the crown of a  yogini, who then began to perform. The yogini [herself] saw the trio of the  Master Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra, and Yeshe Tsogyel arrive. At this time,  the seven white Turquoise Lamp goddess sisters arrived, wavering and modest.  Prostrating to the lama, each dissolved into the yogini, who then said, "I am  Vajra Turquoise Lamp, and I request you come to my place!" The lama re 

sponded, "I want to stay forever in your place." She replied, "I would be happy '  if you stayed [there] forever, but you won't even be able to stay beyond the  first winter month." He then asked, "What do you want with me?" She replied,  "Guru [Padmasambhava] bound me to an oath of allegiance, and hence I have  

come to look after his Treasure precepts." He inquired further, "[But] the pre cepts are yonder, and their revealer has passed away. So what are you doing  here?" She responded, "Though the precepts are yonder, their meaning is here.  Since your good fortune didn't pass away even after you passed away [in your  former incarnation], I have come."  

[Longchenpa asked], "How many Word Protectors do [these Treasures]  have?" She replied, "They have many. In particular, there is glorious Vajra Sow,  Black Vitality Accomplishing Mistress, Dark Red Harm Giver (gNod sbyin  dmar), and Vajra Turquoise Lamp. In addition, there are the Nine Divine Gen 

eration Siblings (lha rabs mched dgu), the Twelve Teaching Guardian goddesses  (bstan ma bcu gnyis), and the Dang deities (Idang lha)." [Longchenpa] followed  by asking, "How many people should be introduced to the guidance? How  many guidances are there to give?" She replied, "There are eleven [guidances;  she then specifies a total of twelve]. Since the first three are fraught with danger,  you should sequentially introduce three, four, and then five individuals to  them. The remaining nine [guidances] should be done for groups of seven  [disciples]. Since in general [these Treasures] are fraught with danger, they  could pose obstacles to your lifespan. If you give guidance on them only a little,  I would be happier." [Longchenpa] asked, "Do you have my Treasure scrolls?"  She replied, "They'll come slowly - we'll make sure to remind you!"  

Then, after a while, she asked, "Do you remember my granting you a spiritual  attainment on your head?" The lama responded, "When I was practicing medi tation at Cokla (ICog la), at daybreak one day a dakini with golden mail came.  She put a diadem on my head, thereby engendering a wonderful experiential 

LONGCHENPA AND THE DAKINIS 259  

realization in me. Was that you?" She answered, "Yes!" He asked, "Are you  Turquoise Lamp"? She replied, "No, no! I am Vajra Sow! Don't you recognize  me?"  

[Longchenpa] asked, "When the seminal nuclei (thig le in Tibetan; bindu in  Sanskrit) are explained as primary in this [system], the third empowerment is  conferred to one with a sexual partner - how is this?" She replied, "That is  intended for engaging those given to desire. It is conferred only mentally for  those without desire." He further inquired, "In the context of the introduction  [ritual], what is 'settling concepts into the unborn,' and 'settling mentality  beyond into the incalculable' all about?" She answered, "What can antidotes  do to conceptuality? Introduce them to the intention of the extremely expan sive matrix, which is primordially free!"  

Longchenpa asked, "Well, then, there are many explaining these Seminal  Heart [teachings] - what is the point of myself explaining them as well?" She  replied, "It is said that there are such figures as the Karmapa and Rinchen  Lingpa giving verbal transmissions (lung), but I don't like their explanations.  Even a clay pot has a handle (lung); how could that be sufficient? Because each  [pot] also has an owner, these [teachings] need one [as well]!" Longchenpa  further inquired, "How are the Treasures of Rinchen Lingpa?" She replied, "Of  course they exist, but they aren't pure or authentic." He then asked, "How is  it that I have actualized you without meditating upon you?" She answered,  "Am I simply a deity who must be meditated upon, a mantra to be recited, an  object of offerings? Don't you understand that I am always present for all yogins  and yoginis with intact commitments and realization? I have been in seamless  union with you in all your rebirths."  

Then [Longchenpa] inquired, "What does the location of Princess [Pema sel]'s wealth that is concealed in Chimphu look like?" She replied, "It is in a  flat area in a rock mountain that resembles an offering of divine foods. But the  time has not come for it yet." He then asked, "How long will it be until that  Treasure of Vimalamitra is extracted?" She answered, "Fifteen years from now,  it will be extracted by a white Tantric adept, who will translate them and spread  them. In it will be the four profound volumes, which will come into your  hands."  

Then on the first of the next month, he sent the yogin Ozer Gocha to get  the text [of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis]. When he was on the road back,  the tip of a rainbow touched and encircled the text. In particular, all the male  and female yogins saw it linked to Rimocen by a five-colored rainbow on the  night that he arrived at Chukpo ('Phyug po) rock mountain. In a dream of  Geshe Lorin (dGe bshes blo rin), a woman told him, "Though he is considering  departing to the border area, I must not allow it." On the ninth [Ozer Gocha]  escorted the texts [back]. That evening when [Longchenpa] was enjoying the  communal feast offerings after performing ritual confessions as part of fulfill ment rituals, a dakini descended. Saying, "The lama and disciples have con 

gregated for instruction," she performed many dances.  

Then on the tenth, many yogins and yoginis saw an even vaster gathering 

260 DAVID GERMAN O AN D JANET GYATSO  

of dakinis than before. During the day of the eleventh, when the earlier guid ance finished and the yogins and yoginis who were senior students were dis persing, Yeshey Tsogyel descended into one yogini. She gave voice to a lot of  dakini sounds. When a grand fire ceremony was done at twilight, she gave a  little siddhi [substance] one by one to some people, and then told them, "Don't  talk at all [and stay] to one side." [She] opened all the vessels and prepared  auspicious connections for the siddhi to descend, and [she] sequentially di rected all the siddhi substances to the lama. He said, "Great benefit to living  beings and sublime prosperity will ensue [from this]." The siddhi substances  were then carried to the lama's quarters, and dawn broke. When the sun rose,  and a yogin and yogini went outside to demarcate borders for a strict retreat,  

she [again] gave voice to various dakini sounds and danced.  Then on the twilight of the twelfth, she was contemplating opening the  gateway for these teachings, and performed all the dakini-empowerment sym bols with a skull cup, mirror, and vase. At that time, she taught the instructions  on the manifestation of all appearances and beings as luminous visions by  means of an introduction to the space of the female consort (yum mkha'). That  night the introduction to the fourth [empowerment] was born in the Lama's  heart for the first time. At that time, he asked, "What are these - the stars in  the sky and so forth?" She replied, "They are lamas who think they are gods,  and so forth." One person thought to himself that she was lying, but that  [despite this] whatever she did was permitted [by Longchenpa]. She acted in  the same way for all five senses [which were being evoked in this ritual intro duction] - in the context of sound, she strung a bell on her staff and beat it  on the ground, questioning insistently, "What do you hear it as? What is being  said?" Some voiced their doubts [about her] as before. [However], at that time  the lama himself obtained the introduction to [the realization that] all phe nomena are impossible to pinpoint as such; they appear in the manner that  they are imputed.  

During this, the yogini was able to read [everyone's] mind, and when they  became attached to mental states of faith and so forth, she said, Phat to the  demon of exultation! Phat to the demon of arrogance! Phat to the demon of  dualistic grasping!" and raised a great commotion. Everyone thus became  frightened and panicky. The Lama [however] understood all phenomena as  serving to refine his skill in being divested of presumptions and objectification,  and knew it as the mirror of realization. That night [he transmitted] the ritual  introduction into the way of gazing for the empowerment to primordial gnosis  and so forth. Similarly, she danced the next day and gave voice to a lot of  dakini sounds. At daybreak the next day, as the lama was sleeping, his mind  spaced out into radiant light: upward was the vision of original purity, in  between were clusters of Enjoyment Bodies, downward the modes of manifes tation of the six types of living beings; and he heard a variety of sounds and  languages. He was aware of all of this with his mind, yet it appeared devoid of  any coarse [substantiality]. The continuity of his ordinary memory and thoughtLONGCHENP A AND THE DAKINI S 261  

had become broken in the preceding moment, and he spaced out as if fainting  in a state of intense red vision with a blue tinge. Then his awareness projected  out into the coarser manifestations of spontaneity, and he spaced out within  the upper original purity, the intermediate Enjoyment Bodies, and the lower  Emanational Bodies. After a while, the yoginl came, and said, "That previous  [experience] was an introduction to remaining without ignorance [as every 

thing] dissolves into internal radiance within primeval original purity. The so called 'fainting' was a fainting within the state of reality, and hence you must  raise [yourself out of it.] The subsequent [experience] was an introduction to  the external radiance of emission of Emanational Bodies along with the manner  of gradually straying." Then many rainbow colors previously absent manifested  all over the sky in forms resembling the individual Word Protectors. When he  asked what they were, she replied, "It is those [Word Protectors themselves]."  When the sun rose, she gave an introduction to many different symbols and  their meanings.  

At noon, as the lama was sitting on the throne, [Yeshe] Tsogyel put three  layers of garments [on him], and said, "Everyone offer donations and prostrate!  Today [you] sons must be diligent!" When each [of the disciples] prostrated  and made offerings, she made prayers for immeasurable auspiciousness, and  the sky was filled with rainbow colors. At that point she said, "This type of sky  appears when a lama who is a spiritual guide who will accomplish vast benefit  for others is appointed to his religious seat of authority." When she gave the  lama some siddhi [substance], he asked, "What is this?" She replied by saying  such things as, "It is an ocean of glorious wealth! It is the spontaneous accom plishment of others' welfare!" He asked, "How many if they are counted?" to  which she responded by saying, "innumerable hundreds of thousands." Because  of these answers, [Longchenpa] said, "Sublime benefit will come to living be 

ings!" In the afternoon, holding [it] to the five clusters of guests [miniature  images of the five buddhas?], she hung a diadem of blue and red silk on the  lama's head as a crown, and performed an investiture of him with many aus picious verses. At twilight he made auspicious connections for the emergence  of sublime benefit for others. There was an intense commotion of dakinis after  the introduction, and so he asked, "Would such [manifestations] accompany  the opening up of any other dharma Treasure?"  

Just as the sun was about to arise during the subsequent introduction, he  saw in the sky above the facing mountain to the west a lion throne with a soft  seat of the finest silk, adorned with a backing curtain of delicate lattice designs,  decorated with a variety of jewels, and topped by a peacock canopy. The yoginl  said, "This is the throne of the great knowledge-holder Master [Padmasam 

bhava]. It is a sign that you should sit on it. Look at it further!" And when he  looked, he saw in all directions a great vision of the nature of the five [-colored]  lights adorned by seminal nuclei. "It is an apparition of the field of buddha  bodies and primordial gnosis," he said.  

Then when the lama was sitting on the throne at noon, [she] offered to him 

262 DAVID GERMANO AND JANET GYATSO  

the volumes of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis, a scroll painting of the peaceful  and wrathful [buddhas], a Vajrasattva mirror, a [long-] life vase, and a skullcup  [filled] with ambrosia. She also had each of the others offer a gift [to Longch enpa]. Having then prostrated and invoked [prayers] of auspiciousness, she  implored [him], "I request that you act for the welfare of others." So he per formed a permission [ceremony]. That afternoon, the lama said, "I need to  compile a guidance course," and opened up the text. One yogini saw the Guru  [Padmasambhava] come in the fashion [described in] his mind-evocation [rit ual] and dissolve into the lama, while [Yeshe] Tsogyel [appeared] on his right  and Turquoise Lamp on his left, dictating the words of the guidance. At that  time, he separated out the texts of two guidance courses, and composed them  as notes.  

In this way, Yeshe Tsogyel descended in actuality for six days, from the first  to the thirteenth, and she gave to the holy lama [Longchenpa] Drime Ozer  Pema Ledreltsel (Pad ma las 'brel rtsal) the complete threefold introduction to  the symbols, meaning, and analogies of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis, along  with the seal of entrustment. She then departed to Oddiyana. . . .  

[Over the next sixteen days there are further visions of Padmasambhava and other  figures. Various women appear who assist in some of the ritual performances, and there  are signs of meditative success among several of Longchenpa's disciples.]  

At midnight on the twenty-ninth, Namdru Remati descended and said, "Why  haven't you given me an offering cake? I've endured hardship for a long time!"  Everyone was panic stricken, and [Longchenpa] asked, "Who are you?" She  replied, "I am in all phenomena! I am present right up to the top of your head!"  He asked again, and she said, "I am Namdru Remati. Since I have been guarding  your Treasure, [I] am going to give it to you." He inquired, "What do you  have?" and she responded, "I have some clothes along with the Master [Pad masambhava's] religious robe and skull cup. I have come [here] with the in 

tention of conferring these upon you. I showed you a miracle before, but you  didn't recognize me. The other day you gave everyone else an excellent com munal feast of offering cakes, but there was nothing for me. I was thus ashamed,  and felt like stealing everything!" As she said this, she seemed to become quite  reduced in presence. He asked, "How many are you?" and she replied, "We are  five [in number]." He further inquired, "What are your body color and hand held accoutrements?" She replied, "I, Namdru Remati, am black and ride on a  four-footed mule. My right [hand] holds a sword and my left [hand] holds a  bag of disease. Red Mistress of the Desire Realm ('Dod khams dbang phyug)  rides a three-legged mule, green Vajra Creature-Headed Goddess (rDo rje phra  men ma) rides a bear while waving her hand, yellow Vajra Mistress (rDo rje  dbang phyug) [rides] a three-legged mule, and white Vajra Action Lamp (rDo  rje las sgron ma) [rides] a three-legged mule - all of them hold skulls and 

LONGCHENP A AND THE DAKINl S 263  

ritual daggers as hand-held accoutrements. I am the Mistress of the Desire  Realm holding a saber and bag of disease."  

Then for three days she performed many miracles relating to Treasures and  caused an intense commotion. Then she descended again on the night [that  Longchenpa was transmitting] [teachings on] breakthrough, and displayed  miracles. At that point, the lama said,  

Having revealed the gateway to the Treasure of radiant light within  myself,  

I have no need for Treasures in the cracks of rock mountains.  If I have Treasures, that's fine; if I don't that's fine, too.  

If I have the right fortune, it's fine; fine, if not.  

There is no point in bartering your boasts of guarding Treasure  With me, a yogin who has exhausted phenomena, exhausted intellect.  

They each responded, and conversed back and forth a few times. Then the time  came, and [he] accepted [the duty to] extract [the Treasure], so [that they]  were pleased. . . .  

[The text proceeds to describe Longchenpa's transmission of further empower ments relating to the Great Perfection visionary techniques, which causes some  of these abstract visions to be seen by all in the sky. The figure of Yeshe Tsogyel  is sighted again, and predictions are made about Longchenpa's successors.]  

Then after a while, when the sun was setting, the lama said, "Since the em powerments and guidances of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis have all been  completed [and it is time for the communal feast], be careful tonight!" When  he said that, [someone replied], "There is no beer." [The lama said], "The other  day the dakinis gave us siddhis. Let's call them tonight and see if they come.  Pour water in the malt dregs jug and collect [the beer that is thereby produced].  I will bless it." By thus straining out the beer, they obtained one jugful and  asked, "Isn't this enough?" He replied, "Since this won't even suffice for what  is needed tonight, collect [more]!" They strained more, yet all of it came out  as fresh as a first straining of beer from malt. When all the yogins and yoginis  were intoxicated, [Longchenpa] said in a playful manner, "This represents my  activity of emanating and transforming material things!"  

Then Turquoise Lamp requested, "I entreat you to come to my place [that  is, White Skull Snow Mountain]." [Longchenpa] pleased her by assenting, say ing, "Let me go first," and she departed. Then the Mantra Protectress de scended, and when leaving, said, "Something that you will find upsetting is  approaching." Namdruma came down after a while, and said "I request that  you not depart." The lama refused her, saying "I explain such profound teach ings to all of you nonhuman spirits but you don't understand. Being pleased  or displeased are [both] a miraculous show of mind. You can come to wherever 

264 DAVID GERMAN O AND JANET GYATSO  

I am." He then performed the conferral of an empowerment for meditative  contemplation. She said, "That was amazing; I am bound to [your] heart-mind."  He asked her, "Where did you go since the other day?" "I went to the pasture  lands to collect a first-fruit tithe offering" she said. In fact, at that time there  had occurred considerable disease among the cattle.  

Then all the yogins and yoginis offered a mandala of their own clothes,  ornaments, and jewels, and made vows to practice [the teachings he had trans mitted]. The lama rejoiced, saying "Many will emerge who will strive to be  generous and to practice in these teachings of mine." He then taught very  profound instructions on entering into the sheath of radiant light. At that time  he said, "Since my instructions are very rare in this world, you will be able to  accomplish rapidly a body of light."  

Then on the thirteenth, when performing the higher empowerment, a pre vious disciple from eastern Tibet (Khams) upset [Longchenpa] with inappro priate behavior. [Longchenpa] said "Some disciples in these teachings will have  impaired religious commitments." He thus performed ritual confessions as part  of fulfillment rituals, and departed [for Shukseb]. [Turquoise Lamp's] previous  statement that someone would come to upset him just as he was leaving re ferred to that [situation].  

Then, on the road by which he was coming, he performed a communal feast  offering at Chukpo (Thyug po) rock, and there were many rainbow-colored  lights and portents of the dakinis. Then, on the road along which he was going  it was sunny without clouds, and he suffered from the heat. He prayed and at  once clouds gathered and a wind, not too strong, arose and he also had a vision  of Turquoise Lamp welcoming him. When doing a communal feast at Chilmo  (mChil mo), again there were many omens of the dakinis. Then, when he was  invited to Shukseb, a dakini descended into one yogini and for six days she  gave voice to dakini sounds, and said, "I beseech the lama to come to Oddi yana." During this period, rainbows continuously appeared every day.  

Then he built a hermitage on White Skull Snow Mountain [above Shukseb]  which he named Oddiyana Fortress, and stayed there. He gave empower ments, guidances, and instructions, and again dakinis spontaneously descend ed. There were many omens and the sky was filled with rainbows. Periodically  his residence was linked to five-colored rainbows in the sky, which everyone  witnessed.  

Then the one with the deepest spiritual attainments from the empowerment  crowd, the yogin Ozer Gocha, requested that he compose a text on the em powerment, guidance, introduction, and so forth for the instructions of The  Seminal Heart of the Dakinis that had been previously [transmitted], and spon sored a communal feast offering with tormas [for that purpose]. [Longchenpa  then] stayed in retreat from the eighth of the first autumn month, and from  the tenth began the [composition] of the text. The sky was filled with rainbows  and expressions of the dakinis. In his dream, many crowds of supplicating men  and women were prostrating [to] and circumambulating [him]. They be-

LONGCHENP A AND THE DAKINI S 265  

seeched him, "We are bound to your heart-mind! Please look after us com passionately!" At night there was the sound of dakinis in all directions. Also  many unprecedented miraculous displays manifested to the great meditators  in the area. The first [autumn] month was like that, and up until the second  autumn month the lama spent his time supplicating dakinis and composing  the text day and night. Throughout this period, there occurred immeasurably  many auspicious connections that would benefit others, dreams, and visionary  experiences. Every day, rainbow-colored light swirled above his residence on  the col of White Skull Snow Mountain, and many amazing visions of light  occurred. Then, on the first of the third autumn month, he performed a cele bration for the full completion [of the text entitled The Seminal Quintessence  of the Dakinis]. All the yogins made prayers of auspiciousness, at which point  the sky was filled with rainbows, and inconceivably many auspicious signs  occurred. . . .  

[The text then concludes with lengthy celebratory verses].  

The Luminous Web of Precious Visions is set forth here by Yogi Pema Ledrel tsel - the one illuminated by the light rays of the sun, who is the glorious  Oddiyana Master [Padmasambhava] - through summarizing a portion of the  chronicle of the manifest emergence of the profound Treasures. It is completed. 

### 15 The Anonymous Agama Prakasa

The Anonymous Agama Prakasa: Preface to  a Nineteenth-Century Gujarati Polemic  

Robin Rinehart and Tony K. Stewart  

In 1874, a substantial Gujarati book was published in the city of Ahmedabad by  an anonymous author, with a lengthy English title: Exposition of the Nigamas or  that portion of Hindoo Shastras which the dukshinas or Right Hand sect follows as their  books of revelation, i.e. Vedas, Sootra, Smritis, Pooranas &c. For the use of reformers  in India by the author of the "Nibandha Sangraha." The author prefaced the text,  which included extensive Sanskrit passages from more than seventy different  texts, like this:  

We dedicate the following pages to the thinking Public, who have curiosity to know  the ancient mode of worship proclaimed by the revelation called Nigamas. The an cient practices of a nation are often buried in oblivion, but those of India are well  preserved in its sacred literature. It is necessary that Reformers, in order to be suc cessful, ought to possess a knowledge of the ancient literature, which the people  have, through habit, ignorance and Priest-craft learned to venerate. The secrecy which  is attached to the sacred literature of the Brahmans, principally arises from the ig norance of the language in which it is written and by its being to a great extent, out  of vogue. The primeval sacrificial system, which is the basis of the ancient Vedic  Religion is cruel, uncouth, as well as opposed to the ideas of the present age. It would  not have been satisfactory to describe it without referring to authorities on each point  asserted and discussed. The book therefore is filled with authentic extracts from Vedic  literature, which is considered as revelation from the Most High. It has been hitherto  a special privilege of the Brahmans to recite it by rote and offer sacrifices in a manner  handed down from generation to generation, without understanding their purport  or condition of civilization in which they were ordained. Various miraculous powers  are attributed to the mantras and sacrifices and various stories, inculcating the holi ness of the Brahmans and power of their ritual are industriously circulated, in order  to create awe and respect among the ignorant masses. It becomes therefore necessary 

THE ANONYMOUS AGAMA PRAKASA 267  

to unveil this ritual as far as the limits of a small book will admit and to place within  the reach of the Reformers such portions of the ancient mode of worship as required  notice. This it is hoped may stimulate a further research, in those regions of antiquity,  which appear to be utterly neglected in India by those, whom they concern most.  The Religion of a nation greatly affects its destinies and progress. Adherence to the  ancient prejudices combined with the thickly prevailing ignorance and a powerful  priest-craft has produced baneful effects, such as early-marriages, miserable and  forced widowhood, prevention of travelling to foreign countries, slavery of female  sex, waste of money on useless objects, eleemosynary habits of one-tenth of the  population, internal dissentions, want of fellow-feeling and patriotism and above all  false worship of God. When reformers try to remove these effects, where do they  stumble? At the religious difficulty.  

The text purports to explain those features of the Hindu tradition that are  deemed admirable by the author, then explained by one pandit and further elu cidated by a second, but for the special purpose of encouraging emerging notions  of "progress" into "modernity." Apart from the diction, which appears a trifle  stilted to our contemporary sensibilities, there is nothing remarkable about such  a publication; it is typical of many such productions in the nineteenth century.  But later in that same year, a companion volume appeared by the same still  nameless author, which in its contrast with the first reveals not only the extent  of this reforming agenda but a remarkable taxonomic organization of the various  dimensions of Hindu practice and theory that anticipate the creation of the cate gory of Tantrism, which, as Andre Padoux has argued in the Encyclopedia of Re ligion, was a newly recognized independent category of religious experience con structed in the nineteenth century.  

The title of our anonymous author's companion volume and its preface, which  opens with the same telltale phrase, are worth quoting in full and with original  punctuation (pp. 1-2):  

Exposition of the Agamas or that Portion of Hindoo Shastras, which Vamees or Left  Hand Sect Follow as Their Books of Revelation, i.e. Tantras, Vamalas, Rujusias, &c.  for the Use of Reformers in India, by the Author of the "Nigama Prakash"  

We dedicate the following pages to the thinking Public, whose education and natural  public spirit have excited in them a curiosity for knowing the doctrines & dogmas  contained in that portion of the Hindoo Shastras which enjoy the title of "Agamas"  and which for a long time have remained a secret store, though they continue to  attract veneration from ignorance, habit or the pretentions of the professors of what  is called "Mantra Shastra." It is evident that they can not be properly appreciated,  unless they are in some degree unveiled and thrown open to the Reformers, who  wish to introduce changes, in order to establish a pure form of religion. The object  of these pages, is to hold up to light the most filthy, infernal and obscene superstitions  and pretended miraculous power of Maritra Shastris, who abound, in every town in  India, especially in native states, where they find a large-patronage. It would have 

2 6 8 ROBI N RINEHAR T AND TONY K . STEWAR T  

been useless simply to describe their practices without referring to their authorities.  The book, therefore, is filled up with extracts from Sanscrit-books, which enjoy the  notoriety of having been composed by Shiva, the great object of worship throughout  India. It would be easy to imagine what should be the degeneration and debasement  of a nation which not only gives currency to such literature as the Tantras, but  venerates them as revelation from the Most High. It is hoped that this publication  will induce all those, who are concerned in the welfare of this great nation to unite  in one common effort to put down the diabolical tenets inculcated by the "Vami" and  "Kowl" sects. The secrecy with which they are practiced & propagated, is a real  obstacle, which must, to a great extent, baffle the exertions of Reformers but it must  be recollected that perseverance overcomes all difficulties. It will be a grand triumph  to free Hindoos from the snares of these knaves, who pass by the polite names of  Mantra Shastris and Upasakas but who deserve to be denounced as enemies to all  that is decent, virtuous, and moral.  

What follows this remarkable preface is an introduction that names dozens of  groups who are seemingly indiscriminately lumped together into this category of  "Vami" or left-hand practitioner, followed by an anthology of some two hundred  pages of Sanskrit and Gujarati.  

These twin texts are follow-up companions to an initial volume entitled Ni bandha Samgraha, which unfortunately has not surfaced in any repository we can  locate. Based on the title and vague references in the following texts, we infer that  it reflects an initial commitment to a defense of the rational injunctions of religion,  in which the Nigama Prakasa, with its generally Vaisnava orientation, represents  the salvageable dimension of Hindu practice, and the Agama Prakasa, with its  Saiva, Sakta, Natha, and general tantrika orientation, that which is despicable.  Whether they were conceived originally as a set or logically grew from the initial  argument is impossible to say, although the latter is most probable because of the  exclusively backward reference; that is, the title page of the Agama Prakasa refers  only to the author of the Nigama Prakasa, which in turn only refers to the (for  us) anonymous Nibandha Prakasa. But we do have a probable author in the figure  of one Gopal Rao Hari Devmukh, whose name appeared on the title page of a  translation of the Agama Prakasa in a handwritten manuscript. There are very few  additional clues to the authorship or dates, save the following.  

Based on a single explicit intertextual reference in the Agama Prakasa to a  datable text, the Sanskrit Siksapatri (Shikshapatri) of Swaminarayan published in  1826, it seems reasonable to conclude that the texts were compiled in the mid 

nineteenth century, not long before their publication, but they may well have  been circulated before printing, as inferred from the simultaneous publication  dates. Swaminarayan's Siksapatri features a pro-Vaisnava, anti-advaita and anti tantrika polemic (for example, it implies that the philosopher Sahkara was a tan trika), but is equally critical of brahman priests, particularly those who prescribe  expensive rituals, which are precisely the two overriding themes of the twin vol umes by our (tentatively identified) anonymous author. Those texts deemed re-

THE ANONYMOUS AGAMA PRAKASA 269  

liable by the Siksapatri are the very ones so deemed in the Nigama Prakasa, and  vice versa for the Agama Prakasa, suggesting that the author of our text is a  follower of this important new tradition. This Swaminarayan connection is sig nificant, because the group was seen as a reforming agent of Gujarati society, both  by locals and by British administrators and clergy. Followers of Swaminarayan  were opposed to animal sacrifice, forbidden to consume liquor or meat, sing  vulgar songs, engage in practices for the appeasement of ghosts or evil spirits,  and were strictly forbidden to participate in sexual rituals. The Swaminarayan  religion was progressive in that the group was open to all castes, even though  caste hierarchies were still observed, and the group came out strongly against the  practice of sati (widow burning) and female infanticide, while promoting widow  remarriage and allowing women to take formal vows of renunciation. The urge  to reform, however, is not simply the outgrowth of the colonial project but has  deep roots in the Hindu traditions.  

Since the emergence of the devotional cults of the early centuries of the first  millennium, the orthoprax vaidika and smarta rituals have come under criticism  from those who have argued that the meaning and point of the rituals was no  longer known, and therefore that the rituals were performed out of ignorance,  inviting karmic and other forms of disaster for all who participated. With the  resurgence of vernacular devotionalism in the premodern, precolonial, era, the  critique extended to include sincerity of religious feeling, that is, devotion (bhakti).  In the nineteenth century, the Western conception of religious hypocrisy, coupled  with a sweeping indictment of all that could not be defended rationally or sci entifically, brought these ongoing critiques together in works such as the Agama  Prakasa.  

The criticism was two-pronged: the first was aimed at those brahman ritualists  who, in the arrogance of their ignorance, were accused of perpetuating a mean ingless ritual system that took advantage of the ordinary Hindu to no positive  end, producing a parasitic (and therefore useless, but not debased) class of priests.  The second target was the group of practitioners (not limited to priests) who,  seeing only gain and pleasure for themselves, debauched the rituals to include  sexual indulgences and other unseemly activities transgressive of ordinary social  sanction, such as drinking liquor and eating meat - the so-called "left-handed"  practitioners of Tantra. What was criticized first was the arcane and the secret,  for both groups depended on the inability of their participants to fathom the  mysteries of their liturgies. This accounts for some, at least, of the groupings of  individuals castigated by the author of the Agama Prakasa: Nathas and Saktas  were connected to propounders of Vedic lore (sastris), household priests (pandi 

tas), and hired performers for specialized, often magical, rituals (mantrikas). The  texts are similarly grouped, with Tantras and Rahasyas finding a place beside the  Vedic Brahmanas, Upanisads, and Sutras.  

Clearly, the Agama Prakasa's critique of Indian religion has strong links to the  past, but it also reflects the climate of British colonial rule, which gave its impulse  a greater social claim and a much wider audience, aided not only by the intro-

270 ROBI N RINEHAR T AND TONY K. STEWART  

duction of the printing press (a vernacular press was established in Ahmedabad  in 1845) and improved systems of travel and communication but also by the  adoption of institutional models from Western organizations such as the Young  Men's Christian Association, which was active throughout India. The new insti 

tution of the vernacular newspaper and the inexpensively printed pamphlet and  book (such as the Agama Prakasa) provided powerful input to the increasingly  vocal public arena, which was marked by organized lectures and debates among  traveling religious leaders. New popular Indian religious leaders (many of whom  who were educated in schools run by Christian missionaries) incorporated many  of the colonial social issues directly into their platforms; because the public debate  was shaped in forums often conforming to Western sensibilities, the terms of that  discourse were not entirely in the control of locals. These religious figures occa sionally adopted stances as a show of solidarity with their British rulers, but in  other instances they advocated reform to show that any necessary changes in  Hindu practice could be implemented from within the tradition itself, with no  need for outside assistance - a position that reflected independence, pride, and  an emergent nationalism.  

Our text seems on the surface to be sympathetic to British rule, for the author  is keen to show that the tantrika practices he finds so despicable are most prev alent in the princely states ruled by Indian kings, and not those areas under direct  British rule. Such sympathy was typical of the mid- to late nineteenth centuries,  before an organized movement for independence from the British got underway.  But it should be noted that elsewhere he labels Bengal, which at the time of  composition was the capital of British India, to be the hotbed of debauched prac tices, the stronghold of mantra-sastra, which he labels "Bengali vidya" (arcane  knowledge of Bengal). His zeal for religious reform is coupled with a strong na tionalist proposal - a unified nation working together to cleanse the religion of  its excesses - but his sentiment often spills over into a ready regionalism tied  both to language and locale. In the opening pages of his introduction, he claims  to know of no more than two, or at most, four hundred men who practice these  left-handed rituals in his own locale of Ahmedabad. Yet when one travels so far  as Banaras, the figure jumps to the thousands, and when one ventures to the  edges of India, to Dravida in the south (especially Kerala), to Kashmir in the  north, and most of all to Bengal in the east - that is, away from the heartland of  Hindu India defined by Ahmedabad as its center - the practitioners are numbered  in the millions. The tendency to exoticize those who are "not like us," that is, the  projection of an "other," is a common feature of this indictment.  

Although these characterizations may seem somewhat unsophisticated in light  of our most recent reconstructions of India's religious heritage, they were part of  a larger nineteenth-century effort to map and catalog the full terrain of Indian  religious cultures. Importantly, this effort included the "scientific" control of pop 

ulations through the enumerations of the census, which tracked religious affilia tions (and in cases of an ambiguous response, assigned one). It became the task  of many religious writers to ground their critiques in enumerative, if not statistical,THE ANONYMOUS ACAMA PRAKASA 271  

analysis. The surprising pluralism that emerged from such analyses was quick to  be characterized in starkly delineated terms, because the categories that these  rulers and reformers erected were exclusive in ways that reflected, at the very  lowest level, the census taker's inability to check two boxes at once. As such, it  revealed a predilection for exclusive "group membership" as the defining feature  of identity (an individual could not have two identities at once), whereas it appears  that individuals who participated in these traditions did not always follow this  exclusionary approach. As religious identities became politicized in the latter  stages of the nineteenth century, thought and rational assent were given unprec edented priority over action in categorizing "proper" religion in India, and mem 

bership in a clearly defined "group" was a prerequisite for being counted. With  a litmus test of a self-articulated "purity," the response of many reform groups,  including the Swaminarayan, was to accept specific texts and practices as repre sentative of a "true" Hinduism while declaring others debased or degenerate forms  of religion, and in many cases not even Hindu at all. The author of our text  adopted a similar strategy as he brought to light not only the "filthy, infernal, and  obscene superstitions" of the tantrika tradition, but also the Vedic texts previously  kept secret as "a special privilege of the brahmanas."  

Although it is common nowadays to think of the texts and practices of Tantra  as shrouded in secrecy because of their connection with transgressive activities,  our text reminds us that the recitation and rituals associated with the Vedas were  an equally mysterious arena for those who were not brahman males trained in  Vedic tradition. Indeed the stated aim of many of the translated versions of San 

skrit texts printed in the nineteenth century (including our text) was to make  them available to those who otherwise had no access to them. Reformers argued  that many Hindus were ignorant of their own religious tradition, and that the best  path to religious reform was for them to study the proper texts and subsequently  bring their practices into conformity with the texts, and thereby to rationalize  those practices. Essential to this argument was a reading of Indian history that  posited an initial golden age of religious purity and consistency (typically the age  of the Vedas) followed by a period in which religious knowledge fell into the  hands of a small group of brahmans who either inadvertently or through greed  and corruption gradually forgot the true meaning of the Vedas, causing the tra dition to enter a lengthy period of degeneration. Our author, along with others  who subscribed to this model of India's religious history, saw the decline of an  "original" Hindu tradition as responsible for the spread of Buddhism throughout  India, which in turn led the god Siva to institute the sensual practices of Tantra  as a radical antidote to the ascetic, world-negating tendencies of Buddhism. The  conflict engendered by trying to exalt the ancient while indicting it forced the  author of the Agama Prakasa to restate his position, according to context. Thus  he believed it essential that the secrets of the Vedas and other texts deemed  acceptable be revealed so that people could bring their practices into conformity  with them, even as he sought to reveal the secrets of Tantra in order that that  their practice be eradicated. Where those secrets were mixed (misra) with Vedic 

272 ROBI N RINEHAR T AND TONY K. STEWAR T  

secrets, problems abounded. We should note that this purported "secrecy" is as  much a rhetorical device as a reflection of reality, for our author himself had been  able to learn of this "secret" in extenso (although his translator seems a bit unsure  from time to time, so we might infer the that the details were not widely known  in spite of the general recognition), and he asserts that at least one-fourth of the  people in every city of India practiced it (sometimes even publicly), making it a  very well-known secret indeed. Importantly, and contrary to many of our con temporary characterizations of Tantra, our author routinely highlights secrecy  over sexual indulgence as the dominant trope of these practices.  

The argument for the eradication of tantrika practices, by Indian and British  reformers alike, singled out those aspects of it which they found the most trou bling to a modern society on moral grounds. The consumption of liquor and  meat, and participation in sexual rituals, were often paired with ignorance and a  laxity of discipline as the source of the problem. This strategy was clearly evi denced in the introduction to the Agama Prakasa, as the author acknowledged a  wide variety of texts and practices from different regions of India but lumped  them together as a "sect" known as the Vamamarga ("left-hand path"), Tantra marga, or Kaulamarga, whose adherents were united in their practice of "despi cable" and "immoral" rituals, whether they had any historical connection or not  Our text is thus part of a larger nineteenth-century trend toward conceiving of a  new entity called "Tantrism" as a specific modality of Indian religious experience,  where previously these groups would have remained categorically distinct.  

The printed edition of this text, which is probably not its original publication,  can be found under the full title Exposition of the Agamas or that Portion of Hindoo  Shastras, which Vamees or Left Hand Sect Follow as Their Books of Revelation, i.e.  Tantras, Vamalas, Rujusias, &c. for the Use of Reformers in India, by the Author of  the "Nigama Prakash"; the Gujarati title is simply Agama Prakasa etale Tantrika  Dharmano Knulaso. Both title pages indicate the publisher to be Sumsher Bahadoor  in Ahmedabad, with the imprint dates of 1874 C.E. and Samvat 1930. The trans 

lation of the preface comes from a ninety-six-page manuscript purchased in an  antiquarian book stall in London by Stewart in 1997. The bound and undated  anonymous translation - done in a hand that suggests English schoolboy edu cation - the first part of what would have covered at least four volumes, was  copied on rag bond with the watermark "M and J Lay 1817," with the putative  

original author named on the verso of the endpaper that serves as a title page.  We have transcribed the anonymous English translation of the preface to the  Agama Prakasa, checking every line against the printed text, preserving its some what awkward phrasing, but editing inconsistencies in transliteration, and sup plementing with glosses those phrases the translator chose not to translate, either  out of frustration with the long lists or out of a healthy respect for those places  where the original author's understanding far exceeded his own. The translator's  glosses appear in parentheses and our glosses appear in brackets. Hyphenation  of technical terms generally follows the translator's original, which, along with 

T HE ANONYMOU S ACAMA PRAKASA 273  

his choice of vocabulary, suggests a heavy reliance on Monier-Williams's 1899  Sanskrit-English Dictionary. We have retained the translator's preference for capi talizing proper names or titles. Our transcription preserves the paragraph breaks  of the original Gujarati text, which, as readers will surely note, is somewhat hap hazardly organized, and shifts from gross generalizations appropriate to an in experienced reader to the advanced technical descriptions of ritual and practice.  A second editor's hand can be detected in our translation manuscript, and those  suggested changes have been routinely incorporated without comment, since it  appears that the translation was at one time intended for publication, although it  appears that never occurred.

Explanation of Agamas (or Tantras or Vamamarga)  

Translated from the Agama-Prakasa of Gopal Rao Hari Devmukh  

PREFACE  

Agama-sastra is called the Mantra-sastra; and it is also known as the Vama marga, the Tantra-marga and the Kaula-marga. This sect advocates the three  doctrines, viz., action or sacrificial rites, worship, and knowledge; there are  books written on the subject and Siva is regarded as their author; there are also  other books to the same effect and they are composed by the Natha-sectarians  and they inculcate the ceremonies called nydsa [imputation of mantras to dif-

274 ROBI N RINEHAR T AND TONY K. STEWAR T  

ferent body parts in order to sanctify], mudra [gestures], japa [chanting], and  puja [worship] as well as the worship of the different gods, and goddesses,  Bhairava, etc. These people repeat the pancanga [five modes of devotion] which  includes [prayers such as the] sahasra-nqma, stavaraja, kavaca, hrdaya, and  panjara. There is also another ceremony called the Purascarana which is ob 

served in connection with the various gayatns [verses] and mantras [utter ances]. One has to be initiated, before he is admitted into this sect and that  ceremony is called the purnabhiseka and the pattabhiseka. It is said that the  sound "soham" is made 21,600 times while inhaling and exhaling and this  process is [named] japajapa and ajapajapa. There are many treatises on the  subject of the Sakta worship; in some places the Vedic hymns are also used  [but] the actions are quite different from the Vedic. The different actions are  the worship of damanaka (jackal), the sacrifice of diitf (female go-between),  the worship of a virgin, of a female ascetic, and of hair, the placing of a vessel  and the making of a thread. The books are called the Tantra and Rahasya; some  are known as the Yamala and Amnaya, while others are named the Kalpa. All  these books, if collected, will be equal in number to the Vedas, the Sastras and  the Puranas. Some ceremonies are mentioned to gain the desired objects and  to reduce, to sicken, kill or ruin an adversary (jarana, marana, and chattan).  Intoxicating drinks, flesh, fish, and women are necessarily required in all these  ceremonies. Flesh and fish are consecrated and placed in a plate and afterwards  the devotees partake of the food. It is mentioned in the Tantra books that the  spiritous liquors ceased to be drunk, as Brahma, Krsna and Sukra cursed them  all, but that there is no sin in drinking them after removing the curse by some  peculiar ceremony. There are some technical terms in the Tantra which contain  bija [seed] mantras of one word only. The ways of such men as are versed in  this Mantra-sastra are quite different; they have their own distinct years,  months, days, astronomical divisions of time, worship, sraddha [ceremony for  deceased relatives], guru-tarpana [libations to gods and ancestors], precepts  and general ceremonies. The books on the subject are also different in various  countries. The Gauda-patha [the reading proper to Bengal] and the Gurjara patha [reading proper to Gujarat] are different from one another on account  of the different countries in which they are accepted. The principal treatise on  the subject is the Candl-patha which is included in the Markandeya Purana as  well as in the Katyayani-tantra. Taking this book to be an authority, the dev otees perform the sacrifices, marjana [rite of purification], tarpana [libations  to gods and ancestors], japa, etc. by reciting [praise of the goddess in the forms  of] haracandi, satacandi and sahasracandi. The ten Mahavidyas [personifica 

tions of the saktis or powers of Siva] are regarded as the principal goddesses  in the Tantras. There are many books which give description of sacrificial  receptacles or pits and pavilions called the hunda [latrine?] and mandapa re spectively; and all this system is attributed to Mahadeva [Siva]. Some people  recognize three distinct features of these ceremonies, viz. Vaidiki [Vedic], Tan triki, [Tantric] and Misra [combined]; Misra is that in which Tantriki and 

THE ANONYMOUS AGAMA PRAKASA 27 5  

Vaidiki are used together. It is difficult to separate from the Tantras the part  promiscuously accepted by the Brdhmanas [brahmans] in their religious rites.  Various Tantras and Mantras art found in the Daksina [southern]-marga. From  this, it appears that the Brdhmanas did not differ from the Tantra-marga. Had  there been any difference of opinion, they would not have taken anything from  the Tantras; but, that is not the case: the Tantra-marga that is to say, Kaula marga is prevalent in many parts of India. The Brahmacaris, Sannyasts, Para 

mahamsa Panditas and many other people belong to this sect in every city and  town, but their ways of life are kept very secret and hence it is that they are  not brought to light. It is after a long search that we have come to know  something about them. About two or four hundred men are connected with  the Sakta-mdrga in Ahmadabad and in the same way there are many in Nadiyad,  Baroda, Broach, Surat, Puna, Satara and Karbir; thousands of Brdhmanas follow  the Sakta-marga in Benares, while in Bengal, and the Dravidian countries mil lions are found; wherever there is a temple of the Devi, there this system is in  vogue and liquor and meats are offered to the various goddesses, viz, Bechraji,  Ambaji, Kalaka, Hinglaj, Tuljapura, Vindhyavasini, Kamaksi, Matapura, and  Kali of Calcutta. The Vaisnavas despised all liquors and meats and they there 

fore do not go to such places, but the Gosavis, Atitas and the Natha sectarians  do go there. It is clearly mentioned in the Siksapatri of the Svaminarayana that  no one should salute a god to whom liquors and meats are offered; the followers  of this sect do not make a bow to such a god but many of them have faith (in  those gods) in order to serve their purpose. In native states, the Mantra-s'astras  are employed to perform some mystical ceremonies. There is not a single native  state which does not engage such men and spend lakhs of rupees on these  peculiar ceremonies.  

The object of this book is to show what Agama-sastra is, what particular  gods are worshipped, and what the names of the books and the technicalities  are; the names of the authors of the various books, the mudras, the mystical  powers of accomplishment and bija, etc., are mentioned in this book. The Vedic  and the Tantrika ceremonies are these days mixed together to a very large  extent but in the original books of the Vedas there is not such a mixture; no  traces of the Tantrika ceremonies are found in the Brahmana and the Sutra  works but they were introduced into the Karma-marga by the later Prayoga karas. If we examine the present system of the Brahmanical sandhya [daily  rites], we find that the nyasa, mudra, dsana [posture] and arghyapraddna [ritual  presentation of water] etc., are taken from the Tantras, the Pranayamas [breath 

ing exercises] from the Yogasastra, japa and upasthana [worship] from the  Vedas and the repetition of the names and praises (nama-smarana) from the  Puranas. It is difficult to separate and classify all this. In the same way, there  are other Tantrik ceremonies, viz, kunda, mandapa vidhi, laghunyasa, and ma 

hasodhanyasa.  

It is said that the pioneers of this system were the nine Nathas and eighty four Siddhas. It appears from the thousands of books on the subject that this 

276 ROBI N RINEHAR T AND TONY K. STEWAR T  

work was carried on long ago and that the Brahmanas were not opposed to it,  because many people believe that a follower of this sect pleases god and gratifies  all his desires by the virtue of the mantras. It can be inferred from the  Sankaravijaya [a biography of the Advaita Vedanta philosopher Sahkara] that  Sahkaracarya was also a Sakta, for the worship of cakra [meditative wheel;  bodily center of energy; chiromantic circle; zodiac?] is highly praised in that  book, and because the cakra is found in the Shin-geri and Dvarka [monasteries]  established by him; this sytem therefore existed before Sahkaracarya. The opin ion of some people is that, when Buddha appeared, all men became ascetics by  his precepts; so much so that they would not marry, fight or cultivate the land;  there being no government, all worldly affairs ceased; some people left every 

thing aside and observed fasting days and thought that they would attain to  salvation by dying in that state. At that time, Siva instituted the Kaula-marga  to set the people to worldly affairs, and allowed them to use liquors and meats  freely, and determined that the woman was the only supreme deity. It is said  in the Bhdgavata Purana [4.2.2]: "Let the foolish and impure men who wear  long hair, apply ashes and carry bones, be admitted in the Siva-dfksa (religious  rites, initiation etc. of Siva) in which intoxicating drinks is held sacred or  divine." The two chapters of the Padma Purana are devoted to the origin of  pakhanda or heretical doctrines and it is said by Siva therein that the Kaula  system was made to pollute people. Perhaps, these statements are made by the  Vaisnavas themselves, but it appears that this system followed Buddhism and  that it was carried on for a very long time, because, how can one account  otherwise for thousands of books which treat of the said system?  

Afterwards, [the philosopher] Kumarilabhatta insisted on the Vedic rites  inculcated by the Purva-mimamsa and after including some ceremonies in  which many animals were killed, and which were intended for the attainment  of the desired objects, he settled that salvation can only be obtained by per 

forming religious ceremonies. This system lasted for some time as well and  afterwards, there appeared Sahkaracarya who revised the Uttara Mimamsa and  declared that the atma [individual spirit] was brahma[n] and that salvation or  absolution could not be obtained by performing karman or religious rites but  by knowledge. According to him knowledge is superior; heaven is the fruit of  observing religious rites [karman] but one cannot have salvation thereby. The  system of the Vedanta bears in many respects a very close resemblance to that  of the Kaula. (The Kaula is called Rajyayoga.) The yoga system of Patanjali is  called Hathayoga while the Vedanta is known as Jnanayoga, while the system  which is advocated in the Gita is termed Karma-yoga. The difference amongst  the four systems is that one gets salvation, according to the Rajyayoga, by  enjoyment, while the Hathayoga declares that he should desire to obtain final  beatitude by performing religious austerities, viz, samddhi (mortifying the  body, etc.); the Jnanayoga recommends asceticism and the Karmayoga suggests  that absolution can be had by performing ritual actions (karman) advocated  by the varnasrama [classical system of caste, life stages, and goals]. There is a 

THE ANONYMOUS AGAUA PRAKASA 277  

story in the Padma Purana, which affirms that Siva will manifest himself in  order to propagate heretical doctrines (pakhanda). Now some people ascribe  this statement to the Vamamarga, while the Vaisnavas say that it is applicable  to Sankaracarya because the latter was a great heretic in calling the personal  soul (atma or jivatma) brahma[n]. This is the opinion of the Vaisnavas belong 

ing to the Madhva-sampradaya [followers of Dvaita Vedanta teachings of  Madhva]. The Vaisnavas of all denominations believe that atma (personal  "soul") is not brahma[n] but that it is an object created by brahma who is its  master and whose service is its duty. All doctrines opposed to this are called  heretical. According to the Kaulika-marga, the atma is Brahma-rupa [in the  body or form of brahma] - and all those who do not belong to that sytem are  termed Pasu and Kantaka (beasts and thorns). It also asserts that all prescribed  rules and prohibitions should not be followed and that one should act inde pendently without any restraint. The system of religion of the sannyasi Para 

mahamsa as well as of the Aghoris is identical with that of the followers of the  Vama-marga. In these times, many Aghoris are not found but formerly there  were many; they used to live in forests and partake of urine and excrement.  Near Siddhapur, there is a village called Avaghadasthali where dwelt the head  of the Aghoris; he used to catch scorpions, small lizards and other animals and  then place them in a pot and, when they were naturally decayed, he would  drink their extracted juice from the skull of a dead man and after throwing  their bones away, bring other animals. Some people eat the flesh of corpses  while they are being burnt and others take out the dead body of a woman from  the grave and make asana [i.e., mount it] in the burial ground in order to  accomplish their mystical powers. A guard is always kept in a graveyard that  none may tamper with dead bodies; there is a saying current among the people  that a mantrasastri or one versed in mystical science has power to snatch away  the bodies of the Dheda or the Bhanghi clan from the smaiana [cremation  ground].  

Many immoral and horrible practices which are contrary to the DharmaSastra  (the science of law or morality etc.) are advocated by the Mantra-sastra. As a  rule the followers of this system worship various incarnations of the form of  Siva and Sakti, and thinking that the power of the Vedic hymns has ceased but  that of the Tantrika is still in force, they observe this form of worship and  believe that Visnu is in the form of Sakti. There are many stories in the Puranas  giving the origin of the worship of Siva and Sakti in the form of the male and  female generative organs (lihgam yoni [respectively]). This worship of the gen erative organs is taken from the Tantras, because they not only mention it  clearly but also the Pancamakara [five Ms] containing kunda [menstrual blood]  and golamata [semen], etc.; as it seems to be a Tantrika custom, the Vaisnavas  do not worship Siva nor do they take the Tlrtha-prasada (of Siva); they only  salute the image of Siva. The religious ceremonies (karma-kanda) observed in  the Vama-marga are quite different. The followers of this sect perform very  secretly the non-Vedic ceremonies, viz, the pratasmarana (morning prayer), 

278 ROBIN RINEHART AND TONY K. STEWART  

snanaviddhi (ceremony of bathing), tripundra-dhdrana (making marks with red  or white powder on the forehead etc.), bhu-suddhi (purification of the earth),  bhiita-suddhi (purification of animals), pranayama (restraining the breath), san dhya (morning and evening prayers), japa, (muttering certain syllables of  phrases), purascarana [preparatory rite], karanganasa [nyasa of the elephant's  trunk?], antaramatrika [internal mystical diagrams], bahirmatrika [external  mystical diagrams], citranyasa [placement of symbolic diagrams on body], na thadividya [supreme knowledge of the Nathas], mulavidya [knowledge of the  root or base], nityadividya [knowledge of the eternal], tattvanyasa [imputation  of metaphysical truths?], dvara-puja [worship of the opening], tarpana [liba tions], dasa-vidyanyasa [imputation of the ten goddesses], patra-nirnaya [re moval of the vessel], nitya-puja [daily worship], suryarghya [offering to the  sun], tirtha-samskara [pilgrimage rites], gurvadi-pujana [worship of the guru,  etc.], diksha [initiation], prayascitta [rituals of atonement], nimba-puspa-pujd  [worship of the sexual organ of a young virgin], damanaka-puja, vasanta-pujd  [spring-worship of Sitala(?)], sri-cakra-puja [worship of the mystical sricakra  diagram of masculine and feminine united], diksa-kala [the black consecra tion], diksabheda [consecration of non-differentiation], sarvatobhadra [square  diagram], punydha-vacana [proclamation of auspiciousness], nandi-sraddha  [offerings to ancestors], kurma-cakra [diagram in shape of a tortoise], nava  yoni [sexual organ of a prepubescent girl], kaula-sraddha [rite for the Kaulas],  mantra-sodhana [purification through mantras], mantroddhdra [selection of  mantras], natha-parayana [knowledge of the Natha system], tattva-parayana  [study of metaphysics], nama-parayana [study of the names], pancanyasa [five  nyasas noted above], mahasodha-nyasa [nyasa of great purification], maha-ny asa [great nyasa], sammohana-nyasa [nyasa of bewitching], saubhagya-vardha na-nyasa [nyasa of increasing good fortune], antyesthi [funeral sacrifice], &c.  

There is a place of Bhairavanatha, in Kakaria at Ahmedabad and the cere monies peculiar to the Vama-marga are observed there; such places are found  in every city. The ceremonial consists in making some gestures with the hands  called mudrds. There are many mudras, viz, maccha-mudra (gesture in the form  of a fish), kurma-mudra (a gesture in the form of a tortoise), kusa (sacred grass),  tarksa (bird or Garuda), dhenu (a cow), vidravani (literally act of defeating),  vasakari (subduing), khecari (moving in heavens), bona (an arrow), pasa (a  snare), musala (a pestle, a club &c), sankha (a conch-shell), haustubha (a jewel  found from the ocean [jewel worn by Krsna]), srivatsa (a particular mark or  curl on the breast of Visnu or Krsna.) &c. [These are all marks of the worship  of Krsna.] The Saktas have a different mark (tilaka) on the forehead and a line  of red powder is produced between the eyes; when two Saktas meet they make  presents of liquors, meats, and fish, but, as they do such things very privately,  no one knows who a Sakta is. Many Sastris, Pandits, Vidiyas (those who learn  the Vedas by heart), householders, Sannyasis, Paramahamsas, and other people  belong to this system of Vdma-marga. Some say that they can convert wine  into milk and show it to others in the form of milk and fish as bananas by the 

THE ANONYMOUS AGAMA PRAKASA 27 9  

virtue of their mystical powers. They have pretensions or claims to magic to a  very great extent. It is said that the king Gopicanda abandoned his kingdom  and his queens through listening to the precepts of Macchendranatha (Mat syendra-natha) and that in the same way Goraksanatha (Gorakhanath) made  dead men alive.  

The followers of the Vama-marga do not salute any other gods except Devi  (goddess) and Siva. They say that gods and men perish if they bow down to  them (gods), that the vaitala [vampires], bhutas (evil spirits), yaksas, yaksanis  [male and female class of tree-dwelling spirits], Datta, Hanuman and all other  gods are ready at their service, and that they can kill and make any one sick  or mad. The credulous and ignorant people take all this for truth. At Benares,  there was a certain Sakta, named Bhaskaracarya who is author of many books.  Once upon a time, he was not invited to a dinner party by some gentlemen  and the consequence was that all the food cooked for other persons was  changed into a dirty substance or excrement; but the tradition says that, when  Narayana Diksita Patanakara saluted Bhaskaracarya and took him to his house,  all the dirt assumed the form of the original food. The same man (Bhaskara carya) carried bottles of liquors on the back of an elephant and gave a spirituous  bath to the Kasi-Visvesvara ([Siva lihgam] of Benares) together with a grand  procession. Even in these days, some Brahmanas sprinkle the water extracted  from the bhanga [hashish] on the image of Siva; the king Sivaji of Deccan had  a preceptor named Ganesadeva who got a temple built in a sacred place called  Makuli; his system is now followed in Satara, while that of Bhaskaracarya is  prevalent in Benares. According to the Saktas, no worship of any sort can be  observed without liquors, meats, eggs and women. As the pancagavya [five  products of the cow], which consists of five things, viz, cow dung, urine, milk,  ghee and curds, is taken according to the Vedic rites to perform a penance for  

the bodily purification, in the same way, liquors are drunk and used for mor gana [rites of request]. The religious ceremonies called the dlksa, sraddha, puja,  antyesti &c cannot be performed without intoxicating drinks. The liquors,  meats and fish are called Tirtha (sacred waters [fords]), suddhi (purification)  and kadali (a deer &c) respectively. It is mentioned in the Tantra-sastra that  liquors are considered extremely pure and that Devi (goddess) is pleased be yond measure, if any one would partake of them. Some portion of the Sanskrit  text is attached to this book, which when read will clearly show the import of  the subject. It will not be worthwhile to give meaning of all the Sanskrit pas sages, as a specimen, a few of them are translated in the first part.  

This book is intended for those men who wish to make a religious reform (dhar mani sudharana), and they should think of its merits and demerits.  Some Brdhmanas are upasakas (worshippers [conductors of worship]) from  times immemorial; they observe the worship (upasana) in their family from  generation to generation; some kings become the pupils of the Brahmanas  versed in the mystical science and believe that they will be greatly benefitted  thereby. Ganesa-sastri of Nasik was the religious chief (danadhyaksa) of Gaik-

280 ROBI N RINEHAR T AND TONY K. STEWAR T  

war Malhavara and was publicly recognised as an upasaka (worshipper). Some  prime-ministers of the Baroda State also belonged to this sect, and, as a rule,  the native states have many such men. Sivajivas[?] Maharaja had a mason,  named Ladaba-bhagata from Deccan, as well as four or five Brahmanas who  were Dravidas [from the south]; they showed some mystical tricks to the Ma 

haraja and he gave them a jagir or property worth a lakh of rupees and paid  money to build a temple. As many men are patronised by the kings, this system  is carried on without any detention. Every city has one-fourth part of its popu lation as Saktas - and the ceremonies are performed very secretly in the middle  of the night; if a king be a supporter, they are also observed publicly. It is very  curious to see that, in case a Brahmana is accused of drinking spirituous liquors,  the men who drink always are considered pure or virtuous and they themselves  insist on giving prayascitta [rites of atonement] to that man accused. It is  said: - The world is deceived in the broad day light by those cheats who pre tend to be omniscient, initiated (diksita), agnidava (having a great conflagration  by fire), knowers of Brahma[n] (God) and observers of religious austerities,  and who while away the nights of the full moon at the houses of harlots, in  enjoying pleasures characterised by profound love and fragrant mouthful of  liquors.  

When a country is characterised by dark, gloomy, thick, blind, and terrible  ignorance, heresy is considered a religion and a true religion is regarded as  heresy (pakhanda), while the credulous people are deceived by their cunning  preceptors. Formerly, there was the Vedic religion in this Gujarat, and it was  followed by the Sravaka, Vama-marga, Siva, and Vaisnava religions succes 

sively. It is said in the Mahiman stotra to this effect: "The Vedic, the Samkhya,  the Yoga, the Pasupati (Saiva) and the Vaisnava systems (came out after the  other)."  

All of these religions are now lost in oblivion and no one knows what his religion  is. The native princes and their subjects are sinking into ignorance; there are no  schools and teachers to impart religious instruction, and, as all religious books are  written in the Sanskrit language, no one knows their import; thus truth (artha) is  confounded with untruth (anartha) and the wicked and deceitful men serve their  selfish motives.  

Some modern Vedias (those who learn the Vedas by heart) and Josis (as trologers) say that they are upasakas (worshippers) and that the Devi (goddess)  is pleased with them; the kings do not take medicine from them unless they  (Vedias) say so. When such statements are made, the princes think that the  Devi is kind to those men and that they will be cured of the disease; these  (credulous) fellows are initiated by the Sastris, Panditas, and Mantrikas (versed  in the mystical science) who are regarded as their preceptors (gurus); they  believe that they will be greatly benefitted by tying talismans prepared by those  mystical men with coals (angara, yantra, tavija).  

The Mantra-Sastra is also called the Bengali Vidya (the learning of Bengal),  because the Gauda Brahmanas of Bengal used to come to Gujarata and DeccanTHE ANONYMOUS ACAMA PRAKASA 281  

and circulate there the mystical books (mantra-sastra-grantha), a large number  of which are even now found in Bengal and Kerala; they have not yet come to  this side. In Gujarata, temples dedicated to Kalika (kalika-sthapana) are found  in Dabhoi, Pavagadha, Ahamadabad, and Patana. The Bengali Brahmonas vis 

ited this country in the times of the Hindu kings and made some pupils; they  circulated some books and introduced Kalika. The killing of various animals  is sanctioned by the books on the Mantra-Sastra, but no mention is made any where about killing cows, though it is mentioned in many places in the Vedas;  from this it appears that the prohibition of killing cows was made in the Kali yuga or the iron age and that the Mantra-sastra came into existence afterwards.  The devotees or advocates of the last mentioned system require necessarily a  secluded place and sakti (literally power) that is to say a woman in all the  ceremonies (anusthana). The five makaras (beginning with madya, mamsa,  mina, mudra, and maithuna) [liquor, meat, fish, grain, and sexual intercourse]  are also called prathama (first), dvitiya (second), tritiya (third), caturthi  (fourth), and pancaml (fifth) respectively. In case all objects be not secured,  the ceremony is observed by taking the single prathama (madya = liquor);  if two or three things be had, they are only used in performing the rites.  The pancaml (fifth, viz, maithuna = cohabitation) is considered as amrta (nec tar or immortal[ity]) and it is produced from sakti (power = woman); and  hence it is that cohabitation with the woman is termed yajna (sacrifice) or the  dutiyaga.  

Siva is regarded as the founder (acarya) of this sytem. Now the question  arises why Siva should produce or advocate heresy (pakhanda), as all the books  treating of the Tantra-marga are said to be authorised by Siva. There is a logical  maxim [in Sanskrit] that even a fool does not move without having a special  object or aim in view. The meaning of the statement is even an idiot does not  do anything without some reason; what should be then the cause of such a  heresy (pakhanda); how did people believe in it and should we call him a god  or man who propagated a heretical system (pakhanda)!  

The Vama-marga is diametrically opposed to all religious or law books  (Dharma- sastra), morals and good customs. Not only do they not observe  caste-distinctions but they also disregard the marriage ceremonies. The men  and women perform the ceremony called the ghata-kancuki. Ghata-kancuki is  a peculiar and immoral rite according to which the bodices of different women  are placed in a pot and the men present at the ceremony are allowed one by  one to take out each bodice from it. Each then cohabits with the woman to  whom that particular bodice belongs. Any man takes any woman he happens  to find; the followers worship a naked woman and consider that they attain to  greater merit by getting a female of the Bhangina caste or one in her monthly  course. They worship her, eat the remainders of her food, and come into con tact with her; they do not observe any distinction between what should be  eaten and what should not be eaten, It is mentioned in the books of the Vama 

marga that one is highly benefitted by acting thus and taking this statement 

282 ROBI N RINEHAR T AND TONY K. STEWAR T  

into consideration, people join this sect (dharma). From this it appears that  there is no telling how mean one may become in the hope of deriving some  benefit; though he may be mistaken in his ideas as to right or wrong, still, as  soon as he sees some advantage, he does not shrink from committing the most  horrible deeds. All such men are naturally mean and wicked. There are indeed  many instances in history showing that a single man killed thousands of men,  burnt their city, committed dacoity, and put millions of people into an ocean  of misery for his own insignificant good. There have been instances, also, of  great men who made millions of people happy. Many efforts are necessary for  the nourishment and growth of man; no one would nourish the child of some  other person, even if thousands of rupees be offered but as God has given  instinct to the parents who nourish their children, this difficult task is attended  with success and thousands of men attain to maturity; their overgrowth be comes so very rapid that some of them cannot be supported, because many  men waste money in giving dinners and in marriage ceremonies and nourish  their children to no purpose. Good men are sorely wanting, but, if all parents  make their children virtuous, strong and useful, the world will abound in good  men. In these days, many useless people wander about for their livelihood and  are not afraid of acting in any way they like. The principle of education must  be such as would make men more useful and religious and must be accessible  to all men. As there was no education at all in this country many heretical  systems (pakhandas) took rise and people became wicked; their greatest exploit  is to quarrel and annoy one another. There is nothing like material confidence.  In a great kingdom like that of Baroda, the clerks, state-officials &c would envy  and destroy one another. Two men do not trust each other; that is their hearts  or thoughts are not in accord; in the same way the enmity inherent in the caste system has increased to such an extent that any reform is impossible. The  natives of this country are inferior even to the lower animals or beasts, because  they serve their selfish motives by ruining others; the enmity and wickedness  which they possess are not found even in beasts. When all this is considered,  it appears that the reasoning power vanished and futile learning (avidya) and  ignorance were on their increase. One should dispel foolishness (avidya ajnana) and propagate good and true religion.  

The tithis or days of a month are called tattva (essence) in the Devi-marga  while the days of a week are called natha (lord); there are thirty-six days in a  month and they are thus pronounced: "pha-mase, kha-yuge, pa-parivarte" (In  the month Pha, in the cycle Kha, in the year Pa). There are five paray anas, viz,  nityanatha (eternal lord), caturanga (four limbs), hamsa (a swan), cakra (a  wheel), deva (god), and their fruit is mentioned as follows [in Sanskrit from]  Saubhdgya-ratna-tantra: "The Nitya-parayana gives all accomplishments and  the Hamsa-parayana affords the highest object" (paramartha).  

The prefixes and suffixes called bijas are applied to some mantras. The man tra which is recited to gratify the desires is pronounced repeatedly, and this  repetition is called the samputi-patha. In the same way, when a Brahmana re-

THE ANONYMOUS ACAMA PRAKASA 283  

cites generally the candi (candi-patha) [glorification of the goddess Candi], he  receives two annas (3 pence) and if he were to repeat the samputi-patha with  all its ramifications, which is recited four times, he would charge eight annas  (one shilling) for every recitation. In the same way if he were to recite it nine  times, it would be called nava-candi and if hundred times, sata-candi. All these  actions are mentioned in the Tantras and though some Brahmanas censure the  Tantra-marga, still they observe the tantrika ceremonies. It is originally ar 

ranged that, if prayers are to be said to God or some other deity, they must be  offered from the mouth of a Brahmana; if a man of some other denomination  were to say such prayers, God or any other deity would not listen to them.  Prayers offered by a man of another caste do not become fruitful, therefore, if  men of any caste have to say prayers they must have them done through a  Brahmana who accords the merit or prayer to the sacrificer (yajamana). If a  child be born to some one in the mula asterism, the mula is appeased (mula  santi), that is to say a Brahmana is sent for and thus requested: "You say that  this child was born in the mula-asterism; sit and suggest some means to avoid  this danger." This ceremony is called "Varum." After the Brahmana is thus  requested, he makes avahana [invocation] of a particular deity mentioned in  the book which is intended for appeasing gods, or in other words, he invites  the god and appeases him by offering prayers (puja), japa, sacrifice, &c; the  sacrificer thinks that his difficulty is avoided thereby. In case the sacrificer were  not to observe this, the Brahmana would tell the women of the house, "As the  child is born in the mula-asterism, there is a great danger to the master (of the  house) and if you do not make santi (the act of appeasing) - just for the sake  of money (paisa), you may do anything you like. If you want to spend a small  sum (in performing the ceremony), you can invite four Brahmanas and spend  five rupees whereby everything will be propitious and you as well as your child  will be happy." Having heard these words of the Brahmana, the wife, if unex perienced, annoys her husband and puts him to expense. In the same way, the  Suklas (the priests of the Brahmanas) order many santis to be made in the  marriage ceremonies, and looking at the horoscopes of the bride and the bride groom says that the marriage should be brought about after appeasing Mangala  (Mars) because that planet is inauspicious. Thus the priest has his claim on all  things. If it does not rain or cholera and fever be ravaging, the santi should be  made and the disease disappears while the rain falls; such statements are made  in books but all this must be done through a Brahmana and at the end of all  ceremonies the Brahmanas should be fed, otherwise the rites observed are of  no avail. If a complaint be made to a god (devata) it must be mentioned to a  Brahmana who will convey it to that particular deity who gives such a reply as  would satisfy the Brahmana, therefore it is considered better to feed more Brah manas and give more daksina (alms in the shape of money). No one should  give less than what he can afford to pay. It is said: "One should not be cunning  in money matters."  

No religion has such methods (sadhana) as that of the Brahmanas. There are 

2 8 4 ROBI N RINEHAR T AND TONY K . STEWAR T  

answers found in the Sastras to whatever you may ask. If one drops a lamp  from his hand there is a santi for it and it is called the dipa-patana-santi (the  act of appeasing for dropping a lamp). If you invite a Brahmana at the time of  death, he would afford final beatitude (to the dead man) for two pices (penny)  which sum is regarded as a lakh of rupees spent (for the purpose). They show  a way to the poor as well as to the rich men in proportion to their abilities;  there is no difficulty or refusal to a question of any kind. There is no reply  only to one who enters into discussion or uses reasoning. There is no liberty  in the Sastras to ask what this is and what its cause is. If any one questions  that, he is called an atheist or scorner (mindaka) of the Sastras. There is every thing in the Sastras, if you listen without a discussion. If a goat is to be sacri 

ficed, it (the ceremony) is found in the candi-patha; while if a pumpkin is to  be cut, if a japa is to be made or a marjana [purification] is to be performed,  there is a sanction found in the Sastra. You get whatever you require. Whence  can such a kama-dhenu (a cow fulfilling all desires) be had? One should only  give his consent to hearing what is said. This is the state of the Hindu-Sastras,  and particularly in the Agamas, this principle is carried on to a very great  extent.  

The ceremonies of the followers of the Vama-marga are ten times greater  than those of the adherents of the Vedas. In the Vama-marga, the puja (wor ship) is called yaga [yajna](sacrifice), the Kall-yaga is named as anusthana in  which a sacrifice is made by repeating a thousand names of Kali. In all the  ceremonies (anusthana), there is a great deal of nyasa, mudra, and japa. In some  ceremonies, red peppers and bhilana [?] are sacrificed. They make a doll of the  man by the name of whom the ceremony is undertaken and after piercing a  knife in the body of the doll and destroying its eyes, sacrifice it piece by piece  and recite mantras; this ceremony is called marana [killing] or abhicara-karman  (act of killing). The Syena-yaga mentioned in the Tantras is intended for killing  enemies but there are thousands of such ceremonies in the books of Agamas  and the credulous men consider them valid, while the heretical Mantra-sastris  take an undue advantage. Thus there is a great deal of mischief in this subject.  If you go to a city like Baroda and examine the state of the thing, there you  will see much of it. 

### 16 Conversation between Guru Hasan Kabiruddm and  Jogi Kanipha

Conversation between Guru Hasan Kabiruddm and  Jogi Kanipha: Tantra Revisited by the  

Isma"ili Preachers  

Dominique-Sila Khan  

Ismailism, a form of Shi'a Islam, entered the Indian subcontinent toward the end  of the eighth century C.E. In 1094 it underwent a major split, from which there  emerged two main branches. The Nizari sect, originally known as the "new mis sion," was first based in Iran, but soon spread to Syria and Central Asia, as well  as into the subcontinent, perhaps as early as the twelfth century. As Daftary and  Corbin have shown, Isma'ilism can be broadly defined as a well-organized rev olutionary type of movement, undergirded by a complex esoteric philosophy.  Persecuted by the Sunni rulers of Delhi, who cast themselves as the representatives  of an "orthodox" or "normative" Islam, the Indian Isma'ilis, viewed as heretics,  generally resorted to the Shi'a custom of precautionary concealment of one's true  faith (taqiyya). At the same time, they adopted a strategy that involved accepting  most of the beliefs and practices of the people they sought to convert while  gradually transforming the same to fit the requirements of their own doctines.  This method, however, should not be viewed solely as a tactic for conversion but  rather as an essential part of Isma'ili philosophy: not merely a later evolute of  Islam, their faith was also a "culmination of Hinduism." Rather than rejecting the  established beliefs and practices of local populations, the Nizari missionaries ab sorbed and adapted them in order to create what Maclean has righly called "an  innovative synthesis," in which Muslim and Hindu elements were harmoniously  combined.  

In fact, the syncretic form of Isma'ilism that developed on the subcontinent  closely resembles many other religious movements of the medieval period, and  as such, was referred to as Satpanth (literally the "true path" or "true sect") - a  name retained until recent times. This"historical phase of acculturation came to  a gradual end toward the close of the nineteenth century. The first changes oc-

286 DOMINIQUE-SIL A KHAN  

curred with the arrival of the Aga Khan (the living Imam of the Isma'ilis) on the  subcontinent in the 1840s. As increasing numbers of Isma'ilis, convinced that  they were no longer subject to persecution, came out of concealment and began  searching for a new identity, the whole movement was gradually re-Islamicized - a process that has continued down to the present day. Nonetheless, the "syncretic"  phase - some six to seven centuries in duration - has left a lasting mark on the  Nizari sect, in the form of readily accessible rituals and texts. This "innovative  synthesis" was clearly the fruit of extensive exchanges and interactions with the  many indigenous (Jain and Hindu) belief systems that were prevalent in the me 

dieval period. Because of the practice of taqiyya, as well as of a typical conversion  strategy, Nizari missionaries on the subcontinent never revealed themselves for  whom they were: as Nanji has stressed, they presented themselves, according to  the context in which they were preaching, as Sufi dervishes, or as Hindu jogis  (yogi in Hindi, from the Sanskrit yogin, "practitioner of yoga").  

On the Hindu side, the Nizari preachers drew from a variety of sources, both  Vaisnava and Saiva. They developed their own doctrine of Visnu's descents (ava taras), equating Kalki, the tenth of these, with their Imam who, apart from being  a religious leader, was considered to be a manifestation of Divine Light. Of greater  impact, however, were Saiva ideas and practices, most particularly those involving  Tantric forms of yoga. It is obvious, from numerous references found in the Nizari  textual sources, that the followers of Gorakhnath and other of the Nath masters  (also referred to as jogis) deeply influenced the literature and rituals of subcon tinental Isma'ilis.  

The Nizari literature is revealing in this regard. So, for example, the Agakhani  Khojas who now form the majority of Nizari Isma'ilis in India and Pakistan, have  preserved a rich and wide-ranging corpus of sacred texts generally referred to as  ginans (the word ginan means "knowledge" or "wisdom," and is derived from the  Sanskrit jnana). Composed in a blend of north Indian vernacular languages, most  of these were intended to be sung (and many still are sung ) in jamat khanas,  their sacred assembly and prayer halls. Ginans may be replete with terminology  proper to Tantric yoga, and at times entire ginans will be devoted to hatha yoga  and the Nath tradition. These include an Isma'ili version of the story of the  illustrious royal renouncer Gopicand and his sister (a work signed by Pir Shams,  a famous thirteenth- or fourteenth-century missionary and saint); a series of po ems explicitly referred to as Jogvanis ("discourses on yoga," attributed to Imam  Shah, a fifteenth-century figure); and the text that will be presented here, a meet ing between Jogi Kanipha and Imam Shah's father, Hasan Kabiruddin.  

At this point, we need to say a few words about the rituals of the subcontinental  Nizari Isma'ilis, insofar as they have been influenced by Tantric practices. As  Shackle and Moir have noted, the organization of religious life in the Satpanth  (the acculturated form of subcontinental Nizari Isma'ilism) differs from the fa 

miliar patterns found in "orthodox" Sunni Islam. Traditionally, Nizarrs neither  went to mosque nor recited the five daily prayers, but rather maintained and  continue to maintain their own jamat khanas, open exclusively to members of 

ISMAIL I PREACHER S 28 7  

the community, the "assembly of the faithful" (jamat), where they recite the morn ing, evening, and nighttime prayers, and sing ginans. Their most characteristic  ritual is the ghat-pat ceremony (ghat means "pot," and pat refers to the low wood en table on which this vessel is placed), which centers on the distribution of  sacred water from the pot, which is either mixed with clay from Karbala (a Shi'a  holy site) or blessed by the imam. As Ivanow has rightly stated, this rite may be  viewed as a symbol of conversion and participation in the religious life of the  community. Typically, the holy water of which all the followers partake - in a  kind of communion - is referred to in the sacred literature as ami (from the  Sanskrit amrta, the "ambrosia" or "nectar of immortality"); the same term is used  in Hinduism for the sacred fluid in which the feet of a divine image or one's guru  have been bathed.  

A number of scholars consider this ritual to have been inspired by Tantric or  Sakta cults, especially those "of the left-hand" (vammarg; vamamarga in Sanskrit),  which may well have been prevalent among such major convert groups as the  Lohanas (a trading caste of the Sindh region) and untouchables. By accepting  certain of their practices, and recasting them into a new mold to meet the re 

quirements of Nizari Isma'ili ideals, the process of conversion was presumably  made smoother. Let us briefly mention the elements of the Satpanth! ritual which  recall the Vammargi ceremonies.  

secrecy: those who had not been initiated into the Satpanth were not allowed to attend  their ceremonies  

joint participation of men, women and children  

caste mixing: all communities, including untouchables, commune in the assembly halls  communal drinking of consecrated water which, as Ivanow has observed, is intended  to replace the semen partaken of in Sakta or left-handed Tantric rituals  the pot itself in which the water is kept is traditionally worshiped by Hindus as the  Goddess, of whom it is a symbol  

Here, it is worth noting that, perhaps due to the secrecy that surrounded the  Nizari rituals, Indian Isma'ilis, viewed as heretics by the Sunni rulers (including  the fourteenth-century Sultan Alauddin Khilji), were accused of indulging in "free  licence and incest" - an accusation more accurately leveled against Vammargi  practitioners.  

In conclusion, it may be said that, in conformity with the spirit of Isma'ilism,  the ritual complex of the Satpanthis ought not to be regarded solely as a "revision"  of Tantra, but also as its "consummation," in the same way that the Nizari sect  as a whole, in its Indian form, may be viewed as the culmination of earlier Hindu  systems. This is further corroborated by the fact that the spiritual message of the  Satpanth and its religious literature were considered to be a secret "fifth Veda,"  called the Athar Ved (literally, the "immobile, stable Veda," not be confused with  the fourth Veda, the Atharva Veda). Here as well, we may detect a reference to  Tantric revelation, which is also viewed as a fifth Veda that, unlike the four original  Vedas, is accessible to women as well as men from every caste. 

288 DOMINIQUE-SIL A KHAN  

The text translated here deals with the imaginary encounter between two presti gious religious figures: a Nath jogi who is an exponent of Tantric yoga, and a  Nizari missionary. In spite of its obvious anachronisms and other implausible  elements, this dialogue - in which the representatives of two different spiritual  paths exchange their views - undoubtedly reflects an historical situation in which  interactions took place between Nath jogis and Isma'ili pirs (even if this ginan in  its written form is the creation of a much later period, the eighteenth or nineteenth  century). It is worth noting that some of its parts are still sung in the sacred  assemblies of the Khojas, as Zawahir Moir, who remembers entire portions of it,  has informed me.  

The choice of Kanipha Nath as the central figure of the text, in the role of the  jogi, is certainly not a concidence here. On the one hand, he is one of the foremost  masters of the Kanphata ("split-eared") jogis and is listed as one of the renowned  Nine Naths. In addition, as Briggs has noted, there is a tradition that traces the  origins of the Vammarg to this disciple of Jalandhar Nath, who was himself one  of the original Naths. Even today Kanipha is revered as the head guru of the  Kalbelya jogis of northwest India, a community of snake charmers who have  preserved various traditions and customs connected with Tantric yoga.  

The story opens with Kanipha being cursed by his guru, Jalandhar Nath. With  the curse, however, the jogi predicts that his disciple's salvation will eventually  come through a saint named Guru Hasan Kabiruddin who was, as we know, a  famous Isma'ili missionary. According to Isma'ili tradition, Hasan Kabiruddin  concealed his identity in the course of his missionary activities, appearing either  in the guise of a Sufi pir (a Muslim "saint" - he continues to be revered by the  Sunni Suhrawardi order of Sufis as Hasan Darya); or, as Upanga has noted, as a  vegetarian Hindu sadhu dressed in white or saffron robes.  

Jalandhar Nath adds that his disciple will recognize his new master when Kan ipha's miraculous chariot, now suspended in mid-air, suddenly falls from the sky.  This happens on the day that the jogi reaches the city of Uch (at that time the  center of the Nizari mission on the subcontinent). Although Hasan Kabiruddin is  but a child, he has attained true wisdom. The dialogue begins when, surprisingly  enough in a Nath context, Kanipha's new guru reveals to him the "true" secret of  Visnu's ten avataras. (Here, as in other cases, it is obvious that the prestigious  Vaisnava model is being used to counterbalance the Saiva and Sakta idioms of  the Kanphata jogis). This new revelation, however, concerns the "true" (according  to the Nizari doctrine) identity of the tenth incarnation of Visnu. This is Kalki,  whom he equates with Imam Ali (the Prophet's son-in-law) and, as such, with  every living Imam considered to be his cyclic reincarnation. Guru Hasan Kabi ruddin claims that 'Ali, the manifestation of Divine Light, is the original founder  of the Satya Dharm, the "religion of truth," an equivalent of the term Satpanth.  Oddly enough, this appears in the manuscript form of the ginan as Saiv Dharm,  the "Saiva religion"; once more, this may be viewed as an allusion to the fact that  the Nizari spiritual message does not contradict or negate the faith of the Saiva  Naths but ought rather to be viewed as a kind of "super-Saivism," a new revelation  that supercedes the earlier one. 

ISMAIL I PREACHER S 289  

Although he is impressed at first by his new guru's knowledge, Kanipha still  considers himself to be the wiser of the two, and seeks to please the pir by  asserting that he will be rewarded for his wisdom and will obtain miraculous  powers (riddhi-siddhi), liberation (mukti), and immortality (acal pad). To his sur 

prise, the child-guru retorts that all these achievements (typical of Tantric yoga)  are devoid of value. There then follows a discussion of the four yugas (cosmic  ages); the nature of the world and of God; and the role played by Hasan Kabi ruddin's predecessor, the great pir Sadruddin, who is credited with most of the  syncretic features of the Satpanth. Recognizing the differences between this new  teaching and his former beliefs, Kanipha wishes to know to which sect (panth,  literally "path" or "way") Hasan Kabiruddin belongs. Everyone, answers the guru,  belongs to a sect (or follows a path), but it is he who will reveal the "true path"  (Satpanth). He begins with a stinging criticism of all the outward signs by which  the Kanphata jogi distinguishes himself: "What kind of jogi are you," asks Kabi ruddin, "if you shave your head but do not shave your mind?" The true jogi  should don "mental" earrings (mudras), smear the "ashes of truth" on his body,  and so on. Emphasis is thus given to "inner religion," which actually coincides  with the essential Isma'ili doctrine of the superiority of the esoteric truth (batin)  over the externals of religion (zahir). The dialogue continues in question-and answer form, the answers being much longer than questions, and often takes the  form of short devotional songs (like the ginans sung in Ismaili assemblies).  

The passage translated here corresponds to the second and final portion of the  text and represents sightly less than half of its total length. Differing in its content  and tone from the first portion, it treats of what might be termed "inner yoga";  that is, everything a yogin should be and do, according to Satpanthi philosophy.  Curiously enough, direct references to Islamic or typically Nizari terminology are  scarce; however, a few bear mentioning: Allah and the Prophet; paradise depicted  as Amrapuri, the "City of Immortality"; Islam Shah, the living Imam who was a  contemporary of Hasan Kabiruddin; the "true believer" (momin, a term that refers  to a Muslim in general and, in the Isma'ili context, to a member of the Nizari  community); and the community of the faithful (gat).  

In contradistinction, the passage is replete with words belonging to the sphere  of Hinduism and of Tantric yoga. These include: intellect (cit); consciousness  (caitan); the elixir (rasa, literally "essence," "flavor," or "meaning"), the three prin cipal channels of the yogic body (ida, pingala and susumna) and the moon (canda,  identified with the ida channel), the stage in which the yogin experiences the  "inner sound" (surat-nirat), the mystical sound (nad), supernatural powers (riddhi siddhi), and so forth. The soul is called hansa (literally, "migratory bird"), and the  Spiritual Master the Hansa Purus, literally, the "Man of the soul or breath." The  body is also described as navsar (literally "nine-head"), and inhabited by "five  ministers," probable allusions to the yogic image of the nine bodily orifices and  the five senses.  

The lesson that is transmitted by the Isma'ili pir to his Nath disciple does not,  therefore, deny the value of such purely hatha yogic techniques as postures (as anas), breath control (pranayama), and meditation (dhyan). However, it simulta-

290 DOMINIQUE-SIL A KHAN  

neously emphasizes the necessity of true knowledge and of following a guru who  alone can show the true path. "Search with your breath, and place your hope in  the Invisible Master (Alakh Purus, literally, the "Cosmic man who defies descrip tion") is a message comprehensible to Nath and Nizari alike. The Isma'ili Guru  is also represented by alchemical symbols, which are an essential part of Tantric  yogic imagery: " If you find the Guru you will be transmuted"; and "The true  Guru is like mercury, the sadhu is like copper: if the two are rubbed together one  obtains gold." As will be seen throughout, characteristically Tantric "intentional  language" (sandha bhasa) is also used extensively, for example to describe the state  experienced by the accomplished yogin: "sound (nad) is resounding without a  mouth . . . without feet you come and go."  

The final portion of the text, immediately preceding the brief conclusion (in  which it is related that Kanipha is released from his guru's curse and granted  liberation) is actually a devotional song, a short ginan that, in the Nizari tradition,  is also attributed to an earlier missionary, Pir Shams, and which appears in Kas 

sam's selected translations of the ginans. It seemingly sums up the entire message  of the Satpanthi preachers, asserting what a "true jogi" or fakir (holy man, literally  "poor man") should be. Therefore, in accordance with the imaginary vision of the  poets who composed this text, one could say that Kanipha does not, by becoming  a member of the Isma'ili community, cease to be a yogin, because the Satpanth  is a kind of "super-yoga" that encompasses and complements the traditional val 

ues of Tantra.  

The Conversation between Guru Hasan Kabiruddin and Jogi Kanipha exists in both  manuscript and printed form. The manuscripts are written in the sacred (and  once secret) alphabet of the Nizari Khojas known as Khojki, whereas the printed  texts use both the Khojki and the Gujarati scripts. No critical texts have yet been  established, and the publications that are available are more or less revised copies  of a collection of ginans brought together by an Isma'ili named Lalji Devraj at the  beginning of the twentieth century; these constituted the official canon at that  time. Here we have used a version published in Bombay in 1921; no other pub lication data are available. I am deeply indebted to Zawahir Moir, who not only  provided me with the text in Gujarati script but also helped me to understand its  meaning and establish the translation.

2. The guru says: Give up what has come and go and take the truth, says my  true Guru. Eat only after having carefully considered, O Jogi!  

3. The jogi says: Impurity says, "I am the queen of the world." Impurity is  removed by water, and the impurity of water by wind - but who will remove  the impurity of the soul, O Pir?  

4. The guru says: The body is like a pot, the mind is like musk, and knowledge  is the light of the soul. The man in whose heart Allah and the Prophet dwell - why should he be affected by impurity, O Jogi?  

5. The jogi says: Who is the learned brahman (pandit)? What is the flesh 

292 DOMINIQUE-SIL A KHAN  

(pind)? Whose children are you [the Nizans]? With whom should one eat?  How may one reach the City of Immortality [paradise], O Pir?  

6. The guru says: the mind is called the pandit; the body our pind; we are the  children of the venerable Islam Shah; in the assembly of the pious, meditation  should be your food: in this way you shall reach the City of Immortality, O  Jogi 

7. The jogi says: What is your sacred thread? What is your loincloth? What is  your word? What is your sacred book, O Pir?  

8. The guru says: The absence of grief is our sacred thread; the suppression of  grief is our loincloth; permanence is our word; the body is our sacred book, O  Jogi!  

9. The jogi says: What is the city? What is the place? Who are the ministers?  Who is the king? Who is the vizier? Tell me this, O Pir!  

10. The guru says: The city is the body; navsar ["nine-head"] is the place, and  there are five ministers within. The soul (hansa) is the king, the breath (pavan)  is the vizier: know [the secret of] this city, O Jogi!  

11. The jogi says : Who is asleep? Who is awake? Who identifies the ten  directions? Who recognizes the Guru? Who brings one to the [true] path, O  Pir?  

12. The guru says: The soul is awake; the flesh is asleep; cosmic illusion (maya)  identifies the ten directions and knowledge recognizes the Guru. It is therefore  knowledge that brings one to the [true] path, O Jogi!  

13. The jogi says: Which are the pilgrimage centers of the four cosmic ages,  and which are the pilgrimage sites of the true believers? Which is the pilgrim age site of the running river, and which is that of the six philosophical schools,  OPir?  

14. The guru says: The pilgrimage sites of the four cosmic ages are nonexistent;  the pilgrimage sites of the true believer are [composed of] knowledge; the  pilgrimage site of the running river is within [you]; the Satpanth is the true  pilgrimage, [replacing] the six philosophical schools, O Jogi!  

15. The jogi says: How many years will the clouds give rain? Who will obtain  salvation, heaven, or the inner world?  

16. The guru says: The clouds will give rain for thirty-six years; both heaven  and the inner world will be saved. Therefore, take heed in your mind, O sadhu:  there is no other salvation - it is ahead, it is far away where there is no teaching,  no sound, no ego, no primeval chaos. So says Pir Hasan Kabiruddin, O Jogi!  

O Jogi, take heed in your mind! Here is the path to salvation - listen!

PART TWO  

1. O renouncer, if you conquer the mind you can fulfill your desires, and if  you conquer the mind you will experience great bliss. If you conquer the heart  you will experience happiness; in this way [the fruit of] the yoga is ripened.  

2. O renouncer, if you conquer lust and anger then the truth will become  sacred. If you conquer the intellect the moon will become pure - it becomes  totally pure, O sadhu!  

3. O renouncer, they ask for the elixir, and they wish to taste the nectar of  immortality, and they seek the lord of knowledge. The king of heaven has  made the body a throne, yet they go on searching for the Supreme Master  [outside of themselves]!  

4. O renouncer, the body is full of lust and desire is a goddess. But it is con sciousness that is the abode of the Supreme Master. Anger and selfishness are  the kings of the armies, and meditations on the inner sound are his ministers,  O renouncer!  

5. Above everything it is the Name that leads you to your inner depth. Action  (karma) is the true throne of the Master. When both yoga and practice are  conjoined, O Lord, then any action you perform is done well.  

6. O renouncer, slay your desires, keep your mind concentrated, and do your  own cooking [work for your own transformation]. Control the postures, do  not fall asleep - and all will take place as the Lord ordains, O renouncer!  

7. O renouncer, if you find your Guru he will tell you the meaning, and the  doubts of your mind will be removed. Without water the lotus flower does not  bloom: only the fool would laugh at this, O renouncer!  

8. O renouncer, if you find your [true] Guru, you will be transmuted! O sadhu,  without a guru you cannot find the path. Within the circle of knowledge shin ing lamps appear: therefore without a guru [whose knowledge provides light  to his disciple], this will remain out of reach, O renouncer!  

9. O renouncer, the night is dark! Your companions are your enemies, and  you are dwelling in another man's house! How will you find the path without  a guide? Make haste and consider this, O renouncer!  

10. O renouncer, the true Guru is like mercury, the sadhu is like copper: if  the two are rubbed together one obtains gold. Just as you see yourself mirrored  in water, so your vision is made pure, O renouncer!  

11. O renouncer, purity is the door to the true Guru's dwelling and compassion  is the Supreme Master's fragrance. The heart is like a pot - search with your  breath, and place your trust in the Invisible Master! 

294 DOMINIQUE-SIL A KHAN  

12. O renouncer, it is easy to slip in the narrow passage of the heart! There  even a needle cannot find its way, so ride the chariot of your breath and be  like a king on a throne. Control it, letting it enter in and exit regularly.  

13. O renouncer, blossoms are blooming and there is no tree; sound (nad) is  resounding without a mouth! Without speech the praises of the Lord are sung;  without feet you come and go, O renouncer!  

14. O renouncer, make your mind your seat, strap in your consciousness, and  enjoy the giddy ride! Ida, pingala and susumna are your slaves - they are the  servants of the true Guru, O renouncer!  

15. Search your body to find its silken thread and do what the Guru says. Like  the mother-of-pearl that anxiously waits for the rain [that produces the pearl],  so the soul swells with eagerness to meet the Lord, O renouncer!  

16. O renouncer, when the Spiritual Master appears before you the body is  purified. Meditate without the body, O you whose limbs are smeared [with  ashes], then [you will not be a god] but will reach a divine state.  

17. O renouncer, both sound and the absence of sound are the manifestations  of the Guru. Intellect and truth are your companions. The Guru's renewed  miracles will be yours to experience. [Learning to practice true] knowledge  and meditation is like [riding] an elephant.  

18. O renouncer, those who wake to enjoy the divine elixir will ripen, while  those who remain asleep will lose it. They will therefore lose the path, O Gu sain! It is only fools who wish to sleep, O renouncer!  

19. O renouncer, it is in the inner self that the miraculous powers dwell and  it is there that the eternal play goes on. In the inner self the Lord has planted  a garden and therein the gardener dwells.  

20. O renouncer, in the inner self is the earth with its nine continents; within  it is Mount Kailasa; and within it are the seven seas. Without a guru the cup  [of the nectar of immortality] is lost!  

21. O renouncer, the Lord has said, "Look into your inner self!" Only then  will you gain the sacred vision of the Master. Pir Hasan Kabiruddin says, "Lis ten, O people of the jamat, you will then have no more rebirths!  

O Jogis, you must live in this way - listen!  

DOHA [COUPLET]  

Famished and exiled, the heart is sad - on your seat be firm!  Those who vanquish the fear of the grave deserve the name of fakir!  

O Jogi, this is the [true] way of begging alms - listen: 

ISMAIL I PREACHER S 295  

PART THREE  

1. O renouncer, make the world you mendicant's bag and satisfaction your  begging bowl; may your reflection be your staff! Place the two earrings of  forgiveness and compassion in your ears, and let knowledge be your food. O  renouncer! He is the true jogi in this world: he whose mind is one, he is the  true jogi!  

2. O renouncer, knowledge is my guru, [true] renunciation is of the senses.  May the conjunctions [of opposites?] be your ashes! He who accepts the true  religion and meditates on the truth, he is the true jogi! O renouncer, he is the  true jogi!  

3. O renouncer, stop both the moon and the sun [the left and right channels],  choosing concentration as your staff. Then the susumna [the central channel]  will begin to reverberate: few indeed are those who know this secret!  

4. O renouncer, wash your sins away in the triple confluence; play the un struck sound! Hasan Kablruddin says: "Die while your are living, and you shall  not be reborn. O renouncer, he [who does so] is the true jogi in this world!"  

Having listened to this ginan of spiritual teaching, Kanipha prayed and spoke:  

Kanipha says: O Guru, thanks to you I have found the path to liberation and  through the grace of the blessed Guru jalandhar I have had darsan [vision] of  you! You have imparted to me the knowledge of liberation! I offer you obei sance!  

Thus, in various ways, the path to liberation was revealed to him by Guru  Hasan Kabiruddm - and he enjoyed it. 

## Tantric Paths 

### 17 Emptiness and Dust: Zen Dharma  

Transmission Rituals  

William Bodiford  

Although the Shingon lineage of Kukai (774 - 835) and the Tendai lineage of  Saicho (767 - 822) can be most readily identified as the Tantric mainstream  within Japanese Buddhism, we must not overlook the pervasive influence of Tan tric rituals, Tantric deities, and Tantric symbolism on Japanese religious traditions  in general. Even today fire invocations (homa in Sanskrit, goma in Japanese), for  example, are ubiquitous not just in Shingon and Tendai, but also in Hosso, Ni chiren, and Zen lineages, as well as in Shinto (Japan's so-called "native" religion),  mountain asceticism (shugendo), and many New Age religions, such as Agonshu.  In medieval times, before the eighteenth-century renaissance of Buddhist schol arship gave birth to a heightened sense of sectarian identity among these lineages,  Tantric imagery was even more common than it is now. For this reason, scholars  of Japanese culture often refer to medieval Japanese religions as kenmitsu (com bined exoteric and esoteric Tantric) Buddhism.  

Prime examples of Tantric tendencies within medieval Zen can be found in the  once common practice of secret initiations into the esoteric lore of Zen, and in  the documents (kirikami) on which the contents of such initiations were recorded.  These initiations were reserved for the most advanced disciples, those who would  inherit the dharma lineage of their master and thereby become Zen masters in  their own right. Conducted in absolute secrecy over a period of several weeks or  months, the initiations would reveal to the disciple both special ritual techniques,  which the master and disciple would rehearse, as well as the symbolic associations  from which the ritual techniques derived their religious power. Over the course  of the initiations, the disciple would record on separate single sheets of paper (the  original meaning of the term kirikami) key terms, signs, and gestures for each  ritual. Some of the rituals taught in this way were exactly the same as the ones  transmitted in Shingon or Tendai lineages. The most interesting initiation docu ments for students of Zen, however, are the ones that focus on Zen itself. 

3 0 0 WILLIA M BODIFOR D  

Two such documents are translated below. While reading these translations, it  is important to remember that these documents have become available to the  general public only because modern-day Zen masters no longer maintain the  tradition of esoteric initiations that such documents represent. They have also  abandoned, therefore, the traditions of hands-on knowledge and oral explanation  necessary to understand fully the content of these texts. For this reason, much of  the symbolism remains obscure.  

The first document, entitled "Emptiness and Dust Ritual" (Kujinsho) concerns  the ritual of dharma transmission in which the disciple merges his mind and his  body with that of his teacher. Its title implies the merging of the universal, timeless  truth of emptiness (sunyata), or buddhahood, with limited, historical phenomena  (the dust of ordinary existence). It explains the mythological origins of the Zen  lineage in just such a ritual union and how this same form of union must be  reenacted in present-day dharma transmission ceremonies. The mythological or 

igin of Zen, of course, lies in the oft-told story of how one day on Vulture Peak  (Grdhrakuta) Sakyamuni, the historical Buddha, preached a sermon not with  words but by holding up a flower. Maha Kasyapa was the only one of Sakyamuni's  many disciples who grasped the true significance of this wordless teaching, which  he expressed by a slight smile. Sakyamuni thereupon selected Maha Kasyapa to  inherit his dharma robe and his dharma lineage as the second Zen ancestor.  Although this story might seem to suggest that the secret, wordless, mind-to 

mind transmission of the true dharma occurred at the moment when Sakyamuni's  flower met Maha Kasyapa's smile, in reality, according to our document, the  formal conveyance of the dharma did not occur until a secret ceremony later that  night.  

The Emptiness and Dust Ritual document explains how the spiritual union of  Sakyamuni and his disciple was symbolized by a wide variety of ritual forms that  the contemporary Zen master and his disciple must reenact: flames leap from  one torch to the next (symbolized in the document by a two-headed flaming  chicken); teacher and disciple reflect one another by covering their faces with  mirrors; they mix their blood together, and they use their mixed blood as ink to  write their names together; the teacher anoints the disciple, who then anoints the  teacher. After each ritual element the teacher and disciple must recite together:  "Future generations must never terminate the lineage of the buddha-to-buddha  transmission."  

The most powerful tangible symbol created during this ritual is a genealogical  table known as "blood lineage" chart (kechimyaku). Beginning with Sakyamuni,  the table lists the names of each generation (both real and imagined) of Zen  ancestors down to the present. This list of names constitutes a "blood lineage"  (kechimyaku) in several senses of the word. First, as mentioned above, the master  and disciple physically mix their blood together to produce ink for writing the  chart. The spiritual connection between each individual person named provides  the life blood that sustains the religious experience of Zen awakening, and the  written list of names forms a text that can be used as a magical talisman to confirm 

EMPTINES S AND DUS T 301  

the faith of the present generation in the reality of that awakening. In popular  religious lore, a properly written blood lineage chart can exorcise ghosts and free  the dead from the torments of hell. The intangible, wordless essence of the Buddha  wisdom is symbolized by Vajra Jewel Precepts (kongo ho fan) that are transmitted  along with the blood lineage chart. For this reason, the Emptiness and Dust Ritual  document identifies dharma transmission ritual as a special kind of precept or dination ceremony.  

The second document, entitled The Unsurpassed Ultimate Blood Line of the Bo dhisattva Precepts in the Orthodox Transmission of the Buddhas and Ancestors (Busso  shoden bosatsukai kechimyaku saigoku mujo no koto), makes explicit the soteriolog ical implications of the first document. It begins by asserting that the blood lineage  is the fundamental body of all buddhas and all living beings. The circle surround ing the names of Sakyamuni Buddha and Maha Kasyapa at the head of the lineage  chart signifies the true blood lineage, which is none other than the bright "moon  disk" of wisdom that "constitutes the fundamental mind of living beings." It goes  on to explain that the disciple attains sudden awakening at the moment when he  receives the ordination with the Vajra Jewel Precepts. In this awakened state, all  dualities, including all distinctions between good and evil, collapse. Every aspect  of the precept ordination is charged with soteriological significance. The teacher's  bowing to the disciple enacts the descent of the universal (honji) into the particular  (suijaku), whereas the disciple's bowing to the teacher represents the ascent of the  particular into the universal. The union of both ascent and descent is achieved as  both teacher and disciple leave the initiation site together. A five-colored string  is tied around the blood lineage chart because living beings fundamentally are  the Five Wisdom Buddhas of the Womb Mandala. The string is tied with nine  knots because living beings possess nine types of consciousness, and so forth.  

The physical layouts of the original documents are also noteworthy. The Emp tiness and Dust Ritual document is long and thin, with a circle at the top of the  document, followed by text, followed by a list of names, and concluding with  more text. The circle at the top of the document contains the names of Sakyamuni  Buddha and his disciple Maha Kasyapa. The circle itself is labeled as depicting a  small mirror of the type that the teacher and disciple will wear on their heads  during the dharma transmission ritual. The list of names in the middle of the  document consists of all the Indian, Chinese, and Japanese patriarchs in the Zen  genealogy. The dictionary forms of the names of the first ten Japanese Zen masters  listed are as follows: Dogen (1200-1253), Ejo (1198-1280), Gikai (1219-1309),  Keizan Jokin (1264-1325), Gasan Joseki (1276-1366), Tsugen Jakurei (1322- 1391), Tenshin Jisho (d. 1413), Kido Choo (d. 1410), Sesso Ichijun (1377- 

1455), and Tenno Soin (d. 1467). A red line, written in the blood of the master  and disciple, runs from the top circle down the right margin of the text through  the list of names and then back up the left margin back to the circle. The Emptiness  and Dust Ritual document also contains a brief glossary of the esoteric meaning  of each word in the phrase "I entrust (fuzoku) so-and-so with the Lineage of the  Wisdom Eye that Perceives the True Dharma (shdbogenzo), the Marvelous Mind 

3 0 2 WILLIA M BODIFOR D  

of Nirvana (shobo genzo nehan myoshin)." Both documents conclude with fictitious  stories that tell how the original copies of the documents were brought to Japan  from China by Dogen, the founder of the Soto lineage of Japanese Zen. Finally,  both documents are signed and dated by Kyugai Donryo, about whom nothing  is known other than the fact that he once served as the abbot of Yokoji Zen  monastery.  

The Kujinsho kirikami, copied in 1637 by Kyugai Donryo is a Yokoji (Ishikawa  prefecture) initiation document. It was photographed September 5, 1980 by Ka neda Hiroshi. (Kaneda serial nos. 2-5). The transcription is in Ishikawa Rikizan,  "Chusei Sotoshu kirikami no bunrui shiron, 12: shitsunai (shiho, sanmotsu, kech imyaku) kankei o chushin to shite," Komazawa daigaku Bukkyo gakubu ronshu 19  (1988): 165-167.  

Busso shoden bosatsukai kechimyaku saigoku mujo no koto, copied in 1622 by  Kyugai Donryo, seal by Meian Tosai, is also a Yokoji (Ishikawa prefecture) initi ation document. It was photographed September 5, 1980 by Kaneda Hiroshi  (Kaneda serial nos. 101-2).

Further Reading  

Regarding the roles of secret initiations and precept ordinations in the develop ment of Zen Buddhism in Japan, see William M. Bodiford, Soto Zen in Medieval  Japan (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1993), as well as two of his forth coming articles: "Bodhidharma's Precepts in Japan," and "Documents of Insight:  Initiation Documents (kirikami) in Japanese Zen." The ways that Zen monastic  rituals serve to construct religious authority from dharma lineages is illustrated  in Robert H. Sharf, "The Idolization of Enlightenment: On the Mummification of  Ch'an Masters in Medieval China," History of Religions 32 (1992): 1-31. Although  a serviceable overview of the full range of Japanese Tantric Buddhism does not  exist, readers will find in Taiko Yamasaki, Shingon: Japanese Esoteric Buddhism  (Boston: Shambhala, 1988) an excellent account of how one contemporary Shin gon practitioner views his own tradition. Stanley Weinstein, "The Beginnings of  Esoteric Buddhism in Japan: The Neglected Tendai Tradition," Journal of Asian  Studies 34 (1974): 177-91, points out how Shingon historical scholarship tends  to slight the contributions of Saicho. Nonsectarian accounts of specific Tantric  rituals can be found in Michel Strickmann, "Homa in East Asia," in Agni: The  Vedic Ritual of the Fire Altar, edited by Frits Staal (Berkeley and Los Angeles:  University of California Press, 1983), vol. 2, pp. 418-55, and in two articles by  James Sanford: "The Abominable Tachikawa Skull Ritual," Monumenta Nipponica  46 (1991): 1-20, and "Breath of Life: The Esoteric Nenbutsu," in Esoteric Bud-EMPTINES S AND DUS T 303  

dhism in japan, edited by Ian Astley-Kristensen (Copenhagen and Aarhus: Seminar  for Buddhist Studies, 1994), pp. 65-98. The same volume (pp. 37-64) also  contains Ian Reader's account of the Agonshu, "Appropriated Images: Esoteric  Themes in a Japanese New Religion." Finally, parallels between the Shingon teach 

ings of Kukai and the Zen teachings of Dogen are discussed by David E. Shaner,  The Body-Mind Experience in Japanese Buddhism (Albany: State University of New  York Press, 1985).  

Emptiness and Dust Ritual  

[Written inside a circle:] A bright mirror, 4.2 inches in diameter. The great  master Sakyamuni Buddha - Maha Kasyapa - . .. . [A line extends down the  right margin of the text to the remainder of the lineage chart found below.]  

First year of Shoan [1299], senior water year of the horse, fourth moon, fif teenth day; lecture concerning Sakyamuni holding up the flower:  Sakyamuni raised the flower before a huge audience of eighty thousand,  including five hundred senior disciples. Although the entire audience turned  their heads and looked at the same sight, they did not fathom Sakyamuni's  heart. Only Maha Kasyapa smiled. Sakyamuni said: "I have the Lineage of the  Wisdom Eye that Perceives the True Dharma, the Marvelous Mind of Nirvana  (nehan myoshin). I entrust it with Maha Kasyapa. Later tonight I will perform  the Buddha-to-Buddha Dharma Transmission Ceremony."  

In the middle of the night Maha Kasyapa silently sneaked past the gaze of  the audience of eighty thousand, including five hundred senior disciples, and  entered Sakyamuni's cave at the base of the Udumbara Tree next to the moun tain stream on Vulture Peak. The cave was four bays wide. Sakyamuni sat facing  west on the golden-lion throne situated on the east side of the room. Maha  Kasyapa sat on the west side, facing east. Because of the darkness outside it  was difficult to discern their shared location. Just then a flaming chicken flew  into the room. A flaming chicken is a type of bird with two heads and red and  white spots in nine places. Flames blaze from between its two heads. In that  room it appeared just like the flame of a lamp. Thus, it signifies the location  where dharma fires of wisdom erupt.  

Sakyamuni turned toward heaven and kowtowed three times. Maha Kasyapa  placed his seating mat over Sakyamuni's mat and kowtowed three times. Then  they performed the ceremony of the past buddhas and present buddhas. Facing  two mirrors toward each other, they performed the kasaya robe ritual, covering  their heads with the mirrors. Sakyamuni took the upper mirror and Maha  KaSyapa took the lower mirror. Their reflections shifted. Sakyamuni's mirror  reflected the image of Maha Kasyapa, while Maha Kasyapa's mirror reflected  the image of Sakyamuni. This is the mutual embodiment of buddhas. Having  completed the above, next they performed the kasaya robe ritual, raising their 

304 WILLIA M BODIFOR D  

heads. Sakyamuni rubbed Maha Kasyapa's forehead and said: "Just as these two  mirrors function together, so too is the Lineage of the Wisdom Eye that Per ceives the True Dharma bequeathed. Throughout the infinite future this lineage  must never be allowed to terminate." These are the words that are chanted  buddha to buddha.  

Then the image in one of the mirrors shifted to reflect the name of Sakya muni. Likewise, Maha Kasyapa's name appeared reflected in the other mirror.  They performed the rite of mixing blood from their tongues to form ink and,  using a wooden stylus, linked the two names together. The dharma transmis sion ceremony of past buddha to present buddha is performed thus. Do not  allow it to become lost to buddhas of future generations. Buddhas and bodhi sattvas have halos of light or purple clouds around their heads because they  perform this ceremony.  

In the same manner as when the Buddha spent twenty years in Heaven of  the Thirty-three Deities (trayastrimsa) preaching the Maha Maya Scripture to  his mother, the huge audience of eighty thousand addressed the Buddha and  asked: "According to the scriptures, this is the dharma of equality. But what  about the blind people of the triple world? How can they be saved? Please by  your compassion provide them with a means of salvation." In response, the  Buddha preached the Ten Vajra Precepts.  

The appearing in the mirror, the placing it on one's head, the appearing of  Sakyamuni's name, the linking together names of past buddhas and present  buddhas, the ink from the blood of the tongue, the sprinkling of sanctified  water on one another's heads, the transmitting the flame of the flaming chicken  with its spots in nine places, the lighting of the torch: these constitute the  dharma transmission ceremony of all buddhas. They are the life root of the  buddhas.  

The Wayfaring Site [bodhi-manda, or site of awakening] of Sakyamuni and  Maha Kasyapa became a stupa. It is the appearance of the Transmission Re turning Stupa. The bodhisattvas, auditors (s'ravakas), and solitary buddhas  (pratyekabuddhas) gathered around it like clouds. The king of Magadha and  his sixty thousand attendants came to that assembly of equality. The earth and  heavens shook with six kinds of earthquakes. The demon of the Sixth Heaven  tried to disrupt the Buddha by throwing rocks to smash the stupa. But at that  moment many additional stupas began to appear. They were too numerous to  count. As soon as rocks were thrown by the demon they appeared as letters  and fell from the sky. The many stupas appeared and the letters became at 

tached to their back gates. Within ten years they spread throughout central  India. As Master Tendai said, from there to this Vimalakirti-like abbot's quar ters [that is, the room in a Zen monastery where the initiation is conducted],  thus has the dharma been transmitted. This buddha-to-buddha lineage must  never be allowed to terminate.  

Later generations must never doubt this Emptiness and Dust Ritual. Deviation  from this format is the heresy of naturalism (tennen gedo, that is, denial of  karmic connections). This document was originally written in an Indic script. 

EMPTINES S AND DUS T 305  

After a long time the Indic letters became corrupted. During later generations  this document required special study of Sanskrit and the proper procedure  began to disappear. During the time of Ejo, the second ancestor of Eiheiji, this  version was drafted. The original text is inscribed on Chinese paper and is  stored inside the heart of the sacred image of Dogen, the founder of Eiheiji. It  is never revealed.  

("True Dharma" is the ancient mirror. "Lineage of the Wisdom Eye" is the  blood from the tongue. "Nirvana," which is complete Parinirvana, is liberation  from the cycle of birth and death. The "Marvelous Mind" is the flaming chicken,  which is the shining flame of the torches. "Entrust" is shared use.)

of the Bodhisattva Precepts in the Orthodox Transmission  of the Buddhas and Ancestors  

What is the blood lineage? The blood lineages of all previous buddhas and  ancestors as well as the blood lineages of all deluded, ignorant living beings  fundamentally are not two. They constitute the undifferentiated true body of  a single flavor. Because the buddhas and ancestors have awakened, they con 

stitute original awakening like the moon shining bright in a cloudless sky.  Because ordinary people are deluded, they experience darkness as if the moon light is obscured by clouds. When ordinary people of deluded minds receive  the bodhisattva precepts all filth and obstructions are eliminated, completely  allowing this spiritual luminosity to appear for the first time. For this reason  the Brahma Net Scripture states: "Living beings who receive ordination with  the precepts enter into the ranks of the buddhas, attaining the same great  awakening. Truly they are the Buddha's children." Based on this principle, the  person receiving the precepts sits in the Dharma Throne in the Wayfaring Site,  and the teacher bestowing the precepts bows to him. This ritual signifies the  attainment of the Way, as the fundamental Buddha [the teacher] descends and  the manifest trace [the disciple] ascends. Then the disciple bows to the teacher.  This ritual signifies the attainment of the Way, as the fundamental ascends and  the manifest trace descends. The preceptor bestows and the disciple receives.  The teacher hands over the blood lineage chart and the disciple humbly grasps  hold. This ritual signifies the attainment of the Way, as the fundamental and  the manifest trace together descend. Once the lineage has been bestowed,  teacher and disciple leave the Wayfaring Site together. This ritual signifies the  attainment of the Way, as the fundamental and the manifest trace together  ascend.  

The round circle drawn at the head of the blood lineage chart signifies the  bright moon disk that constitutes the fundamental mind of living beings. It is  called the "blood lineage." Therefore, the blood line that links together the  upper and lower names signifies the undifferentiated body of teacher and dis 

ciple. A five-colored string is used to tie these two together, because living  beings are inherently endowed with the marvelous virtues of the Five Wisdom  Buddhas of the Womb Mandala. Ascending without knowledge of this prin ciple, they become stained with the mud of the five defilements (klesas). Be cause the seed of the Five Wisdom Buddhas is thereby concealed, in ascending  they defy the five planets, in descending they defy the five mountains, in be tween they defy the five constant ethical norms. Day and night, dawn and dusk,  they accumulate the karmic conditions of their evil actions. Therefore they 

EMPTINES S AND DUST 307  

defy the spiritual standards of the three jewels of Buddha, Dharma, and Sahgha  and of the local gods. Nonetheless, by cultivating the courageous vigor of spir itual practice one purifies his six sense organs, and at the moment one receives  the Vajra Jewel Precepts of the buddhas and ancestors he suddenly eliminates  the five defilements and realizes the fundamentally awakened body of the Five  Wisdom Buddhas. Although each of the five colors has a different name, they  are neither different nor distinct from the awakened body. This is why a five colored string is used to tie these together.  

Blood-lineage charts are rolled up and bound with nine knots. This indicates  that the eighty-four thousand dharanis [spells] and the eighty-four thousand  defiled practices, the good and the evil, ultimately are not two. True and false  are one and the same. All return to the perfect dharma body of the nine types  of consciousness. The nine knots express this.  

The Chinese graph for the word "union" (go) is used to state the doctrine  of all nine types of consciousness being perfectly endowed. When the ways of  host and guest achieve union, all insignificant matters, petty humans, and non sentient things end up in the coal pit. This one Chinese character is composed  of three graphic elements: "man," "one," and "mouth." This means that man  uses his mouth to eat things to sustain his life. Union with this blood lineage  thus sustains the life of the buddhas and ancestors. Buddhas use their one  mouth to preach the unsurpassed dharma wheel to save all beings of great and  small, real and provisional spiritual capacities. Zen uses the one mouth to pluck  out the stakes hammered in by monks. In such ways, is there any affair of day  or night, secular or sacred, that is not accomplished with the mouth? Other  extensive ways of examining the graph "union" also exist and should be handed  down.  

This tradition was first transmitted when Dogen, our country's first ancestor,  traveled to Song-dynasty China in accordance with the instructions of Eisai,  the founder of Kenninji monastery, and entered into the innermost chambers  of Master Tiandong Rujing, thereby completing his studies. Wanting to return  to our country, Dogen humbly requested leave. Master Rujing replied: "Don't  be so hasty. There exists this document called The Unsurpassed Ultimate Affair  of the Buddhas and Ancestors. It is rare. I have not yet permitted you to learn  it. At this time you must keep this a deeply held secret. After you receive it,  take it back to Japan and use it to benefit all beings." Dogen obeyed his teacher's  command and remained for another month. After he finished receiving it, he  returned to this land to save all deluded beings, the good and the evil, the elite  and the base.  

What is the great affair of the buddhas and ancestors like? You must guard  this well. Guard it well. You must keep it secret.

### 18 The Necklace of Immortality: A Seventeenth-Century  Vaisnava Sahajiya Text  

Glen A. Hayes  

The Vaisnava Sahajiyas were Hindu tantrikas who lived in northeastern India,  especially in the region of greater Bengal (Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Assam), from  approximately the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries. Many things about  the medieval Vaisnava Sahajiyas remain unclear to modern scholars, including  their origins, social standing, major personalities, esoteric practices, authorship  of texts, and their continued existence into current times. Although much about  their beliefs and practices is elusive - we have, for example, no existing written  commentaries to help us in understanding key words and phrases, and apparently  no living connections to the medieval teachers - what we do know suggests a  truly distinctive approach to Tantric expression and experience. This chapter  explains why the medieval Vaisnava Sahajiyas are unique, and selected passages  from an important text, The Necklace of Immortality (Amrtaratnavali) of Mukunda dasa (ca. 1650 C.E.) will illustrate this distinctiveness.  

The goal for Sahajiyas was to achieve the ultimate state of sahaja, a Sanskrit  and Bengali term that literally means "together (saha) born (ja)," and by extension  of the semantic domain, "innate," "easy," "spontaneous," or "primordial." In the  translations that follow, I use "primordium" or "primordial." Basically, sahaja is  the original state of cosmic unity and bliss; a state that transcends the realm of  samsara (phenomenal reality), in which all created beings exist, subject to pain  and endless rebirth. Sahajiya ritual practices (sadhanas) were developed to guide  both men and women to the realization of this state of liberation. These groups  of Tantric practitioners are generally called "Vaisnava" Sahajiyas, as their worship  focused on one of Visnu's most important manifestations: the playful and erotic  cowherding god Krsna, the "Dark Lord." To Sahajiyas, Krsna was not regarded  simply as a supreme being. Like most tantrikas, the Sahajiyas connected human  and divine natures, so the Dark Lord was reinterpreted as the inner divine aspect  of a man, and Krsna's mythical consort, Radha, was reinterpreted as the inner 

THE NECKLACE OF IMMORTALITY 30 9  

divine aspect of a women. Furthermore, some Sahajiya beliefs and practices, in cluding concepts of religious love and the use of devotional songs, were adapted  from the famous medieval devotional (bhakti) tradition known as Bengali (Gau diya) Vaisnavism, which grew up around the famous Bengali religious leader  Krsna Caitanya (ca. 1486-1533 C.E.). It is largely due to their historical (and  controversial) connections to Bengali Vaisnavas that the label of "Vaisnava" Sa hajiyas has been used by scholars like Manindramohan Bose, Shashibhushan Das gupta, Edward C. Dimock, and Paritos Dasa. In Sahajiya texts themselves, the  

religion is typically referred to as the Primordial Way (sahaja-dharma).  There was much more to the Vaisnava Sahajiyas than their reinterpretations of  Bengali Vaisnavism and the Caitanya movement. Sahajiya gurus adapted a wide  range of beliefs and practices into complex ritual systems and elaborate views of  the universe, and composed hundreds of texts of varying length in Bengali (with  occasional Sanskrit passages), many of which have survived to this day. A few  manuscripts have been edited and published, but most remain unstudied in ar chives in West Bengal and elsewhere. Discernible in these texts are hints of San skrit aesthetics and dramaturgy, classical and medieval Hindu devotionalism,  Samkhya philosophy, Ayurvedic medicine, Siddha Tantra and alchemy, hatha  yoga, and perhaps even Sufi Islam and Tantric Buddhism.  

The Vaisnava Sahajiyas are distinctive partly because most of their texts were  composed in the Bengali vernacular; Sanskrit passages, when they do occur, are  typically only quotes from earlier works, mantras, or opening invocations,  whereas most other Hindu Tantric traditions rely extensively on Sanskrit. This  choice of language reflects the regionalism and local flavor of Sahajiya beliefs and  practices. In Bengal, Sanskrit never attained the prominence that it did elsewhere  in India, and although some Sahajiya gurus may have been versed in Sanskrit,  the evidence suggests that they preferred to convey their teachings in Bengali. In  The Necklace (v. 13), Mukunda-dasa goes further, rejecting the Vedas and Vedic  rituals, the ancient foundations of Sanskrit authority and religious life. The most  popular works of Bengali Vaisnavism, especially the Caitanya-caritamrta of Krsna dasa Kaviraja (ca. 1575 C.E.), were composed mainly in Bengali - (although some  important treatises were composed in Sanskrit). In The Necklace (v. 4), Mukunda dasa even claims that Krsnadasa was his own guru, so this choice of the local  vernacular may have been a matter of tradition, also deemed appropriate for the  majority of Bengali devotees.  

Before we discuss the more obvious Tantric and yogic dimensions of the Sa hajiyas, we need to emphasize the ways in which Sahajiya gurus adapted Bengali  Vaisnavism - much to the chagrin and outrage of the rather orthodox followers  of Caitanya then (and even now). Orthodox Bengali Vaisnavas developed much  of their belief system from classical Sanskrit devotional texts such as the Bhagavata  Purana and medieval poems like Jayadeva's Gitagovinda. Their basic view is that  Krsna is the supreme god and creator of the cosmos, and that his creative powers  (sakti) extend to the vast reaches of the universe. Human souls (jivas), created by  Krsna, long to return to a loving and blissful relationship with him. Fortunately, 

310 GLE N A. HAYES  

Krsna wants to experience the love and devotion (bhakti) of the souls, and so he  has used his cosmic powers of magic (maya) and playfulness (lila) to fashion an  eternal heavenly abode (dhaman) that is identical to the idyllic setting of the  Bhagavata Purana: the pastoral village of Vrndavana, in the forested region of  Vraja. These gorgeous heavenly realms are also called Goloka ("Cowland") and  Gokula ("Cowhouse") Here, Krsna grows up as a handsome youth, enticing the  lovely young milkmaids (gopis) to leave their husbands for furtive lovemaking in  the groves and gardens of Vraja. Many Bengali Vaisnavas quickly allegorize these  figures: the milkmaids represent the human soul, and their desires to frolic with  Krsna in the woods is understood to be the quest of the soul to rejoin the creator.  Since Krsna has thoughtfully reproduced this mystical scene in all of its details  in a blissful heaven, it is possible for devout Vaisnavas to travel there if they take  on the role of one of the characters in that heavenly abode. Much of Bengali  Vaisnavism is dedicated not only to singing and dancing praises to the Dark Lord,  but also to developing an inner spiritual identity as one of the Vraja residents. As  David L. Haberman has shown, this process of "acting as a way of salvation"  allows one to adopt the identity and "spiritual body" of fellow villagers of Krsna,  especially one of the impassioned milkmaids. Those who choose to "become"  female attendants to Krsna's beloved consort Radha (herself a married woman)  experience the most intense love, as they visualize the divine couple's erotic sports  in the inner heavenly worlds. But for Bengali Vaisnavas, this means that their  souls are returning to an eternal relationship with god. And although in the mythic  drama and in heaven Krsna seems to be involved in adulterous affairs, they are  not really adulterous, since this is really god just playing with his creation. Human  beings, on the other hand, following Hindu caste rules and good family values,  should never be adulterous. Human beings are not divine, only Krsna is; their  souls were made by god, but they themselves can never become god. This dualistic  theological relationship was aptly phrased by the later Bengali poet Ramprasad  Sen when he argued that "I don't want to become sugar, I want to taste sugar" - with the "sugar" standing for the divine, and the taster as the human soul.  

The Vaisnava Sahajiyas had their own interpretations of the erotic drama of  Krsna, the milkmaids, and Radha. For Tantric Sahajiyas, as noted above, Krsna  is not regarded as a supreme god, a creator who dwells in a distant heaven, and  Radha is not merely his chosen consort or emanation of blissful energy. In contrast  to Ramprasad, Sahajiyas have wished to transform "tasting sugar" into "becoming  sugar." They therefore have adapted the sophisticated theological dualism of Ben 

gali Vaisnavas (which is not a pure dualism) into their own monistic system, in  which humans reunite with their inner divine natures. According to Sahajiyas,  every man has within himself his "true form" (svarupa) as Krsna, the divine mas culine principle, and every woman has within herself her divine feminine prin ciple as Radha. And rather than trying to visualize and then participate in the  lovemaking of a god and his consort in heaven, Sahajiyas call upon all men and  women to make love themselves in order to unify their essences and get to heaven.  In doing so, Sahajiyas are using the physical world and their human bodies as  platforms and tools for their experiments with the sacred. Both of these Sahajiya 

THE NECKLACE OF IMMORTALITY 31 1  

claims - that men and women are really Krsna and Radha, and that adulterous  relationships and ritual sexual intercourse can be salvific - have caused some  scandal or at least discomfort in Bengali Vaisnava communities. Regarded by the  orthodox Vaisnavas as loathsome heretics, and transgressive to the extreme, Sa 

hajiya practitioners, who may have seemed on the surface to be regular devotees  of Krsna, have often felt compelled to perform their ritual practices without the  knowledge of their neighbors or risk certain public condemnation. In various  sources from the sixteenth century to the present day, outraged Bengalis and  shocked European colonial administrators have written of what they regarded as  the depraved sexual practices of various Tantric groups, including the Sahajiyas.  

Although the influence of Bengali Vaisnavism on the Sahajiyas is clear enough,  the Tantric influences are harder to trace; many Vaisnava Sahajiya texts claim that  their own gurus were noted Bengali Vaisnavas like Krsnadasa Kaviraja, Nitya nanda, and even Caitanya himself. And although one text claims that a legendary  writer on dance and drama, Bharata, was the founding Sahajiya guru, virtually all  Vaisnava Sahajiyas see themselves as intimately connected to Bengali Vaisnavas.  Although Sahajiya texts were clearly influenced by earlier Tantric yogic traditions,  most existing manuscripts seem to have been composed after the time of Caitanya.  How can this be? Part of the problem has to do with the claims of Caitanya and  his followers in Bengal that the renowned leader was himself the "incarnation"  (avatara) of both Krsna and Radha in one body. The belief is very Tantric in  nature: the idea that both male and female cosmic principles are latent within the  microcosm of the human body. But it is also a plausible reading of Bengali Vais 

nava theological views concerning the ultimate relationship between the divine  Krsna and his creative female powers. Much like the Saiva and Sakta tantrikas,  who saw the existence of both the god Siva and the goddess Sakti within the  human body, Sahajiyas utilized the Caitanya model to argue for a similar in 

dwelling of both Krsna and Radha. And since the Caitanya movement was growing  in popularity at the time, it was perhaps inevitable that Sahajiya gurus would  adapt what they saw as a congenial tradition - giving it, however, their own  "Tantric" reinterpretation. By adopting the Caitanya traditions, however, Sahajiyas  also appropriated something that most other Hindu tantrikas did not: the fun 

damental roles of human passion (raga), divine love (prema) and devotion (bhakti)  in practice.  

In The Necklace, Mukunda-dasa presents the outlines of a basic Sahajiya world view and ritual system, although he does so in a language that is highly technical,  difficult to translate, and challenging to understand. To begin, the words are often  grammatically uninflected, lacking the usual markers for noun case, number, and  verb tense. This means that the relationships between adjectives, nouns, and verbs  are often unclear. I have tried to render the most inclusive reading of each passage,  but many passages could be read in alternative ways. This is fairly typical of  Tantric language in general; due to its grammatical indeterminacy, however, the  form of the Bengali language adapted by the Sahajiyas creates additional hurdles  to scholarly interpretation. In choosing passages for this volume, I have tried to  use material that presented a basic picture of Sahajiya beliefs and practices. For 

3 1 2 GLEN A. HAYES  

translations and studies of other Vaisnava Sahajiya texts, readers may consult the  recommendations for further reading.  

Of the complete text of The Necklace of Immortality, only four verses are in  Sanskrit: the opening invocation and three quotations from earlier Vaisnava  works. Following these invocations (w. 1-5) to Krsna, Caitanya, famous Bengali  Vaisnavas, and his own guru Krsnadasa Kaviraja, Mukunda-dasa sketches out  some of the basic beliefs and practices of his system. In simplest terms, the process  of realizing sahaja requires the yogic mastery of one's emotions, mental states,  physical body, and sexual energies in order to create a type of subtle inner yogic  body or "divine body" (rupa, deva-deha) - that provides a vehicle for the soul  (jiva) to travel to the blissful realms of sahaja. The basic system revolves around  the complex and important term rasa, which literally means "juice," as from fruit  or sugarcane, but which has several levels of meaning for Sahajiyas. Although rasa  is a term already found in Sanskrit aesthetics and Bengali Vaisnavism, it can also  be used to describe an elevated state of religious rapture, in which one experiences  the purified emotion of love for the divine. Drawing on more obscure Tantric and  alchemical influences, Mukunda-dasa plays with the additional significant mean ing of rasa as "male semen" and "mercury," and it is this meaning - of an essential  fluid - that predominates in the text. I have translated it as "Divine Essence," but  the multiple referents should be kept in mind. By performing ritual sexual inter course (sambhoga) with a female partner (rati), the male Sahajiya is understood  to yogically "reverse" his rasa-semen and propel it, along with the sexual fluids  of his partner, along his urethra into a mystical yogic channel, the Crooked River  (bankanadi), that flows upward and inward into the inner body and worlds. Only  by sexual ritual can the vital fluids of men and women be transformed into vastu,  a technical term meaning "truth, essence, thing," or "object," but which I translate  as "Cosmic Substance," the most fundamental constituent unit of the universe. It  is this Cosmic Substance, created only through Sahajiya rituals, which forms the  subtle inner body, in much the same way as the physical body is made of flesh  and blood. As indicated in verses 7-12, this realization of rasa as Divine Essence,  and its transformation into the Cosmic Substance of the Inner Body (rupa) is  needed to reach the ultimate state of sahaja. One can only learn about this from  those who have already experienced rasa, advanced practitioners called rasikas,  which I translate as "Experienced Ones."  

This powerful and liberating process of ritual sexual intercourse is controver sial; it is a tool that is not universal and a modality of religious ritual that takes  years to cultivate. As with all tantrikas, one must first receive initiation and a  mantra from a guru (w. 14-15). Additional and subsequent instructions are  received from a second person, the siksa ("teaching") guru, who according to  another Sahajiya guru, Akificana-dasa, should be a woman. There are three stages  of Sahajiya practice (v. 18): beginner (pravarta), accomplished (sadhaka), and  perfected (siddha). Beginners should start their practices using the standard ritual  devotions (vaidhi-bhakti) of Bengali Vaisnavas (w. 20-23), including singing  hymns, chanting, dancing to Krsna, and developing an alternative spiritual bodyTHE NECKLACE OF IMMORTALITY 313  

and identity as one of Krsna's followers. At this level, Sahajiya practices resemble  those of orthodox Vaisnavism. Such devotional actions result in the experience  of a mystic emotional state called a bhava ("mood, condition"), which I have  translated as "Divine Existence."  

After using these techniques from Bengali Vaisnavas, clearly discussed by Ed ward C. Dimock, Jr., and David L. Haberman, the more obviously Tantric di mensions of Sahajiya practice begin. During the second and third stages of prac tice, the rituals involving coitus and erotic activities are gradually introduced - after all, the Sahajiya couple are acting out the divine loveplay of Krsna and Radha.  

Like rasa, the term rati, which I translate as "Female Partner," also comes from  Sanskrit and Vaisnava traditions and has a distinctive Sahajiya meaning, as well.  It does mean an actual female ritual partner, and in Vaisnavism generally refers  to a woman loved by Krsna. However, consistent with the fluid-based cosmology  of Sahajiyas and other tantrikas, it can also mean female sexual fluids, which are  "reversed" along with male semen in order to create the inner body. The Female  Partner must also be visualized (w. 33-39) as having an "Inner Damsel Body"  (rupa-marijan), which is an elegant blend of Caitanyaite and Tantric visualization  techniques. As adapted from the erotic adventures of Krsna, the ideal female  partner should not be one's own (svakiya) spouse, but rather one "belonging to  another" (parakiya). Such a dangerous liaison, risky in itself, only serves to  heighten the passions of forbidden love, as the relationship could end if known  to others. Underlying this process, however, is the need to transform worldly  passions (raga) and lust (kama) into pure divine love (prema). These basic posi tions are complicated by amplifying the roles of emotions and by including vari ous erotic games (vilasa) as part of the sexual ritual. These features help to dis 

tinguish the Sahajiyas from most other practitioners of Tantra.  

The Sahajiya model of the inner or subtle body is also quite different from most  Saiva and Sakta Tantric systems. In addition to incorporating ideas from the  mythology of Krsna with its beautiful gardens, forests, and villages, the basic  structure of the subtle body in The Necklace consists of the Crooked River and  four inner lotus ponds (sarovaras) - rather than the more typical six or seven  cakras, susumna-nadi, and fiery kundalini-sakti of other Tantric traditions. This  emphasis on rivers and ponds clearly reflects the watery deltaic geography and  topography of Bengal, and it also expresses the Sahajiya emphasis upon physi cality, substances, and fluids. In contrast to other South Asian traditions, such as  the philosophy of Vedanta, which regarded the natural world and the human  body as illusory obstacles to liberation, the Sahajiyas saw the world and body as  very "real" and useful for salvation - a basic Tantric understanding. This allowed  them to transform the human body, its parts, and processes, using them to give  "birth" to the inner subtle body, thereby reaching the blissful realms of the pri 

mordial state of sahaja.  

There are several realms and states of consciousness associated with sahaja, all  of which are said to be places of bliss (ananda). The Necklace has often vivid  descriptions of such places (w. 43, 45-47, 54-57, 96-99), visualizing them as 

314 GLEN A. HAYES  

particular villages and gardens alongside a mystical river. The Crooked River is  of great importance, since it connects the four inner ponds. For the Sahajiyas,  this subtle physiology functions in much the same way as the cakras and susumna nadi of other Tantric systems; but the river and ponds convey the reversed sexual  fluids, not the fiery kundalini. These four ponds (VV. 97-98) may be thought of  as a set of holding tanks within the male body, and each one represents a different  level of purity, consciousness, and bliss. The lowest, the Pond of Lust (kama sarovara), is said (v. 96) to be reached through the "ninth door" of the human  body, probably a reference to the urethra, where the Crooked River begins. Next  is the Pond of Arrogance (mana-sarovara), where lingering feelings of egotism and  selfish desire must be purified - again, through continuation of the sexual and  other rituals. The third reservoir is the Pond of Divine Love (prema-sarovara),  where the pure and selfless affection between the two partners is developed.  Reflecting influences from Tantric alchemy, each of the ponds also serves as a  type of alchemical vessel, into which the base sexual fluids are drawn through  sexual intercourse. It is out of these yogically transformed sexual fluids that the  immortal elixir of Cosmic Substance is fashioned. The uppermost vessel is the  Pond of Immortality (aksaya-sarovara), which has such features as a thousand petaled lotus and is the abode of the cosmic mountain Sumeru (similar to the  highest cakra in other Saiva and Sakta systems). The fourth pond is thus closest  to sahaja, the realms of bliss, and the realization of the androgynous state of the  Primordial Inner Being (sahaja-manusa) - the complete union of male/female and  Krsna/Radha.  

Many details of these yogic processes and visualized realms are difficult for us  to understand, as the text was composed with the intent of concealing such cosmic  secrets and powers from outsiders. Some verses seem impossible to understand  at all. But we can still glimpse some salient aspects of practice. For example, it  seems that the word rasa itself is used as a mantra during sexual intercourse (VV.  55-56), and uttering ra-sa helps the practitioners to reach sahaja. But difficulties  and dangers lurk along the way: if one can bypass the pitfalls of passion and lust,  described as the flower arrows of the love god or as a deadly serpent (VV. 104- 7), then one may discover the myriad yogic channels of the inner body (v. 110)  and use coitus and eroticism to escape ordinary worldly decay (v. 115), that is,  to overcome mortality, the goal of many yogic sadhanas.  

Each of the four ponds is described in varying detail in the complete text, with  multicolored and multipetaled lotuses, bathing and entry steps, surrounding vil lages, and mystical qualities. Each is beautiful and adorned with precious gems  (VV. 162-63), a typical Tantric reference not only to their great value but also to  the fact that each pond is fashioned out of Cosmic Substance - a commodity that  is most difficult to obtain. Some of this imagery is derived from Bengali Vaisnava  visualization techniques involving the ponds and other locations where Radha  and Krsna met for their secret loveplay. But the Sahajiya depictions of the ponds  are also based upon the gurus' experiences of these ponds as important realms of  the subtle body. As such, the ponds are vital reservoirs for the yogically manip-

THE NECKLACE OF IMMORTALITY 315  

ulated sexual fluids, and reflect a standard Tantric motif of the reversal (ulta) of  the cosmic process. For the Sahajiyas, this process requires a journey along the  Crooked River as it flows "upward against the current" (v. 180) to sahaja. Found  in these inner realms are a variety of different beings and special places, such as  the Self-perfected Inner Being (svatah-siddha-mdnusa), the Primordial Inner Being  (sahaja-manusa), the Place of the Hidden Moon (guptacandrapur), and the Pri 

mordial Citadel (sahajapur). Attaining these places also entails mastery of breath  control, which leads to mystical visions of different colors and objects (VV. 184- 90). Like other tantrikas, Sahajiyas must visualize inner forms of the Female  Partner, known as the eight Heroines (nayikas), enthroned in the delicate lotuses  of the ponds (VV. 242-44). Although few details of the Heroines or the Female  Partner are given (in one passage she is described as a lovely sixteen-year-old  maiden), the process of coitus is likened to the "churning" (mathana) of the part 

ner (VV. 256-58). Although this image possibly refers to the vigorous mixing of  the sexual fluids, it also recalls the mythical effort of the gods to extract nectar  from the cosmic ocean, the making of butter, and the preparation of alchemical  elixirs.  

The concluding passages of the text emphasize the centrality of the Female  Partner in the attainment of sahaja (VV. 309-10), review basic dimensions of the  cosmos (VV. 311, 317-19), and extol the importance of The Necklace itself (VV.  329-30); the text ends with "Blessed Mukunda-dasa presents The Necklace of  Immortality." Some scholars, such as Paritos Dasa, have argued that this text and  several others were originally composed in Sanskrit by one Siddha Mukunda deva, and that various disciples such as Mukunda-dasa prepared the Bengali trans 

lations that have come down to us. Until more evidence is found, this argument  must remain unproven, leaving us further mystified by the Vaisnava Sahajiyas of  medieval Bengal.  

So what do we learn from a text like The Necklace of Immortality? To begin, it  suggests that human beings have experienced their bodies and sexuality in many  different ways, and that some have used these experiences as the basis for ex pressing vivid, sensual, religious worlds. The Sahajiyas used all of their sense  capacities - sight, sound, taste, touch, and scent - to bring together the spiritual  and the material. But this is true of many other Tantric traditions. The Vaisnava  Sahajiyas are distinctive in the ways in which they combined the physicality of  the body, sexual energies, emotions, passions, and senses in order to express their  elaborate models of reality. In simplest terms, gurus like Mukunda-dasa attempted  to blend the best of the complex worlds of Tantric yoga and bhakti devotionalism,  offering both men and women a powerful means of liberation from the apparent  limitations of the ordinary world and their bodies. Such a bold use of sexuality  definitely has the power to offend. Yet such a dangerous rejection of social norms,  found throughout Tantra, is deemed necessary for salvation.  

Beyond the controversies surrounding sexual practices, the text also raises pro found questions about perceptions of gender and power. Most Sahajiya texts seem  to have been written by men, from a male perspective, and privilege the male 

3 1 6 GLEN A. HAYES  

body by locating the ponds within the man (v. 169). If anything, ritual coitus is a  form of what some scholars have called "inverse intercourse," in which the man  takes the fluids from the woman and draws them into his body. The subtle body  is "born" within the male body, unlike the physical body, which is born in a  womb. It should be pointed out that although these are clearly male-centered fea 

tures, they are not therefore anti-female, since the Sahajiya system is dependent  upon the harmonious interaction of both male and female cosmic principles.  Without the Female Partner and her fluids, the male can never reach sahaja; with out the man and his essences, she is also denied final liberation. In the end, both  must experience the ultimate state of sahaja, or it does not happen. Sahaja itself is  transcendent, beyond the duality of male and female, but unobtainable without  their interaction. The Vivarta-vilasa ("Erotic Games of Transformation") by Akift cana-dasa (ca. 1700 C.E.) states that the siksa or teaching guru, who provides in struction on the advanced ritual practices, is identified with Radha and should  thus be a woman. This reflects the Sahajiya view that all woman are teachers, and  that men must learn from them. And though much of Bengali society at the time  was dominated by men, Bengal was still the center of the worship of such great  goddesses as Durga, Kali, and Sakti. We see this regional emphasis on the divine  feminine reflected in Sahajiya texts like The Necklace, as well: in the importance  given to the Female Partner and the Damsel, to Radha and the milkmaids, the vi sualized Heroines, and the female gurus. Much about the medieval Vaisnava Sa hajiyas will remain a mystery to outsiders, as gurus like Mukunda-dasa seem re luctant to loosen their grasp on the jewels in The Necklace of Immortality.  

The Necklace of Immortality exists in two manuscript editions found in the archives  of the University of Calcutta, and a printed version edited by the Bengali scholar  Paritos Dasa. The manuscript version used for these translations is Bengali ms.  no. 6451 in the collection of the University of Calcutta. Another version exists as  ms. no. 595 in the same collection. I would like to thank the University of Cal 

cutta, especially Asitkumar Bandyopadhyay, P. K. Dasa, Tushar Mahapatra, S. C.  Banerjee, and the Department of Bengali, for providing me with access to these  and other Sahajiya manuscripts. Ms. no. 6451 consists of 330 verses (to which I  have assigned line numbers) and was written using several different poetical me 

ters. The meter used in all of the translated verses is called payara, consisting of  two rhymed lines of fourteen syllables each. A printed edition of The Necklace of  Immortality (Amrtaratnavali) may be found (in Bengali) in Paritos Dasa, Caitan yottara prathama cariti sahajiya puhthi ["Four Primary Post-Caitanya Sahajiya Man uscripts"] (Calcutta: Bharati Book Stall, 1972).

(Calcutta: Firma KLM, 1976). Bose tends to focus  on the connections between the Sahajiyas and Bengali Vaisnavism, whereas Das gupta argues for influences from earlier Tantric Buddhism. Dasgupta also exam ines other contemporary Bengali Tantric traditions, including the Bauls and Naths.

OPENING INVOCATIONS  

1. Glory to the eternally blissful Krsna, resplendent in his heaven of  Gokula.  

To Him Mukunda dedicates this book called The Necklace of  Immortality.  

2. Salutations to the blessed Krsna Caitanya, an ocean of Divine Essence.  Salutations to his disciple Nityananda, salutations to the other  humble friends.  

3. Salutations to his disciples Rupa, Sanatana, and Raghunatha Bhatta,  and to Jiva, Gopala Bhatta, and Raghunatha Dasa.  

4. Salutations to my own Master, the blessed Krsnadasa Kaviraja.  Through the power of your compassion, all has been revealed.  

5. I offer greetings to the companions of Caitanya.  

I am energized by their profound compassion.

BASIC CONCEPTS OF PRACTICE AND COMMUNITY  

7. Listen closely, for I am going to speak about the principles of Divine  Essence (rasa).  

Only with the help of Experienced Ones (rasikas) can you taste this  Divine Essence.  

8. Devotees who are Experienced Ones will attain their Inner Body.  Their minds are constantly overwhelmed by the experience of Divine  Essence.  

9. With their minds flooded by experiences of Divine Essence, they float  along.  

Yet such Divine Essence can be generated only with the guidance  of Experienced Ones.  

10. You must discover the Cosmic Substance (vastu)  

hidden within the Divine Essence.  

This Primordial Cosmic Substance and Divine Essence are like gems.  

11. Transformed into this gemlike Cosmic Substance, the Divine Essence  assumes the shape of the Inner Body (rupa).  

The Inner Body is given birth through the rituals involving Divine  Essence.  

12. Then, with the help of Experienced Ones, you will meet a woman  who knows the Inner Body.  

To realize your inner self you must frolic with a woman who knows  Divine Essence.  

13. Divine Love for Krsna is always pure, it is never stained.  Get rid of the Vedas and never perform any Vedic rituals!  

14. The first step on the path is to seek refuge at the place of the mantra guru.  

Ordinary physical birth is from a womb, but this only results in old  age and hell!  

15. When you are accepted by the guru you will be sheltered by the  power of the mantra.  

Keep the instructions of the guru close to your heart!  

16. With great care, the guru who has initiated you with the mantra  will guide your practices.  

You must continue to follow those instructions for as long as you  practice!  

17. One of those commands is that you associate with a special  community of practitioners. 

THE NECKLACE OF IMMORTALITY 31 9  

Through following such instructions, you will reach the state of  consciousness of the Divine Existence.  

18. The three stages of practice are called: beginner (pravarta),  accomplished (sadhaka), and perfected (siddha).  

These are the three conditions: Divine Existence (bhava), Divine  Essence (rasa),  

and Divine Love (prema).  

19. When you are initiated and receive your mantra, the guru will protect  you.  

While in the beginner's stage, your practices involve the use  of your physical body.  

20. The kinds of practices appropriate for the physical body consist of the  sixty-four types of ritual devotions developed by Gaudiya  

Vaisnavas.  

Such ritual devotions have been written about and explained  elsewhere.  

22. You must master these different ritual devotions as a beginner.  The initial awareness of Divine Existence will continue for so long as  no Female Partner (rati) is actually present.  

23. The sixty-four types of ritual devotion for the physical body  are intended for the beginner.  

Devotions that are influenced by worldly karma should be avoided by  the Adept.  

25. One joins the spiritual lineage of the guru at the precise moment  one receives a mantra.  

After this initiation, however, you must continue your practices  under  

the guidance of a teaching guru.  

26. Through such sustained practices, the adept will develop the finest  physical body.  

Even older men and women can benefit from the consciousness  of Divine Existence.  

TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE BODY  

27. A Divine Body (devadeha) must be born within the physical body.  So how may men and women come to know that they possess a  Divine Body?  

28. With effort, you will discover the Divine Body within the physical  body. 

3 2 0 GLEN A. HAYES  

One may produce the Cosmic Substance of the Divine Body  by following the teachings.  

29. By performing ritual practices with a woman, the Divine Body will be  discovered within the physical, body.  

A woman who has realized her divine inner nature should serve as  the passionate Female Partner.  

30. When both the male and female principles are brought together  within the physical body,  

then one is ready to perform the advanced practices  

leading to consciousness of Divine Essence and Divine Love.  

31. Without following these steps, you will never acquire the Cosmic  Substance.  

How then will you know about the transcendent Cosmic Substance?  

32. That transcendent Cosmic Substance seems to be very remote.  The person who is able to obtain it is a hero in the ways of passion.  

33. The form of that blessed Inner Body must be without impurity, as  must the Female Partner.  

One can't reach the Vraja heaven without traveling the way of  passion.  

34. The blessed Inner Damsel Body (srirupamanjari) leads the adept to  the Vraja heaven.  

With her body of eternity, she helps the adept to master the passions.  

35. Without her, you'll never taste the passion-filled Cosmic Substances  of the Vraja heaven.  

For adepts seeking Vraja, she is the very essence of the way of  passion.  

37. The Female Partner who is imbued with Divine Love shimmers with  erotic energies, and is herself a well of Divine Essence.  

Having a splendid body like Radha, she is the well of both Divine  Essence and Cosmic Substance.  

38. The Female Partner who is imbued with Divine Love is the vessel  of shimmering Divine Essence.  

The Inner Body was born in that ocean of Divine Essence.  

39. In the Vraja heaven, the adept acquires an eternal Inner Body.  That is why it is called the blessed Inner Damsel Body.  

40. Through Divine Essence, the Inner Body is born, becoming a vessel of  Divine Love.  

And through that inner body one becomes conscious of the true  nature of passion. 

THE NECKLACE OF IMMORTALITY 32 1  

COSMIC REALMS OF BLISS  

43. Along the far shores of the Viraja River is a place called the  Homeland.  

There is a village there called the Primordial Place, a realm of eternal  bliss.  

45. In that region there is a Tree of Emptiness, and lotuses  of one hundred and one thousand petals.  

The Homeland spreads out around that tree and the waters of a pond.  

46. To its north is a village called the Place of Bliss.  

The abode of the god of love, it has a lovely grove  

where the Experienced Ones taste Divine Essence.  

47. Forever blissful, forever overwhelmed, forever desirous,  The Primordial Being (sahajamanusa) makes its home there.  

54. In that realm there is a lake called Moon Pond.  

It is located near the left side of the inner ocean.  

55. The Pond of Lust (kama-sarovara) is to be generated out of that  Moon Lake.  

Through uttering the syllable sa [of the mantra ra-sa: Divine Essence]  a vast empty space is revealed within the human body.  

56. In the making of the other syllable, ra, the Female Partner  becomes the secret vessel of semen.  

In the Place of the Hidden Moon, the male and female principles  are joined together.  

57. That Place of the Hidden Moon is apprehended  

by joining the two principles together.  

Behold how all the regions of the vast cosmos emerge in that special  place.  

96. The Pond of Lust is reached through the ninth door of the human  body.  

This is a subject that has been revealed by all the holy books.  

97. There are four ponds within the body: the Pond of Lust, the Pond of  Arrogance, the Pond of Divine Love, and the Pond of Immortality.  

98. The four ponds exist within the human heart.  

Only if you have a physical body can you reach the other shores of  reality.  

99. The Pond of Lust is the most sought-after thing of all.  Without fail, you must be diligent in your ritual practices. 

322 GLE N A . HAYE S  

RITUAL SEXUAL INTERCOURSE AND EROTICISM  

104. The five flower-arrows of the god of love are the enchanters of Krsna.  But a deadly serpent of death and time lurks within the human body.  

105. That deadly serpent can strike day or night.  

Even a mind in total control of the body cannot prevent the serpent  from striking.  

106. But, a mind in control of the physical self is really the cause of  Phenomenal Reality.  

Such a soul is of the lowest kind, unable to prevent lust.  

107. That is why such conditions hinder the worship of Krsna.  The soul's thirst for a Female Partner can drive one mad.  

108. When engaged in these kinds of practices, you must be very, very  careful.  

You should visualize an inner mental form of the Female Partner.  

109. Performance of religious rituals with a devout woman belongs to the  second stage of the practitioner.  

The god of erotic love helps to transform the Female Partner  into her inner visualized form.  

110. Within the physical body there are nine major yogic channels  and 320 million finer channels.  

Who is the person who knows which one goes where?  

115. The ultimate ritual is ritual sexual intercourse and eroticism with a  Female Partner.  

If you perform such practices with a Female Partner,  

you will escape worldly decay.  

INNER WORLDS AND A CROOKED RIVER  

154. This path of practices is difficult to travel; it seems to be near, but  then remote.  

From a distance it seems close, from close up it seems distant.  

155. You must be able to come to know the principles of your own body.  Whoever does not learn about the body suffers the consequences.  

156. The ponds and all of Phenomenal Reality exist within the body.  Who can truly worship without knowing the principles of the body?  

158. Without the instruction of the guru, you cannot know the guru's  principles.HE NECKLACE OF IMMORTALITY 32 3  

Distracted day and night by so many things, just eating and  defecating.  

162. Those ponds should be visualized as having a pleasing shape.  I will tell you about them, please listen carefully!  

163. Those ponds are adorned with precious jewels.  

Those eternal abodes are encrusted with gems.  

168. You must perform your practices with the physical body of your  Female Partner.  

Through such practices, you will attain your own Cosmic Substance.  

169. The ponds are within the man, but the woman becomes conscious of  them.  

A Female Partner suitable for such practices should be  

a desirable and joyful woman.  

170. During sexual intercourse, the ponds and lotuses shimmer with  erotic energies.  

The Pond of Divine Love, where Divine Love blossoms, is eternal.  

179. The Village of Eternal Bliss is located along the far shores of the  Crooked River.  

The Crooked River flows in a northerly direction.  

180. Its undulations are pleasing and well formed.  

Its waters flow upward against the current.  

181. To its west is the village called the Primordial Place.  That eternal abode is the place of the Self-Perfected Inner Being.  

182. The community of Experienced Ones dwells in the Place of Eternal  Bliss.  

The Experienced Ones are youthful; the Experienced Ones are  numerous.  

183. The people of the Primordial Place perform the rituals of the  Primordium.  

The Primordial Being is the vessel of all Divine Essence.  

MYSTICAL LIGHTS AND BREATH CONTROL  

184. Following the sunrise, nothing remains in that Land.  Please hear, all Experienced Ones, about the truths of that place.  

185. Please hear, all devotees, the story of the Land of Eternal Bliss.  In that place, neither the moon nor the sun rise; the wind moves not  at all. 

324 GLE N A . HAYE S  

186. There is blue light, white light, and yellow light.  

The three lights glow like the rising sun.  

187. The vessel of nectar is carried along by the rippled waters of the  Crooked River.  

The nostrils force air into that vessel of nectar.  

188. The nose quickly exhales the air that has been inhaled.  The rising sun doesn't glow, yet there are different kinds of light.  

189. The rising sun is absorbed by the brilliance of the lights.  These matters have been covered by other books.  

190. Just as the breath is quickly exhaled through the nose,  so too I narrate this book, The Necklace of Immortality.  

HEROINES OF DIVINE LOVE  

242. The eight Heroines appear in the eight petals of a lotus.  They float in blue lotuses, yellow lotuses, and white lotuses.  

243. Thus the Heroines are visualized in the eight petals.  The eight Heroines who appear in the eight lotus petals are  the Inner Bodies of the Female Partners.  

244. If by this you are able to understand the principles concerning  the realization of the body,  

then, with great devotion, you will know the nine major yogic  channels and the 320 million finer channels within the body.  

256. Divine Love came into being through the churning of the Female  Partner during intercourse.  

Thus there comes into being a place  

called the Pond of Divine Love (prema-sarovara).  

257. Krsna's home is in that pond, which contains drops of Divine Love.  A Female Partner who embodies Divine Essence is a woman suitable  for Krsna.  

258. Continually churning the Female Partner produces the essence  of the Female Partner.  

Deeply entranced day and night, a state of wonder develops.  

THE FEMALE PARTNER AND THE COSMIC REGIONS  

309. The Female Partner and Divine Essence will lead you to the heavens  of Goloka and Vrndavana.  

By understanding these principles, you will master your own lusts. 

THE NECKLACE OF IMMORTALITY 325  

310. You should carefully realize the Female Partner in the Pond of Lust.  Through such practices with a Female Partner, you will attain  the Primordial Cosmic Substance.  

311. The Land of the Hidden Moon is the essence of everything.  There is no Cosmic Substance beyond this Cosmic Substance.  

317. There are seven heavens, seven hells, and eight protectors of the  directions.  

There are the nine major yogic channels, 320 million finer channels,  the cosmic mountain Sumeru, and the jungle.  

318. The Crooked River spirals around them in the four directions,  as the eight Heroines wrap themselves around the trees like creeping  vines.  

319. There is a village called the Place of Eternal Bliss.  

You must certainly make your home in that land.  

328. An ocean of Divine Essence, this book is a like a great god among  the gods.  

This is not paradoxical for the followers of the blessed Inner Body.  

329. That Inner Body is made of eternal Cosmic Substance and is  the essence of practice.  

This book, The Necklace of Immortality, is the vessel of Divine  Essence.  

330. The nectar of the celestial river Mandakini is delightful ambrosia.  Blessed Mukunda-dasa presents The Necklace of Immortality. 

### 19 The Tibetan Practice of the Mantra Path
The Tibetan Practice of the Mantra Path

According to Lce-sgom-pa  

Yael Bentor  

The text translated here is an exposition of the Buddhist Tantric path written in  Tibet in about the twelfth or thirteenth century. It was chosen for the present  volume because of its relatively concise and straightforward style of explaining  Tibetan Tantra. The uncertainty concerning the author's exact identity, dates, and  sectarian affiliation need not concern us here. According to the testimony of the  text itself, its author relies (specifically in the section on the completion process)  on the authority of Naropa. The work from which our selection is taken, The  Outline of the Jewel Mound of Instructions (Man-ngag-rin-chen-spungs-pa'i-dkar-cha

is devoted to the entire Buddhist path. The five opening chapters are concerned  with general Mahayana topics, including the Bodhisattva path, the Perfection of  Wisdom, emptiness, the two truths, and the true nature of things. Our excerpt is  the first part of the sixth chapter entitled "The Teaching of the Practice of the  Mantra Path." The name of the author is given in the work variously as Lce-sgom 

rdzong-pa, Gces-sgom Mkha'-skyong-brag-pa, and other names. For the sake of  brevity we will simply call him Lce-sgom-pa (pronounced Cegompa). This intro duction will be devoted to clarifying Lce-sgom-pa's presentation of the Mantra  path as a guide to the translation. It will closely follow the logical progression of  the text itself. Some may prefer to read the translation first and the introduction  second.  

The author begins his essay by placing the Tantra/Mantra path within the gen eral context of the path to enlightenment. The Buddhist Great Vehicle (Mahayana)  is said to comprise two paths, the path of the Sutra and the path of the Tantra,  also called the Perfection of Wisdom and the Mantra path, respectively. According  to our text, the path of the Sutra was taught by the Buddha for people who are  only slightly afflicted by desire and who are able to renounce the world. This  seems rather tongue-in-cheek, since it is obvious that most people are greatly  afflicted by desire and are not able to renounce the world. It is precisely for this  great majority that the Mantra path was taught. 

MANTRA PATH : LCE-SGOM-P A 327  

Lce-sgom-pa distinguishes three methods for overcoming suffering in samsara,  which results from the emotions afflicting all unenlightened beings. These three  methods reflect the three paths within the Great Vehicle delineated by him - the  Sutra, Tantra/Mantra, and Great Seal. The Sutra path of the Perfection of Wisdom  is the classical method of the Great Vehicle based, for the most part, on the  bodhisattva ideal and the notion of emptiness. The Tantra path is further divided  into two - the common Tantric method, which Lce-sgom-pa calls the path of  purifying the mind in stages, and the path of the Great Seal (mahamudra), which  he defines, in contrast, as an instantaneous practice. This Great Seal is, according  to him, the pinnacle of all Mantra path practices, yet at the same time superior  to it. In the path of the Sutra, the afflicting emotions are regarded as adversaries  to be conquered with some countermeasure. The afflicting emotion of desire may  be overcome through nonattraction, aversion though loving kindness, and igno rance through correct understanding of Buddhist views. The Tantra path, on the  other hand, employs a homeopathic approach - a remedy of a type similar to the  affliction is applied. This method is stated in a famous verse from the Hevajra  Tantra (2.2.52): "By passion beings are bound and by that very passion they are  released." Other examples are a thorn stuck in one's finger, which may be removed  by another thorn, or an Indian washerman who removes the dirt from a cloth by  dirt itself (used in India as cleanser). These examples are easier to understand  than the one given in our text. Lce-sgom-pa emphasizes that the remedies of  corresponding type employed in the Tantra path are not the actual afflicting  emotions. Ordinary desire is cured not by ordinary desire but by sublime desire - desire that has been transformed. Hence, in the Mantra path as well, the ordinary  afflicting emotions are in fact renounced.  

How are one's afflicting emotions transformed? This occurs as part of the prac tice (discussed below) in which meditators transform themselves into enlightened  beings, and their world into the celestial mansion of the mandala in which they  abide. With such a transformation, their enjoyment of objects of desire is said to  be like that of enlightened beings who are making offerings to enlightened beings.  In this case, both offerer and recipient are said to experience perfect enjoyment  untainted by any trace of affliction, such as attachment, miserliness, or jealousy.  They realize that all offerings that appear as forms, sounds, tastes, and so on, are  in actuality nondual enlightened wisdom and emptiness. As such, they function  as objects of the senses that no longer induce ordinary clinging, but rather im 

maculate bliss. In other words, offerings made on the path to enlightenment serve  to transform ordinary attitudes with respect to offerings into a blissful mind that  realizes their true nature. One example of this occurs in the generation process,  wherein practitioners who have been transformed into enlightened beings express  their gratitude to these enlightened beings. Since the practitioners are no longer  distinguished from the enlightened beings, they generate from themselves another  mandala of enlightened beings that is like a reflection in a mirror. This replica  splits off from themselves in the same way that one butter lamp lights another,  without the first losing any of its light. In making the offerings to the enlightened  beings emanated from themselves, practitioners worship these enlightened beings, 

328 YAE L BENTO R  

express their gratitude to them, and accumulate merit on the level of conventional  truth. At the same time, at the level of the highest truth, they meditate on the  true nature of the recipients of these offerings as illusion empty of inherent ex istence. After making their offerings, the recipients of the offerings merge back  into the offerers indistinguishably, like water into water. On the basis of this  visualization, the practitioners meditate on all offerings, offerers, and objects of  offering as empty illusion. They realize that all appearances arise as the role playing of enlightened wisdom. The empty and unobstructed nature of everything  enables them to dissolve one enlightened being into another. Such is precisely  the true nature of things dissolving in the true nature of things. Therefore our  text explains, in words similar to those employed by Milarepa, "One enjoys in  the manner of enlightened beings making offerings to enlightened beings, of the  playfulness of enlightened wisdom in enlightened wisdom, and of the dissolution  of the nature of things into the nature of things. Thereby, the ordinary afflicting  

emotions that afflict one's stream of being are cleared away."  What is the method for overcoming afflicting emotions according to the Great  Seal? Here the meditators do not neutralize them with counteractive antidotes,  nor do they apply remedies of a similar type, but rather realize that they are the  result of their own conceptualization. The workings of the mind cause objects of  desire to appear in the way they appear, and bring about the afflicting emotions  that grasp at them. The example our text provides for the existence of afflicting  emotions is the appearance of water in the desert that arises from optical illusion.  Once the beholders comprehend the phenomenon of a mirage, they understand  the true nature of water in the middle of a desert, and their former mistaken  perception, which holds to the existence of this water, ceases. Because no antidote  is applied in this case, the afflicting emotions are said to be released or liberated  by themselves.  

This classification of the Great Vehicle into three paths that differ in their cure  for the afflicting emotions is not meant so much to illustrate historical develop ments within Buddhism as to serve as a didactic means for presenting the different  approaches and clarifying their unique features. The classification of the three  paths as gradual stages, ranging from the inferior to the superior, allows the  presentation of newer developments - such as the paths of Tantra and the Great  Seal - as both belonging to the Great Vehicle and surpassing it. This presentation  is modeled after the older method of the Great Vehicle itself, which presents  Buddhism in general as consisting of three paths, with the Great Vehicle included  within it in the highest position. In order to emphasize this parallelism, Lce-sgom 

pa first introduces the three vehicles for the path in Buddhism in general - those  of the Hearers (sravakas), the Solitary Buddhas (pratyekabuddhas), and the Bo dhisattvas - while adding that only the last of these is capable of leading to bud dhahood itself. The two others were taught for people with lesser capacities, as  skillful means for gradually leading them into the Great Vehicle of the Bodhisat tvas. Similarly, the paths of Mantra and the Great Seal are part of the Great Vehicle,  yet are reserved for practitioners with the highest capacities. 

MANTR A PATH : LCE-SGOM-P A 329  

Before practitioners may embark on the Tantric practices that lead to liberation,  they must receive initiation from their gurus. This initiation is called ripening  initiation, since it activates the disciples' capacities to engage in the practice. In  receiving initiation, the disciples gain the first inner experience of the meditation,  such as seeing themselves as enlightened beings. When both guru and disciple  are worthy, the disciple shares in the meditation of his or her guru. They also  share in the meditation of the entire lineage of teachers, who have achieved direct  experience in that meditation. Our text lists two essential roles of the initiation:  cleansing the disciples' impurities and endowing them with efficacy. The first is  said to purify the disciples' entire being - expressed in terms of their body,  speech, and mind - by removing obstacles that prevent access to the practice,  such as habitual tendencies. Each of the inner experiences in the initiation is  represented by an external symbolic ritual action. The purification is symbolized  by the vase initiation, in which gurus or their helpers pour consecrated water  from a decorated vase into the disciples' hands. At that time the disciples visualize,  in the space above themselves, a mandala of enlightened beings, with the female  enlightened beings holding up decorated vases filled with nectar, which they pour  on the disciples' heads. They are to feel that the nectar completely fills their bodies  and purifies them of all their defilements.  

The second role of initiation is to endow the disciple with the ability to perform  the practice. The literal meaning of the Tibetan word for initiation is "empower ment." It empowers disciples with the spiritual powers of the entire lineage of  gurus, rendering them appropriate recipients for the practice. Here the disciples  should visualize that the nectar filling their bodies transmits the powers of all  their gurus. The initiation consists of four parts, each empowering the disciples  with the capacity to engage in a successive practice on the path. First, the vase  initiation transforms disciples into vessels suitable for the generation process in  which they transform themselves into enlightened beings. Second, the secret ini tiation renders the disciples suitable vessels for engaging in the practice of the  subtle body, composed of cakras, channels (nadis), and winds (pranas). This prac tice is based on the practitioner's own body, in contrast with the following initi ation, which relies on another person's body. This is the initiation of enlightened  wisdom (jnana) with a consort (prajria) that consists of sexual yoga and turns the  disciple into a suitable vessel for engaging in meditation on bliss together with a  consort. The fourth initiation, which is nonconceptual, empowers the disciple to  practice the meditation of the Great Seal.  

According to the tradition of the new schools as followed by our text, the  Tantric system is divided into four cycles. In the lowest of these, that of Action  (Kriya) Tantra, only the first initiation, the vase initiation, is conferred, whereas  in the fourth one, that of Highest Yoga (Anuttarayoga) Tantra, all four initiations  are conferred. In the second Tantric cycle, that of Performance (Carya) Tantra,  and in the cycles beyond it, the five initiations of knowledge are conferred. These  five initiations transform one's five afflicting emotions and five aggregates into the  five enlightened wisdoms and the five buddhas (tathagatas) of the mandala. The 

330 YAE L BENTO R  

water initiation puts out the fire of hatred, actualizes the mirrorlike enlightened  wisdom, and transforms the aggregate of form into Vairocana. The crown initia tion destroys the mountain of pride, actualizes the enlightened wisdom of equa nimity, and transforms the aggregate of feeling into Ratnasambhava. The vajra  initiation overcomes the poison of desire, actualizes the enlightened wisdom of  particularized understanding, and transforms the aggregate of perception into  Amitabha. The bell initiation releases the chains of jealousy, actualizes the en lightened wisdom of accomplishments, and transforms the aggregate of condi tionings into Amoghasiddhi. The name initiation dispels the darkness of igno rance, actualizes the enlightened wisdom of the nature of reality, and transforms  the aggregate of consciousness into Aksobhya.  

In the third Tantric cycle, that of Yoga Tantra, the initiation that authorizes the  disciples to become teachers or gurus is also conferred. The complete set of ini tiations conferred in the cycles of Highest Yoga Tantra enables its recipients to  engage in the two main practices that will be explained below, the generation  process and the completion process. The initiations are of varying degrees of  complexity. According to Lce-sgom-pa, these depend on the preferences and eco nomic means of the disciple. In the most elaborate initiation, multicolored pre cious stones, or at least colored grain or powder, are used to draw the mandala.  In the Kalacakra initiation, conferred nowadays by the fourteenth Dalai Lama in  the West, it is such a colored-powder mandala that is used. Some mandalas have  even found permanent homes in European and Northern American museums.  This permanence goes against the intent of the traditional ritual, at the end of  which the colored-powder mandala is destroyed and scattered into a body of  water. Although an initiation based on a colored-sand mandala creates a profound  impression in disciples, a true disciple does not require any ritual or implement.  

The effect of the initiation is explained in terms of the disciples' basis, path, and  fruit. The basis is the disciples' ground state before receiving initiation. The initiation  purifies the basic condition of the disciples' body, speech, and mind. In terms of  the path, the four initiations endow disciples with the ability to engage in the four  practices on the path to enlightenment (the generation process, the practice of the  subtle body, the meditation on bliss that relies on a consort, and the Great Seal).  The fruit of these practices is an awakened or enlightened being, a buddha endowed  with the four bodies (or embodiments) - the emanation body (nirmanakaya), the  embodiment of enjoyment (sambhogakaya), the dharma embodiment (dharmakaya)  

and the embodiment of the essential nature (svabhavikakaya).  

Having explicated the initiations, Lce-sgom-pa explains the practices on the  path, beginning with the generation process. The generation process is so called  because, by means of visualization, practitioners generate themselves as chosen  enlightened beings at the center of a mandala. Our text emphasizes that regardless  of the visualization technique, this meditation is a progressive and gradual pro 

cess, in contrast to the instantaneous practice of the Great Seal. The first purpose  of this practice, as listed by Lce-sgom-pa, is the purification of ordinary conceptual  thoughts. Since classical Buddhism, conceptual modes of thinking have been 

MANTRA PATH: LCE-SGOM-PA 331  

counted among the core roots of samsara. Things do not exist in the way they  appear to the ordinary mental apparatus. By means of the generation process,  ordinary perception of the world and its contents - all its inhabitants - dissolves  away and is replaced with the mandala and the enlightened beings inhabiting it.  Through such practice, one conceptualization is replaced with another - though  the later conceptualization is somewhat more "true," since it is in this form that  actual reality appears to enlightened beings. However, the shift from one concep tualization to another demonstrates both the relative nature of each and the work 

ings of the human mind in creating such conceptualizations. The nature of mental  construction is more apparent with regard to the mandala than with regard to  the external world, and this serves to illuminate the dreamlike nature of ordinary  reality, as well. Eventually both conceptualizations will dissolve.  

The generation process aids not only in recognizing conceptualization as con ceptualization but also in utilizing the power of practitioners' minds to transform  and recreate their reality. The control achieved over the visualization of themselves  as enlightened beings at the center of a mandala can also be employed for ma nipulating the ordinary reality that has been replaced by this visualization. Once  the nature of the workings of the mind is realized, one can, by knowing their true  nature, create whatever appearances one wishes. Hence, one can "truly" transform  the ordinary world into that of the divine mandala, while comprehending the  true nature of this new reality.  

The second purpose of the generation process, according to our text, is the  actual engagement in the meditations of tranquil abiding (samatha) and penetra tive insight (vipasyana). These two meditations are the paradigmatic meditations  of classical Buddhism that the Tantra, being both unable and unwilling to discard,  appropriates. The Tantra path maintains that its practice not only fulfills both of  these meditations but also supersedes them. Tranquil abiding can be attained  through one-pointed concentration on the visualized enlightened being, while  penetrative insight can be accomplished by understanding the true nature of this  enlightened being as a dreamlike illusion, empty of intrinsic existence. This is in  addition to the other attainments of the generation practice.  

The third purpose of the generation process, according to the general Tibetan  tradition, is to prepare a basis for the completion process. It seems that the gen eration process has at times been taken to be an autonomous meditative trans formation able to achieve the goal of attaining buddhahood in and of itself. In  combining the different Tantric practices into a systematic path, however, the  generation process is usually allotted a position subordinate to that of the com pletion process.  

The fourth purpose is to attain the form body (rupakaya) of the Buddha. The  three or four bodies or embodiments of the Buddha are divided into the form  bodies and the dharma embodiment. Whereas the completion process is said to  accomplish the latter, the generation process with its visualization of oneself in  the form of a chosen enlightened beings considered to effect the realization of  the form body.  

In addition to the completion process performed in the cycle of Highest Yoga 

332 YAEL BENTO R  

Tantra alone, there is yet another practice by the same name that is performed at  the conclusion of the generation process in the various Tantric cycles. Lce-sgom pa points out that these two completion processes should not be confused, and  lists three types of completion processes that belong to the generation process.  The first is sealing with the four seals (the seal of union, the seal of dharma, the  seal of action, and the great seal), which effects the realization of the meditator  as an enlightened being whose true essence is nondual emptiness and appearance.  The second completion process within the generation process is meditation on  the enlightened being as illusion. Here, meditation on the form of the enlightened  wisdom with all its intricate details, as well as the practitioner's identification with  this form, is infused with a meditation on its illusory empty nature. The purpose  of the generation process is not to replace practitioners' fixations on their ordinary  existence and their ordinary world with yet another fixation on themselves as  enlightened beings in a wonderful celestial mandala. Therefore, the generation  process is not complete without this meditation on those enlightened beings as  intangible - a rainbow in the sky, having the nature of light empty of intrinsic  nature, yet another conceptualization of the mind.  

This is also the purpose of the third completion process within the generation  process, in which the visualization of oneself as an enlightened being at the center  of a mandala is gathered back at the end of the meditative session and dissolved  into emptiness. Everything that has been created out of the expanse of emptiness  dissolves back into this primordial state. This dissolution serves to demonstrate  the true nature of the visualization - an empty illusion - and to prevent attach 

ment to the reality created through the generation itself. In Highest Yoga Tantra,  the emphasis is often shifted from these three forms of completion to the com pletion process per se.  

The essence of this completion process is enlightened wisdom characterized by  three qualities - bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality. The discussion is again ar ranged in terms of the basis, path, and fruit of the completion process. The true  mode of being of the bodily aspect at the disciple's basis (prior to embarking on  the path) is the subtle body that consists of channels, energies, and the pure  elements of the white and red drops. Whereas the coarse white and red drops  received from the father and mother respectively - drops that together produce  one's physical body - lead to rebirth in samsara, the pure white and red drops  lead into the spiritual birth of the mind of enlightenment. The true mode of being  of the mental aspect at the basis is a great bliss that is primordially empty, devoid  of essence, and lacking in any mental construct. By realizing the true mode of  being of their bodies, practitioners come to know the crucial points of the medi 

tation; and by realizing the true mode of being of their minds, they come to know  the crucial nature of the meaning that they should meditate upon. With the  realization of these two true modes of being, they proceed to the path of the  completion process, which consists of the three practices into which they are  initiated through the three higher initiations. The first of these is the practice in  reliance on one's own body that, according to our text, consists of the six yogasMANTR A PATH : LCE-SGOM-P A 333  

of Naropa; the second is the practice in reliance on the body of a consort; and  the third is the Great Seal. The fruits of this path are the four yogas of the Great  Seal (one-pointedness, lacking mental constructions, the singularity of plurality,  and the stream of innate nature without meditation).  

When it is instantaneous, the Great Seal is not a practice. A practice is a gradual  process with a beginning, middle, and end, composed of meditation, object of  meditation, and so on. In the nondual nonconceptual Great Seal, there is neither  meditation, nor object of meditation, nor meditator. These distinctions are the  source of the problem, since as long as one engages in conceptual thinking, one  cannot reach beyond it. Hence, the four yogas of the Great Seal are the natural,  spontaneous fruit of the prior practice on the path, and they may be seen as four  aspects of a single meditation. Still, in accordance with the faculties of the prac titioner, the four yogas may arise simultaneously, gradually, or by leaping to a  higher level, as Lce-sgom-pa points out.  

Four purposes are listed for the completion process. The first is relinquishing  any attachment to the visualized enlightened being and realizing that its nature  is suchness, just like that of any other phenomenon - a purpose quite similar to  those of the completion processes that belong to the generation process. The  second purpose is achieving a direct experience of great bliss that is indistinguish 

able from enlightened wisdom, through practices relying on one's own body and  the body of another. The third is the purification of cognitive obstruction, the  counterpart to the purification of emotional obscurations said to be achieved  through the generation process. The fourth is attaining the dharma embodiment  that complements the attainment of the form body realized in the generation  process.  

Next in the topics of discussion are practices undertaken outside the formal  meditation session, between meditation sessions or in postmeditation. Postme ditation is of utmost importance for the practitioner's meditative experience, and  Lce-sgom-pa devotes much space to it. Sitting in meditation withdrawn from  everything is not an end in itself. The purpose of meditation is to effect and  transform one's entire being. Hence, Lce-sgom-pa explains that after arising from  their formal meditation, practitioners should preserve their meditative experiences  and combine them with their daily activities. Those who have not attained mean ingful meditative experiences in their formal meditation should in the meantime  engage in religious practice between meditative sessions.  

Like the formal sessions themselves, these practices differ among the various  vehicles. Having renounced all sensual pleasures, Hearers and Solitary Buddhas  engage in bodily ascetic practices. Lce-sgom-pa refers ironically to the bodily  hardship and the difficulty of these practices, implying that these practitioners  may not achieve much beyond the hardship itself. Bodhisattvas also abandon  objects of desire, while practicing the ten perfections for the sake of leading others  to enlightenment. On this point, our text maintains that Tantric practitioners do  not renounce the objects of the senses, but understand their true nature. In con trast to the practices of the actual meditative session - which he mentions only 

334 YAE L BENTO R  

in passing, assuming the reader (or hearer) to be already familiar with them - Lce-sgom-pa describes the practices outside the meditation session in some detail.  These depend on the practitioners' meditative experiences. Beginners in medita tion engage mainly in practices performed between meditative sessions. Since the  great majority of the followers of the Tantric path are beginners, these are very  popular practices, in both senses of the word. They are considered to be conducive  to actual meditative experience, since they contribute to the accumulation of merit  and wisdom and to the removal of any impediments to the meditation that may  follow. Among the practices that our text lists are recitations of mantras, such as  the Om mani padme hum that springs constantly from the lips of so many Tibetans.  The yoga of food means that the daily meals taken between meditative sessions  are considered as offerings to the enlightened being one is practicing to become.  Tormas, generally, are food offerings made to one's enlightened beings and pro tectors. A mandal is a symbolic offering of the entire universe, the greatest offering  one could imagine. It exhibits both the importance of these offerings to the offerers  and their nonattachment to the material world. The seven-limbed practice, in its  Tantric version, includes prostration, offering, confession of sins, rejoicing in the  joy of others, seeking refuge in the Three Jewels, generating the Bodhisattva's  mind for enlightenment, and dedicating one's merit to all. The water offering is  made to hungry ghosts tormented by hunger and thirst, whose insatiable craving  is iconographically represented by their huge bellies and tiny mouths. Many Ti betans make daily offerings of water to quench their thirst. Tsha-tshas are small  images or stupas stamped in clay or water for the accumulation of merit. Often  they also contain ashes of one's parent or lama. Circumambulations of holy places,  temples, monasteries, and so forth also serve for the accumulation of merit.  Rounding out the list of these popular practices are the recitation and copying of  Buddhist scriptures, studying and understanding them, as well as teaching them  to others.  

The next stage, following that of the beginners, occurs when a slight inner  experience arises in meditative equipoise. This experience should be applied to  postmeditation activities. For example, when during their formal meditative ses sion practitioners engage in the generation process, they meditate on the illusory  empty nature of themselves as enlightened beings. In postmeditation they should  apply this realization to everything that appears to their senses. In a similar way,  they combine their inner realization during the completion process with their  ordinary activities in the external world. Not only are they to apply their medi tative experiences to daily life but their everyday experience should also serve to  sustain their formal meditation. In their postmeditation, the practitioners should  first understand that all phenomena appear to them in the way they appear as a  result of their own mental processes; and then realize that these mental processes  too are empty of inherent existence. Since everything is empty and unobstructed,  one thing can simply dissolve into another, which is tantamount to the dissolution  of the nature of things into the nature of things as Lce-sgom-pa describes.  The third stage of this postmeditational practice occurs when the slight inner 

MANTRA PATH : LCE-SGOM-P A 335  

experience evolves into a slight stability in the experience. In order to enhance  that stability, a special practice called "taming the engagement of awareness" is  performed. Once again, depending on the distinctive characteristics of the prac titioners, this practice may be performed "with mental elaborations," "without  mental elaborations," and "completely without mental elaborations." According  to our text, the first is intended for practitioners who are rich and young but lack  in true understanding, the second for those of medium possessions, age, and  wisdom; and the last for those who are impoverished and old but possess great  wisdom.  

The first group tames the engagement of their awareness by actually acting out  the mandala. Together with yogins and yoginis in a number equal to that of the  male and female enlightened beings of their chosen mandala, they withdraw to a  solitary place. There they prepare a mandala, and while occupying the abodes of  the enlightened beings in it, they practice the generation and completion processes  with all the ritual details. The offerings play an instrumental role in the transfor 

mation of the practitioners into enlightened beings. In making ritual offerings,  they practice in the manner of enlightened beings making offerings to enlightened  beings until they actualize this mode of offering.  

In contrast to this training, those who tame the engagement of their awareness  "completely without mental elaborations" perform the practice known as "the  activity of a bhusuku." Bhusuku is a Sanskrit acronym for "eating, sleeping, and  defecating." Apart from these three life-sustaining actions, these practitioners do  nothing but meditate on emptiness. It is by playing on the meaning of the Tibetan  word for "taming the engagement" (brtul-zhugs) that Lce-sgom-pa explains this  practice, which consists of taming (brtul) the ordinary mental processes that in volve conceptual thinking, and infusing (zhugs) all external and internal events  into the mandala of enlightened beings. Here, Lce-sgom-pa applies one of the  classic Buddhist meditative sequences as the guideline for this Tantric meditation.  The practitioners should first see themselves and their world as the celestial man 

dala and the enlightened beings dwelling in it, while maintaining the conventional  temporary nature of that mandala. Second, they realize how that mandala and its  inhabitants came into being through the working of their ordinary minds. Third,  they realize that in actual fact the true mind does not objectify or perceive external  objects (mi dmigs-pa), since the true nature of everything is emptiness. Nonper 

ception of objects brings about a new type of perception, a direct realization of  the true nature of things. The four steps in this meditation endow the four kinds  of offerings - outer, inner, secret, and suchness - with a new meaning.  

These three practices for taming the engagement of the awareness - with, with out, and completely without mental elaborations - enhance the practitioners' sta bility of meditative experience, and lead them to the fourth stage of the postme ditative practice, in which a very stable experience is reached. At this stage the  

practitioners explore the degree to which their meditative experience has been  secured by undertaking the so-called "practice of the crazy yogin." This is a serious  test for their equanimity and impartiality. For example, their experience of having 

336 YAEL BENTOR  

a nice meal should not be the least bit different from eating excrement; drinking  beer from drinking urine, and so forth. They should experience a total equanimity  not only toward undertaking these diametrically opposed activities but also with  regard to abstaining from them. This is a state of complete freedom from duality.  It is no longer a practice of postmeditation, since there is no longer any such  distinction to be made.  

Lce-sgom-pa warns against the misuse of these highest practices - of taming  the engagement of the awareness and the practice of the crazy yogin - by ignorant  persons who do not understand their true purpose. He emphasizes that it is only  for persons endowed with spiritual qualities that these practices can be factors  conducive to enlightenment. Moreover, the subject of the second part of this  chapter, the keeping of the practitioner's vows and commitments on the path,  which is not translated here, also stresses the moral foundations of this practice.  Lce-sgom-pa concludes the present section by reiterating the Tantra/Mantra  method of employing the "enemy" for overcoming that "enemy." Whereas in the  view of the Sutras the enjoyment of the senses is the cause of bondage in samsara,  the Tantra maintains that this very enjoyment is the key to liberation from sam sara. The Tantra, however, makes practitioners' reliance on the enjoyment of the  senses conditional on their thorough understanding of the true nature of sense  objects. Recognizing the essential characteristics of the objects of desire and their  effect on the mind is the foundation of the Great Seal, and the subject of the  seventh chapter of Lce-sgom-pa's Outline of the Jewel Mound of Instructions.

"The Practice of the Mantra Path" by Lce-sgom-pa  

While bowing down with reverence through my three avenues of being [my  body, speech, and mind] to the lama, yi-dam [tutelary deities], and dakinis, I  have written concisely on the theory and practice of the Mantra, the path of  the swift messenger of excellent skillful means.  

Thinking about the inconceivable number of types of sentient beings to be  trained, the completely perfect Buddha taught, on the whole, an inconceivable  diversity of vehicles for the path. But, in fact those vehicles for nirvana are  three. Furthermore, the path that brings attainment of the highest buddhahood  is nothing but the Great Vehicle (Mahayana). The others, the two vehicles of  Hearers and Solitary Buddhas, were taught as skillful means for gradually in 

ducting into the Great Vehicle people of lesser mental capacities. The Sutra of  Great Liberation That Expands in All Directions teaches:  

O sons of noble families, for example, just as one person has three names - when he is young he is called a child, when he is over twenty years old, he  is called a man, and after passing the age of eighty he is called an old per son - just so are the three vehicles of mine. To the Hearers whose minds  are limited I taught the small vehicle, to the Solitary Buddhas whose minds  are moderately expanded I taught the medium vehicle, and to the Bodhi sattvas who have entered the great path, I taught the great vehicle. O son of  noble family, even though there are diverse doors for understanding, even tually, they are united into one juncture. This juncture is the One Vehicle  (Ekayana), which when separated through skillful means is considered to  be three. The vehicles of the Hearers and of Solitary Buddhas are included 

338 YAEL BENTOR  

as well in the Great Vehicle. The Great Vehicle alone is the vehicle for bud dhahood. Therefore, even though there are three vehicles, these are the One  Vehicle.  

Also the Song of the Names of Manjusri (Manjusrinamasangiti) states:  

Realizing the advantages for beings of the methods and ways of the different  vehicles, he [Manjusri] has gone forth from the three vehicles and abides in  the fruit of the one vehicle.  

The Great Vehicle, taking into account the two different types of people who  are receptacles for the practice, but who have not yet reached the path of Seeing,  taught two dissimilar systems for the path. In taking into account those people  who are only slightly afflicted by the desire for sense objects, who have the  ability to renounce, and who aspire to attain awakening, the path of the Per 

fection of Wisdom of the Great Vehicle was taught. In taking into account  those who are greatly afflicted by the desire for sense objects, who are unable  to renounce, and who aspire to awakening, the Mantra path was taught. Also  within the Mantra itself two paths were taught: 1. the path of purifying the  mind in stages by the outer and inner generation process and by the completion  process, and 2. the path of the Great Seal that is the instantaneous practice of  the essential meaning.  

The method of overcoming the afflicting emotions in the Perfection of Wis dom of the Great Vehicle is as follows: Having placed the afflicting emotions  and the objects of desire in the position of an enemy, one overcomes them by  means of an antidote of the opposing type, an antidote that contradicts them.  By meditating on nonattraction as an antidote to desire, on loving kindness as  an antidote to aversion, and on codependent origination as an antidote to ig norance, and so forth, one overcomes them. In the Mantra system of the Great  Vehicle, one overcomes the afflicting emotions of passion through antidotes of  a corresponding type. One meditates on sublime desire as an antidote to or dinary desire. Having transformed the entire vessel-world and its content-in habitants into a celestial mansion-mandala with pure enlightened beings, one  enjoys in the manner of enlightened being making offerings to enlightened  being, of the playfulness of enlightened wisdom in enlightened wisdom, and  of the dissolution of the nature of things into the nature of things. Thereby,  the ordinary afflicting emotions that afflict one's stream of being are cleared  away - in the same way, for example, as one would soothe a burn by fumi gating it in the same fire that caused it - in order that the pain of the burn  quickly subside. The method of overcoming the afflicting emotions in the in stantaneous Great Seal is to recognize their essential characteristics, and  thereby abandon them. By realizing the inherent nature or the essential char acteristics of the conceptualization of the objects of desire and of the afflicting  emotions as the nonarising true nature of reality, the holding of things as real  is reversed. By virtue of this reversal, craving and aversion are naturally lib-

MANTRA PATH: LCE-SGOM-PA 339  

erated. For example, one might mistakenly take a mirage to be a body of water,  but by carefully investigating, seeing that there is no water there, the clinging  to the holding of the mirage as water is naturally liberated. Hence even Tantra  does not teach that the actual afflicting emotions are taken on the path. Al 

though there is some variation in their methods of abandoning the afflicting  emotions, in terms of abandonment itself there is no difference between the  three paths.  

Now, generally speaking the majority of the gods and people of the Desire  Realm, greatly afflicted by desire for objects of the senses, are unable to re nounce, but still aspire to awakening. For them the Buddha taught the method  of training on the path through the special means of the Tantra belonging to  the Great Vehicle (Mahayana). There are two general subjects here: 1. the path  of the initiations that bring maturation and 2. the path of the skillful means  that bring liberation.  

THE PATH OF THE RIPENING INITIATION  

1. The essential nature of the initiation is cleansing the impurities of the  stream of being of the disciple and endowing them with efficacy. 2. The ety mology: It is called "ripening" because it causes the unripe basis to ripen, and  it is called "initiation" because having been made into a receptacle suitable for  meditation on a particular path, one is initiated, empowered for meditation on  that particular path. 3. The divisions of the initiation: In terms of their essential  meanings there are four divisions. The first is the vase initiation, the second  the secret initiation, the third the enlightened wisdom initiation with a consort  (prajna), and the fourth the precious word initiation. There are two divisions  to the vase initiation, the initiation of the disciple and the initiation of the  teacher (vajracarya). In both the secret initiation and the consort initiation  there are two divisions: the initiation of the path of passion [formation] and  the initiation of the path of liberation [dissolution]. There are no divisions in  the fourth initiation. It is the "leaping over" or the culmination of all four  initiations. There are three divisions in terms of the degree of elaboration:  {Those who are wealthy and who like mental elaboration} are conferred elab orate initiation by means of a mandala of powdered precious substances, grain,  or colored powder. {Those with medium wealth and understanding) are given  a medium initiation by means of a body mandala, or a mandal of a bouquet of  flowers. Those who posses little wealth and do not like mental elaboration are  conferred the four initiations in an abbreviated form by means of the body,  speech, and mind of the lama, or an emblem, or some small article of initiation.  

4. The internal grades of the initiation are four in number: The cycle of the  Action Tantra (Kriya Tantra) teaches that the initiation is conferred with the  water of the vase using only a mandal. Its initiand becomes a vessel suitable  for meditation on the enlightened being by merely bestowing permission for  the mantra. The cycle of Performance Tantra (Carya Tantra) teaches that 

340 YAEL BENTO R  

through the five initiations of knowledge and the initiation of vajra practice,  six initiations in all, the initiand becomes a suitable vessel. The Yoga Tantra  explains that through the complete initiation, beginning with the five initia tions of knowledge and followed by the initiation of the disciple and the ini tiation of the teacher, the initiand becomes a suitable vessel. The Highest Yoga  Tantra (Anuttara Yoga Tantra) explains that through the complete vase initi ation as well as the three supreme initiations the initiand becomes a vessel  suitable for meditation on the entire path of the generation process and com pletion process.  

5. This being so, there are three benefits or purposes for conferring the four  initiations: The first benefit or purpose is purifying the basis from aspects of  impurity. First, the vase initiation mainly purifies the impurity of the bad ha bitual tendencies of the body. Second, the secret initiation mainly purifies the  impurities of speech. Third, the initiation of enlightened wisdom with a consort  mainly purifies the impurities of the mind. Fourth, the precious word initiation  purifies every impurity of the body, speech, and mind - all three. The second  benefit or purpose is making the initiand a vessel suitable for meditation on  the four paths. The vase initiation makes the initiand a vessel suitable for  meditation on the generation process of oneself as an enlightened being. The  secret initiation makes the initiand a vessel suitable for meditation in which  one's own body possesses skillful means, such as the "channels and winds" [the  subtle body]. The initiation of enlightened wisdom with a consort makes the  initiand a vessel suitable for meditation on the bliss that relies on the consort,  the body of another. The fourth initiation makes the initiand a vessel suitable  for meditation on the instantaneous Great Seal. The third purpose of conferring  the four initiations is to bring the initiand into the fortunate state of attaining  the four embodiments of the fruit. The giving of the vase initiation brings the  initiand into the fortunate state of attaining the emanation body of the fruit.  Similarly, the secret initiation brings the initiand into the fortunate state of  attaining the embodiment of enjoyment. The initiation of enlightened wisdom  with a consort leads to the Dharma embodiment, and the fourth initiation to  the embodiment of the essential nature. In short, initiation brings the initiand  into the fortunate state of attaining all the good qualities and accomplishments,  both mundane and supermundane.  

According to the system of Lama Naropa, there are three general topics on  the path of the skillful means that bring liberation: the yoga of the path; the  conducive practices; and the companion vows. The yoga of the path is divided  into two practices, the generation process and the completion process.  

In the generation process there are five topics.  

1. The essential nature: One should generate that which is to be generated - whatever enlightened being one chooses with the appropriate components of  the skillful method.  

2. There are two kinds of divisions: The divisions appropriate to different  texts are two: the generation process for attaining the common accomplish-

MANTR A PATH : LCE-SGOM-P A 341  

ments according to manuals of ritual collections, and the generation process  for attaining the supreme accomplishment. For these divisions one needs to  consider each individual text. The divisions according to the degree of elabo ration are three: extensive meditation on the wheel of the mandala; middle  meditation; and concise meditation on the main ornament of the male heroic  being or of the female heroic being.  

3. The etymology: Because this is a process of visualizing the generation of  the supporting celestial mansion [the mandala] and the supported enlightened  beings [residing in it], it is called "generation process."  

4. The methods of meditation are of two types: Those who pursue the pro found and are not fond of the elaborate generate the complete visualization  in an instant. Then in clarifying the visualization in stages, they meditate.  And those who pursue the extensive and are fond of the elaborate, meditate  in stages on the proceedings of the practice. Clarifying the visualization in  stages for as long as they are not weary, they meditate. The method of medi tation for each of these should be known from the practice manual of each  meditation.  

5. There are four purposes: The purpose of purifying ordinary conceptual  thoughts; the purpose of the actual arising of the concentration of tranquil  abiding and the spontaneous arising of penetrative insight; the purpose of pre paring a basis for the completion process; and the purpose of attaining the  perfect form-body of the fruit.  

In the generation process [in the cycles] up to Yoga Tantra - apart from  merely sealing with the four seals, meditating on the body of the enlightened  beings as illusion, gathering back in stages the enlightened being and its ce lestial mansion at the end of the meditative session, and meditating on emp tiness - there is no completion process with its distinctive methods. Above and  beyond the generation process, Highest Yoga Tantra also teaches the comple tion process.  

In the completion process there are also five topics.  

1. The essential nature of the completion process is the actual generation of  the enlightened wisdom of bliss, clarity, and nonconceptual thought in the  body and mind by setting the mind on certain supports.  

2. There are three divisions according to the system of Lama Naropa. a. The  "natural state of the basic entity": First, the natural state of the basic entity of  the body is the natural condition of the bodily channels, the winds and the  pure elements of bodhicitta [thought of enlightenment]. By knowing all these  conditions exactly, one knows the crucial points of the meditation. Second, the  natural state of the basic entity of the mind: The actual natural condition of  the mind as such is great bliss, primordially empty, devoid of inherent essence,  lacking mental elaborations. By realizing well this natural condition, one knows  the essential nature of the meaning off which to meditate. By realizing these  two aspects of the natural state of the basic entity in this way, one knows the  meaning on which to meditate, and the crucial points of the meditation. b. The 

342 YAEL BENTOR  

"natural state of the path": Knowing the basic entity in this way leads to the  teachings on the natural state of the path. There are three practices here de pending on the stream of being of the practitioner: the practice of one's own  body as possessing the means; the practice, with a consort (the body of another);  and the practice of nondual Great Seal. The practice that relies on one's own  body as the means is known as the "six dharmas" in the system of Lama Naropa.  c. The "natural state of the fruit": Practicing these leads to the "process of arising  of the natural state of the fruit" within one's stream of being. This is "arising  in the mode of the four kinds of the yoga of experiencing the true condition":  the yoga of one-pointedness, the yoga free of mental elaborations, the yoga of  the multitude as one taste, and the yoga of the stream of the innate nature  without meditation. These too arise gradually, instantaneously, or in leaping  over, depending on the special faculties of the person who is the receptacle for  the practice. For the meaning of these you should examine the Great Guidance  of the Path.  

3. The etymology: Because one perfectly completes enlightened wisdom it is  called "completion process."  

4. You should know the practice of meditative techniques from the trans mission.  

5. There are four purposes for the completion process: a. The purpose of  abandoning clinging to the enlightened being of the generation process, while  realizing this enlightened being as the true nature of things; b. The purpose of  directly realizing the natural innate enlightened wisdom and great bliss; this  purpose is fulfilled by relying on the special method whereby the meditative  experience that dissolves and increases the pure elements takes the practition ers through the rebirth process by means of bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality.  In relying on the special method, the meditative experience that dissolves and  increases the pure elements takes the practitioners through the rebirth pro 

cesses by means of bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality, whereupon they realize  directly the natural coemergent enlightened wisdom and great bliss, c. The  purpose of purifying all the cognitive obscurations, d. The purpose of coming  to attain the dharma embodiment of the final fruit.  

Now, the teachings on the conducive practices.  

1. The essential nature of these practices: Having been absorbed in a con centration within meditative equipoise, one practices preserving the experi ences of meditative equipoise in the postmeditation phase by combining it with  various daily activities.  

2. The practice is divided into two parts: a. First is the "practice-without passion," which is subdivided into two parts. The lesser practice is the practice  of the Hearers and the Solitary Buddhas: after abandoning completely all the  objects of the senses, they undertake practices that cause bodily hardship and  weariness, such as the twelve ascetic practices. The extensive practice is the  practice of the Bodhisattva: after abandoning the objects of the senses, theyMANTR A PATH : LCE-SGOM-P A 343  

practice the ten perfections for the sake of others, b. The "practice-with-pas sion" is the practice of the Mantra. By means of thoroughly knowing the true  nature of all appearances, they train in the path while relying on the five objects  of the senses. The Guhyasamaja says: "The enlightened wisdom with passion  always relies on objects of the senses with desire." In classifying that practice  of the Mantra there are four stages: beginners' practice; the practice of those  in whom slight experience has arisen; the practice of attaining a slight stability  in the experience; and the practice of attaining a great stability in experience.  3. The methods of the practice:  

a. Beginners' practice: Beginners chiefly engage in practice between medi tative sessions - in the recitation of mantras, food yoga, tormas, mandals, the  seven-limbed practice, water offerings, tsha-tshas, circumambulations, recita tion of sutras, listening and explaining the teaching, realizing the view of the  teaching, writing the letters of the scriptures, and so forth, with great devotion.  They perform the complete practice, including the preparation, main part, and  conclusion. By mainly performing these practices, beginners perfect the accu mulations and purify the obscurations, thereby developing the factors condu cive to the arising of experience in the mind. These are called the practices of  Samantabhadra.  

b. The practice at the time of the arising of a slight inner experience, as a  result of that beginner's practice: The practitioners unify the slight inner ex perience that arises in their meditative equipoise with their postmeditation,  and combine it with everything that appears to their sense faculties. Further,  just as in the meditative equipoise of the generation process they meditate on  the mandala of the enlightened beings of their yi-dam, so too in postmeditation,  they should meditate on and see all appearances as the illusory mandala of the  enlightened beings. They also should combine the experience as it is generated  in the meditative equipoise of the completion process with everything that  appears to themselves in postmeditation, and unify them. In short, when the  practitioners arise from their meditative equipoise and engage in the manifold  external world, enjoying forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and objects of touch,  they then know all these to be of the inherent nature of the enlightened beings.  Further, {since they know them as) their own {mind}, and they know the true  nature of their mind as emptiness, they practice in the manner {of enlightened  beings making offerings to enlightened beings, in the playfulness of enlightened  wisdom in enlightened wisdom} and in the dissolution of the nature of things  into the nature of things. Hence, everything that appears to their faculties in  the postmeditation phase assists them on their path. This is called the secret  practice as well as the practice of realization. They should rely on these ritual  actions between the meditative sessions described above - actions that are ben eficial to their meditative experience and do not harm it, and avoid any harm  to their meditative experience.  

c. Performing in this manner brings about the practice at the time of attaining  a slight stability in the experience. For the sake of enhancing that experience, 

344 YAE L BENTO R  

they should practice taming the engagement of their awareness. For this there  are three practices.  

i. The practice with mental elaborations: Those persons who are receptacles  for the practice that possess great riches are young in age, and small in wisdom  perform in the following manner. In a very secluded place that is in harmony  with their mind, they arrange perfect requisites for the feast offering. In an  upper chamber they arrange a mandala, receptacles and offerings decorated  with various ornaments, and prepare there a seat for the yogins and yoginis.  They gather consorts, endowed with the essential characteristics, in a number  equal to that of the female enlightened beings of the mandala. Then the yogins  and yoginis enter into the abodes of the heroes and heroines in the mandala.  They meditate as in the generation and completion processes, beginning with  the meditation on the protection wheel. Next, the yogins and yoginis make  offerings, first outer offerings {such as flowers and incense), then inner offer ings (for the five senses), then secret offerings, and finally, they make offerings  of songs and dances again and again. At that time, they entirely abandon or dinary craving in every respect. They make offerings in the manner of enlight 

ened beings making offerings to enlightened beings, the playfulness of enlight ened wisdom in enlightened wisdom, and of the dissolution of the nature of  things into the nature of things. In this way, they practice uninterruptedly for  six months or more. This is the practice with mental elaborations.  

ii. Second, the practice without mental elaborations: Persons who are re ceptacles for the practice with medium riches, age, and wisdom perform ev erything as above except that they perform the entire practice in a medium  way together with one, two, or three consorts, who are endowed with the  essential characteristics.  

iii. Third, the practice completely without mental elaborations: Persons who  are receptacles for the practice with few riches, old age, and great wisdom  perform in the following manner. In an isolated place, such as a site for the  disposal of the dead, having renounced the actual consort, they engage in med 

itative equipoise on the natural innate enlightened wisdom. They perform the  activity of a bhusuku. Here bhu stands for bhunj - the activity of eating; su for  sutana [svapana] - sleeping; and ku for kutisara [kutisara] - defecating. In  such a manner they are not active: abandoning all but these three involuntary  activities, they preserve only the yoga of emptiness. Now, you may ask why  these are called "taming the engagement of awareness." Thoroughly compre 

hending the outer, inner, secret, and suchness, they discipline their ordinary  conceptual thoughts by means of their awareness. Thereby all the outer and  inner phenomena are infused into the assemblage of enlightened beings of the  mandala as mere conventional illusion. They then further realize that all these  enlightened beings are emanations of their own minds. In the highest truth,  they do not perceive them even as mind itself: rather, they penetrate the equa 

nimity of emptiness. Hence this is called the practice of taming the engagement  of awareness. 

MANTR A PATH : LCE-SGOM-P A 345  

d. Practicing in this way brings about attainment of great stability in expe rience and realization: At this stage, through the practice of taming the en gagement of awareness great stability and some ability in the three doors are  attained. For the sake of examining whether these experiences and realizations  are stable or unstable, one should perform the "practice of the crazy yogin."  There is pure food that should be eaten and food that should not be eaten  {such as excrement), drinks to be drunk {such as beer} and drinks not to be  drunk {such as urine}, places to be gone to {such as the king's palace), places  not to be gone to {such as the house of a butcher), those to have intercourse  with {such as a consort with the essential characteristics) and those not to have  intercourse with {such as mother and sister). When they practice all these  things that are to be done and not to be done, they practice with impartiality;  and when they give them up, they give them up with impartiality. They practice  such a practice at the appropriate time regardless of hope and fear even with  regard to whatever is dharma and not dharma, without affirming or negating,  and without accepting or rejecting anything. Hence, when they simply abide  unceasingly in the actuality of the realization of the equanimity of samsara and  nirvana, free of dualistic grasping, without meditation and postmeditation, that  is called "practicing the great meditative equipoise." It was taught that the  culmination of that experience gives rise to the path of seeing.  

4. The etymology of practice: because the practitioner ought to perform it,  it is called "practice."  

5. Abandoning the faults of objections: Clearing doubts about contradictions  within the scriptures. Now the scriptures of the Perfection of Wisdom teach  for the most part that enjoying the five objects of the senses is the cause of  bondage to samsara. Yet many Tantras of the Great Yoga of the Mantra teach  that enjoying anything one likes among the five objects of the senses is the  cause for liberation. If you ask, "would not this contradiction cause doubt?"  the answer is that these two scriptures are intended for different persons.  Who are they? In taking into account those people who are receptacles for the  practice, who are ignorant, who do not understand the inherent nature of the  five objects of the senses: on that basis, relying on objects of the senses was  taught as a cause of bondage. And in taking into account those people who are  receptacles for the practice, who have the wisdom of completely understanding  the inherent nature of the five objects of the senses: on that basis, relying on  anything they like among the five objects of the senses was taught as a cause  for liberation. The Guhyasamaja teaches: "In relying on desire toward all de sirous enjoyments, the yogin would quickly attain buddhahood." The Jewel  Peak Sutra (Arya Ratndkuta) teaches: "Kasyapa, it is like this. Just as, for ex ample, a poison enclosed by mantra and medicinal herbs cannot perform the  action of killing, O Kasyapa, so too afflicting emotions enclosed by wisdom  and skillful means cannot perform the action of wrongdoing." The same source  also states: "Endowed with great means, afflicting emotions become a factor of  enlightenment." 

346 YAEL BENTO R  

6. The benefit of training in the Mantra path: By enjoying anything they like  while understanding the inherent nature of the five objects of the senses as the  cause, they would attain the untainted bliss of the fruit. The Guhyasamaja says:  "Though they adhere to intense vows of asceticism, they will not achieve, but  when they adhere to all enjoyments of desire, they will quickly achieve." The  Cakrasamvara says: "Therefore by means of bliss you will attain blissfulness,  all-awakening." Therefore all the previous buddhas and bodhisattvas also at 

tained the fruit by adhering to the Mantra practice. The Guhyasamaja teaches:  "Buddhas and bodhisattvas and those who practice the highest Mantra practice  attain the unwavering [eighth bodhisattva level], the highest quality, by relying  on all desires." If those Mantra practices are not performed in accordance with  the timing of the practice, if the beginner performs the taming of engagement  of awareness or the "practice of the crazy yogin," that will later become a cause  for a lower rebirth. Therefore it is very important to perform in accordance  with the timing of the practice. In this way these four practices are conducive  to quick awakening. For example, when you urge a good horse on with the  conducive factor of a whip, it runs faster. Just so, you should obliterate your  ordinary body, speech, and mind with the conducive factor of practicing the  experience and realization in meditative equipoise. Thereby you quickly bring  about the attainment of the level of buddhahood. Therefore this is called the  conducive practice. 

### 20 The Ocean of the Heart: Selections from  

the Kularnava Tantra  

Douglas Renfrew Brooks  

Few Sanskrit texts within Saiva and Sakta Hindu Tantra provide as clear and  concise a vision of basic tenets, beliefs, and values as the "Ocean of the Kula" or  Kularnava Tantra. Traditionally regarded as the fifth section of the Urdhvamnaya  Tantra, a work that has never been recovered, the Kularnava Tantra as we know  it today consists of some 2,060 verses divided among seventeen chapters called  ullasas or "waves." Usually dated between about 1000 and 1400 C.E., the text is  as much a repository of traditional materials defining the movement or school  called the Kula or Kaulism as it is a singular, original document.  

Although there are dozens of verses, sometimes entire chapters, that require  technical and deeply esoteric knowledge to grasp even the first layers of meaning,  the Kularnava has much to say in broader terms about what it means to live one's  life immersed in the practice of Hindu Tantric yoga as a worshiper of Siva and  Sakti. The Kularnava does not contain all the materials of this broad Tantric  tradition, or even more of them than other texts within Saivism and Saktism, but  it offers a primer and a base to which various elaborations of lineage understand ing and practice are later added. In this way, the Kularnava seeks to create far 

reaching principles of generalization even as it defines and distinguishes a "nar row" vision of the Kula path.  

Certainly the Kularnava Tantra creates its own particular vision of the Kula as  a distinctive school or "clan"-as the word kula suggests-of esoteric initiation and  practice. The Kularnava appears to view itself as the quintessential Kula text, the  single authoritative source that defines both particular and universal aspects of  the path. And yet the Kularnava has been regarded as an authoritative resource  and compendium of essential teachings by tantrikas who subscribe neither to its  doctrinal definitions nor to its prescriptions. In this way, the word kula refers to  the highest or the most secret teachings of the "heart," a meaning of the term that  suggests yet another set of broad metaphorical connotations. I have throughout 

348 DOUGLA S RENFRE W BROOK S  

my translation used the English word "heart" as the term that suggests the widest  possible meaning of kula. This translation is based, in no small part, upon a  passage from the Paratrimsikavivarana of Abhinavagupta, which states that there  exists a set of meanings that link kula to a reality that is the very core, the center,  the heart of the Tantric deity Bhairava himself. That passage reads as follows: "For  truly the kula, because it is identical with the essential self of the Supreme, grants  that perfection. Kula is called the circle of rays of the splendor of the supreme  Lord Bhairava, made up of the fullness of his own light."  

Thus, when the Kularnava discusses such seminal topics as initiation, ritual  practice, discipleship, and the nature of divinity, we gain insights and perspectives  that apply across many different sectarian lineage traditions. Specific or general  points made within the text are subject to further interpretation within the con 

texts of particular lineages. There is to my knowledge no lineage, historical or  current, that defines itself according to the specific data found in the Kularnava  Tantra, despite the text's own narrower self-definition.  

The single common link among Kula lineages is their association with the term  kula as a means of designating their brand of spirituality. Certain philosopher theologians, such as the famous Abhinavagupta, further differentiate the "Kaula"  or "Kaulika" from the tantrika. But this is not a distinction of importance to the  Kularnava, and not the sort of distinction that applies to later interpreters who  identify themselves as Kaulas or who cite the Kularnava Tantra. It is the wish of  all different sorts of Kaulas to define their own versions of the Kula path. The  Kularnava is no different in this sense: it creates its own kula and yet that is not  all it imagines itself to be nor what it becomes to later interpreters.  

In addition to meanings that imply association by initiation, this Tantra suggests  that kula means "the essence of reality one takes to heart," and this is the meaning  that clearly captures its larger intent. In this sense, the heart of the Kularnava is  its secretive body of teachings and practices meant for an initiated spiritual elite.  To enter the kula, to practice the kula, to learn or achieve the goals of the kula  is to engage the secrets of the heart and to penetrate the heart of the divine. To  overemphasize the sociocultural aspect of Kula Tantra-as a school or movement  of secret initiations and practices meant for a spiritual elite-can lead us to over look its most fundamental claim: that there is a path leading to the heart of the  divine and an experience of the divine that leads one's heart to the source of  happiness in the world and liberation from death and rebirth. Although this  spiritual goal may not itself distinguish the Kula path, it is no less the Kularnava  Tantra's most important claim.  

The selection presented here intends to capture the Kularnava Tantra's broadest  theological and practical teachings. I have selected verses that any Kaula might  cite for the sake of defining the Kula path in the broadest sense. To these verses  one would then add any number of more specific sectarian ideas and interpre 

tations and, in this way, capture the flavor of a given Saiva/Sakta Kula Tantric  lineage. Kularnava verses are quoted by tantrikas both to support general prin ciples and in the context of very specific arguments and ideas. This is, in fact,  one of the text's most appealing characteristics: it can and has been used for nearly 

OCEA N OF THE HEART 349  

every purpose to which one might quote a "scripture." I have not limited the  selection to the verses that "all" Saiva and Sakta tantrikas might somehow hy pothetically agree represent common ideology, but rather have chosen those that  provide enough commonly mentioned material to permit a basis for comparison  with other texts, lineage practices, and claims of authority. I have avoided a se lection that reflects the apparent preference of the Kularnava itself to define a very  

particular and authoritative Kula tradition and practice of its own design.  All Hindu Tantras present themselves as very specific and usually highly de tailed secret teachings. Saiva and Sakta Tantras most often appear in the format  of revelations of Lord Siva to his beloved Sakti in answer to her particular queries.  In this guise, the Tantras emphasize that what is to be held in general is expressed  most precisely by the very particular points of view prescribed in the text. So, for  example, by way of demonstrating how Kula practice requires initiation into man tras, the Kularnava goes into exquisite detail regarding different mantras and the  implementation of those mantra practices it regards as defining the path. At stake  here is more than the revelation of specific teachings or distinctive Kaula forms  of knowledge; at stake is the way a tantrika learns to generalize, to see the whole  from the parts, to become visionary by focusing on a particular subject. In this  way, the tantrika learns generalization not by learning things in general but by  extrapolating the general from the particular. The Kularnava has a penchant for  levels of generalization that lead one through the particular.  

Historically we find Kaula practitioners, sometimes speaking for lineages, who  regard selections of the Tantra's very specific teachings as their own and who  vehemently disavow or passively disregard other specifics. At the same time, these  individuals may cling to equally selective aspects of the Tantra's broader vision,  picking and choosing as their own the themes, issues, attitudes, and practices  that the text commends. However, the Kularnava Jantra is neither definitive nor  exhaustive in its presentation of basic Saiva/Sakta Tantric materials, no matter  how authoritative it appears to be for so many traditionalists of different lineage  traditions.  

What is presented here is, like the full extant text, a feast of the general and  the particular, the common and the controversial, the accessible and the esoteric.  It would seem that the text presumes selective readings, expansions, emendations,  and elisions even as it lays out its specific views and broad sweeping generaliza 

tions. Certainly the tantrikas who today engage the Kularnava as an authoritative  resource are as often reluctant to consider its specifics as they are welcoming of  its generalities; however they regard the text as a whole, they select what they  wish to emphasize or concentrate upon, and simply leave the rest.  

The Tradition of the Kula: Teachings and Practices  

The Kularnava Tantra's interest in practical methods of self-realization stem from  its basic cosmology. The universe is nothing other than the singular, undivided  consciousness of God, Siva, who by his own free will chooses to delimit his nature 

350 DOUGLA S RENFRE W BROOK S  

to experience the joy and ecstasy of his own otherness - his divine complement  and consort, Sakti. Siva is both the material and the efficient cause of creation;  nothing exists which is not Siva. Sakti is his own experience of his original illu minative Self as true reflection or vimarsa. Siva chooses to experience his otherness  as Sakti for sheer delight, joy, and by the play of his own consciousness. He  

remains unfettered and unconditioned by the conditions he chooses.  Human beings, however, caught in the web of karma and deluded by the  exercise of their own free will, experience themselves as limited, conditioned, and  therefore disconnected from the ecstasy of divine consciousness. To put it simply,  what God does in limiting himself so that he may enjoy the experience of plurality  and diversity, unenlightened human beings experience as their own separateness  from the One who becomes the Many.  

The universe is God's body and creation is the process by which God assumes  two bodies, as Siva embraces Sakti. The Kularnava makes clear that human beings  must regard their own assumption of embodiment not as a curse of karma but  as an opportunity to experience the divine's own forms of embrace. This embrace  is the perfect relationship: Siva in union with Sakti, the guru protecting the loving  disciple, the Kula adept committed entirely to the spiritual discipline by which  the truth of the Self as God within, and guru as the divine outer form, is fully  revealed.  

This Tantra maintains that one needs to look to one's own experience as the  fundamental test by which the divine relationship and its joys are confirmed.  Although texts may instruct and reveal this truth, it is only the example of the  guru and the guru's own transmission of this experience that will enable the  committed disciple to transform his or her own life into a life of joy and liberation.  Thus, the Tantra commends the twin goals of human existence, bhukti, worldly  enjoyment, and mukti, ultimate liberation, as its promise to those who keep its  secrets and take up its disciplines. The Kula path, it goes on to say, is the sole  path that can promise both of these aims in this very lifetime; it is therefore  superior to all others. One becomes capable of true enjoyment only to the degree  that one is advancing toward liberation; similarly, the liberated are the only ones  who experience life's true enjoyment.  

To enact this vision of reality, the Kularnava Tantra places strict requirements  on both the aspirant and the Kula guru. The means to achievement are also spelled  out in detail. At the heart of the Kula path is initiation into the subtle form of  divinity itself: the mantra. Kularnava teaches specific mantras-several of which  are included in this selection and all of which are commended as forms of the  supreme consciousness. Its most basic teaching, however, is that these secret  mantras form the highest path to divine realization. More than mere means, man 

tras placed in their proper meditative and ritual contexts are none other than  Sakti, whose divine consciousness awakens as the realization of one's own Self in  identity with guru and God.  

In addition to the mantra, this Tantra endorses the empowerment created by  ritually employing the five M words (makaras), so called because each begins with 

OCEAN OF THE HEART 351  

ma in Sanskrit - wine, fish, meat, fermented grain, and sexual intercourse. The  makaras, which induce states proximate to divine ecstasy, reveal divine conscious ness as a form of experience that transcends the boundaries of ordinary conven tion. The heroic adept, in contrast to the mere animalistic person, achieves union  with his Sakti by experiencing fully their embodied relationship as a recognition  of the one Self in each other. Just as the divine couple are inseparable, so too the  true Kula adept experiences all forms of this perfect relationship. With these  experiences come the constancy of a state that appears in whatever form or man ner of life the perfected yogin adopts. Such uninterrupted states of perfect aware ness do not, however, exempt the Kula adept from his vows of secrecy or the  need to sustain a practice that reflects outwardly his inward recognition. It is, in  the end, the grace of the guru - who from initiation forward has led the Kula  disciple to the point where his freedom is as absolute as his discipline is uncom promised - that liberation is realized.  

Entering the Ocean of the Heart  

The selected verses for translation follow generally the evolution of the Kula teach ings as this Tantra presents them in the order of chapters. Certain themes are  reiterated in nearly every chapter, and key points are made over and over again.  As one studies more deeply the Kularnava Tantra's teachings, one experiences  more fully the radical nature of this path. The Kula is radical in the sense of its  unremitting demands on the adept to make extraordinary efforts and to use ex traordinary means to achieve its goals. The goals it sets forth are, in its own view,  the most worthwhile, real, and fulfilling one could imagine; one makes every form  of consciousness another aspect of the divine's own consciousness of itself. To  enter the kula, to penetrate the heart of the divine, is the divine's explicit wish to  be united in the ecstasy of its own creative, sustaining, and dissolving experi ence - at once a unity and a union with its own otherness.  

The Kularnava Tantra was edited with an introduction by Arthur Avalon (Sir John  Woodroffe) (reprint Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1965). The verses translated be low are based on that edition.

352 DOUGLA S RENFRE W BROOK S  SELECTIONS FROM THE KULARNAVA TANTRA  

THE NATURE OF THE ABSOLUTE AND EMBODIMENT'S CONFUSION  

1.7 Siva, O Goddess, is by his own nature the supreme absolute, without as pects; He is omniscient, the agent of all, lord of all, without any taint and  without a second.  

1.8 He is his very own light, beginningless and endless, without change, the  supreme of the supreme, without qualities, being, consciousness, and bliss.  Sentient beings are but a portion of that Siva: they have come about from their  own beginningless ignorance, just as sparks indicate the fire from which they  arise.  

1.19 One should protect oneself who is the Self of all; the Self is the vessel of  the all. For the sake of protection one should make every effort [toward Self realization] , for there is otherwise no true vision of reality.  

1.24 For one who does not make every effort for suggestive cures of hell-like  bodily diseases here in this body, and so has gone to a place without medicines,  what could a person do when such diseases are in place?  

1.35 He does not see what he sees, nor even hear what he hears, nor does he  know what he recites, and so he is deluded by your maya.  

THE TRUE SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE: THE SOURCES OF TRUTH AND ERROR  

1.42 One should do today what is for tomorrow and what is meant for the  latter part of the day in the earlier part of the day. Death does not wait around  to see what has been done or has not been done.  

1.96 Not knowing that the truth is situated within one's Self, the deluded is  confused by looking for it in treatises. One whose judgment is so poor is like  the shepherd who sees his goat in a well when it is actually already within the  flock.  

1.107 The one true knowledge that gives liberation comes from what the guru  teaches; all else is imitative, bearing confusion and error. The supreme is the  one reality that embodies.  

1.109 However, the nondual truth has been spoken by Siva, freed from rituals  and tormenting efforts. Obtained directly from the guru's mouth, it is not  otherwise obtained, even by studying tens of thousands of scriptures.  

1.115 So long as there is false attachment to the body and so long as there is  sense of "mine-ness"; so long as there is no compassion from the guru, how  then can there be truth?OCEAN OF THE HEART 353  

THE KULA TEACHING: THE HEART'S SECRET TEACHING  

2.6 You must keep this teaching secret; it is not to be given to just anyone but  given only to a disciple and to one truly devoted. Otherwise one will surely  fall into disaster.  

2.7 The Veda is superior. Higher than the Veda is the path that worships Visnu;  the worship of Siva is superior to worship of Visnu; and the Right path is  superior to Siva worship. The Left path is superior to the Right; the Doctrinal  path of Saivism superior to the Left. The Heart path is superior to the Doctrinal,  and there is nothing higher than the Heart.  

2.9 The most secret of the secret, O Goddess; the most essential of the essen tial; the best of the best. The Heart path, which comes directly from Siva, O  Goddess, is transmitted from ear to ear.  

2.23 In other paths, if one is a yogin, then one cannot be an enjoyer of life.  Nor can an enjoyer of life be a yogin. The Heart path has the nature of being  for both enjoyment of life and yoga and so, beloved, it is greater than all others.  

2.33 The knowledge of the Heart shines in one whose consciousness is pure,  peaceful, whose actions serve the guru, who is extremely devoted, and who  can keep a secret.  

2.50 Even if one performs no other rituals or actions, leaving aside what is  commanded according to one's social estate and stage of life, the one who  dwells within the Heart is a vessel of enjoyment and liberation, O Goddess of  the Heart.  

2.68 One yoked to the compassion of the guru, for whom a fallen state has  been shaken off by initiation, who finds delight in the worship following the  Heart - such a person, O Goddess, comes from the Heart [he is a Kaula], and  not another.  

2.80 The followers of the Heart, knowers of the essence, do not consider other  religion, just as bees who serve themselves the blossom of the coral tree don't  seek to obtain other flowers.  

THE PATH OF THE MANTRA, THE HIGHEST PATH IS THE HEART PATH  

3.49 The supreme mantra that bestows the grace of the Auspicious One (Sri)  is the foundation of the highest path (urdhvamnaya). He who knows this as  our supreme form is himself Siva.  

3.50 This mantra is performed, O beloved, with each exhalation [which makes  the sound ham] and inhalation [which makes the sound sa] of breath, repeated  by all breathing beings, from Siva all the way down to the worms. 

354 DOUGLA S RENFRE W BROOK S  

3.56 Just as the fig tree exists in its subtle form in its incipient seed, so too the  three worlds that make up the universe exist within this supreme mantra that  bestows supreme grace.  

3.63 He who attains loving devotion to the auspicious guru who is my own  form is said to achieve the supreme, knowing the supreme mantra that bestows  the grace of the auspicious one.  

3.82 He who knows the mantra that bestows the grace of the auspicious one  knows all mantras, including those belonging to Siva, Visnu, the Goddess, the  sun, Ganapati, and the moon.  

The esoteric etymology of the mantra, that is, why it is called prasada-para ("grace giving supreme") is given next, focusing on the two elements of the mantra's  name, the prefix pra- and the word para. Next follow the instructions for "laying  down" or nyasa of the divinities in the form of mantra-names, invoking and  placing them within the subtle body. The mudras or gestures that should accom pany the nyasa process are next mentioned. In this way, the mantra in all its  subtle divine forms is identified and invoked onto the subtle body of the Kula  practitioner. The details of nyasa involve the recitation of mantras, gestures of  placement on the physical body, and mental identifications. The process of inter identification brings the ritual of the Kula Dharma into its distinct focus: specific  mantras, specific actions and intentions, and specific goals are enunciated. These  ritual details need not detain us; more importantly, the text implies their distinc tiveness and superiority.  

4.12 Performing this inter-identification, O Goddess, wherever a human being  goes he shall experience preeminence, benefits, esteem, and human dignity,  beloved one.  

4.127 Why say too much, O Goddess? This inter-identification is beloved to  me. It should not be spoken about to one who is not like a son, nor should it  be explained to one who is not a true disciple.  

Next follow the ritual prescriptions for the vessels and offerings, including the  five M-word substances - mamsa (flesh), matsya (fish), madya (wine), mudra  (fermented grain), and maithuna (sexual intercourse). These and other offerings  are called the kula-dravyas, or heart oblations. They are strictly regulated and  their qualifications and benefits detailed. Considered privileged and dangerous,  these ritual actions are a distinctive (but not unique) aspect of the Kula path.  

THE FIVE M-WORD OBLATIONS ON THE RITUAL PATH OF THE HEART  

5.71 Those who offer with loving devotion to us both flesh and drink, they  create a blissful experience and, being beloved by us, are the followers of the  Heart. 

OCEAN OF THE HEART 355  

5.72 Our supreme mark - characterized as being, consciousness, and bliss - manifests effulgently when there occurs the true enjoyment of the Kula obla tions [the five M-word offerings], and not otherwise.  

5.75 For example, just as a dwelling enveloped in darkness becomes lit by a  lamp, so the Self covered in Illusion is seen by drinking the oblation [of wine].  

5.77 Wine truly is the Terrifying Divinity (Bhairava) and wine is even called  Power (Sakti). Ah yes! The enjoyer of wine can delude even the immortals!  

5.78 A man who, having drunk a potent wine, is not adversely affected and  has become supremely one-pointed in meditation on us, he is liberated and he  is the true Follower of the Heart.  

5.79 Drink is Power, Sakti; and flesh is Auspicious, Siva: the Enjoyer becomes  the Terrifying One, Bhairava himself. The bliss that arises from this union of  the two is called liberation.  

5.88 One who serves oneself for the sake of pleasure with wine and the rest  is fallen. Having dispensed with one's own lassitudes one should indulge only  for the sake of pleasing the gods.  

5.89 It is said that indulging in intoxicants such as fish, flesh, and drink, and  so on, other than at the time of ritual sacrifice, is prohibited and errant, my  beloved.  

5.90 Just as the brahman is enjoined to drink intoxicating soma on the occa sion of Vedic sacrifice, so drinking wine and the like at prescribed times gives  enjoyment and liberation [on the path of the Heart].  

5.91 Only when one knows the meaning of the Heart treatises directly from  the auspicious guru should one take upon oneself the practice of the five im printing ritual acts [that is, the five M words], for otherwise one becomes fallen.  

5.105 He who practices the five imprinting ritual acts without the proper im primatur, O Goddess of the Heart, becomes contemptible even though he may  experience the Absolute.  

5.111 The divine Sakti of animalistic persons is unawakened and that of the  follower of the Heart is awakened. One who offers service to that awakened  power truly serves Sakti herself.  

5.112 One who experiences the bliss of union in sexual relationship as being  between the Supreme Power (Parasakti) and the Self - such a person knows  the meaning of sexual relations; others are inferior, indulging only to pursue  women.  

5.113 Knowing, O entrance of the Heart (kula-nayika), the true condition of  the five imprinting ritual acts in all these ways directly from the mouth of the  guru, O Goddess, one truly serves and is liberated. 

356 DOUGLA S RENFRE W BROOK S  

6.6 Pure in Self and deeply joyous within, bereft of anger and greed, having  turned away from the avowed ways of animalistic persons, one should offer  sacrificial ritual with a sweet disposition, my beloved.  

6.7-8 When by my grace a person has,after a long time, become firm in his  feelings of devotion, he should perform the rituals, offering the libations to gether with the offerings as it has been taught by the Auspicious Terrifying  Lord (Sri Bhahava) and according to the instructions of the guru - for other wise he will fall.  

6.9 One should perform the worship of the auspicious wheel (Sri Cakra) with  the discipline of mantras, O Goddess of Light. Being then in your company I  accept that [worship] myself.  

6.10 With the experience, "I am the Terrifying Lord," and so possessed of  qualities such as omniscience, the lordly yogin should become a performer of  the Heart worship.  

WORSHIP AND DEITY PRESENCE WITHIN A YANTRA  

6.85 A yantra or diagrammatical form is said to consist [actually] of mantras;  the deity has the form of mantras as well. The Goddess worshiped in the yantra,  O Goddess, is pleased spontaneously.  

6.87 As the body is for an embodied soul like oil for a lamp, my beloved, so  likewise the yantra is the place of all divinities.  

6.88 Therefore, drawing the yantra and meditating on Siva in the proper man ner, and gaining knowledge directly from the guru, one should worship all  according to the prescribed rules, my beloved.  

Chapters 7 and 8 detail the worship of various deities including Siva as Batuka  and the accompanying forms of the Goddess. Included are many of the specific  mantras, the yantra prescriptions, and procedures of worship, as well as the bene fits and prohibitions of such worship.  

AS ARE THE GODS, SO ARE THE WORSHIPERS OF THE HEART  

8.106 Just as We the Divine Couple are inseparable; just as the goddess Laksmi  [is inseparable] from Lord Narayana, or the goddess Sarasvati from Lord  Brahma, so is the Courageous Practitioner with his Sakti consort.  

9.3 Meditation is said to be of two sorts, divided accordingly as gross and  subtle. The gross sort is said to include a particular form, while the subtle  centers on the formless.  

9.9 When there is no longer any reflective consciousness and one is as calm 

OCEA N OF THE HEART 357  

as the still sea - the innate form itself being empty - such meditation is called  samadhi or Equanimity Consciousness.  

9.10 The purely self-illuminating truth is nothing like a cognitive process; one  can become that self-illuminating truth instantaneously.  

9.22 For one immersed in the state of the singular Self, whatever is done is  worship, whatever is recited is a mantra, whatever one sees is a meditation.  

9.23 When one has experienced the Supreme Self (Paramatman), the sensation  of identifying with bodily consciousness ceases; wherever such a heart goes,  there consciousness is in equanimity.  

9.24 When the knot of the heart is severed, so all doubts are cut away; and  karmas, actions, and intentions - past, present, and future - are destroyed  when one sees the Supreme Self from within.  

9.41 The body is the abode of God, O Goddess; the embodied self is God,  Ever-abiding Siva (Sadasiva). Abandon ignorance as if it was old flowers offered  in worship and perform worship with the contemplation "1 am He," so'ham.  

9.42 The embodied self is Siva; Siva is the embodied self; that embodied self  is only Siva. The experience of bondage to one's animal nature is how one  thinks of the embodied self; liberated from this animal nature identity one has  the experience of the Ever-abiding Siva.  

9.52 Drinking wine, eating flesh, carrying out the practices of one's own ini tiatory teaching, contemplating the unitive experience of both "I" and "That,"  so the Heart yogin dwells in true happiness.  

9.55 Valuing what is devalued in the world and devaluing what the world  values, this the Terrifying Lord who is the supreme Self has pointed out is the  path of the Heart.  

9.59 There are no commands; there are no prohibitions. There is neither merit  nor fall; no heaven and truly no hell for the followers of the Heart, O Goddess  of the Heart.  

9.62 What is poorly characterized becomes well characterized; otherness be comes one's own heart and what is contrary to righteousness becomes righ teous for the followers of the Heart, O Goddess of the Heart.  

9.65 Living anywhere, taking on any disguise, and [living] unrecognized by  everyone, in whatever social position he may be, he remains a Heart yogin, O  Goddess of the Heart.  

9.66 Yogins in various guises act for the sake of humanity; they wander the  earth, their true nature unrecognized by others.  

9.67 They do not reveal their true experience immediately, O Goddess of the 

3 5 8 DOUGLAS RENFREW BROOKS  

Heart, living in the midst of the world as if they were intoxicated, mute, or  just idiots.  

9.73 The yogin goes about his own life while the world looks upon him laugh ing, reproaching, and with contempt, keeping its distance from him.  

9.74 The yogin wanders about the ordinary world in different guises, acting  on some occasions like a dignified person, sometimes like a vagrant, sometimes  like demon or a ghoul!  

9.75 The yogin enjoys the pleasures of life only for the sake of serving the  world, [and] not out of his own desire. Offering grace to all people, he traverses  the earth out of compassion.  

9.77 Just as the wind touches everything and space extends everywhere, just  as all who bathe in rivers become pure, so the yogin is always pure.  

9.81 Wherever the elephant walks becomes a path, and similarly wherever the  Heart yogin goes becomes a path, O Goddess of the Heart.  

9.88 Whosoever knows the truth of the Heart and is well-versed in the treatises  on the Heart should perform the worship of the Heart; he is truly the Heart  follower [and] not another, my beloved.  

9.90 By initiation (dfksa) one is a Heart follower who knows the triadic truth  [as supreme, ordinary, and both], who surrenders to the auspicious feet of the  divine, who possesses the meaning of the root mantras, and who offers loving  devotion to God and guru.  

9.94 I do not dwell on Mount Kailasa nor on Meru or Mandara: wherever  reside the Heart knowers, I reside there, O my divine contemplation!  

9.131 Just as a tree gives up its flowers regardless of [whether it has] once  obtained its fruit, so the yogin obtaining the truth gives up attachment to  actions and rituals.  

Given this statement concerning the state of absolute freedom in which the yogin  abides with respect to worldly life and religious requirements, Chapter 10 next  describes at length the different occasions for ritual worship and different ritual  benefits, violations, and prohibitions. Also mentioned are specific deities, mantras,  and manners of worship that the Heart follower may enjoy as part of his privileged  spiritual practice.  

ULTIMATE IDENTITY AND IDENTIFICATION  

13.64 Just as words such as "pot," "vessel," and "jar" all mean the same object  [artha: goal, meaning, thing], so too are god and mantra and guru said to be  the same object. 

OCEAN OF THE HEART 359  

13.65 Just as divinity is, so is the mantra; just as there is mantra, so there is  the guru.  

13.66 The fruits of worship are the same for god, mantra, and guru. For the  sake of establishing myself in the form of Siva, I seize upon worship, O Goddess  of the Mountain (Parvati); for the sake of taking on the form of the guru I  break the stranglehold of fear.  

SECRECY, INTIMACY, AND PRIVACY ON THE HEART PATH  

10.44 One should not enunciate the guru's name except at the time of ritual  recitation, my beloved, calling him instead over the course of spiritual life by  such titles as Auspicious Lord, Deity, and Svami, and the like.  

10.45 One should not tell anyone other than one's own disciple the mantras  praising the guru's sandals, the imprinting gestures, the root mantra, and one's  own grace-giving sandal mantra.  

10.46 Lineage, scripture, levels of teaching, the practice of mantras, and such  must all be obtained directly from the guru in order to bear fruit - and not  otherwise.  

14.3 Without initiation, there can be no liberation: This has been said in the  sacred Siva teachings. And there can be no initiation without the preceptor of  a lineage.  

14.7 Therefore one should make every effort to seek always the guru of un broken lineage who is in origin the immediate Supreme Siva.  

14.14 The experiential knowledge of the mantra cannot establish itself in the  unworthy. So there should be an examination of the disciple; otherwise [ini tiation, worship, and knowledge] bear no fruits.  

14.30 Those persons who at the outset have no true loving devotion, who then  in the midst of their spiritual practice gain loving devotion, and at the end  experience the expansion of loving devotion, they assimilate the inner practice  of yoga.  

14.34 Initiation, you will recall O Goddess, is threefold: It is given by touch,  by deliberate sight, and by mere mental intention without acts, ritual, efforts,  or any other such things, great Goddess!  

14.38 The disciple becomes worthy of grace by stepping into the current of  the divine Sakti's initiatory power; where Sakti does not descend, no accom plishment can be claimed.  

14.78 Initiation is said to be twofold, divided accordingly as outward and in ner. Initiation into actions such as ritual the outer; the inner one creates the  experience of pervasive penetration into one's being. 

360 DOUGLAS RENFREW BROOKS  

14.86 That initiation by which those who indulge themselves in their animal istic nature become Sivas, opening the eyes to the Self, O Goddess: that is  liberation from the noose of being a mere animal.  

14.97 O Goddess, for one who is without initiation there is no fulfillment nor  true path. So by every effort one should seek initiation from a guru.  

LIBERATION IS THE EXPERIENCE OF THE HEART  

15.19 There are innumerable hundreds of thousands of mantras and they un settle the heart of one's own divine consciousness. The one mantra obtained  by the grace of the guru will provide every goal and accomplishment.  

15.34 Placing oneself in postures such as the lotus, the cross-legged, or warrior  pose, one should perform repetition of the mantra and offer worship. Otherwise  [initiation, grace, and effort] will bear no fruit.  

15.113 One should perform the recitation of the mantra by fixing oneself on  it, with life breath coursing through it, setting it within one's consciousness,  and making the deep connections that form the meaning of its syllables.  

THE NATURE OF THE DIVINE AS MANTRA IMPARTS THE SUPREME GRACE  

16.40ab Male divinities' mantras are called mantras while those of female di vinities are called vidyas, my beloved.  

16.116 One who knows the mantra of supreme grace is liberated whether he  dwells in a place of true pilgrimage, or a place without means to ford across  the world, or even in the midst of the ocean of worldliness - there is no doubt  about it.  

17.102 This treatise called the Ocean of the Heart exists within the heart of  divine yoginis. 1 have illumined it today; and with true effort it should be kept  secret. 

### 21 Tantric Buddhism and Chinese Thoughtin East Asia  

Fabio Rambelli  

The text translated below from the Chinese, entitled Ritual of the Secret Dharanis  of the Three Siddhis for the Destruction of Hell, the Transformation of Karmic Hin drances, and the Liberation from the Three Conditioned Worlds (hereafter, Ritual), is  a short but comprehensive summary of the doctrines and meditative practices of  East Asian esoteric Buddhism. The ideas and practices presented in this text cir culated in various forms in China between the late Tang and the early Song  periods (ninth and tenth centuries), and became very influential in Japan from  the twelfth century onward. The earliest known surviving versions were edited in  Japan in the early nineteenth century.  

The origin of the Ritual is obscure: no official Chinese catalogues of Buddhist  texts of the Tang period mentions it, and its title does not appear in any Japanese  records until the late ninth century. Direct citations from the text appear only in  much later works, composed in Japan between the eleventh and the twelfth cen 

turies, particularly those by the Shingon monk Kakuban (1095-1143) and the  Zen monk Yosai (1141-1215). Under its title the Ritual includes the note "trans lated at the imperial behest by Subhakarasimha Tripitaka from Central India,"  but this attribution is dubious. Subhakarasimha (Shanwuwei, in Chinese: 637- 735), traditionally considered to be the founder of the Tantric Buddhist tradition  in China, did translate several Tantric works, among them the Mahavairocana  Sutra, but it seems unlikely that he was involved in the production of this text.  One of the main reasons for which the traditional attribution to Subhakarasimha  has been questioned is the content of the Ritual. It contains an advanced com bination of Indian Tantric teachings and practices and Chinese doctrines and  rituals, mainly drawn from medicine (especially from such texts as the Huang-di  nei jing su wen) and Daoism. Not only is the Ritual obviously not a translation  from the Sanskrit but the first Tantric patriarch in China could not possibly have  been responsible for such an advanced form of religious and cultural syncretism. 

362 FABI O RAMBELL I  

Scholars have therefore moved the Ritual's probable date of composition to the  late Tang period (first half of the ninth century). The reference to Subhakarasimha,  however, is not completely arbitrary. The Ritual is in fact heavily influenced by  the susiddhi ("perfect siddhi" or perfect spiritual attainment) textual lineage cen 

tered on the Susiddhikara Sutra, translated into Chinese by the Tantric patriarch.  This textual tradition was popular in China during the late Tang period and  became very influential in Japan, especially in the Tendai school of esoteric Bud dhism. Recently, it has been suggested that this text may actually have been  composed in Japan.  

Apart from Chinese medical and Daoist elements, the body of the Ritual consists  of citations from Tantric texts. Its patchwork-like nature makes this text particu larly interesting as a summary of late Tang Tantric doctrines and practices, which  later became the template of Japanese esoteric Buddhism and also influenced such  aspects of cultural life in medieval Japan as music, linguistics, poetry. The con fluence of Tantric Buddhism and Daoism in the Ritual, with its systematic cor relation of Indian doctrines and practices with doctrines and practices from the  Chinese tradition, offers historians of religion an example of cultural interaction.  This text also shows the dynamism of the Tantric tradition which, despite its  marginal origins, nevertheless became one of the central cultural formations in  several regions of the East Asian world.  

The main protagonists of the Ritual are the five buddhas located on the lotus  flower at the center of the Womb mandala and, in various combinations, also in  the Vajra mandala (see below). Each represents or embodies some characteristics  of the soteriological processes at play in Tantric Buddhism, especially the steps  leading to enlightenment and the five types of wisdom acquired through it. Ma 

havairocana, the cosmic buddha of East Asian Tantric Buddhism, is the most  important among them. Situated at the center of the mandala (see below), he  represents both the principle of enlightenment and the whole range of powers  associated with it. All around him are the so-called four buddhas. Below him, to  the east, is Aksobhya, to the south is Ratnasambhava, to the west is Amitabha,  and to the north is Amoghasiddhi. These buddhas are usually referred to in the  text with the honorific title of "tathagata," meaning "the one who came to this  world form the realm of truth" or "the one who came to this world in the same  way as the buddhas of the past." The five buddhas serve as the reference point  for a number of five-elements cosmic series that structure the Tantric universe  and guide the practitioners in their meditations.  

As we will see, the practices described in the text enable the practitioners to  identify themselves with Mahavairocana, the paradigmatic buddha of esoteric  Buddhism. The text makes several references to the doctrines concerning the  nature and characteristics of the buddha. For example, "Buddha body" refers to  the buddha's superhuman body, characterized by thirty-two major signs and  eighty-eight lesser marks (even though the text also calls a Buddha body the body  of the practitioner who has successfully completed the cycle of meditations it  describes); "Buddha land" is the paradisiacal pure land ruled by a perfected bud-TANTR1C BUDDHISM , CHINES E THOUGH T 363  

dha who preaches the Law and leads beings to salvation; and the "Buddha assem bly" is a synonym for mandala.  

A mandala is a Tantric representation of the Dharmadhatu, the enlightened  universe. In this image, the most representative buddhas, bodhisattvas, and other  beings are ordered according to a geometrical pattern. Although a mandala is  usually painted, three-dimensional mandalas also exist. East Asian esoteric Bud 

dhism acknowledges two paradigmatic forms of mandala, respectively the Womb  mandala and the Vajra mandala. The Womb mandala uses the imagery of womb  and fetus to represent both the compassionate soteriological activity of the Buddha  that permeates the entire universe and the principle of universal salvation. In  contrast, the Vajra mandala represents the absolute wisdom attained by the prac 

titioner with enlightenment, symbolized by the vajra ("diamond" or "thunder bolt"). Both mandalas are divided into "sections" centered on a specific buddha  or bodhisattva who represents various aspects of the enlightened cosmos. In this  text, as in most esoteric Buddhist materials in East Asia, the term vajra is often  used without direct reference to the Vajra mandala and its related doctrines, but  simply as a marker of Tantric discourse to signify something noble, superior,  particularly powerful, and efficacious for salvation. In these cases, vajra is trans lated in the text below as "adamantine."  

As mentioned before, the five buddhas are located on the eight-petaled lotus  at the center of the Womb mandala. The lotus is a very important metaphor in  Buddhism; the fact that the lotus has its roots in the mud of putrid ponds but  develops into a beautiful and pure white flower was primarily used to represent  the process of enlightenment. The lotus was later associated with the human heart  (hrdaya) - the bodily location of the mind (citta) and the physical site at which  enlightenment takes place. Indian and Chinese physicians noted a morphological  resemblance of the lotus to the heart. As the Ritual says, "the shape of the heart  of ordinary people is like a closed lotus. .. . In visualization one should open  one's heart to form a white lotus with eight petals." Enlightenment results from  opening one's heart by means of meditative practices, to reveal within it the shape  of the eight-petaled lotus found at the center of the mandala. As a support for  meditation, the practitioner uses a white disk representing both the moon as a  metaphor for the eight-petaled lotus (which is painted in an almost circular way)  and the heart of the practitioner himself, as well as the pure enlightened mind  achieved through such practice. Thus, through visualization the ascetic modifies  his body/mind to embody enlightenment. In this practice, soteriology merges with  physiology: indeed, bodily metaphors of the heart became an important part of  the doctrines of bodhicitta, literally "the mind (citta) of enlightenment (bodhi)."  This key concept refers first of all to the "thought of enlightenment," that is, the  desire to be saved and to engage in Buddhist practice. This is the very beginning  of the individual process of salvation, and therefore it is a very important moment.  In East Asia, however, bodhicitta is often interpreted literally as "the mind of  enlightenment." In this context, one can-arouse the desire of enlightenment be cause all sentient beings have an innate principle of enlightenment. In other 

364 FABI O RAMBELL I  

words, we are "always already" enlightened, but we just don't know it. Practice  thus becomes a process toward the self-awareness of one's innate buddhahood.  Tantric Buddhism added a further important layer of meaning: in a coherent  nondualistic fashion it stressed that if everyone is innately enlightened, then the  initial desire for enlightenment (bodhicitta) is already the final goal of practice.  This move enabled Tantric Buddhism to emphasize the possibility of attaining  salvation in the present life - or, as the well-known Japanese definition has it, to  "become buddha in this very body."  

The eight-petaled lotus at the center of mandala, where the five buddhas and  their retinue are located, is often described in Tantric literature (and in this text)  as the Dharmadhatu Palace, the cosmic palace where the buddha Mahavairocana,  surrounded by the other buddhas, bodhisattvas, and all kinds of beings, meditates  and preaches. Dharmadhatu, literally "Dharma element," refers to the absolute  reality experienced in enlightenment (the realm of absolute truth, translated in  Chinese as "the realm of Dharma"). Dharma refers primarily to the Buddhist  teachings, but also to the underlying cosmic principles (the absolute Truth) that  the Buddha explained; it also refers, when translated as a noncapitalized and often  plural term (dharmas), to the constituent elements of reality ("things" or "entities"  in general, ranging from material objects to thoughts, mental factors, immaterial  relations, and spiritual entities such as nirvana). Because of the complex meaning  of the term dharma, and because all beings in the universe possess, as we have  already noted, the Buddha nature (the innate principle of buddhahood), the term  "realm of Dharma" came to be used in Chinese and Japanese texts to refer to the  totality of the cosmos as sharing an underlying common principle and/or material  substance. This was one of the major innovations of East Asian Buddhism, prob ably mediated from Chinese cosmological and philosophical doctrines. Once the  universe was envisioned as sharing an underlying substance and principles, it  became possible to speak of Mahavairocana's "Dharmadhatu body," constituted  by the six elements of reality (earth, water, fire, wind, space, and consciousness).  Thus, the entire universe came to be understood as the body of the primary  Tantric Buddha, and ascetics could then seek to reproduce such a cosmic body  within themselves through the performance of Tantric practices such as those  described in the Ritual.  

In this sense, Dharmadhatu-body is a synonym of another complex term,  "Dharmakaya." Literally "the body of absolute truth," it originally referred to what  was left behind in this world by the historical Buddha (Gautama Sakyamuni) after  his extinction: teachings, later preserved as written texts, relics, and traces of  various kinds. This notion of a "body of truth" later appears in the doctrines on  the nature and status of the Buddha body, as paradoxically referring to the tran 

scendental, unconditioned aspects of the Buddha. Mahayana Buddhism devel oped the doctrine of three bodies of the Buddha, according to which Buddha  exists and manifests himself according to three different modalities: Dharmakaya,  Sambhogakaya, and Nirmanakaya. The latter two bodies have forms. The Sambho gakaya (Enjoyment body) is the Buddha body that the ascetic sees as a reward 

TANTRI C BUDDHISM , CHINES E THOUGH T 365  

for his countless practices; it transcends the perceptive and mental faculties of  common, deluded people and can be perceived only by bodhisattvas. The Nir manakaya (Manifestation body) is the physical body in which the Buddha appears  in this world to beings of lesser faculties such as gods, humans, and animals. It  is but a shadow of the splendor of Sambhogakaya, but it is the only way to lead  ignorant beings to salvation. The Dharmakaya is absolute, unconditioned, and  formless. It cannot be perceived or known, but is postulated as the substratum  of all activities of the buddhas. Tantric Buddhism further distinguishes between  the Dharmakaya of Principle and Dharmakaya of Wisdom, a distinction that re 

flects the cosmological and soteriological implications of absolute truth (the prin ciple) and knowledge (wisdom).  

An important contribution of East Asian Tantric Buddhism to the doctrine of  the Buddha bodies, brought about especially by certain Shingon lineages in Japan,  is a change in the status of the Dharmakaya from a formless and signless entity  to an immanent cosmic repository of all possible forms and signs. According to  this vision, the entire universe (the Dharmadhatu) as the "body" of Mahavairocana  (Dharmadhatu-body or Dharmakaya) is an immense semiotic machine, a sort of  pansemiotic cosmos, continuously and eternally engaged in preaching the Law to  all beings and, ultimately, to itself for the sheer pleasure of listening to it. The  Ritual was one of the key texts for such a development. Thus, Buddhism changed  from a doctrine of renunciation into a performance affecting all senses and in volving the entire universe. The status of salvation was modified by this change,  as is shown by the Ritual, in which complex meditative and ritual practices leading  to salvation have the status of multimedia performances, as it were, involving  sounds, visions, lighting effects, the aroma of incense, and architectural setting.  

The Ritual is essentially a set of instructions regarding three short mantras and  related formulae; as such, the text is characterized by the intermingling of the  language of commentary and the language of ritual. It outlines the conceptual  background and describes the ritual procedures that may enable one to afford the  ultimate soteriological goal of esoteric Buddhism, namely to identify oneself with  the buddha Mahavairocana. The structure of the Ritual is as follows: first, the  Tantric-Daoist cosmology of the human body is presented, with all the complex  correlations governing it and the practices necessary to maintain balance. Then,  the three siddhis (spiritual attainments) and the respective mantras are intro duced. The text then describes the production of the "living-body relic" - the  meditative destruction of the ascetic's ordinary body and the creation of a stupa 

like cosmic body. As the text puts it, "From the letter A comes out the syllable  ra, which burns one's body and reduces it to ashes. From the ashes the syllable  va is generated. . . . From it . . . the mantra of the five elements [of the cosmic  stupa] is produced. This mantra takes its place on the five parts of the body. . . .  This is the pure bodhicitta." The visualizations proceed to ensure the embodiment  of both Womb and Vajra mandalas. The Ritual finally concludes with a vast cosmic  vision of absolute nondualism. In a way,the text reproduces the meditative pro 

cess and its results.

The practices here described consist mainly in visualizing the universe as a five element stupa, also called caitya in the text. The stupa in India is a funerary  monument, sometime of large dimensions, that enshrines relics of the Buddha. It  symbolizes the formless body of the Buddha and the essential structure of the  cosmos. East Asian stupas are usually wooden towers, known in English as pa godas, which enshrine relics or other sacred objects. The stupa described in this  text, however, is a vertical object in the form of a pagoda composed of five ele ments (from bottom to top: square, triangle, circle, crescent, and sphere), used  as a meditation support. The type of stupa described in the text is still used in  Japanese cemeteries as a small memorial monument. Through the meditations  presented in the Ritual, the ascetic will reconfigure his body as a stupa, the mys tical body of Mahavairocana, and thereby become a buddha himself.  

Such a goal is achieved through complex visualizations, based on multiple  interrelations of several subtle substances (breath, light, sound, writing, and so  on), in which the hidden structure of the entire universe is recreated and em bodied by the ascetic through meditation on his body. The universe of the Ritual  is organized on interconnected series of five elements that form closed causal  chains. For example, the text correlates the five buddhas, the five stages of the  enlightenment process, and the five wisdoms thereby attained, with the cosmic  elements (earth, water, fire, wind, and space), the five directions, the five seasons  (the four usual seasons plus an intercalary period), the five aggregates (the skan 

dhas, the psycho-physical constituents of reality), the five viscera, the five souls,  the five phases (wuxing in Chinese: the five natural elements according to the  Chinese cosmology, namely, earth, fire, water, wood, and metal), and so forth.  The body is the privileged site for the experience of such a cosmic structure. Once  mastered and embodied through initiation, knowledge, and ritual action, cos 

mology opens the way to liberation. Such a recursive cosmology is directly re flected in soteriology, as we will see below.  

There are essentially two sets of meditations on the body. Whereas one set  focuses on the internal structure as envisioned by Chinese medicine (the five  viscera), the other set consists in the visualization of three external areas of the  body, which are the sites of the "three siddhis" mentioned in the title of the text.  Siddhi, meaning "achievement, completion," refers here to different kinds of spir 

itual attainment and enlightenment. The three siddhis are: the "intruding siddhi,"  centered in the abdomen; the "protruding siddhi," centered in the heart; and the  "perfect siddhi," centered in the top of the head (usnisd), the location of supreme  wisdom. Each of these is related to a specific mantra, a formula used as a medi 

tation support in which are condensed the spiritual powers of the deity it rep resents. These mantras are, respectively, a ra pa ca na; a vi ra hum kham; and a  vam ram ham kham. By focusing intensely on a mantra's written forms, sounds,  and meanings, the practitioner is able to embody and control the mantra's deity.  

The sites of the three siddhis in the body correspond to the locations of the  three "cinnabar fields" (dantian) in Daoism. According to Daoist medical soteri ology, control of these three centers of pure energy enables the practitioner to 

TANTRI C BUDDHISM , CHINES E THOUGH T 367  

achieve liberation from the coarse body and become an "Immortal" (xianren). The  impact of Daoist soteriology and, more generally speaking, of Chinese cosmic  anthropology, is evident in the Ritual, in which the correlations uniting human  body and external reality are discussed in detail. By becoming aware of the pro 

found relation between the individual and the universe, the initiate is able to  control the cosmic forces and, as a consequence, to embody the cosmos - which,  as we have seen, is actually a stupa, a reliquary body. It should be noted that the  soteriological transformation of the practitioner's body into a Buddha body is  described in the text as an effect of an "empowerment" (adhisthana in Sanskrit,  jiachi in Chinese, kaji in Japanese) that results from the ascetic's interaction with  the Buddha.  

Besides describing the procedures for salvation, the text also mentions the  benefits gained through ritual manipulation of the three mantras that constitute  its nucleus: wealth, health, and longevity for the practitioner; peace and strong  political authority for the country. These are typical Tantric benefits: support of  state and imperial power; worldly benefits; and individual salvation in the present  life. Protection, in particular, is ensured by the activity of Dharma-protectors,  supernatural figures whom the ascetic is able to control through the correct per formance of ritual.  

Descriptions of visualizations, in which several semiotic substances are manip ulated in complex ways in order to effect a transformation of the practitioner's  body and universe, occupy the major part of the text. However, these meditations  are not an end in themselves. The text is not only concerned with individual  spiritual experience but also presents a complex picture of the relationships link ing religious knowledge and practices to other fields of social and cultural life, in  particular cosmology, epistemology, semiotics, soteriology, and politics and state  ideology. We now discuss briefly each of these fields as they are treated in the  texts.  

The Ritual combines Tantric Buddhist ideas and practices with a vocabulary  and a repertoire of images, metaphors, and procedures borrowed from Daoism  and Chinese culture in general in order to provide a more concrete, bodily de scription of the processes that lead one to become a buddha. It is interesting to  note that the Buddha is characterized in these texts as a sort of Daoist immortal,  endowed with a perfect body that is a condensation of the entire universe. In  particular, the Ritual presents breathing techniques of Daoist origin aimed at har monizing the various forms of breath-energy (qi) inside the body. In addition,  visualization of bodily organs and mental apparatus and their relations transforms  the body (or rather, the body-mind complex) into a replica of the cosmos.  

According to both Indian Tantra and traditional Chinese medicine, the human  body is a microcosm. The Ritual privileges the Chinese vision of the body as the  locus for enlightenment. The central apparatus of the body, the five viscera (liver,  lungs, heart, kidneys, and spleen), is directly related to the five phases (wood,  metal, fire, water, earth) in the external world. The five viscera also control five  souls or spiritual functions of the human organism, namely, the celestial soul 

368 FABI O RAMBELLI  

(hun, in Chinese), the terrestrial soul (po), the superior soul (shen), the will (shi),  and the ideas (yi), which are produced by different configurations of the qi (cosmic  breath/energy). Another important network of organs in the body, mentioned  only in passing in the text, is constituted by the six receptacles (liuju, in Chinese).  Whereas the five viscera are basically repositories of breath/energy, the six recep 

tacles function as centers of consumption.  

Based as it is on the manipulation of images, signs, and ritual objects, the bodily  and mental soteriological process described in the text is primarily semiotic, cul minating in the production of a perfect body, a "living-body relic" which, as we  have seen, is a condensation of the entire universe. It is possible that the teachings  in the Ritual and other cognate texts were connected with East Asian practices of  self-mummification, by which ascetics sought to achieve a Buddha body in the  present lifetime. These ascetics, called sokushinbutsu ("buddhas in their present  body") in Japanese, aimed to turn their body into the ultimate stupa-like, whole body relic.  

The meditative technology described in the text implies a particular kind of  semiotics, in which there is no distinction between the practitioner, the signs and  symbolic objects he employs, their meanings, and the external reality (the deities  of the mandala and, ultimately, the entire Dharmadhatu) to which they refer. The  characteristic circularity of esoteric Buddhist practices is particularly apparent in  the text: the tool of meditation (the moon-disk mandala) is equivalent to the part  of the body it affects (the heart/mind), to the mental functions on which it operates  (the apparatus of consciousness), and finally to the results achieved (the three  siddhis and the three bodies of the Buddha). On the other hand, it is coextensive  as a mandala with the entire universe (Dharmadhatu), the mind, and the sub stance of semiotic activity (the Sanskrit letter A). As a result of such circularity,  salvation is continuously produced and certainly realized. The Ritual is a good  indication that the soteriology of Tantric Buddhism in East Asia is based on se 

miotic practices, in which symbols are manipulated in meditation and ritual ac tion. The text attributes enormous importance to language, especially the absolute  language of mantras, and to the development of particular macrosemiotic for mations composed of a variety of semiotic substances and objects organized in a  quinary series, in which each component is an alloform of all the others. The  previously mentioned stupa (or caitya) is one of these macrosigns. Another ma crosign, related to the previous one, but based on a nine-element system, is the  mandala complex of "moon-heart-lotus" that constitutes a rich support for the  practices described in the text.  

It is precisely the mastering of these macrosemiotic formations that enables one  to attain the goals of practice, be they salvation or this-worldly benefits. In other  words, attainment requires initiation; and initiation, as an act generating symbolic  capital, is directly related to power strategies. This is what is meant by this text  when it warns against careless transmission; easy availability would reduce its  symbolic potential. The text is also explicit about its political position: it ensures  both individual salvation and the protection of the state. In other words, it pres-

TANTRI C BUDDHISM , CHINES E THOUGH T 36 9  

ents itself as a tool for state government against rebellious or revolutionary move ments. It is not surprising, then, that this text and its variants became one of the  ideological pillars of institutional Buddhism in medieval Japan, which described  imperial institutions as inseparable from the Buddhist establishment, and which  effected a general "mandalization" of state territories, as well as of numerous  intellectual and productive practices, thereby turning Japan into a veritable geo political mandala. Some of the presuppositions of such a cultural and ideological  policy are to be found in the Ritual translated below.  

The Ritual, as it appears in the Taisho Canon (vol. 18, no. 905) and in the Manji  Zokuzokyo (no. 102), is a reprint of older versions published in Japan in the early  nineteenth century and based on earlier manuscripts preserved in different tem ples and copied by several people. Those early manuscripts appear to have been  very corrupt. Even though the copyists tried to amend the texts, several mistakes,  repetitions, and obscure expressions still appear in the modern published ver sions. In addition to relying on the aforementioned editions, my translation is  based on the partially annotated version of Kanbayashi Ryujo in Kokuyaku issaikyo:  Mikkyobu (Tokyo: Daito shuppansha, 1931), vol. 3, pp. 95-111 (which contains  a few additional errors). I have made some emendations, for which I am fully  responsible. Significant variants, original terms, as well as my explanatory com ments have been added in square brackets. Except where indicated, all terms  found in italics are Sanskrit.

Ritual of the Secret Dharanis of the Three Siddhis for the Destruction  of Hell, the Transformation of Karmic Hindrances, and the Liberation  from the Three Conditioned Worlds  

Translated at the Imperial Behest by Subhakarasimha Tripitaka from Central India  

In the practice of yoga there are a thousand ways, but only a small part of them  will be mentioned here. When [Mahavairocana] opens his mouth and moves  his tongue, the Dharmadhatu Palace shakes. All the tathagatas in the Realm of  the Lotus Receptacle emerge from samadhi, hell is destroyed, karmic hin 

drances are transformed positively, and beings are freed from the threefold  conditioned world. One should know that if the Sanskrit letters are properly  inscribed on the crown of the king, the ten thousand countries will be pacified.  If mantras are written on the banners of the envoys from the central govern 

ment, the four directions will be peaceful and provincial governors will be  under control. Also, if Sanskrit letters are written on drums and shell trumpets  [used to give orders in battle], the severe sound of authority will be heard from  afar. Evil spirits will be purified, order will reign over a thousand leagues, crops  will be abundant, and the people will not suffer calamities and diseases; the  deities [will be benevolent], and the weather will be regular. If written upon  war drums after empowerment, through visualization and chanting, the armies  of the enemies will spontaneously surrender without casualties. Such drums  can be called Adamantine drums.  

The pure eyes of Vairocana Buddha,  

open, are like lotus flowers.  

I bow deeply to the master of gods and humans of the three worlds,  the savior with the great bodhicitta.  

The sublime Teachings of Mantric Empowerment [that is, esoteric  Buddhism]  

consist in flowing into the gate of letter A, the unborn.  

The [light of the] signless universal knowledge emitted by the curl  between the Buddha's eyebrows  

permeates and illuminates everywhere, like the sun and the moon;  The karmic activities of body, speech, and mind become the three  mysteries  

and the three mysteries become the Dharma of the Nirmanakaya.  The five natural elements and the five wisdoms become the five parts  [five-syllable mantra],  

and the five parts completely contain the entire Dharmadhatu.  [The four buddhas] Aksobhya, the savior of the world Ratnasambhava,  Amitabha, the king Amoghasiddhi,  

form the auspicious circle of the siddhi,  

transmit this sublime Dharma and convert all living beings; 

TANTRI C BUDDHISM , CHINES E THOUGH T 371  

Trailokyavijaya, the compassionate one with infinite powers,  Vajrasattva, the venerable Acalanatha,  

without breaking their vow, at the right time,  

when the practice of yoga is finished, return to the Diamond Realm.  

The Buddha says:  

The letter A corresponds to [Aksobhya's] Vajra Section and controls the liver.  The letter A is Mahavairocana Tathagata as Dharmakaya of principle, the orig inally pure, ultimate, and ungraspable emptiness [one version adds: the great  bodhicitta innate in all sentient beings]. It is the seed of the adamantine element  earth, the mantra of the Vajra section. In terms of names-and-forms [nama rupa], the earth is the forms. Among the five psychophysical aggregates it is  forms, that is the body, that controls earth. Its seed is impure. In other words,  the five viscera are material dharmas, and since they arise out of the aggregate  of forms, in terms of names-and-forms, the earth corresponds to the forms.  The liver controls the celestial soul [hun in Chinese]. The breath/energy [qi]  of the hun soul becomes the east and wood. Wood is the color of the sky. Wood  controls the spring, and its color is green/blue. Green-blue breath is generated  by wood, and wood is generated by water. The liver is generated by green-blue  breath and by the kidneys; its shape is like a lotus leaf in vertical position. At  the center is located the heart. The flesh heart is in the left part of the chest.  The liver protrudes outside and becomes the eyes; it also controls the muscles.  The muscles stretch out and become the nails. Now, because the five syllables  control the five viscera and the six receptacles, inside and outside intermingle,  as will be explained. If an excessive amount of sour flavor enters the liver, the  liver benefits but the spleen suffers. Should there be no hun soul in the liver,  one would lose sensibility and the lungs would damage the liver, thus causing  an illness. Just as metal overcomes wood, if the lungs are strong the liver is  weak. One should be careful with the lungs. If green-blue breath absorbs white  breath, the diseases of the liver heal, because green-blue breath predominates.  

The syllable vam corresponds to [Amithaba's] Lotus Section and controls  the lungs. The syllable vam is the eleventh transformation of the letter va; the  syllable vi is the third transformation. Its meaning is a development of the  meaning of the letter A. In other words, vam is the seed of the ring of the  element water, the sea of wisdom of Mahavairocana Tathagata. The Dharma 

kaya of Wisdom, as well as the Sambhogakaya, have unconditioned supernat ural powers. Vam is the mantra of the Lotus section. The lungs control the  terrestrial soul [po in Chinese]. The shape of the po is like a flower. It controls  the nose and corresponds to the west and to metal. Metal controls autumn, and  its color is white. The color white is generated from wind, and wind is generated  from the yang breath of earth. Among the five aggregates, it is discerning that  controls wind. Discerning is generated from consciousness; consciousness is  generated from past intentions; past intentions are generated from ignorance;  ignorance is generated from false views; false views in turn are generated from  other false views. This is the cycle of twelve causal factors. The lungs are 

372 FABI O RAMBELL I  

generated from white breath and the spleen. If an excessive amount of spicy  flavor enters the lungs, the lungs will benefit but the liver will suffer. Should  there be no po soul in the lungs, one would become insanely frightened; the  heart would damage the lungs, thus causing illness. Just as fire overcomes  metal, if the heart is strong the lungs are weak. One should be careful with the  heart. If white breath absorbs red breath, the diseases of the lungs heal. White  breath is another name for the lungs.  

The syllable ram corresponds to [Ratnasambhava's] Treasure section and  controls the heart. The syllable ram sows the seed of the fire element in Ma havairocana Tathagata's pure mind. Fire, being the abode of the buddhas of all  times, burns ignorance, defilements, and delusory attachments accumulated by  sentient beings over a beginningless period of time, and generates the seeds of  bodhicitta. The meaning of the syllable ram is a development of the meaning  of the letter A. In other words, since it represents the Tathagata as Nirmana kaya, ram truly is the fire mandala [or mantra, that is, the mandala/mantra of  Acalanatha's samadhi] of the Dharmakaya of Wisdom. The heart controls the  superior soul [shen in Chinese], and its shape is like a bird. South is fire, and  fire controls the summer. Its color is red. Red is generated from fire; fire is  generated from wood. Among the five aggregates it is perception that controls  fire; perception is produced by ideation. Moreover, the heart is generated from  red breath and the liver. The heart protrudes outside and becomes the tongue;  the heart further controls the blood; the blood stretches outside and becomes  milk. It also controls the ear, and turns into the nostrils, the septum of the  nose, the jaws, and the chin. If an excessive amount of bitter flavor enters the  heart, the heart will benefit but the lungs will suffer. Should there be no shen  soul in the heart, one would lose the sense of time; the kidneys would damage  the heart, thus causing an illness. Just as water overcomes fire, if the kidneys  are strong the heart is weak. One should be careful with the kidneys. If red  breath absorbs black breath, the diseases of the heart heal. Red breath is the  syllable ram.  

The syllable ham corresponds to [Amoghasiddhi's] Karma section and con trols the kidneys. The syllable hum is another transformation of the syllable  ha. Ham means that Mahavairocana Tathagata always abides on the seed of the  element wind and longevity. Since the three gates of liberation refer to the fact  that time is ungraspable, ham is the mandala/mantra of the great power of the  Dharmakaya. Wind is controlled by the aggregate of discerning. The five viscera  are: liver, the lungs, heart, spleen, and the kidneys. The stomach is one of the  six receptacles; it is the belly, that is, the one among the six receptacles cor responding to the spleen; it is the sea located within the five viscera and the  six receptacles. All water enters the stomach, which distributes it to the five  viscera and the other receptacles. The five flavors circulate inside the body,  and since the best among them enter the stomach first, the kidneys in particular  receive them from the stomach. The kidneys are located below the waist and  the navel; the one to the left is the kidney proper; the one to the right is calledTANTRI C BUDDHISM , CHINES E THOUGH T 373  

Gate of Life. They lie upon the abdomen [that is, on the stomach]; when they  stretch out they become sperm. The kidneys control the will [shi in Chinese],  and correspond to the north and water. Water controls winter, and its color is  black. Among the five aggregates it is intention that controls water. Intention  is generated from perception, and perception is generated from discerning. The  kidneys are generated from black breath and the lungs, and control the ear.  The kidneys protrude outside and become the bones which control the mar 

row. The marrow stretches out and becomes the ear holes. The bones in turn  stretch out and become the teeth. If an excessive amount of salty flavor enters  the kidneys, the kidneys will benefit but the heart will suffer. Should there be  no shi soul in the kidneys, one will be sad and cry; the spleen will damage the  kidneys, thus causing illness. Just as earth overcomes water, if the spleen is  strong, the kidneys are weak. One should be careful with the spleen. If black  breath absorbs yellow breath, the diseases of the kidneys heal. Black breath is  the syllable ham.  

The syllable kham corresponds to [Mahavairocana's] Void section and con trols the spleen. The syllable kham is the invisible usnisa [that is, the top of  the head, one of the marks of the Buddha representing enlightenment] of Ma havairocana Tathagata which, as the site of the wisdom of Great Emptiness  experienced by the five buddhas, is both principle and wisdom of extinction  (nirvana) and Thusness (tathata). The syllable kham is thus the supreme man dala/mantra, the sacred place where the buddhas of the ten directions and of  all times attain enlightenment. The spleen controls the ideas [yi in Chinese],  and becomes the center and earth. Earth controls the summer and its color is  yellow. Yellow is generated from earth; earth is generated from fire. As ex plained before, the aggregate of forms controls earth [therefore, consciousness  controls space]. Earth also becomes the orb corresponding to wood [that is,  the liver]. The green-blue color of wood corresponds to the sky. The spleen is  generated from the yellow breath and the heart; it controls the mouth and  becomes the yi soul. If an excessive amount of sweet flavor enters the spleen,  the spleen will benefit but the kidneys will suffer. Should there be no yi soul  in the spleen, one would lose the sense of orientation; the liver would damage  the spleen, thus causing illness. Just as wood overcomes earth, if the liver is  strong the spleen is weak. One should be careful with the liver. If yellow breath  absorbs green-blue breath, the diseases of the spleen heal. Yellow breath is the  syllable kham.  

The five viscera are like a lotus turned upside down. What inside the body  are the five viscera outside become the five phases. The former protrude outside  and become objects. These are the forms. Whereas "forms" refer to the four  natural elements and the five senses, "names" refer to the four immaterial ag 

gregates such as discerning, volition, and so on. The sun and the moon, the  five planets, the twelve constellations, and the twenty-eight lunar mansions  form the human body.  

The mountains, the sea, and the earth come from the letter A. The rivers 

374 FABI O RAMBELL I  

and all the water streams come from the syllable vara. Gold, jade, precious  gems, the sun, the moon and the stars, and the light of fire, and jewels come  from the syllable ram. The five cereals, the five fruits, and the blossoming  flowers are produced by the syllable ham. Beautiful people perfumed with won 

derful fragrances, heavenly longevity, a pretty face, a beautiful aspect, fortune,  and wealth display their glory out of the syllable kham.  

The letter A is the east and the tathagata Aksobhya, the syllable vam is the  west and the tathagata Amitabha, the syllable ram is the south and the tathagata  Ratnasambhava, the syllable ham is the north and the tathagata Amoghasiddhi,  the syllable kham is the zenith ["center" according to one version] and the  tathagata Mahavairocana. The meaning of the letter A is extremely profound;  it concerns the substance of emptiness and quiescence and cannot be argued  upon philosophically. The mother of the myriad dharmas, the king of the great  initiation - this is the letter A.  

Since the teachings related to the letter A are difficult to believe in, this text  should not be shown, especially to the precept-masters of the Lesser Vehicle.  The Sanskrit text of the five-syllable mantra comes from the four hundred  thousand words [of the main Tantric scriptures?]; this mantra alone is the  supreme Merit Field [punyaksetra] containing the essence of the Mahavairo 

cana Sutra and the Diamond Head Sutra. The virtues acquired by those who  chant this mantra are incommensurable, unimaginable, and unexplainable.  Contemplation of the fundamental principle through memorization and  chanting of the five-syllable mantra of the Diamond Head Sutra will bring people  fortune. Their bones will be strong and their bodies healthy; forever free from  calamities and diseases, they will cultivate longevity.  

The doctrines concerning this mantra in five syllables are the usnisa [that  is, the highest form] of the five wisdoms, the essence of the five buddhas, the  mother of the wisdom of Sakyamuni [the historical Buddha] and the buddhas  of the ten directions and of all times, the caring parents of all sentient beings,  the treasury of the entire Dharmadhatu. Since it fights against all demons and  always wins, [this mantra] is like armor, halberd, bow, arrow, and staff. For  this reason, buddhas and bodhisattvas of all times are immersed in and emerge  from these five syllables, which are the seeds of the sprouts of the buddhas of  all times.  

The throne for this meditation is yellow; it is the circle of the adamantine  Dharma [esoteric Buddhism], also called the adamantine throne.  

1. A [the text here has the picture of a square] is the adamantine earth.  The letter A is used in the earth throne- and adamantine throne-meditations.  2. Vam [picture of a circle] is the adamantine water. The syllable vam is  used in the water- and lotus-meditations.  

3. Ram [picture of a triangle] is the adamantine fire. The syllable ram is  used in the sun meditation.  

4. Ham [picture of a crescent] is the adamantine wind. The syllable ham  is used in the moon meditation.

5. Kham [picture of a sphere] is the adamantine space. The syllable kham  is used in the space meditation.  

[picture of a five-element stupa]: this is the visualization that the es sence of the Tathagata is unborn.  

The mantra in five syllables is the delicious taste of all the tathagatas' sweet  dew [amrta in Sanskrit] of unbornness, the miraculous medicine of the Buddha  nature. If one syllable penetrates the five viscera, no disease will occur. How  much more powerful will the practice of visualizations of the sun and the moon  be! One will immediately experience the emptiness and the quiescence of the  Buddha body.  

A vam ram ham kham: these five syllables are the mantra of the Dharmakaya.  As for the amount of merit acquired in chanting them once, or seven times, or  twenty-one times, or forty-nine times a day, each chanting is equivalent in  virtue to reading one million times excerpts from the whole Buddhist canon.  How much greater will be the merit of sitting in quiet meditation and entering  samadhi! Thanks to the contemplation of the letter A, the truth is as clear as  the sun shining in the sky. Once the Buddha nature has been realized, the  virtues acquired are incomparable. The texts of the esoteric canon truly tran scend discursive thinking. However, there is the risk that monks with a Sravaka  ["auditor," an original disciple of the Buddha] nature and those who keep the  precepts of the Lesser Vehicle will not only arouse doubts and refuse to believe  these doctrines, but also increase their sins. This is like the king who, even  though he loved his little child so much as to give him all the precious objects  in his treasury without regrets, nevertheless refused to give him Ganjiang and  Moye [two famous ancient swords], because the child was not able to use them  and the king was afraid that he would harm himself. In the same way, the  Tathagata secretly transmits the esoteric teachings only to the great bodhisat tvas and does not make them available to the inferior knowledge of the sravaka.  

Dharmadhatu is the Dharmakaya Tathagata's true reality. In the human body  we distinguish between the upper part, from the armpit to the top of the head;  the middle part, from the navel to the armpit; and the lower part, from the feet  to the navel. Also in the mantras one should distinguish between three different  siddhis [to be acquired].  

Lower siddhi: A ra pa ca na. It is called the "protruding siddhi." It generates  roots and stems and permeates the four directions. To chant it once is like  reading excerpts from the whole canon a hundred times (to chant it once is  like chanting the 84,012 Vedas; the practitioner will be freed from all troubles  and sufferings). When one enters the Tathagata's state of the indifferentiated 

ness of all dharmas, all letters are undifferentiated, and one quickly attains the  great wisdom. If chanted twice, this mantra eliminates all major sins committed  over a hundred million kalpas [eons] of rebirths. [The bodhisattvas] Manjusri  and Samantabhadra extend their protection to the four classes of Buddhists  [that is, monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen] surrounding them. The good  deities, Dharma-protectors endowed with the fearlessness of compassion, 

376 FABI O RAMBELL I  

appear in front of the practitioner [to protect him]. If chanted three times, the  practitioner will attain samadhi; if chanted four times, the practitioner will be  able to remember all the dharanis, if chanted five times, the practitioner will  immediately attain the supreme bodhi.  

Middle siddhi: A vi ra hum kham. Called the "intruding siddhi," it generates  branches and leaves. The intruding siddhi goes from the navel to the heart.  Permeating the four directions, its bright light penetrates Buddha's Dharmad hatu, whence its name. To chant [this mantra] once is like reading excerpts  from the entire canon a thousand times (this mantra is also called the ada mantine formula for the subjugation of the four multitudes of demons and the  six destinations and for the attainment of universal wisdom).  

Upper siddhi: A vam ram ham kham. This is called the "secret siddhi," the  "perfect siddhi," as well as the "susiddhi." Susiddhi permeates the Dharmad hatu. These are the Dharmadhatu's secret words to attain buddhahood and  experience the great bodhi; their light permeates everywhere. Only buddhas  can trespass this threshold; pratyeka-buddhas and Sravakas cannot understand  it; therefore it is called the "secret siddhi." To chant it once is like reading  excerpts from the entire canon one million times.  

The protruding siddhi goes from the feet to the waist; the intruding siddhi  goes from the navel to the heart; and the secret siddhi goes from the heart to  the top of the head; these are the three siddhis. The protruding siddhi is the  attainment of the Nirmanakaya; the intruding siddhi is the attainment of the  Sambhogakaya; and the susiddhi is the attainment of the Dharmakaya. These  truly are the three eternal bodies, the repository of the true Teachings, the  perfect body of the Dharmakaya Mahavairocana, the true source of the Womb  and Vajra mandalas. Therefore I bow my head and pay homage to Mahavai rocana Buddha.  

These three five-syllable mantras, that is, [each of] these five syllables, are  equivalent to the fifteen adamantine samadhis. One syllable is equivalent to all  fifteen syllables, and all fifteen syllables are equivalent to each syllable; each  syllable is equivalent to each set of five syllables, and each set of five syllables  is equivalent to each syllable. The serial visualization in proper order [from  the beginning to the end] or in reverse order [from the end to the beginning]  produce the same result, since the beginning and the end are nondual [that is,  nondistinct]. The following eight meditative practices contain all dharmas.  [The practitioner should see that] each syllable contains all syllables; all syl lables contain each syllable; each syllable explains all syllables; all syllables  explain one syllable; each syllable makes all syllables; all syllables make each  syllable; each syllable destroys all syllables; all syllables destroy the meaning  of each syllable. All the preceding constitutes one meditative set that can be  visualized in the proper order and in reverse order. One should practice the  entire set four times in proper order and four times in reverse order. The benefit  for sentient beings in the entire Dharmadhatu is that they will all become  buddhas. 

TANTRI C BUDDHISM , CHINES E THOUGH T 377  

The shape of the hrdaya-heart of ordinary people is like a closed lotus. Its  muscles form eight sections. In men it is turned upward, in women it is turned  downward. In visualization one should open one's heart to form a white lotus  with eight petals. Upon it as a platform one should see the letter A in golden  color. The letter A is like a square yellow altar, and the practitioner sees oneself  on it. From the letter A comes out the syllable ra, which burns one's body and  reduces it to ashes. From the ashes the syllable va is generated, of a pure white  color. From it, A yam ram ham kham, the mantra of the five elements [of the  cosmic stupa], is produced. This mantra takes its place on the five parts of the  body, from the waist to the top of the head. This is the pure bodhicitta. These  five syllables concur in the creation of the roots of great compassion. The sala  tree of the Buddha grows and fills the entire Dharmadhatu; accordingly, all  dharmas are based upon this five-syllable mantra, which is originally unborn  and transcends language; its substance is pure, without karmic conditionings,  and empty like space. The eight petals of the heart-lotus become a platform,  and the area in the practitioner's body going from the navel to the heart be comes the adamantine platform (a pavilion built on the sea). The navel be comes the ocean; beneath is the abode of all deities [of the mandala], which is  the coastline. From the ocean of compassion of the buddhas arises the Vajra  Wisdom; from the Vajra Wisdom arises the assembly of all buddhas [that is,  the mandala]. On this eight-petaled lotus platform which is the heart one  should then visualize the letter A. This letter emits a massive light that disperses  in the four directions from the heart; then the rays converge again to form a  sort of garland of light like a floral wreath [used in temple decoration] and  pervade all Buddha lands in the universe. This light then encircles the practi tioner's body, shrouding it from the top of the head to the feet. One should  then visualize the syllable am on the top of the head; it turns into the center  of the Womb mandala and produces three rays of light. The first ray turns  around the throat of the practitioner, reaches to the top of the head, and in  the areas brightened by the light, Buddhist deities appear to form the first circle  of the Womb mandala. The second ray of light turns around the heart and goes  from the navel to the throat; Buddhist deities appear to form the second circle  of the Womb mandala. The third ray of light turns around the navel and bright ens the area of the body below the navel, where Buddhist deities appear to  form the third circle of the Womb mandala. This is the heavenly pavilion of  the ordinary world [the residence of the gods between the earth and Brahma's  heaven; or, perhaps, the totality of sacred and profane space]. Forms, colors,  and characteristics of the deities vary, but the practitioner has all of them inside  his own body, as if he were one of the members of the Buddha assembly [that  is, the mandala] himself. His whole body is a mandalic body, that is, the Dhar madhatu body of unlimited salvational powers.  

The central part of the aforementioned Womb mandala is the eight-petaled  lotus representing Mahavairocana's heart. This heart-lotus platform is the cen ter of the mandala; the various buddhas are distributed according to their rank 

378 FABI O RAMBELL I  

on the external lotus. The four directions are the four wisdoms of the Tatha gata, and in the petals situated between them are the four all-embracing [bo dhisattva] virtues [giving, affectionate speech, conduct profitable to the others,  cooperation with others; but also the four Tantric bodhisattvas who convert  beings with hook, rope, chain, and bell]. To the southeast is Samantabhadra,  the sublime cause of bodhicitta. To the southwest is Manjusri, great wisdom.  To the northeast is Maitreya, great compassion. Great compassion is the second  principle. Then to the northwest is Avalokitesvara, who stands for enlighten ment. To realize the goals of one's practices, one should enter the samadhi of  this lotus platform. The first letter A in the lotus is located in the east and  represents the bodhicitta, the beginning of all practices. The yellow color rep resents the Vajra nature; it is called both the "precious banner" and Aksobhya  Buddha. Next, the syllable a is situated in the south. It stands for the religious  practices; its color is red and represents fire. Its meaning is the same as that of  Manjusri, namely, the opening of the lotus; it is also called Ratnasambhava  Buddha. Next, there is the syllable am in the west, standing for the bodhi. The  performance of countless practices results in awakening. Its white color rep resents ultimate wisdom; it also stands for water. Its corresponding buddha is  Amitabha. Next, to the north is the syllable am, which stands for enlighten ment. Its corresponding buddha is Sakyamuni. The syllable stands for the great  nirvana, so called because the practitioner, having expunged the traces, returns  to the origin. Since the sun of the Buddha hides beyond the mountains, the  color [of this stage] is black. Finally, at the center is the syllable amh, standing  for skillful means (upaya). One should know that the substance of such Dhar madhatu in the heart is originally and always characterized by quiet extinction  (nirvana). Accordingly, Mahavairocana's original body, the substance of the  lotus platform, exceeds the eight-petaled lotus, transcends space, surpasses the  realm of mind: only the buddhas can understand it. It is thanks to skillful  means that [the mandala] can manifest all its images even though it is like the  great space; even though its center is empty, it contains all forms. In other  words, the mandala, as the universe of empowerment, being the assembly of  those endowed with infinite salvational powers, appears everywhere in space.  However, this is none other than the single body, the single wisdom, and the  single practice of the Tathagata. Therefore, the eight-petaled lotus is Maha vairocana Tathagata's single substance. Therefore, Mahavairocana at the center  of the mandala is the Dharmakaya. Vajrasattva's Seal (mudra) of Vajra Wisdom  represents prajna [that is, the wisdom acquired with enlightenment]. Avalok itesvara's Seal of the Lotus Holder represents liberation. The mystery of the  body is the power of the Dharmakaya, the mystery of speech is the power of  prajna, and the mystery of the mind is the power of liberation. Since one attains  liberation as a consequence of prajna, liberation depends on prajna. However,  both depend on the substance of the Dharmakaya: they are different but in separable, and if one is missing the other cannot be attained. They are like the  three strokes of the letter I [in Siddham script]. 

TANTRIC BUDDHISM, CHINESE THOUGHT 37 9  

The bodhicitta corresponds to the Vajra section, compassion to the Lotus  section, and skillful means correspond to the Nirmanakaya. Therefore, the  letter A represents the stage inside the womb, and its level of attainment is that  which precedes enlightenment; the letter sa represents the stage outside the  womb, and its level of attainment is enlightenment; the letter va represents the  function [yong in Chinese], and all wheels of Dharma depend on it. The two  manifestations of arbitrary traces [unclear, perhaps a reference to Sambhoga kaya and Nirmanakaya] save the ten worlds. The Tathagata's Seal of Wisdom  is the true aspect of the heart, that is, supreme wisdom. In other words, bod 

hicitta is the cause, compassion is the root, and skillful means are the ultimate.  The meanings of the series of five elements are the causal factors for the prac tices leading to wisdom.  

If a sentient being knows this text's doctrines, the commoners will make  offerings to him in the same way they venerate a caitya [that is, a stupa]. The  caitya is in fact the model of the living body's relics [as described in this text].  Therefore, all devas [godsl and human beings, when praying for good fortune,  make offerings to it. If a practitioner believes these doctrines, he is the recep 

tacle of the Dharmakaya's relics. Furthermore, the Sanskrit terms caitya and  citta refer to the same thing [since they share the same root]. Accordingly,  what is secretly [that is, technically] called "heart" actually is a stupa of the  Buddha. As in the third circle of the Womb mandala [above], one's heart/mind  is the basis. It expands and becomes the center of the Womb mandala, upon  which is the color of nirvana. Accordingly, the caitya is very high. Then, it  expands gradually from the lotus at the center of the Womb mandala and  becomes the universal salvific body of the manifestations of the buddhas, per vading everywhere. Accordingly, the caitya is very wide: its lotus platform is  the entire Dharmadhatu, that is, the cosmic relic of the Dharmakaya. If a sen 

tient being understands this Seal of the Bodhicitta he is like Mahavairocana,  and the commoners will make offerings to him in the same way they venerate  a caitya.  

Therefore, in Mahavairocana's body-and-land, external world and sentient  beings are interpenetrated, essence and signs are identical; Thusness pervades  the Dharmadhatu and the body-speech-mind of the Supreme Self [the enlight ened one] are undifferentiated, like cosmic space. Space is a sacred place, and  the Dharmadhatu is the practitioner's residence. Mahavairocana Tathagata, in  order to spread this doctrine, manifests two Dharmakayas. The Buddha as  Dharmakaya of Wisdom abides in the true principle and, as the Sambhogakaya  for his own enjoyment, manifests the central circle of the Womb mandala and  makes everyone follow the nondual path. The Buddha as Dharmakaya of Prin ciple abides in the undifferentiated and radiant quiescence; absolute, eternal,  and unchanging, he manifests the eight-petaled lotus; as the Sambhogakaya  working for everyone's salvation, he manifests the three circles of the Womb  mandala and makes everyone in the ten worlds attain the Great Emptiness  [enlightenment]. The meanings of Principle and Wisdom show dissimilarities 

3 8 0 FABI O RAMBELLI  

in extension, but they are originally one single dharma and therefore have no  essential differences. All dharmas return to the letter A, and the five syllables  are identical with the single Vairocana.

## Rites and Techniques 

### 22 Worship of the Ladies of the Dipper  

Charles D. Orzech and James H. Sanford  

The Pole Star and the seven stars of the Great or Northern Dipper occupy a  prominent place in Chinese imperial and Daoist traditions, and have microcosmic  and macrocosmic associations on both the astronomical and the human scales. It  was widely believed that the stars and constellations of "heaven" (tian) had ana 

logues in the "under-heaven" (tianxia) and within the human body, and that  events and conditions in one of these systems affected the analogous structures  in the other systems. Thus, heaven was the model for earth, and the heavenly  bureaucracy the model for the earthly empire. So too, the human body was con 

ceived as a "country" containing palaces and offices, with its gods the functionaries  that serve in the "Niwan Palace" (conceived of as "grottos" in the cranium), in the  "cinnabar field" (dantian) located below the navel, and elsewhere. Certain of these  gods were less than beneficent. Indeed, if allowed to leave the body they could  ascend to heaven and report misdeeds to the "comptroller of fate" (siming), who  noted their transgressions in a register. Such entries shortened a person's life. It  is notable that one of the texts below details rituals to alter these records and  thereby prolong life.  

Chinese cosmomagical speculation drew important connections between an  emperor's rule and events in the heavens, and the "Palace of the Pole Star" was  thought to be the celestial model for the palace of the son of Heaven here on  earth. The Dipper asterism was also believed to be the residence of Taiyi, the  Great Monad, and the abode of the deified Laozi, who lives there "as a hypostasis  of the Daoist cosmic Sage, the anthropomorphic form of the Dao" (Robinet 1997:  50). In resonance with the universe at large, the human body contains its own  Great or Northern Dipper. For "located in the very center of the head, the Niwan  ('mud-pill,' but also a transliteration of the term nirvana) Palace is covered by the  seven stars of the Northern Dipper" (Kohn 1993: 209). This inner Dipper is the  focus of a wide variety of Daoist meditational practices and is celebrated in in numerable Taoist works. As one Daoist adept put it,3 8 4 CHARLE S D . ORZEC H AND JAME S H .

In heaven seven stars; on earth seven treasures  

and seven grottos in our heads  

seven times the subtle air of yin melts  

as a slow fire warms the cauldron, warms the lead.

Because of the centrality and ubiquity of the circumpolar stars in Daoist and  imperial ideology, Chinese concern with the religious meaning of the Dipper stars  is often thought to be a peculiarly Daoist interest. Yet these motifs of macrocosm  and microcosm are often expressed in terms of the Indian cakra system of subtle  body organs. The dipper star motif is found in a number of Sino-Japanese venues  that range from Daoist alchemical texts (such as the poem translated above) to  paintings of the Japanese Shinto-Buddhist deity, Matara-jin. It should not, there fore, be surprising that in the volumes of the Taisho Tripitaka collection of Sino 

Japanese Buddhist works devoted to Esoteric or "Tantric" Buddhism (zhenyan,  "Mantra," or mijiao, "Esoteric" teaching, in Chinese; Shingon or mikkyo, in Japa nese) we find several such works.  

Chinese Esoteric Buddhism has a complex prehistory; in brief, between the  third century and the beginning of the eighth century, South and Central Asian  texts describing mandalas, and studded with mantras and dharanis (spells), began  to pour into China. This piecemeal transmission continued until Subhakarasimha  arrived in Changan in 717, followed by Vajrabodhi and his disciple Amoghavajra,  who arrived in the Tang capital in 721 to articulate and propagate the compre 

hensive systems of Buddhist esoterism. Like other South Asian forms of Tantra,  Esoteric Buddhism assumed an extensive series of correspondences between the  body and the cosmos, between internal yogic physiology (composed of cakras or  energy centers strung out along the spinal column and their connecting channels)  and the elements (wind, water, fire, and earth), planets, and stars. Progress toward  enlightenment proceeded on the external level in ritual, and internally through  yogic ascent. Success or siddhi was both a microcosmic mastery of the inner world  and a macrocosmic mastery of the cosmos.  

A common thread that runs through the Esoteric Buddhism of Subhakara sirhha, Vajrabodhi, Amoghavajra, and their disciples in the Late Tang (mid-eighth  through mid-ninth centuries) was the interdependence of the achievement of  enlightenment and various forms of worldly benefit. Nevertheless, much of these  masters' lives were spent in "mundane pursuits" and in constructing rituals mainly  of apotropaic and political value. Many of the ritual manuals collected in the  Esoteric portion of the Taisho canon (volumes 18-21) are directed toward the  ills of the period of the "End of the Dharma" (Chinese moja, Japanese mappo).  For example, in The Scripture Expounded at the Bodhimanda Concerning the Single  Syllable Usnisa, we find the Buddha instructing Vajrapani concerning a time "after  my extinction, during the time of the end of the Dharma." What is then pro 

pounded is the End of the Dharma Siddhi (Taisho 950: 200c, 205c) to shield the  practitioner from a wide variety of impending disasters. 

LADIE S OF THE DIPPE R 385  

Ritual application fell into two broad categories. There were rituals for the  imperial family, high courtiers, and generals, both living and dead; and rituals  designed to protect and maintain the state and the cosmic order. Esoteric re vamping of earlier Buddhist texts and rituals with these purposes in mind con sistently followed the paradigms set out in the Sarvatathagatatattvasamgraha  (Taisho 865-66; 862), and the treatment of these texts and rituals parallels the  treatment of the Scripture for Humane Kings (Taisho 245-46). No disembodied  Buddhism this: rather, the point was application - fully embodied ritual appli cation with sonic, photic, and somatic dimensions. This was, in short, Tantra,  and what dazzled jaded Tang courtiers was its sumptuous ritual, its "smells and  bells."  

The Tang masters drew upon the vast store of correspondences between the  body and the cosmos found in South Asian Tantric systems. Among the most  basic homologies are those involving lunar and solar images, night and day, white  and red, and the ida and pingala channels that pierce the cakras of the yogin's  subtle physiology. Extensive correspondences were worked out not only con 

cerning the moon and sun, but also with regard to the planets and stars. The  alchemical traditions related planets to colors, jewels, ores, and so forth. This  body of lore was developed throughout South Asian yogic traditions. Mainstream  Buddhism had relatively little to say on the luminaries in or outside of the body.  The Abhidharmakosa remarks only that "the stars turn about Meru as though  caught in a whirlpool." Despite this laconic sentence, it makes perfect sense to  "assume that there is some relationship between the seven circular mountain rings  and the seven spheres marked out by the 'planets' of antiquity" (Kloetzli 1983:  46-47). Not unexpectedly, later Kalacakra (Wheel of Time) traditions as sum marized by Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye (1995: 156-58), give more details:  

The celestial sphere pervades space between Mount Meru and the mountain of fire.  It is a belt of wind, within which the twelve houses and the twenty-eight constellations  formed first. [The houses] are situated in a clockwise arrangement. Planets such as  the sun and moon arise above them. [Eight] move counterclockwise; the Eclipser  [moves] clockwise.  

The location of this belt in the body is not specified. The Japanese Byakuhokusho  (containing what is purported to be oral transmission of the Tang masters now  preserved in Japan) seems to identify it with the mouth and eyes in a fashion that  seems to evoke the sacrifice of Purusa in Rg Veda 10.90: "the sun, the moon, and  the five planets emerge from the radiance of Manjusri. Emanating beams of light  from his mouth in the center of this radiance, he manifests the five planets; from  the radiance of his left and right eyes, he manifests the sun and the moon" (Birn 

baum 1983: 123 n.128, citing Taisho supplement 6.461a). South Asian sources  here parallel Daoist tradition in locating the Dipper in the head and associating  it with the sun, moon, and the eyes. As elsewhere in esoteric astral lore, it is  Manjusri, the bodhisattva embodiment of wisdom, who is lord of the heavens. The  Manjusri-nama-sangiti-sutra speaks of the twenty-eight lodges (the lunar lodges, 

386 CHARLE S D . ORZEC H AND JAME S H . SANFOR D  

or groups of stars along the path of the moon; mythically, the abodes of Soma's  wives where he rests on his journey) as the diadem of Manjusri (Birnbaum 1983:  102). Given the identification of the throat cakra with the element wind one may  tentatively imagine the twenty-eight lunar lodges (naksatras) as the bodhisattva's  "necklace" and as the topmost level of the material world (just below the four  transic states or Brahma heavens) that affects the fate of sentient beings. Here we  have, in short, the workings of karma. In his climb to the summit of existence  the yogin masters the forces of karma (the planets and naksatras) and, by bringing  together the solar and lunar forces, transcends the wheel of time.  

A major factor in the success of Tantric Buddhism in the eighth and ninth  century Tang court was the masters' ability and willingness to adapt their knowl edge to the concerns of their new Chinese patrons. Indian astral lore - like that  of the Greeks - focused on the ecliptic (the apparent motion of the sun against  the background of fixed stars), the heliacal rising and setting of stars (which yields  the twelve houses or the zodiacal band of stars confined to the apparent path of  the sun in the sky), and the twenty-eight naksatras. Chinese astral lore was keyed  to the circumpolar stars and meridians drawn from them to the "lunar lodges"  (xiu). The stars of the Great Dipper were not neglected in South Asian traditions;  indeed, they had been identified with the seven rsis (sages) since Vedic times.  The wives of the rsis were the Krtikkas, identified as the Pleiades open star cluster  that rises in the east in late autumn, and which itself resembles a small dipper.  Perhaps this is the reason why the text locates all of the Dipper stars in the east.  The Indian and Chinese traditions shared an interest in the "lunar lodges," and  both sought ritually to divine and influence events in the heavens in order to  shape events in the mundane world. Thus, the Tang masters introduced new  mathematical techniques for the production of accurate calendars (an essential  part of the son of Heaven's claim to rule), performed homa (immolation) rituals  designed to propitiate the "nine Graspers" (spirits of the planets, which are often  associated with disease: jiu zhi in Chinese; navagraha in Sanskrit), and designed  new rites to address the lords of the Great Dipper (an asterism in Ursa Major).  

With this in mind, we turn to the Taisho canon, where we may distinguish  four categories of texts that concern themselves with astral phenomena. First are  those texts in which Manjusri is the lord of astral wisdom. Second is the cycle of  texts designed to prevent disasters connected with the Buddha's usnisa (the pro 

truberance on his head, or "wisdom bump"). Third are those texts primarily  concerned with the lords of the Great Dipper. Finally, there is an assortment of  texts that, along with their primary purpose, also promise protection from astral  misfortunes. A good example of these is the Scripture for Humane Kings.  

The three brief texts we translate represent a synthesis between Chinese and  South Asian astral worship. These are the Scripture Expounded by the Buddha on  Prolonging Life through Worship of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper (Fo shuo  beidou qi xingyan mingjing), Ritual Procedures for Invoking the Seven Stars of the  Northern Dipper (Beidou qi xing niansong yigui), and the Secret Essentials for Per forming Homa to the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper (Beidou qi xing huma miyao 

LADIE S O F THE DIPPE R 387  

yigui). Aimed squarely at neutralizing the evil effects of astral divinities and at  promoting good fortune and long life, these texts were an integral part of the new  Tantric teachings tailored to the concerns of Chinese aristocrats and military men.  

The Scripture Expounded by the Buddha on Prolonging Life through Worship of the  Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper constitutes a short catalog of the apotheosized  seven stars of the Dipper. Each of its seven entries consists of the following parts:  an illustration of the divinity of the star, the star/divinity's name, the drawing of  an appropriate talisman, and a short, formulaic, astrological text.  

The seven illustrations are all of individual female figures in ancient court dress,  with the exception of the fifth star, which shows its female figure accompanied  by a smaller-scale male acolyte. This asterism, zeta Ursa Majoris (the brighter  member is also known as Mizar, and the dimmer star as Alcor) is a well-known  double star visible to the naked eye from a dark site. Curiously, these gender  associations are exactly the opposite of those found in most South Asian sources.  There, Vasistha (zeta Ursa Majoris or Mizar) is accompanied by his chaste wife  Arundhati. However, one verse in the Rg Veda (1.164.16) says in reference to the  Krtikkas (the Pleiades), "They tell me that those virtuous women are men; he  who has eyes sees this, not he who is blind." Each entry is numbered in these  illustrations with a Japanese kana symbol, a feature that makes the Japanese prov enance of the Taisho text patent (but does not, of course, preclude earlier Chinese  provenance, as the text itself proclaims). The talisman shapes, like those of many  Daoist talismanic diagrams, are quite similar to Chinese characters; in some cases  the likely prototype character seems obvious. Each star name has also been as sociated with one or more of the "twelve earthly branches," which, in turn, is  associated with an astrological animal. We have indicated the associated animal  in brackets. Not surprisingly, Manjusri is the recipient of this scripture. Perhaps  of greater import is the catalog of woes that the scripture seeks to address, in cluding favorable rebirth, helping relatives out of hell, help in fending off demons  and "dead souls" (literally, the yang and yin souls of the dead), illness, agricultural  disasters, and difficulty in childbirth.  

The Ritual Procedures for Invoking the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper is at tributed to the master Vajrabodhi and promises a variety of rewards, including  that of lengthening one's life by modifying one's karmic register. One should note  that such a register is a decidedly Chinese notion, one that is treated in greater  detail in the Secret Essentials for Performing Homa to the Seven Stars of the Northern  Dipper. Here we find a standard Chinese account of the role of the Comptroller  of Fate (siming), and of penalties suffered for crimes. The text also notes that the  stars of the Dipper are the "essence of the sun, moon, and five stars [the planets],  making explicit one of the links between South and East Asian astrological lore.  Again, turning to South Asia, we find an intriguing correspondence, since the  seven rsis of the Dipper are sometimes regarded as sun, moon, and Agni (fire).  But this is a homa text, and it gives details of the construction of the altar, the  nature of the offerings, the proper mudras (gestures) and mantras, and a some what cryptic form of divination,

Taken together, these texts illustrate characteristic South Asian Tantric concerns  and practices aimed at advancement and protection in the material world, while  also demonstrating the adaptation of South Asian Tantric practices into the East  Asian milieu.  

The Scripture Expounded by the Buddha on Prolonging Life through Worship of the  Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper (Fo shuo beidou qi xing yan ming jing) is found  inTaisho 1307: 21.425b-426b); the Ritual Procedures for Invoking the Seven Stars  

of the Northern Dipper (Beidou qi xing niansong yigui) is in Taisho 1305: 21.423c 424b; and the Secret Essentials for Performing Homa to the Seven Stars of the Northern  Dipper (Beidou qi xing huma miyao yigui) is in Taisho 1306: 21.424b-425a. All  three texts are found in Taisho shinshu daizo-kyo, edited and compiled by Takakusu  Junjiro and Watanabe Kaigyoku. (Tokyo: Taisho issaikyo kanko-kai, 1924-34).  The mantras have been rendered according to the siddham (a script related to  Brahmi) that appears beside the Chinese transliteration in the texts.  

The Chinese employ two series of characters, the ten "heavenly stems" and the  twelve "earthly branches," to designate a calendrical cycle of sixty years. Each of  the twelve branches is associated with an animal and a zodiacal year sign. We  have given these associations in brackets where appropriate.

If you encounter an inauspicious year or month, pay obescience to this scrip ture seven times.  

At that time the Buddha spoke to Manjusri Bodhisattva, and what he ex pounded was this scripture. It has awesome spirit and awesome power. It can  save all beings from grave offenses and it can eradicate all karmic obstructions.  

If there are monks and nuns, officials and administrators, laymen (upasakas),  good men and good women, whether wealthy or poor, whether of long or short  lifespan, they are all under the sway of the seven stars of the Northern Dipper.  If they hear this scripture and receive it, make offerings, and read it repeatedly,  and exhort friends and relatives, kith and kin, then in this life they will obtain  great fortune and in the next will attain rebirth in a heaven.  

If there are good sons and daughters [whose kinsmen] have already died  and fallen into hell where they have received all sorts of bitter misery - if they  hear this scripture, revere it, and make offerings, then forthwith those who  have died will attain release from hell and be reborn in Sukhavati [Amitabha's  Pure Land].  

If there are good sons and daughters who are injured by attacks of imps or  troubled by evil demons, or if evil dreams, weird occurrences, or dead souls  alarm them - then if they hear this scripture, receive it, and make offerings,  forthwith the dead souls will be pacified and they will always be free of fear.  

If there are good sons and daughters, and if they serve as personal attendants  to an official and - if they encounter this scripture, revere it, and make offer ings, forthwith they will [themselves] attain promotion to official [status]. This  is great happiness.  

If there are good sons and daughters, and if illness racks their bodies and  they seek relief, then they should, in a pure room, burn incense and make  offerings to this scripture. The illness will abate.  

If there are good sons and daughters who desire advancement and through  goods-trading travel as brokers, seeking wealth, comfortable living, and pros perity - if they encounter this scripture, revere it, and make offerings, forth with they will attain the sought-after wealth and comfort they seek, and their  transactions will bring them great fortune.  

If there are good sons and daughters, and if in raising silkworms [the co coons] are empty, or if in husbanding the six beasts are discontented, then in  a pure room, they should burn incense and make offerings to this scripture.  They will attain fields of silkworms according to their wishes, and their six  domestic beasts will multiply and [they] will never suffer injury or loss, disas ter, or obstruction.  

If there are women who are pregnant and in difficulty at the time of partu rition, then if they encounter this scripture, revere it, and make offerings to it,  forthwith mother and child will be separated and the danger will be eliminated.  As a result, the children born to them will attain uprightness and long life as  a consequence of their previous good deeds.  

If there are good sons and daughters, they should know that the seven stars 

392 CHARLES D. ORZECH AND JAMES H. SANFORD  

of the Northern Dipper control human destiny [and that this includes] an  entire lifetime's calamities [such as] official notice, disputes, loneliness, or [en counters] with various apparitions. If a person encounters this scripture and  reveres it and makes offerings [to it] not a single injury will [befall him]. At  that time Manjusri said, "Good sons and daughters, [you should] revere it and  faithfully receive it." [Then] they bowed and dispersed.  

Ritual Procedures for Invoking the Seven Stars of the  Northern Dipper  

Translated by the Tripitaka master and South Indian brahmin Vajrabodhi.  

At that time on behalf of all the unfortunate beings of the final age [of the  Dharma], the Tathagata expounded the mantra-teaching. At that time the sun,  moon, stars, and [lunar] lodges surrounded [the Buddha] and assembled like  clouds all around him, and in unison uttered this question, "Would the Tath 

agata expound for us the spirit-spell?" At that time the World-honored One  uttered the eight-star spell:  

Om sapta-jinaya bhajami jyaya jambu-dhama svami-naksatram bhavatu  svaha  

This mudra and mantra come from the Seven Star section of the Sarvatatha gatatattvasamgraha [note: this section does not exist!].  

The Buddha told Hungry Wolf, Ruiner of Armies, and the others, "If there  are good sons and daughters who receive and maintain this spirit-spell and  preserve it, will you protect them or not?" At that time the Eight Ladies an swered the World-Honored One: "If someone chants this spirit-spell every day  their evil karma will certainly be completely eradicated and they will accom plish everything they wish. If, moreover, someone is able to chant this spirit spell 108 times each day, then forthwith he and all his kinsman will obtain our  protection. If, moreover, a person is able to chant it five hundred times [each  day] then, because of its awesome spiritual power, with a radius of five hundred  yojanas none of the mara [demon]-kings, the demon hordes, the obstructers,  or the numberless evil ghosts will dare to approach, and we will always protect  him. The Eight Ladies of the Northern Dipper, the sun, moon, stars, and lodges,  all the divine dragons (nagas) and dryads (yaksas) and those able to create  obstructions and difficulties at once will cease their obstruction. If someone  wishes to worship them, first arouse an altruistic mind and in a pure place  [suitable] for meditation take incense, flowers, drink, and food for offerings.  Recite the spirit-spell and make the mudra. If you make offerings thus, the  Eight Ladies and their retinue will manifest and in accord with one's wishes  they will serve you, and you will accomplish your limitless desires. If it is kingly  status you [desire, you] will have it - [therefore] how much more so the status  and glory of lesser worldly positions? If you want long life [they will] scratch 

LADIE S OF THE DIPPE R 393  

out your karmic register and restore your life register. If all the kings of states,  the princes, the great officers, those of the rear courts, and so on construct  mandalas in their palaces and pay obescience in accordance with the appro priate homa, the Eight Ladies of the Northern Dipper will be delighted. As a  result [you will] long abide in a superior position and constantly be happy.  The one hundred officers - those superior and those inferior - will be in har mony and not commit acts contrary to the teaching. The people will flourish  and the harvests will be abundant. The state will be at peace and without  disasters, and weird occurrences will not manifest. Sickness and death will not  arise, and all the criminals within the borders will naturally disperse. Therefore  keep this method secret from unbelievers and do not transmit it to the ignorant.  This is because those who are ignorant have minds that do not discriminate.  Being unable to grasp the intent of the teaching they give rise to doubt and  criticism. Although ignorant, those born of the Vajra ["Diamond"], sons of the  Vajra, and the like constantly chant and maintain the Buddha-Eye-Mother  mantra and [this teaching] ought to be transmitted to them. Though ignorant,  the Vajra-sons do not doubt or criticize and therefore they attain success with  the method. As for those who practice it, even in the joy of the Sukhavati they  profoundly reorient themselves toward attaining unsurpassed bodhi [enlight enment] .  

Secret Essentials for Performing Homa to the Seven Stars of the  Northern Dipper  

Compiled by Master Guanding of the scripture translation bureau of the Great  Xingshan monastery.  

I will now, on behalf of the multitude of unfortunate beings of this latter age,  explicate the sequence of rites for making homa offerings to the seven stars of  the Northern Dipper.  

In a pure room make a water altar - whether square or round, about a fore arm across is adequate. Take thatch incense, sweet pine [valerian] and cense  the area. Blend dragon-brain [Borneo camphor?], white sandalwood, and five flavor [Schizandra chinensis?] and daub it [on the altar]. Within the altar  around the hearth install drink, food, and fruit. Divide these in seven portions  and set them out. Food refers to congee [rice soup], cakes, koumiss [fermented  camels' milk], and so on. But as for the choice among the five grains and  sapwood, they are to be selected according to a person's natal star.  

First make a vow intoning these words: "I earnestly request that the Seven  Luminaries, the venerable stars, the daras [the smashers], Hungry Wolf, Great  Gate, Wage Preserver, Literary Song, Pure and Upright, Military Song, and  Ruiner of Armies, on behalf of the patron so-and-so, [to] free him from danger  and lengthen his life so he will see one hundred autumns. I have constructed  this mandala and wish that you would condescend to take pity [on him] and3 9 4 CHARLE S D . ORZEC H AND JAME S H . SANFOR D  

approach this place to accept this homa. Protect this patron so-and-so, free  him from disasters and lengthen his life in accordance with his heart's desire"  (repeat this three times).  

Next make the mudra, clasping your hands before your heart, take your  thumbs and press them on the nails of the third finger [such that] the middle  and little fingers are like a lotus blossom. Open and close your index fingers  slightly.  

Next intone the monosyllabic Usnisa-raja mantra and the mantra for invok ing the seven stars of the Northern Dipper. The Usnisa-raja mantra is:  

Nama samanta dara dara pacara hum  

The mantra for invoking the Northern Dipper is:  

Namah samanta darana ehyehi pax hai dai kai rax murdara gharaham svaha  

Pick up the wood, the five grains, the koumiss, oil, etc., and throw it into  the hearth to incinerate it. Turn to examine [the patron's] natal star. If its  appearance scintillates and changes color and it shines with a yellowish-white  light, then you should make a vow to the Tathagata and in accordance with  the previous method do it for seven days and nights. You must not, in such  cases, approach this star, as it is concealed and may not be seen. Those referred  to as the seven stars of the Northern Dipper are the essences of the sun, moon,  and five stars [the planets]. In antiquity these comprised the seven luminaries  that shine in [all] eight directions. Above they shine on the celestial spirits, on  earth they shine down on men. They control good and evil and apportion  calamity and fortune. The host of stars report to them and the ten thousand  spirits bow before [them] in reverence. If someone worships and makes offer ings to them, that person will have long life and good fortune. He who does  not believe and revere them, his fortune will not last long.  

The Book of Wages and Fate says, "In the world is the spirit who is Comp troller of Fate. On each keng shen day (day fifty-seven in the sixty-day calen drical cycle) he turns to the Celestial Emperor to detail the good and evil that  people do. If a person [is guilty of] serious offenses then he receives the penalty  of destruction. If a person [is guilty of] lighter offenses then he loses twelve  years [of his life]. When the twelve-year [sentence] in the reckoning book is  announced as having elapsed, forthwith the Comptroller of Fate puts an end  to them." Therefore the Tathagata, on behalf of the multitude of beings in the  last generation who are of little fortune and short fate and who die prematurely,  has expounded this monosyllabic Usnisa-raja [mantra] and proceedures for  summoning and offering homa to the seven stars of the Northern Dipper. On  behalf of those who make the offerings, these deities will order the appropriate  natal star to remove them from the death records and restore them to the life  records.  

If all the kings of states construct mandalas in their palaces and in accordance  with this method offer homa and worship, then [the stars of] the Northern 

LADIE S OF THE DIPPE R 395  

Dipper will be delighted and therefore will protect you. You will long abide in  a superior station and you will continually receive peace and security. Ladies in-waiting, wives of high officials, concubines of the rear palaces, princes, the  multitude of officers, the three dukes, and the one hundred officials will be in  concord and will not act contrary to the Dharma. The people will multiply,  they will sow and reap bountifully, and the state will be at peace. There will  be no calamites, and incongruous events will not manifest themselves. Sickness  and death will not arise. Within the borders resentment and opposition and  the hordes of bandits will naturally flee and disperse. Therefore keep this  method secret! 

### 23 The Great Wisdom Mother and the Good Tradition  
Giacomella Orofino  

The tradition of Bdud kyi good yul (literally, "the demon as the object that is to  be cut off) is a medieval Buddhist practice developed in Tibet in the eleventh  century. Becoming widespread soon after the so-called period of the "new trans lations" of the Indian Buddhist Tantras in Tibetan, it was developed directly in  Tibetan rather than imported from India and translated from Sanskrit. It is a  syncretic movement that marks the confluence of Indian Tantric Buddhist and  pre-Buddhist Tibetan elements that are clearly shamanic in nature, which together  gave rise to a religious phenomenon with an identity of its own. It is based on a  complex literature that incorporated texts on dance, chanting, ritual music, the  nature of mystic hallucinations and visions, geomancy, exorcism, curing plagues,  and funeral rites. The basic principle of the practice involves annihilating the ego  by severing or "cutting off demons.  

This tradition was little known in the West prior to the last quarter century,  when it began to attract scholarly attention. The few Westerners who had pre viously described the good (pronounced cho) practice had provided only a su perficial analysis of it, more closely linked to the magicoreligious aspect of its  ritual than to its philosophic background and significance. The earliest data con cerning the doctrines of this practice had already arrived in the West before the  mid-nineteenth century, in the vague and somewhat mystifying descriptions left  by the early explorers of Tibet. This was followed in 1929 by the accounts of  Alexandra David-Neel, who described the good ritual in more detail, defining it  as a "macabre banquet" in which the officiant tramples all the passions underfoot,  "crucifying" the ego. In 1935 Evans-Wentz published the translation by Kazi  Dawa Samdup of The Laughter of the Dakinis (Mkha' 'gro gad rgyangs), one of the  most widespread ritual texts on good, from the collection of Klong chen snying thig  by 'Jigs med Gling pa (1730-1798). The German author compared it to a mystic  drama, akin to a mystery play, probably deriving from pre-Buddhist times. In  1953, George N. Roerich translated an entire chapter on the good yul system in  the Blue Annals, his English version of the Deb gter sngon po, one of the best-

T HE GOO D TRADITIO N 397  

known treatises on the history of Tibet, written between 1476 and 1478 by 'Gos  lo tsa ba Gzon nu dpal; and it is here that the Western reader could find for the  first time a brief hagiography of the most relevant female figure of this school,  Ma gcig Lab sgron (pronounced Ma chig Lab droun). Unfortunately Roerich, in  two other chapters of the Blue Annals, one on the New Tantras and the Lam 'Bras,  (the "Path and Its Fruit" teachings), and another on the lineages of the Zhi byed  doctrines, confused Ma gcig Lab sgron with Ma gcig Zha chung ma, a contem porary woman saint. This error, which led other scholars to confuse the two  yoginis, was identified in 1985 by Janet Gyatso in her thorough study of the good  tradition. Subsequently, since 1990, the Western public has had access to Ma  gcig's biography and to the foundations of good through the well-documented  studies of Karenina Kollmar Paulenz and the more popularized account by Jerome  Edou.  

In this essay I examine the central philosophy of the good school, its origins,  and its theoretical premises. This is followed by an analysis of the taxonomy of  the concept of "demon" from early Buddhism through Mahayana thought to its  subsequent development in good doctrine. This leads to an examination of the  relationship between Vajrayana Buddhism and the literature of Tantras in Tibet,  as well as a description of good practitioners, ritual objects, and the structure of  the practice. I also discuss the pre-Buddhist and shamanistic elements of death  and resurrection, exorcism, and decontamination. Finally, I outline Ma gcig's life  as a means of identifying the ways in which the main strands of this tradition  were developed in her practice. The translation is an excerpt from a poem attrib uted by the tradition to Ma gcig Lab sgron, the Great Collection of the Teachings  (Bka' tshoms chen mo), which was included among the good "root texts" by the  nineteenth-century Tibetan scholar 'Jam mgon Kong sprul (1813-1899) in his  compilation entitled the Treasury of Profound Instructions (Gdams ngag mdzod).  Although a complete Italian translation of this text has been published and a  German translation is in preparation, no English edition exists.  

The colophon to the Great Collection of the Teachings states that the poem is a  work by Ma gcig and that it should be considered to be the basis for all the good  doctrines. This work is renowned by Tibetan tradition as that saint's spiritual  testament, and the text that, more than any other, expresses her thought in a clear  and essential way. We find in it an analysis of the theory of the "four demons"  according to good tradition. Starting from the principle that the root of all demons  is to be found in one's own mind, Ma gcig examines the mechanisms that form  the basis of human suffering, concluding with the consideration that all demons  can be incorporated into those of ego-clinging and pride. Her analysis has an  apophatic connotation that reminds us of the Prajnaparamita (Perfection of Wis dom) literature, and especially of Nagarjunian thought which holds that supreme  reality is neither conceivable nor obtainable through concepts. In this way, her  analysis of the mind is transformed into a hymn to the absolute reality, pure in  its essential nature and free from religious dogma. It offers us considerable insight  into one of the most remarkable traditions of medieval Buddhism. 

398 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

Theoretical Premises  

In the good system, liberation from the fetters of existence can only come about  through the annihilation of pride. The foremost demon to be severed is attach ment to the ego, and all that flows from it: pride, vanity, arrogance, and pre sumptuousness. This is the fundamental cause of human ignorance and the true  obstacle to conquering the suffering of existence and awakening to supreme  knowledge. In more general terms, annihilation of the self is the axis around which  the whole of Buddhist philosophy has turned from its very inception. In this  system, however, cutting off the ego takes on a very specific connotation, as it is  based not so much on philosophical speculation as on ritual procedure that,  teeming with elements of considerable emotional charge, is deeply rooted in the  ancient pre-Buddhist traditions of Tibet. The main rite in good is a sacred drama  in which the officiant, dancing and chanting to the rhythm of a two-headed drum  and the sound of a trumpet made from a human thighbone, invokes all the spirits  

and gods of the universe and offers them the gift of his body.  It is not easy to establish the phases of the historical development of this tra dition. According to Tibetan historical tradition, the good system originated in  certain Indian Buddhist schools, the foremost being that of the Pacification of  Suffering, which was founded by Pha Dam pa Sangs rgyas, a Buddhist master  who lived between the end of the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth  centuries. Another important person in the line of transmission was the brahman  Aryadeva, who some texts identify as Pha Dam pa's uncle. This master is obviously  not the philosopher Aryadeva, the contemporary of Nagarjuna who played such  a major part in the formulation of Madhyamika thought; nor is he the Tantric  Aryadeva, disciple of the Tantric Nagarjuna who may have lived in the eighth or  ninth century. According to tradition, the brahman Aryadeva was the author of  a short text called the Teaching on the Perfection of Wisdom that is considered to  be the theorical basis of the good philosophy, which was translated into Tibetan  by different authors. A copy of one these versions is also preserved in the Peking  Tengyur (bstan 'gyur) (vol. 146, pp. 171-72).  

Giving up one's body was already a cherished topic of ancient Buddhism, as is  evident in certain stories of the Buddha's previous lives (jataka), including those  of the tiger and of the hare. In AryaSura's rendition of the jataka of the tiger, the  Buddha, before offering his body as food to a starving tigress that was on the  verge of eating her own cubs, uttered these words:  

This body of ours is devoid of life, fragile, insubstantial, the source of suffering,  unrewarding, always impure. He who is unwilling to offer it for the good of others  is foolish! Attachment to our own pleasure and the impossibility of alleviating our  suffering render us indifferent to others' suffering. However, why should I remain  indifferent to this suffering as long as it exists and as long as it is possible to alleviate  it? For if, having the opportunity to alleviate someone's suffering, even if he were the 

THE GOO D TRADITIO N 399  

greatest malefactor, I were to remain indifferent, then I would feel I had committed  a transgression and my mind would burn like dry twigs in a fire. So I will hurl myself  down from this cliff and kill my miserable body, so that the tiger will not have to  kill her cubs, so that these will not be set upon by their mother.  

The theoretical premises of the good yul system must be sought, however, in  the Buddhist Prajnaparamita literature, a corpus composed in India in successive  stages from the first century to the end of the first millennium C.E., and which  constitutes the foundation of Mahayana mysticism. In the Prajnaparamita tradi 

tion, the Perfection of Wisdom is depicted as a mother goddess, the mother of  all the buddhas and bodhisattvas. This element, which comes to be grafted onto  such a strongly patriarchal religion as ancient Buddhism, may reflect the cult of  the mother goddess that distinguished the matriarchal societies of the Dravidian  populations of south India. This literature ascribed great importance to prajna,  wisdom or gnosis. Etymologically, the words gnosis and prajna derive from the  same Indo-European stem, and many scholars have pointed out that the Prajna paramita literature shares certain elements with the religious and philosophical  traditions that derive from the Hellenistic mysticism that was developing during  the same period in the Mediterranean area.  

Like the Perfection of Wisdom, all of the various gnostic systems, both Christian  and pagan - Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, Neopythagoreanism, and Hebrew wis dom lore - are based on the principle that awakening can only take place through  an inner process of knowledge. This knowledge of ultimate reality, in contrapo sition to ignorance (avidya), can only arise from direct revelation. Moreover, just  as in Indian Mahayana Buddhism, so too in the gnostic traditions of the Medi terranean and the Near East, Wisdom is a magna mater, likened to ethereal space,  pure and immaculate as sunlight, who metes out divine ambrosia.  

In the Perfection of Wisdom literature, phenomenal reality is deemed a dream,  a mirage, a magical apparition, an illusion. It is only by generating prajna within  oneself that one can rend the veil of ignorance and see the ultimate nature of all  existence (dharmata). Thus, the concept arises of two truths - one provisional  and conventional, the other absolute and definitive. However, the dualism that  might appear to arise from this subdivision has already been surmounted in this  phase of Buddhism, since phenomenal reality, being devoid of self-existence, is  identical with the absolute truth. This truth, however, is ineffable, beyond the  imagination, without form or characteristics, and totally empty.  

Alongside emergent speculation on the notion of emptiness (sunyata), a new  ideal starts taking shape within the Greater Vehicle literature; this is the ideal of  the bodhisattva, who, like the Buddha, has perceived the supreme truth and yet  who renounces nirvana - the complete and definitive extinction of worldly suf 

fering, for the benefit of others - and chooses to continue taking birth in the cycle  of samsara in order to help others on their path towards liberation. This new ideal  of love for others is most clearly expressed in a work by the eighth-century Indian  mystic Santideva, the Bodhicaryavatara, ("The Bodhisattva's Conduct"), a treatise 

4 0 0 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

of great spiritual force on compassion and love, which analyzes the inner path of  the bodhisattva from the resolution to dedicate oneself to the good of others, to  the disciplines (mindfulness, patience, enthusiasm, meditation, etc.) that help to  maintain the pledge, up to the attainment of the actual capacity to benefit others.  From Santideva's text (8.129) we read:  

All the joy of this world  

derives from the wish for anothers' joy;  

all the suffering of this world  

derives from the wish for one's own joy.  

In these words we find already delineated the thought that underlies the good  system, in which, analogously, attachment to the ego is identified as the factor  that determines the suffering and ignorance proper to the human condition. Com passion (karuna) and awareness of emptiness are thus the fundamental principles  that underlie the religious literature of the Perfection of Wisdom, which is the  source of the good system. It should be noted, moreover, that at times in this  tradition the term good ("to sever") is replaced by spyod (pronounced in the same  way), which means "practice" or "spiritual exercise," which refers precisely to the  virtuous acts and practices of the Bodhisattva path.  

The Demons  

A significant feature of this system is a demonology of sorts, which comprises an  accurate analysis of the various demons (mara in Sanskrit; bdud in Tibetan) that  hinder awakening and hence must be uprooted and removed. The etymological  derivation of mara (which is also the symbol of the presence of evil in early  Buddhism) is the Sanskrit root mr-, "to die," whence mrtyu, "death." However,  whereas mrtyu indicates the act of death, mara stands for "he who causes death."  In Buddhist literature, both Pali and Sanskrit, Mara is the tempter, the offender,  who arouses sensual desire, and assails the Buddha to distract him from the  spiritual path. He is the demon who holds and binds men in chains, forcing them  to perpetuate a life that is under the power of death.  

We should take note, however, of the ambivalence of Mara's name. On the one  hand, it designates a popular god with his own place within the cosmology of  early Buddhism: leader of the Paranirmitavasavartin gods and lord of the realm  of desire; on the other hand, it reflects the etymological meaning of "he who  causes death," and Mara is thereby associated with everything that is deceptive,  transient, or that brings about spiritual death. These various aspects were sub 

sequently codified in the Greater Vehicle in the formula of the four maras. The  Mahaprajnaparamitasastra reads: "There are four kinds of mara: Mara of the ag gregates (skandha-mara), Mara of the mental afflictions (klesa-mara), Mara of death  (mrtyu-mara), and Mara, son of the deities (devaputra-mara). The metaphorical  function of the four maras in relation to spiritual death is explained in the follow-

THE GOOD TRADITION 401  

ing way in the Sravakabhumi of Asanga, the fifth-century Buddhist philosopher of  the idealist Cittamatra ('Mind Only') school: Skandha-mara corresponds to the  five aggregates that constitute the personality. Klesa-mara corresponds to the pas sions that range over the three worlds. Mrtyu-mara fixes the moment of death of  sentient beings. Devaputra-mara is the son of the gods, born in the realm of desire  and thus lord over it, who leads those who aspire to transcend the aggregates,  passions, and death astray from the practice of virtue." The personage of Mara is  also present in the Perfection of Wisdom literature. One of the most ancient texts  of this tradition, the Prajnaparamita-ratnagunasamcayagatha, "Stanzas on the Per fection of Wisdom, Heap of Precious Virtue," the original kernel of which prob 

ably dates back to the first century B.C.E., reads (27.447-49):  

If as many beings as there are in the fields - countless as the sands of the  Ganges - would all, let us assume, become maras;  

And if every single hair on their bodies would again magically create a snare, they  could all not hinder the Wise.  

For four reasons does the powerful and wise bodhisattva  

Becomes unassailable by the four maras:  

Because he dwells in the emptiness;  

Because he does not abandon other beings;  

Because he acts as he speaks;  

Because he is sustained by the Sugatas.  

In the Blue Annals, these verses are indicated as the foundation of the theory  and practice of the good system. The four principles listed therein: awareness of  emptiness, love for one's neighbor, observance of Bodhisattva conduct, and de votion to one's master and spiritual lineage constitute the pivots of the conduct  of good practitioners. In this system, however, the interpretation of the aspects of  Mara is developed still further. The four categories are multiplied, reflecting the  multifarious nature of Vajrayana esotericism, with a division of the symbol of evil  under two headings: "outer" and "inner." Later works add further subdivisions:  the "secret" and the "particular" maras.  

The outer maras correspond to those of Indian Mahayana literature, listed  above. The analysis of the four demons that we find in Ma gcig's work, on the  other hand, refers to the "inner" maras and subdivides them into "tangible," "in tangible," "of complacency," and "of pride." The tangible demons (thogs bcas kyi  bdud, literally, "demons that have obstructions") belong to visible reality and con sist of all the phenomena which, through sensory experience, arouse desire and  the thirst for possession in people, and enhance the sense of concreteness and of  the material reality of phenomena, the worst error according to Buddhist doctrine.  The intangible demons (thogs med kyi bdud, "demons that do not have obstruc tions") comprise purely mental events. They arise when the categories of good  and evil are separated in the mind and one distinguishes between what one wants  and what one rejects. This discrimination is the cause of the continuous alter nation between illusion and delusion that generates emotional instability and lack 

402 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

of awareness of ultimate reality. The demons of complacency (dga' brod kyi bdud)  comprise all those factors that lead to feeling complacent about results obtained  regarding philosophical knowledge and powers acquired through the practice of  yoga. In reality, these cause obstacles and block spiritual progress. The demons  of pride (snyems byed kyi bdud) give rise to haughtiness and arrogance. These are  the most important of the demons, as they give rise to all the others, because  attachment to the ego is deemed the first cause of the death of knowledge.  

Cutting off Mental Afflictions  

The theme of cutting off mental affliction was already known in earlier Buddhist  thought: It occurs in the Hinayana (Lesser Vehicle) school, as attested in Bud dhaghosa's Visudhimagga, which states that "relinquishment by means of cutting  off takes place in the one who cultivates the supermundane path leading to the  destruction of contaminations." According to the Blue Annals, the origin of the  term good ("cutting off) is found in the Abhidharmakosa, the summa of Sarvasti vadin-Vaibhasika thought compiled in the fifth century C.E. by the Indian phi losopher Vasubhandu:  

Now, why is this practice defined "the object that is to be cut off (good yul)? In  Vasubhandu's Abhidharmakosa (5.34) it says: "Mental afflictions originate: 1. from  habitual attachment (anusaya); 2. from the presence of external objects; and 3. from  erroneous mental acts." What have to be cut off are mental afflictions. If these afflic 

tions originate from attachment, from the presence of external objects, and from  erroneous mental acts, then as soon as the yogin comes into contact with an external  object and traces of past actions (vasanas) arise within him, he must cut off at the  root those afflictions [deriving] from objects that are based on erroneous mental acts.  This is the reason why this system is called "the object that is to be cut off (good  yul).  

Vajrayana Buddhism  

The Buddhist Tantras, which constitute the final phase of Indian Buddhist liter ature, constitute a highly complex religious phenomenon, in which Mahayana  thought coalesced with popular traditions and cults of ancient India to form a  mystical and gnostic system that was highly symbolical in character. It was called  the Diamond Vehicle or Vajrayana (from vajra, the "diamond" as symbol of the  perfect and immutable nature of ultimate reality), and the Mantra Vehicle or  Mantrayana (from mantra, the sacred formulas that were of crucial importance in  this system).  

The first promulgators of Vajrayana Buddhism, called Siddhas ("perfect ones"),  were yogins, mostly wanderers, living in various regions of India in the medieval  period. These ascetics - among them several women - who had absorbed the 

THE GOOD TRADITION 403  

classical Buddhist theses (the suffering of existence, the transient and fundamen tally empty nature of phenomena, and so on), elaborated a system that gave much  attention to the practice of yoga. Furthermore, they maintained that the passions  which characterize human nature, such as sexual desire, were no longer deemed  negative factors to be repressed; instead, the energy they provided constituted the  principal means of liberation from the fetters of existence.  

The behaviour of the Siddhas contravened the rules and conventions of the  Buddhist monastic communities and contemporary society. Like a kind of sacred  madness, their quest for ultimate truth and the fundamental identity of all phe nomena led them to wander far from towns and to live with outcastes, to eat meat  and other impure foods, to drink alcohol, and lie with women - without discrim inating. The teachings of the Tantras had a strongly esoteric and initiatory char acter, and the very words of the sacred texts were incomprehensible without the  associated initiation and a master's guidance.  

The spiritual heritage of Tantric Buddhism was readily received in Tibet. The  Tantras were translated into Tibetan, along with the earlier Buddhist literature,  in two successive phases, in the eighth and eleventh centuries. These translations  were then arranged and systematized in the Buddhist literary compilations called  Kangyur (bka' 'gyur), composed of texts that were considered to be the "word"  (bka) of the Buddha himself, and Tengyur (bstan 'gyur), the commentarial writ 

ings. These canons include thousands of works, and are of critical importance to  the history of Asian religion, inasmuch as within them are preserved numerous  texts, of which the Sanskrit originals no longer exist.  

To return to the origins of the good tradition, we read further in the Blue Annals  ('Gos lo tsa va, 870):  

"How can one assert that good is similar to the Tantras? Because it conforms to the  Hevajratantra.  

"Good meditation is meditation performed under a lonely tree, in a cemetery, at  night, in the places of the Terrible Mothers (matr, in Sanskrit; ma mo in Tibetan) or  in remote places" (Hevajratantra VI.6).  

Furthermore:  

"Having offered his body as a gift, he can start the practice" (Hevajratantra VI. 19);  and:  

"Whatever demon appears before him, even if it resembles Indra, he will not be  afraid, because he steps forward like a lion" (Hevajratantra VI.25).  

The three topics indicated in the Hevajratantra - the choice of terrifying places,  above all cemeteries; the ritual offering of one's body; and overcoming fear - are  of such importance in the good system as to be considered the fundamental rules  for practitioners of this religious system. The good pa (good practitioners) were  yogins who had given up the world and all social conventions to wander from  one cemetery to another, carefully selecting for their practice places that were  desolate and particularly fearful. cemeteries in Tibet were grim, uninhabited  places, where corpses were devoured by vultures and wild animals. The fear404 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

engendered by these places, frequented by ravenous beasts hunting for remains  of the cadavers, must have been great, especially at night.  

Like the other Tantric yogins, the good yogins wore ragged clothing, but were  recognizable by certain characteristic ritual good objects: a damaru, the two headed drum played in one hand, thereby enabling the yogin to dance with the  other hand free to accompany his chant with the rkang gling (a trumpet made  from a human or vulture's thigh bone, whose sound evoked demonic spirits); a  ritual bell; the skin of a predatory animal with the claws still intact, a symbol of  courage and power; a folding tent, his only shelter against bad weather and symbol  of his high aspirations; a trident, which also served to support his tent; a skull  (kapala) used as a bowl for his daily meal, a banner made of strips of tiger and  leopard skin; a braid of human hair; and a rectangular red hat. This attire was  somewhat reminiscent of the garb of the Kapalikas, the Saiva sect that took the  concepts of Hindu Tantra to extremes, and in which a very important religious  role was played by human skulls and bones.  

The Structure of the Good Practice  

The practice of good began with a sacred dance in which, to the rhythm of the  damaru and the sound of the rkang gling, the yogin visualized himself dancing  on his own ego and trampling his dualistic thoughts, fears, desires, and all the  fetters of samsara. He danced before the buddhas, the Tantric deities, and the  dakinis. These latter goddesses, already present as minor figures in the Indian  pantheon, acquired great importance in Vajrayana, where they were considered  to be the hypostases of the active energy that arises from wisdom; they were  depicted - as attested in the sacred art of Tibet - as female deities who had both  a peaceful and attractive, and a terrifying and disquieting mien. In Kahha's 800  to 850 C.E. Yogaratnamala, one of the few commentaries of the Hevajratantra  extant in Sanskrit, we read (2.3.3) that "dakini derives from the root dai, which  means to fly in the sky and which corresponds to the power (siddhi) of moving  anywhere in the sky." As a consequence, the Tibetans translated this word as  mkha' 'gro ma, "she who flies in space," ascribing a pivotal religious role to these  goddesses. In this case, "space" means the essential condition of reality, the pure  unconditioned state, the ground of all existence; flight in this dimension indicates  the dynamic capacity of transcendent wisdom to turn into action. As we read in  the lives of the saints and mystics of Tibet, however, the dakinis can, in addition  to belonging to metaphysical reality, also take on the form of flesh-and-blood  women, whose tasks it is to aid yogins and to spread and protect the doctrines.  

Good, elaborated by a woman, presided over by a female deity, with a ritual  charged with emotional force, became the dakini practice par excellence. The  Laughter of the Dakinis states:  

I, fearless yogin, practicing  

to unite samsara and nirvana, 

T HE GOO D TRADITIO N 405  

dancing on the deities and spirits of the ego,  

reduce to dust the discursive thought  

of transmigration  

that generates dualism.  

This dance is followed by the evocation of all kinds of gods and spirits, invited  to attend the ritual sacrifice of one's body. The good pa visualizes the transfor mation of his consciousness into a dakini, who cuts the head off his physical body  and then places the corpse inside the cranium, which stretches to cosmic pro portions. The corpse is subsequently transformed in accordance with the wishes  of the guests, multiplied infinitely, and offered to them as a gift. Then the offering  is divided into various categories: the white offering, in which the yogin visualizes  that his body is transformed into ambrosia to be consumed by the higher deities  and by the three jewels: the buddhas, devas, and dakinis; the multicoloured of fering, in which his body is transformed into all kinds of riches and material  goods and offered to the dharmapalas, the protector spirits of the Buddhist law;  the red offering, in which the dismembered flesh and blood are multiplied infi nitely to appease the demons and fierce spirits; and finally the black offering, in  which the officiant visualizes that all the errors and wrongdoings of the world are  absorbed into his body, which is then offered as a meal to the demons. These  offerings aim to satisfy all spirits, both higher and lower, in order to placate  negative impulses and to eliminate definitively the ills of the world.  

Having performed the sacrifice, the yogin, who has now transcended hope and  fear, is absorbed in absolute reality. This is the most solemn moment of the drama:  the gift of the teaching to all the evoked beings and to the entire world. Through  this gift, which encapsulates the ultimate meaning of the entire rite, redemption  for oneself and others is assured and supreme catharsis realized.  

The good practitioners are aware of the psychological significance of this ma cabre banquet. According to the texts, the deities (lha) evoked during the ritual  are the symbolic images of his desires and wishes while the evil spirits ('dre) are  nothing but projections of the practitioner's mind, embodiments of his disquiet  and fear. Offering one's body and dancing on one's ego represent the means of  eliminating discrimination between good and evil, between desire and aversion - the dichotomy that all Buddhist thought deems the root cause of all suffering. In  Ma gcig's Great Collection we read:  

Practicing good in terrifying places  

is like healing injuries  

wreaked by fire  

by cauterizing with fire.  

This teaching,  

which consists in stirring, cutting off,  

driving back, and subjugating [the demons]  

and which arouses strong sensations, is like  

healing through application of fire. 

406 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

In the good system, the horror the yogins seek by evoking demonic spirits in  terrifying places is a metaphor for the anguish and fears that characterize human  existence. These can only be eliminated by doing away with one's pride and  desires, which derive from attachment to oneself. The exacerbation of fear thus  becomes the method for definitively conquering fear itself. Ma gcig's text goes on  to explain the reason for choosing places that engender fear, and for the visuali zations of demonic spirits or other dreadful apparitions. All this is defined as the  necessary condition (pratyaya) for ripening the cause of liberation inherent in  every being:  

As the appearance of the conditions  

is like a weight getting heavier,  

one comes to understand that the secret method  

lies precisely in making the weight heavier.  

Unless all reality is made worse  

one cannot attain liberation  

by means of soothing and pleasing antidotes.  

Wander in grisly places and mountain retreats,  

do not let yourself get distracted  

by doctrines or books:  

no spiritual power can come from them.  

So, just get real experiences  

in horrid, desolate places.  

The Pre-Buddhist Elements  

The Buddhist elaboration of the theme and practice of good is grounded in mag icoreligious traditions and popular creeds in which archaic elements are easily  perceptible. For example, the good initiatory ritual often uses the expression  "opening the door of the sky" (nam mkha' sgo 'byed), which denotes ascension to  a state of transcendent consciousness. This same expression is also found in the  popular religion of Tibet, where it designates ascent into the celestial sphere by  means of the magic rainbow light cord (dmu). According to ancient narratives  about the epoch of the monarchy, the dmu cord was used by the early kings to  descend to earth and then reascend to heaven after their death. To this day, this  term refers to the center of a house or tent, above which a hole is made to allow  daylight and smoke from the hearth to pass. The dmu cord is the symbol of  communication between earth and sky: this word is also found in divinatory rites,  in which it connotes the "cord for ascending to the sky," as well as in other popular  apotropaic rituals.  

Moreover, it should be noted that in terms of the dramatic intensity of the ritual  procedure, the good practices of dismembering and offering the body to the spirits  recall the initiatory dismemberment of the future shaman by demons and the 

THE GOOD TRADITION 40 7  

souls of his ancestors, found among Siberian and Central Asian as well as North  and South American, African, and Indonesian peoples.  

Apart from ritual dismemberment, which partakes of the universal phenome non of death and resurrection found in many archaic traditions, it is possible to  discern other significant elements in the good system that evince traces of sha manism, such as the important ritual function of the sound of the thighbone  trumpet and the drum as instruments serving to contact "the spirit world." More over, it should be noted that the good pa, like the shamans in nearby Buryatia,  serve a particular role in Tibetan society by virtue of their position as exorcists of  the possessed and healers of illnesses - such as plague or other epidemic dis eases - that are popularly believed to be caused by demonic spirits. In Tibet there  was great fear of epidemics, both of humans and livestock, because they presented  a serious threat to the local, and particularly the nomad, economy. On these  occasions, the only persons authorized to touch the dead were the good pa, who  were summoned even from afar to perform the funerary and purificatory rites.  According to tradition, the good practitioner has transcended all forms of fear, as  he has overcome all dualistic considerations created by the ordinary mind con cerning good and bad, pure and impure, and so on. In this way he cannot be  assailed by demons and fierce spirits, and acquires the power to subjugate them  and to heal the diseases they inflict.  

Ma gcig Lab sgron between History and Myth  

According to her biographers, Ma gcig lab sgron was born in the region of E'i Lab  southwest Tibet in the middle of the eleventh century, during a period of great  religious and cultural ferment. Born into a Buddhist family, and bearing all the  signs that indicate an extraordinary birth, she displayed an early inclination to  study the sacred scriptures. From the time she was a child, she had the oppor 

tunity of assimilating the basic principles of Buddhist thought, in particular those  found in the Perfection of Wisdom texts, of which she was an expert reader.  Already at the age of ten she could read four volumes a day, six times faster than  other experts, and so she was called Lab sgron, the "Light of the Lab region,"  because of the knowledge and wisdom she was soon able to display.  

Orphaned at the death of her mother, she became a reader in the monastery  of Lama A ston. However, the disciple soon surpassed her master and, as he had  nothing more to teach her, he sent her to one of the major lamas of the time, the  famous gter ston Grwa pa Mngon shes, the discoverer of the Four Tibetan Medical  Tantras. For four years Ma gcig remained with this master of the ancient tradition,  who taught her the Prajiiaparamita teachings in depth. Subsequently, she received  teachings from Lama Bsod nams Grags pa, who initiated her into the esoteric  meanings of the doctrines. The hagiographies of Ma gcig recount that thanks to  these teachings she had a deep intuition of the Prajnaparamita; she was especially  struck by the chapter on demons (mara), and through this experience she stabi-

408 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

lized her knowledge and was liberated from the dualism of samsara. This episode  can be interpreted as the first acknowledgement by her Tibetan biographers of  Ma gcig's independence of religious thought, which was then subsumed and or ganized in the good system. Due to her awakening, Ma gcig utterly abandoned  worldly conventions, threw away her clothes, donned rags, and went to live with  lepers and outcasts.  

Subsequently, the yogini completed her religious training, receiving instruction  from several masters of the various Buddhist schools. According to tradition, the  most significant spiritual encounter of her life was with Pha Dam pa Sangs rgyas,  the Indian Mahasiddha who introduced the religious tradition known as sdug  bsngal zhi byed (The Pacification of Suffering) into Tibet. His teachings were  aimed at liberating humans from every form of suffering through the process of  the gradual elimination of all attachments and passions. Pha Dam pa is still very  popular in Tibet, especially in such areas as the Ding ri Valley in the southwest  of the country, not far from the Nepal border, where he plays a significant role  in connection with the the local folklore and cult of sacred rocks. He was famous  for both his great yogic capacity and his iconoclasm: in fact he destroyed all the  depictions of deities that he found, deeming them sources of delusion. He used  to exhort his disciples to consider ritual ceremonies and philosophical disserta tions as a kind of attachment, and would advise them to leave their monasteries  to go practice in the solitude of forests or mountain hermitages. According to one  of her biographers, Pha Dam pa immediately entrusted Ma gcig with his spiritual  testament, telling her, "Accept what disgusts you. Help those it seems impossible  to help. Give up all the things you desire. Go to frightening places such as cem eteries. Always remain vigilant and aware. Find the Buddha within yourself."  According to certain accounts, this first encounter took place in Ma gcig's youth,  although it was only subsequently, when she was an adult, that the yogini received  the various initiations of sdug bsngal zhi byed and good from the siddha. How ever, recent studies have cast doubts on the centrality and importance ascribed  by the Tibetans to Pha Dam pa in the constitution of the good system.  

All of her biographers tend to highlight the autonomy of Ma gcig's religious  inspiration. An episode - recounted in the Blue Annals and told in greater detail  in one of her biographies (Rnam bshad, 35-38) - which occurred during the  initiation of the Tantric cycle of Mahamaya (sgyu 'phrul chen mo) conferred by  Skyo ston Bsod nams bla ma, will serve as an example. We examine here the  account drawn from the Rnam bshad, as it contains an abundance of symbolic  details.  

The initiation rite had been celebrated during the night, and when at dawn the  lama was preparing to commence the most important phase of the ceremony, in  which he conferred the Wisdom initiation, Ma gcig had a direct intuition of the  teachings and suddenly withdrew from the temple. The yogini, who had entered  a deep contemplative state, rose into the air, dancing the sacred dances of the  peaceful goddesses, and teaching in Sanskrit. When she had finished the dance,  she alighted on a tree that was near a lake inhabited by a terrible and much feared 

THE GOO D TRADITIO N 409  

snake (naga). Ma gcig, who felt no fear of that demonic being, remained in deep  meditation for a long time. Both angered and intimidated by the yogini's presence,  the demon called a throng of other demons and spirits who assailed her, seeking  to terrify her, but the saint did not let herself be frightened by those monstrous  beings and instead offered them her body. The Rnam bshad biography recounts  that the demons could not harm her because they had not found any form of ego  in her to attack. After she had conquered the demons, all the divine manifestations  of the Mahamayatantra and the Cakrasamvara, all the buddhas of the ten direc 

tions, as well as the goddess Aryatara herself came and conferred on Ma gcig the  four Tantric initiations and numerous other spiritual instructions. Then Aryatara  predicted: "Yogini, you will help all sentient beings and will practice in the 108  cemeteries and terrifying places. Your teachings will shine like the sun high in  the sky and your disciples will attain the knowledge from which there is no  turning back."  

As soon as day broke, the lama and the others participating in the rite went  looking for Ma gcig. They found her sitting in the tree, naked and free from all  worldly misery. Descending from the branches, she prostrated before the lama,  saying: "Those who prostrate sincerely before their master will be purified of all  obstacles caused by their past deeds!" The other participants in the initiation then  accused her of having interrupted the consecration, but the master said that,  whereas they had all only received the initiation of the word (tshig dbang), Ma  gcig had been the only one to receive the initiation of the deep meaning (don  dbang).  

An examination of the allegorical elements in this brief episode enable us to  comprehend Ma gcig's unique place in the Tibetan tradition. The central theme  is that of her spiritual autonomy. Ma gcig is directly inspired by transcendent  reality: she withdraws alone from the temple, hovers magically in space, dances  the sacred dances, and teaches in the original language of the Tantras. These  extraordinary elements mark the authority the Tibetans have ascribed to her. Her  awakening is perfectly depicted in the image of the saint on top of the tree,  dominating the snake with the power of meditation. To Ma gcig are ascribed the  requisites for the founder of a new school. Furthermore, the religious ideal un derlying the doctrine of good - whose core practice is the meditation on offering  one's body - is actualized in the image of Ma gcig offering her body to the de 

mons, by which she exorcizes herself of all possibility of harm. Finally, the ini tiations directly conferred by the divine manifestations, Aryatara's auspicious  prophecy concerning the yogini's religious tradition, and the master's confirma tion of the authenticity of her spiritual inspiration, all assert the undisputed au 

thority the Tibetans ascribe to Ma gcig as the founder of a religious tradition.  The latter part of her saintly life is marked by her encounter with Thod pa  Bhadra (Sanskrit Kapalabhadra), an Indian yogin from Kosala. After having re ceived certain auspicious omens, Ma gcig married him and they had several chil dren. Some biographies relate that Ma gcig was harshly criticized for renouncing  her monastic vows and was given the name 'bka log ma ("the renegade"). The 

410 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

couple visited various pilgrimage sites in Tibet over a long period, but after twelve  years Ma gcig decided to give up family life to return to her Buddhist masters  and resume a lifestyle entirely devoted to spiritual practice. In Ding ri she met  Pha Dam pa again, who gave her further teachings on the Perfection of Wisdom  and yoga. Then the yogini resumed her pilgrimage, and following her master's  instructions, she practiced in 108 cemeteries and holy places. She then went to  Zangs ri khang dmar, where she went into retreat until her death, at the age of  ninety-five.  

In the last years of her life, Ma gcig taught numerous disciples, especially her  own children, who played a prominent part in the continuation of the good  tradition in Tibet. The lineages of transmission reported in the various historical  treatises are somewhat complex, and the names vary according to the different  authors. They are subdivided, along the same classificatory lines as the Tantras,  into a male-paternal or method (upaya) lineage and a female-maternal or wisdom  (prajna) lineage. These genealogical trees of the tradition include a variety of  individuals. All of them, however, mention the Indian yogins Aryadeva and Pha  Dam pa at the beginning of the lineage, prior to Ma gcig. There is another trans mission lineage, called "esoteric" in some hagiographies and "direct" or "very  direct" in others, in which the transmission of the good doctrines passes unme 

diated from the goddess Tara to Ma gcig. This transmission lineage suggests the  desire, already visible in her various biographies, to recognize Ma gcig as the  originator of an autonomous religious system. In fact, the idea is fairly widespread  that it was only with Ma gcig that this tradition began to be defined as good.  

Also noteworthy is an episode that occurred in the final years of Ma gcig's life,  and is recounted in most of her hagiographies and in several texts on the history  of the good tradition. One day when Ma gcig was already in retreat in Zangs ri,  three learned Indian scholars from Varanasi came to visit her. The pandits had  heard about the yogini's teaching and had reservations about a Buddhist tradition  that did not come from India. So they asked Ma gcig whether they could challenge  her in philosophical debate, as was customary at the time among exponents of  the different Buddhist schools. Ma gcig did not hesitate, and started to debate  with the scholars in Sanskrit, astonishing them with her wisdom and great doc trinal learning. The pandits were thus forced to concede the yogini's supremacy  and to acknowledge her as the manifestation of the Great Mother, Prajnaparamita,  in person. From that moment the good teaching spread throughout Tibet and,  crossing the Himalayan frontiers, spread rapidly in India as well. According to  tradition, this was the first Buddhist teaching originating in Tibet to be promul gated in the Indian subcontinent. We cannot ascertain how much truth lies in  this belief, which is handed down to this day among Tibetan lamas; however, it  betokens the importance ascribed in Tibet to the good tradition and its foremost  promulgator.

The Great Collection of the Teachings on the Noble Practice of  Severing the Demons, Perfection of Wisdom  

Praise to that unconditioned state  

which transcends objective considerations,  

the pure, inexpressible,  

unimaginable condition  

that goes beyond any thought.  

I have written down  

this Collection of the Teachings  

on severing the demons  

thinking that someone, someday  

may benefit from it. 

THE GOO D TRADITIO N 413  

The root of all demons is one's own mind.  

If one feels attraction and desire  

in the perception of any phenomenon,  

one is captured by the demons.  

When the mind grasps at phenomena  

as if they were external objects  

one becomes contaminated.  

The demons are divided into four categories:  

the tangible demons  

(whose basis is external objects)  

the intangible demons  

(whose basis is mental images)  

the demons of complacency  

(whose basis is the desire for obtainment) and  

the demons of pride  

(whose basis is dualistic discrimination).  

The tangible demons are numerous:  

when phenomena appear  

before the sense organs,  

if one discriminates between  

what one desires and what one rejects  

the tangible demons arise.  

In this way, perceiving phenomena as concrete,  

one is chained to the wheel of existence.  

As form is empty in its nature,  

do not feel attachment to it  

but meditate on the emptiness.  

If one feels no attachment to form,  

one is liberated from the demon of eternalism.  

If one does not conceptualize emptiness  

one is liberated from the demon of nihilism.  

The manifestation of visible phenomena  

can not be impeded,  

but if they are not considered as concrete  

one's vision manifests as light.  

In this way one is liberated from sight, sounds,  

tastes, odors, touch, and the mind.  

The mind itself is the intangible demon.  

On the other hand, if it arises through the door of the five senses,  it is defined the tangible demon.  

Phenomena that appear to the sense organs  

are instantaneously interrupted  

in the state of spontaneous liberation414 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

and are transformed in the great  

essential dimension of reality.  

The way in which the intangible demon manifests:  

In that discriminating thought of good and evil  

which arises in one's own mind when phenomena appear  

is defined the intangible demon.  

If one separates oneself from the natural  

and spontaneous state of the mind  

and clings to the idea of benevolent gods and evil spirits,  

because of the oscillation between hope and fear  

one's own demon manifests in oneself.  

From the clear and immense space  

of the essential dimension of reality,  

thought and memories arise in all directions  

just as ripples and waves arise  

on the immutable ocean.  

Whoever has this understanding  

has no need of contrivances  

and naturally remains in his own condition.  

One liberates oneself in the space in which  

neither benefit nor harm is born.  

As wisdom arises spontaneously  

from the space of essential reality,  

it is not necessary to nurture jealousy,  

aversion, or affection.  

If one feels no aversion or affection  

the spontaneous mind becomes manifest.  

The way in which the demons of complacency arise:  

The ordinary demons and the superior ones  

arise from illusory mind.  

If, practicing in horrifying places,  

one is not disturbed by the evil spirits  

self-satisfaction is born in oneself:  

this is the demon of complacency.  

When the signs of spiritual power appear - 

merits and material wealth - 

the demons of distraction arise.  

Glory, fame, happiness,  

friends, and enemies  

are the demons of complacency.  

When gods and spirits confer their magical power,  

and one is surrounded by sons and faithful friends 

T HE GOO D TRADITIO N 415  

getting pleasure and satisfaction,  

the demons of complacency arise.  

Whichever virtue one achieves  

with mind empty of dualism  

between subject and object,  

do not grasp at it  

as if it were concrete.  

Act naturally without any attachment  

to the nature of virtues,  

considering them as the objects of dreams.  

Like a beautiful woman  

with ornaments who makes herself  

even more beautiful,  

anything that arises  

is as an ornament  

of one's own condition.  

There is no reason for vanity  

but if it arises one is contaminated  

by the various categories of illusion.  

May this noble conduct  

of remaining in one's own natural state  

without attachment to phenomena  

be kept in secret in the very heart  

of those who know!  

Because all things are the spontaneous mind,  

he who meditates has nothing to meditate.  

Let any perception which manifests spontaneously  

be left in its natural condition  

of union, clarity, and splendor.  

Because the meaning is immutable  

it is unified,  

because one gets real understanding  

it is clear,  

because one is liberated in one's own condition  

it is resplendent.  

Thus just as butter freely remains in butter,  

this contemplation without meditation  

is the supreme meditation.  

If one abandons oneself  

and seeks externally,  

even if one practices for ten million eons,  

he will have no obtainment. 

416 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

Seek nothing, undertake nothing,  

remain freely in the nature of essential reality.  

Not having any hope is the supreme practice  

of cutting off the demons.  

Without the limitation of human hopes and fears,  

if one cuts the rope of attachment,  

where is the Buddha, in reality?  

Although they are divided into four categories,  

all demons are included in the demons of pride.  

Just as the lion on the high snowy peaks has no fear,  

if one eliminates ego-clinging,  

confidence will develop  

and one will not fluctuate  

between the gods and the evil spirit of existence.  

Even if hundreds of them rise up  

the doctrines will shine upon them.  

If they can be recognized as one's own projection  

one will proceed with great dexterity.  

Eliminating the flow of thoughts  

and not undertaking any meditation,  

it is sufficient to obtain a profound insight of inner wisdom  that bursts out strong and spontaneous  

like an epidemic.  

This practice of severing the demons  

which arises from the profound insight  

that there is no root  

is the supreme teaching of all!  

Emaho\ Marvelous!  

Eliminating one's own pride and ego-clinging  

one pacifies the demons!  

Having a profound insight that there is no root  

one obtains the real state of complete awakening!  

So be at ease in a free condition  

and let everything be, in its own natural state. 

### 24 Worship of Bell-Ears the Great Hero, a Jain Tantric Deity  

John E. Cort  

Tantra in Jainism has two distinctive features: it is largely centered around the  use of verbal spells or mantra, and Jain Tantric practices are aimed at improving  one's condition within the realm of rebirth rather than liberating one from rebirth.  Although Jain Tantric rites, such as that given in the second text below, also  involve the use of diagrams known as yantras, these play a subsidiary role com 

pared to the mantras, and most yantras have the ritual mantra written on them.  Mantras are used directly to effect desired results, and to call on nonliberated  deities to effect those results. Jain Tantric rites rarely involve any elaborate form  of meditation or visualization; usually the simple repetition of the mantra suffices.  Some Tantric rituals invoke the central cultic figures of the tradition, the twenty 

four Jinas or tlrthahkaras, the enlightened and liberated souls who showed the  path to liberation. More often, though, the rituals invoke other figures, such as  the wonder-working monk Gautama in the Svetambara ("White-Robed") tradi tion, various goddesses in both the Svetambara and Digambara ("Sky-Clad") tra ditions, and male figures such as Ghantakarna Mahavira and Nakoda Bhairava in  the Svetambara tradition.  

According to Jain theology, however, none of these beings has the power to  grant liberation. The Jinas are inactive icons of the liberated state; the other deities,  although active in the world, are themselves unliberated, and so cannot give what  they themselves have not attained. As a result, most Jain Tantric rituals are aimed  at accomplishing a variety of goals in this world, such as health, wealth, and  power. The texts translated below are a veritable catalogue of these worldly goals.  Many Jain Tantric texts and rituals categorize these goals within the framework  of the "six actions" (satkarmani) of pan-Indian Tantra. What is not found in Jain  Tantra is the development of a full-scale alternative Tantric path to liberation such  as is found in some Hindu and Buddhist Tantric schools.  

The cult of Ghantakarna Mahavira, "Bell-Ears the Great Hero," exemplifies these 

418 JOH N E. CORT  

two distinctive features of Jain Tantra. (This Mahavira should not be confused  with Vardhamana Mahavira, the twenty-fourth and final tirthahkara of this era).  The worship of Bell-Ears is found exclusively among Svetambara Murtipiljaka  Jains, and in particular is special to one mendicant lineage, the Tapa Gaccha. He  is one of the fifty-two viras or "heroes," a class of powerful male deities who  protect faithful Jains and defeat enemies of the Jain community. Bell-Ears is de 

scribed as a fellow Jain, and so is dangerous only to the opponents of Jainism.  The traditional Sanskrit texts of the cult are the seventy-one-verse Ghantdkarna  Mantra Stotra, (a hymn that is also considered to be a mantra), and several Ghan takarna Mantras. The hymn was composed sometime in the latter half of the  sixteenth century by an otherwise unknown monk named Vimalacandra, who  was a disciple of Sakalacandra, who in turn was a disciple of the great leader of  the Tapa Gaccha, Hiravijayasuri (1527-1595).  

These mantras were used in a variety of Tantric rituals performed over long  periods of time, by which the practitioner gained the allegiance of Bell-Ears and  so was able to gain the worldly powers associated with this deity. The nature of  these worldly powers, which ranged from cures for diseases and increasing one's  material wealth to defeating and even slaying foes of the Jain community, show  clearly that Jainism is as much about how to live successfully in the world as it  is about ascetic practices to liberate oneself from the world. The inclusion of  marana or killing foes in the list of Jain Tantric goals - although many Jain Tantric  texts exclude it - also shows that the Jain ethical injunction of ahimsa or non harm does not result in Jains being strict pacifists, as ahimsa is more applicable  in the sphere of dietary practices than in the sphere of relations among states and  religious communities.  

For many centuries, the worship of Bell-Ears was a largely private aspect of  Jain practice, performed within certain monastic lineages, and possibly by some  laymen as well. Vimalacandra (verse 67) claims that this worship dates to the  time of the great Haribhadrasuri (c. sixth to eighth century), although there is no  other evidence to corroborate this. The nature of the transmission of the cult from  teacher to disciple is seen in the third text below, which describes the initiation  of Buddhisagarsuri (1874-1925) into the cult in the late nineteenth century. For  several decades, Buddhisagarsuri's practice was firmly within this largely esoteric  tradition. The texts translated here also indicate ways in which this Jain esoteric  tradition shared many practices and concepts with the pan-Indian yogic and Tan tric streams of religious expression, while giving them a distinctly Jain flavor.  

Buddhisagarasuri effected an important change in the cult after his direct ex perience of Bell-Ears, when he established an anthropomorphic image of the deity  in a small shrine attached to the Jain temple at Mahudi in northern Gujarat. This  is the first known three-dimensional anthropomorphic image of Bell-Ears; pre viously he had been worshiped only in the forms of abstract and anthropomorphic  yantras. Toward the end of his life, Buddhisagarsuri was responsible for convert ing the cult into a highly public one. In part, Buddhisagarsuri's goal was to create 

WORSHI P O F BELL-EARS 419  

a way for Jains to perform rituals aimed at worldly goals and still be good Jains.  According to Jain theology, the Jinas cannot respond in anyway to ritual petitions,  and so it is considered inappropriate and fruitless to worship the Jinas for worldly  ends. Worship of non-Jain deities is fraught with danger, especially as such wor 

ship in the early twentieth century frequently involved sacrificing animals. Bud dhisagarsuri arranged for the construction of a much larger temple at Mahudi,  and wrote several hymns and rituals for the worship of Bell-Ears, including the  one translated as the fourth text below. In line with the transformation of the cult  from an esoteric one followed by initiated adepts into a public one followed by  hundreds of thousands of Jains, we also see in this text a reformulation of the  worship of Bell-Ears along more devotional (bhakti) lines than traditional Tantric  ones. Such interaction between Tantra and devotion has long been a feature of  all South Asian religious traditions.  

The shrine of Bell-Ears at Mahudi is now one of the most popular Jain shrines  in all India. It is visited by hundreds of thousands of pilgrims every year, who  come to offer Bell-Ears his favorite food, a sweet dish known as sukhadi, in return  for his assistance in their lives. In particular, tens of thousands of people come  for the special worship of Bell-Ears on the day before Divali, the autumnal festival  of lights that also marks the New Year according to the western Indian calendar.  The worship of Bell-Ears is therefore an important aspect of insuring that any  possible malevolent influences from the previous year are negated, so that one  can start the new year with an auspiciously clean slate. Images of Bell-Ears are  also found in a growing number of Jain temples throughout western India.  

The Sanskrit Ghantakarna Mantra Stotra is found in Acarya Buddhisagarsuri,  Mangal Puja (Sanand: Sri Sanand Sagargacch Jnan Khata, 1953; originally pub lished ca. 1922), pp. 33-71; Acarya Buddhisagarsuri, Sri Ghantakarn MahavirDev  (Mahudi: Sri Mahudi Jain Svetambar Karkhana Trust, 1983-1984; originally pub lished 1924), pp. 69-74; Sarabhai Navab and Muni Candrodayvijay, eds., Ghan

The Gujarati Ghantakarn Kalp is here translated from Navab and Candroday vijay, pp. 12-19; a similar version of the rite in Hindi is found in Chandanmal  Nagori, ed., Ghantakarn Kalp (Choti Sadri: Candanmal Nagori Jain Pustakalay,  1951). The anthropomorphic yantra of Ghantakarna Mahavira (Figure 24.1) is  illustration 10 in Navab and Candrodayvijay. The Gujarati narration by Muni  Candrodayvijay of Buddhisagarsuri's initiation is from Navab and Candrodayvijay,  pp. 33-36. The Gujarati Worship of Ghantakarn is from Buddhisagarsuri, Mangal  Puja, pp. 18-26; and Buddhisagarsuri, Sri Ghantakarn Mahdvir, pp. 56-62.I have  used different spelling systems to indicate the differing pronunciations in Sanskrit  and Gujarati, especially where the latter does not pronounce the final short -a of  most words.

2. Ghantakarn Kalp  

[Sanskrit invocation:] I bow to Ganesa, the giver of wealth and success, and  beloved son of the mountain-born Parvati. Now I tell the kalpa of Bell-Ears,  which removes enemies and troubles.  

The best times for auspicious actions are an auspicious month, the bright  fortnight, and the fifth, tenth, and full moon in that fortnight. The auspicious  days and conjunctions are Sunday in the Hasta lunar mansion, Sunday in the  Mula lunar mansion, and Sunday in the Pusya lunar mansion. The best days  for killing (marana) and causing to flee (uccatana) are the eighth, fourteenth,  and new moon in the dark fortnight. The best conjunctions are Siddhi, Amr 

tasiddhi, Ananda, Srivaccha, and Chatra. Before commencing, you should con sider the auspicious omens and the power of the lunar position in the horo scope for the performance of the mantsa.  

The performance should be in a pure building, the walls of which have been424 JOHN E. CORT  

attractively washed and rubbed with cow dung, or in a pure forest, in a garden,  on the banks of a river, in a temple, or else in your residence. The mantra for  purifying the earth is: "Om hrim srim I bow to the earth deity." Recite this  mantra seven times while offering incense, lamp, and whole rice.  

The mantra for bathing is: "Om hrim klim I bow to Ganges water." Recite  this mantra seven times while bathing. The mantra for donning clothing is:  "Om hrim klim I bow to the bliss deity." Recite this mantra while donning pure  clothing.  

For a pure rite, meditate using the Bell-Ears mantra:  

Om Bell-Ears Great Hero, destroyer of all ailments. Protect, protect those in  mighty fear of boils, Greatly Strong. Wherever you stand, O god, diseases and  gout are destroyed by the written lines of letters [of your yantra]. Instantly  from the recitation in the ear there is no fear of kings. Witches, ghosts, vam 

pires, and demons do not arise. There is no untimely death, nor are snakes  seen, nor is there fear of fire or thieves, hrim Bell-Ears. Homage to you thah  thah thah svaha.  

Recite this mantra 33,000 times over forty-two days. After that, recite it daily  108 times each at dawn, midday, and dusk. If you accompany the recitation  by offering black pepper and mustard seeds into a sacrificial fire, there will be  no fear of hostile deities. If you fear enemies, then offer a mixture of curds,  milk, ghee, saffron, and bdellium gum resin into the sacrificial fire, and estab 

lish an anthropomorphic yantra (Figure 24.1). This will destroy fear of ene mies.  

THE RITE OF THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC YANTRA  

On the stomach of a human figure make twelve sections, and in them write  the twelve-syllabled mantra Om hrim srim klim sarvadusta nasanebhyah [Om  hrim srim klim for the destruction of all malevolence]. On the throat of the  figure write sri namah [obeisance to wellbeing], on the right hand sarva hrim  noma [obeisance to all], on the left hand satrunasane namah [obeisance to the  destruction of foes], on the right foot ram rim rum namah, and on the left foot  hvam hvim hum namah. Write the Bell-Ears Mantra around the border of the  figure.  

Offer grain, lime paste, a coconut, and raisins into a sacrificial fire. Offer to  the yantra vermillion powder, and make a ring from cotton thread spun by a  young girl. You will be freed of fear of hostile deities, enemies, and kings, and  your fame will increase.  

Here is another ritual with this yantra. On the day of Divali, eat a single meal  of rice pudding, set up an unextinguished lamp of ghee, light ten-scented in cense, and recite the mantra 12,000 times. Lie on the ground as if dead. After  the recitations, make an offering into the sacrificial fire of the five nectars [milk,  curds, ghee, honey, sugar], and you will see the form of your success in a dream.

The text then gives instructions for rituals for specific goals, including obtain ing wealth, gaining control over others, killing, causing victims to flee, elimi nating ignorance, and preventing miscarriage. Two of these are given here as  examples.  

THE METHOD FOR OBTAINING WEALTH (LAKSMI)  

Recite the Bell-Ears mantra. Make a six-cornered yantra. In its six corners write  Om hlim hvim hum hlom namah. Write the Bell-Ears Mantra around the border.  Perform the following rite. To obtain wealth sit facing the west, wearing white 

426 JOHN E. CORT  

cloth, holding a white rosary, seated on a white cloth. With mind, speech, and  body in single-pointed attention, recite the mantra 125,000 times in seventy two days. While reciting eat once per day, and eat something made with wheat.  Offer into a sacrificial fire raisins, dried caroli fruit, almonds, and coconut.  Throughout offer incense, lamps, and food to the yantra. It is certain that after  six months you will obtain wealth. From maintaining the yantra you will obtain  all sorts of pleasure.  

THE METHOD FOR SUBJUGATING OTHERS (VASIKARANA)  

Recite the Bell-Ears mantra while seated facing north, wearing red cloth, hold ing a red rosary, and seated on a red cloth. Recite the mantra thrice daily (dawn,  midday, dusk) for a total of 225,000 times within forty-two days. Establish a  four-cornered yantra. Throughout this time offer incense, lamp, and food to  it. Offer into a sacrificial fire red sandalwood, pepper, and ghee. While making  the offerings, say the name of the deity whom you wish to subjugate. This can  be used either to imprison someone or free someone from prison. For this you  need to establish a yantra of 132 squares.  

Sanskrit colophon:  

1. Whoever reads this in a spirit of devotion, and hears the mantra-bells in his  ear, will have no obstacles and so be successful in the three worlds.  

2. I have made thousands of mistakes: forgive me for all of them, god, be  merciful, O Supreme Lord.  

3. For what I have not known in the invocation, for what I have not known  in the dismissal, and for what I have not known in the worship: forgive them,  O Supreme Lord.  

4. For whatever has been deficient in my instructions, actions, and mantras:  lor give me for all them, O god, be merciful, O Supreme Lord.  

3. Buddhisagar's Initiation and Direct Vision of Ghantakarn  

It was Thursday, the eleventh of the bright half of the month of Fagan, in the  year v.s. 1954 [late February 1898 C.E.]. On that day in Vijapur, Ravisagar  decided to give the siddhamantra [mantra of success] of Bell-Ears, which was  in his mendicant lineage, to the young yogin Buddhisagar, who was his grand 

disciple, and who was both most fortunate and firm in his practice. The practice  of constantly remembering this siddhamantra had come down in the lineage,  and by it those illustrious men had been saved from harassment by animals  and undesirable elements. But there had been no direct vision of the hero Bell 

Ears, the presiding deity of the mantra, for two or three generations in the 

WORSHI P O F BELL-EARS 427  

lineage. Ravisagar saw in the young Buddhisagar the power to generate a direct  vision.  

As preparation for the initiation into the mantra, Ravisagar had instructed  Buddhisagar to consume only mung beans, rice, and water for one day, and to  maintain complete silence until midnight of the second day. At midnight on  the second day, Buddhisagar sat before Ravisagar . Ravisagar twice repeated  into his ear the nineteen-syllable mantra that had been passed down in the  lineage: Om hrim aim klim ghantakarna namostu mama karyani sidhyantu [Om  hrim aim klim praise to Bell-Ears may my actions be successful]. Then Ravisagar  used his right hand to rub vasksep [sandalwood powder that has been charged  by reciting a mantra over it] on the middle of Buddhisagar's brahmarandra  [crown of the head, from which spiritual energy can flow forth], and by press ing his hand gave saktipat [establishment of yogic power]. An awareness awoke  in Buddhisagar's entire body, and his six cakras [centers of yogic energy]  opened. Then for three days Buddhisagar followed his teacher's instructions  and recited the mantra.  

On the first day of the recitation, Buddhisagar saw wheels of unlimited light,  star disks, and minute points in his ajna cakra [point between the eyebrows].  Then the points gradually opened up and became glowing lamps. The light of  the lamps came together in his forehead. In this light for a brief time he saw  the dim form of a black figure. On the second day, he became absorbed in an  indescribable bliss, and his ajna cakra glittered with a shining light. All six  cakras opened. All his kundalis [circles at the six cakras through which the  yogic power travels] were awake. His entire body experienced an unprece dented and stimulating sensation. On the third day, he had the same experi 

ence. In three days he recited the mantra 27,000 times. Mantra-consciousness  was awake throughout his body.  

After the three days, Ravisagar instructed Buddhisagar to incorporate this  supreme mantra in his life, and to give mantra initiation to those among his  followers who were suitable to recite it. Then he instructed Buddhisagar to sit  in one place and recite the mantra. Buddhisagar commenced the recitation,  reciting in his mind for eight hours every day. After nine months he had fin 

ished 1,800,000 recitations. When he had finished 800,000, mantra-conscious ness awoke in him. After 1,000,000, he gained the power over dreams, after  1,400,000 he gained the ability to tell the future, and after 1,800,000 he gained  the power to untangle problems and ward off misfortune.  

After he had finished the 1,800,000 recitations, Buddhisagar made a state ment of intention, in accordance with the science of mantra, to have a direct  vision of his chosen deity. He obtained Ravisagar 's consent, and decided to to  go to Mahudi and there have a sacrifice performed by five laymen who were  dispassionate, faithful, and who daily recited the Navkar mantra [mantra to  the Jain spiritual hierarchy]. He instructed the five laymen that until the sac rifice was completed they had to maintain complete celibacy, renounce all  anger and wrong actions, and every day recite at least five cycles of 108 reci-

4 2 8 JOHN E. CORT  

tations each of the Navkar mantra. For the sacrifice they had to wear white,  red, yellow, blue, and tan clothes. As an introduction to the sacrifice, Ravisagar  recited the Bell-Ears mantra.  

On the day before the sacrifice, the sacrificial ground was prepared by wor shiping it at 4:00 A.M. in front of four young girls. Each girl held in her hands  a coconut, some sukhadi, and eleven and one-quarter rupees. The Ghantakarna  Mantra Stotra [Text 1] was recited three times. As the laymen offered the  coconut water on the ground to the ringing of a bell, a peacock suddenly  crowed. The sky began to lighten. A cowherd passed with his herd. A man  came running with some fragrant flowers and offered them. All of these were  taken as auspicious signs.  

Before sunset, a three-tiered altar was constructed. It was painted white. In  the four cardinal directions Om was painted with sandalwood paste, and hrim  was painted in the four intermediate directions. Eleven and one-quarter rupees  in silver coins were placed on it, and vasksep sprinkled on them. Sweets were  placed on the coins, and this was all covered with a white cloth. Coconuts  were placed on the four corners of the cloth.  

The fire was lit at the auspicious time of 10:15 in the evening. Buddhisagar  sat facing it. The five laymen took up their positions. They made 18,000 of ferings. The first sacrifice was made with bdellium gum resin, the second with  ghee, the third with five nectars of milk, curds, ghee, honey, and sugar, and  the fourth with sticks of wood. At 11:05 Buddhisagar started reciting the man tra. At 2:00 A.M. there was an unprecedented light in his ajna cakra. In the ajna  cakra he saw a divine form with bow and arrow in hand, a smiling face, a  powerful body, wearing golden clothes, a diamond-studded crown, and a di amond necklace. Twice he heard the words, "attention, attention, blessing,  blessing." Buddhisagar folded his hands in thanks at the blessing, and per formed veneration. At the end he heard in his right ear the words, "The god is  present right before you." For a while the deity was visible. Thus it was that  Buddhisagar, the great ascetic, the great king of yogins, the greatly fortunate,  greatly knowledgeable, and most worshipful, received that direct vision which  is difficult to obtain.

### 25 Secret Yantras and Erotic Display for Hindu Temples  

Michael D. Rabe  

The Silpa Prakasa is the only surviving text on Hindu architecture that was written  from an explictly Tantric perspective. Its author, Ramacandra, was an architect  who belonged to a community of Kaula brahmans residing in the Mahanadi delta  of Orissa. Composed during the reign of an obscure local raja, the text's date can  be approximated by the fact that its prescriptions are best exemplifed by one  particular temple. That is the Varahi temple at Chaurasi, located midway between  the great temple towns of Bhuvaneshvar and Puri, and assigned on stylistic  grounds to the early eleventh century.  

Chief among distinguishing features shared by text and its closest physical  exemplar is the prominence given to erotic sculpture. Of course, images of mi thuna (couples) had long been components of the north Indian architectural  idiom. Their auspicious presence on doorframes was called for by the sixth-cen tury Brhat Sarhhita of Varahamihira, for example, but they were seen centuries  earlier even on Buddhist monuments before the Christian era. What distinguishes  their tenth- and eleventh-century permutatations is graphic excess. Not only on  the Varahi temple at Chaurasi (which enshrines a striking image of a sow-faced  goddess, the Sakti or personified energy of Visnu's boar avatar, Varaha), but on  numerous others throughout Orissa and most famously at Khajuraho in the neigh boring state of Madhya Pradesh, the depiction of couples embracing so intensified  that one may say emphasis shifted from nouns to verbs - from depictions of  mithuna to maithuna - to the acts engaged in by couples.  

Again, it is the Silpa Prakasa alone among surviving architectural treatises that  offers, from an avowedly Tantric perspective, a rationale for this profusion of  erotic art on medieval Indian temples. As divulged in the final two verses of the  second passage translated below, erotic sculpture panels (kama-bandha) should  be used as "divertissements" - to titillate the general public while hiding from the  uninitiated any glimpse of secret diagrams inscribed beneath them, called yantras.  However, the employment of sexual imagery should not be construed as endorse ment of hedonistic indulgence. In fact, the Tantric understanding of sex begins 

SECRET YANTRAS AND EROTIC DISPLAY 43 5  

with full acceptance of the orthodox Hindu presumption that kama - broadly,  the pursuit of pleasure - is one of four legitimate aims in life. Tantrikas agree  with the righteous majority, moreover, that liberation (moksa) from the vicious  cycle of rebirth (samsara) is life's ultimate objective - the other two being duty  (dharma) and prosperity (artha). Where they diverge, more in practice than affir 

mation, from followers of righteousness, is in their bold assertion that a left-hand  path can also be efficacious. Harnessing the kama impulse itself, albeit under the  most rigorous if not pleasure-subverting ritual conditions, can also be empow ering and effective in the pursuit of moksa - not to speak of many lesser attain ments along the way, including a wide variety of magical powers (siddhis) like  levitation, astral projection, enticement, and worse.  

The deployment of yantras as visual "instruments" with which to demarcate  sacred spaces, and to invoke within tightly constructed grids the inhabiting pres ence of deities, is a commonality shared by nearly all Tantric practitioners, both  Hindu and Buddhist private meditators and communal ceremony officiants alike.  As such, the Silpa Prakasa is consistent in that site- or icon-specific yantras are  enjoined to underlie virtually every structural component or image type belonging  to both the temple's front worship-hall (mukhasala, the subject of Prakasa 1,  excerpted below) and the sancturary building proper (vimana; see Prakasa 2,  excerpted below). The two passages translated here constitute the major examples  from each of the text's two chapters.  

First, the Yogini yantra may be considered a Tantric substitute for the almost  ubiquitous Vastupurusa mandala of other Sanskrit treatises on architecture (Fig ure 25.1). This presumption gains credence from the fact that the Silpa Prakasa  does not even mention the latter, much better known, example of an underlying  geometrial grid upon which to build. Mythic acounts of the Vastupurusa mandala  vary considerably, but according to the Matysa Purana (chapter 226), a demon of  global proportions grew from a drop of the great god Siva's sweat. Ravenously,  he proceeded to devour everything until all the gods united and managed to press  him face down upon the earth, and to bind him in an eightfold mesh of parallel  cords (asta-bandha). There they were obliged to hunker down indefinitely - 

whence he became known as the Vastupurusa, the "person" upon whom they  "reside." By extension, or alternatively, Vastupurusa personifies the building site  itself, in essence a local guardian spirit (like the genius loci of ancient Rome) who  must be appeased to insure successful construction (of vastus or habitations)  upon it.  

As a geometric schema, there are two main variants on the way the god's asta bandha is conveived as the Vastupurusa mandala. In both cases the grid is square;  the difference arises from whether the intersecting sets of eight parallel lines pro duce sixty-four or eighty-one subdivisions: either there are eight squares on each  side or eight lines between sets of nine (Figure 25.1). Either way, care is taken to  insure that there are thirty-two domiciles for as many gods around the perimeter  (through a diagonal subdivision of the corner squares in the case of the sixty four-square grid). With a larger brahma-sthana residence at the center for a pre-

siding supreme being, one may discern a lingering influence of early references  to a Vedic pantheon of thirty-three gods. In actual practice, however, many ad ditional deities are assigned to other interior subsections of the Vastupurusa man dala, and still others are posted to vital points of its exterior perimeter. These and  many other finer points are eloquently expounded by Stella Kramrisch in early  chapters of The Hindu Temple.  

One additional aspect of the Vastupurusa mandala as actually deployed at con struction sites is reported by S. K. Ramachandra Rao. Although subdued, the site personifying Vastupurusa is neither dead nor entirely immobilized. Throughout  the year his froglike tucked position is conceived as rotating; his head is in the  east in September and moves in a clockwise direction (pradaksina) progressively  toward due south by December, and so on. The demon is also thought to be  dormant most of the time; however, intermittent ninety-minute periods of wake fulness are considered propitious occasions for the commencement of new con struction.  

Much less is known about the analogous Tantric deployment of the Yogini  yantra. The Silpa Prakasa passage concentrates on details of its construction and  investiture with goddesses. But given the parallels of occasion and audience with  the Vastupurusa mandala, its underlying rationale and function in practice can  be imagined. Like its better-known correlate, the Yogini yantra is drawn out on  a site or sanctuary floor and then covered over before construction upon it begins.

Figure 25.2. A Yogini yantra  

In neither case do the grid lines actually serve to demarcate architectural forms;  rather, they serve to position pantheons of empowering and protective deities,  with the obvious difference that the Tantric sets are predominantly female. By  "audience" I allude to the essential presence of a temple's patron - typically a  king - who like the yajamana (chief sacrificer) of Vedic sacrifices is homologized  in his essence with the building (or sacrificial victim) so that attendant benefits  may accrue to him.  

One fundamental reason why female deities should predominate in Tantric  yantras is that worshipers of Sakti, namely Sakta Hindus, consider the energizing  goddess to be dominant over her otherwise quiescent male counterpart. The best known visual expression of this conviction is the iconic Kali standing on the  corpselike body of Siva. The motif plays upon assonance shared between the male 

438 MICHAE L D . RAB E  

god's name and the Sanskrit word for corpse, sava. Tantric deities of both genders  frequently come in multiples of eight - or nine, considering that eight subordi nates frequently form a protective circle around a supreme central deity. Thus,  in one sense at least, the sixteen goddesses (called matrikas, "little Mothers")  consigned to the periphery of the Yogini yantra constitute a simple reduplication:  a protective circle of sixteen guardians is superior to one with only eight. Even  better, by this logic, is the total of sixty-four, reached when an additional four  yoginis are assigned to each vital point of the encirclement. However simplistic  this explanation may appear, it is not trivial in actual practice, given the fact that  a large number of Sixty-Four Yogini temples were constructed throughout central  India and beyond between the ninth and twelfth centuries. These are accompa 

nied by a truly bewildering number of textual variants on the goddesses' actual  names and attributes, with virtually no two lists or sculpture sets identical (see  the numerous examples compiled in Vidya Dehejia's book on the subject). But  again, such quantitative minutia are not unique to Tantric contexts, as evidenced  by the sixty-four- and eighty-one-square variants of the Vastupurusa mandala.  

Yet another current of thought joins these primarily architectural traditions.  Especially with respect to the sixteen component triangles of the Kamakala yantra  as detailed in the second passage translated here, the two works by David Gordon  White mentioned below bear a close reading. They demonstrate that since Vedic  times, sixteen has been considered the number of the moon's waxing and waning  digits, and that in the full moon's plenitude - equated with soma, the divine  ambrosia - there is hoped-for immortality.  

In purely formal terms, the distinguishing feature of Tantric yantras, including  the two examples presented here, is their incorporation of triangles. Sometimes,  as in the famous Sri Yantra, overlapping and reverse-directed equilateral triangles  are conceived as gendered pairs. The resultant stars thus constitute two-dimen 

sional equivalents of the cylindrical stone lihgas (phallic images of Siva) set into  discoid yoni-pithas (denoting the Goddess's vulva) in the sancta of Siva temples.  However, in both yantras presented here, where large numbers of triangles come  into play, they all signify yonis. An overt statement to this effect is verse 531 of  Prakasa 2, wherein the presiding goddess of the second yantra, Maha-Kamaka lesvari, is described as making a gesture called yoni-mudra. A rare survival of this  mudra, in an erotic sculpture tableau of the sort recommended for diverting  attention from the underlying Kamakala yantra, occurs on the Laksmana Temple  at Khajuraho (Figure 25.3).  

Both passages translated here include allusions to the physiological centrality  of sexual fluids in Tantric schemata wherein semen, ideally fortified by female  secretions (rajas) produces a nectar of immortality (amrta) that the adept aspires  to redirect through successive cakras of the spinal column upward to the cranial  vault. As such, the sexual activity referred to as rajah-pana (literally, "drinking  female discharge") in Prakasa 2.534 may be urethral suction (yajroli mudra). With  respect to the cakras, this same verse describes the divine love making as taking  place in the ajna cakra, topmost among the six psychospiritual nodes arrayed

along the spinal column in Tantric yoga, commonly visualized as a two-petaled  lotus at the level of the eyebrows (or Siva's third eye). Even without further delving  into this subject of great complexity and extremely varied traditions among prac tioners, it may be seen that homologies are presupposed between the physical  space and forms of temple architecture, the divine order of the universe, and a  mapping of the individual worshiper's subtle body - or more simply, between  the macro- and micro-cosms: as it is in heaven, so may it be on earth.  

The Silpa Prakasa has been published only once, with a full translation, text in  Devanagari script, and lengthy introduction by Alice Boner and Sadasiva Rath  Sarma: Silpa Prakasa: Medieval Orissan Sanskrit Text on Temple Architecture (Leiden:  E.

The volume was illustrated with photographs of the Varahi  temple at Caurasi, among others, plus reproductions from the one illustrated  palm-leaf manuscript of the text, with an eighteenth-century colophon. The pub lished text is based on three such manuscripts, all of a similar age and written in  the Oriya script.

Further Reading  

The search for texts of this nature was prompted by a more speculative earlier  publication by Alice Boner, Principles of Composition in Hindu Sculpture, Cave Tem ple Period (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1962), wherein she posited the existence of com positional diagrams for a number of well-known rock-cut sculptures at Mamal lapuram and Ellora, dating from the seventh and eighth centuries. Subsequently  she published two additional studies of manuscripts purported to preserve ar chitectural traditions of Orissa: New Light on the Sun Temple of Konarka; Four  Unpublished Manuscripts Relating to Construction History and Ritual of This Temple,  translated into English and annotated by Alice Boner and Sadasiva Rath Sarma,  with Rajendra Prasad Das (Varanasi: Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office, 1972);  and the Vastusutra Upanisad : The Essence of Form in Sacred Art: Sanskrit text,  English translation, and notes by Alice Boner, Sadasiva Rath Sarma, and Bettina  Baumer (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1982).  

Two books are recommended for further reading on the use of mandalas in  temple construction: the magisterial Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, 2 vols.  (1946, reprint: Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1976), and S. K. Ramachandra Rao,  Mandalas in Temple Worship (Bangalore: Kalpatharu Research Academy, 1988).  For a well-illustrated introduction to a variety of Goddess temples belonging to  the same period and region as the Silpa Prakasa, see Vidya Dehejia, Yogini Cult  and Temples: A Tantric Tradition (New Delhi: National Musuem, 1986). The lead ing authority on Orissan temples is Thomas E. Donaldson, Hindu Temple Art of  Orissa, 3 vols. (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1985, 1986, 1987); see also his article, "Pro

Finally, as mentioned with respect to  the underlying Tantric ideology, the reader is advised to consult David Gordon  White, The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India (Chicago: Univer sity of Chicago Press, 1996), chapter 2, "The Universe by Numbers"; and White,  "Transformations in the Art of Love: Kamakala Practices in Hindu Tantric and  Kaula Traditions," History of Religions 38.2 (November 1998): 172-98.  

Silpa Prakasa 1.90b- 106  

90b. Hear now about the supreme Yogini Yantra upon which Sakta temples  [for goddesses] are to be grounded.  

THE YOGINI YANTRA  

91. According to Tantric texts, the installation of yoginis is paramount. On the  ground align three bindus (points) at an equal distance from each other [along 

SECRE T YANTRA S AND EROTI C DISPLA Y 441  

a north/south axis, plus two outer points at an equivalent distance, as well.  The three interior points are equated, respectively, with the metaphysical qual ities (gunas) of sattva, rajas, and tamas, that is spirit, energy, and darkness].  

92. [Two equilateral] triangles [pointing south] should be made to meet at the  upper [sattva] bindu. (Let the sattva bindu mark the apex of the upper triangle  whose base aligns with the north perimeter point, and the base of the second  triangle whose apex extends a double distance to the tamas bindu). The top  triangle denotes sattva and the lower one (with twice the elevation, and cen 

tered on the rajas bindu) may be considered the rajas triangle.  

93.-94. [Likewise,] the central axis connecting the three points is called the  rajas line. From its southern [tamas] bindu, a tamas triangle should be drawn  (of equal size to the sattva triangle above), facing the opposite direction and  with its apex meeting the central rajas triangle at the tamas bindu. [A variant  recension of this passages adds the following gloss as verses 92b and 93a:  "Triangular fields pointing upward are considered fire triangles, whereas those  facing downward are thought to be water triangles."] Next, a transversal line  should be drawn through the midpoint of the sattva [-guna] triangle.  

95. And likewise a line should be drawn across the tamas triangle at midele vation. Then two more equilateral triangles can be formed by diagonal lines  between these transversals that intersect at the rajas bindu.  

96. Thus this supreme yantra is composed of five triangles, [three facing]  downward and [two facing] upward. Finally, two more triangles are drawn to  converge at the rajas bindu from the sides.  

97. Down the middle axis it is the the yogini rekha (line) that activates the  entire yantra by penetrating all the bindus and triangles like a rod.  

98. This is the auspicious Yogini yantra, enjoined for Tantric establishments  (pithas). Wherever temples are thus undergirded by yoginis, the acquisition of  siddhis (supernatural powers) is a certainty.  

99. Sixteen mother goddesses reside on [a corresponding number of] the yog inl-bindus (peripheral points of the yantra, including both ends of the center  "rod"; four yoginis are also to be assigned to each bindu, in sequential order).  

100. This yantra has great power when established within a temple's inner  sanctum (garbha-grha); the yantra should be made coterminus with dimen sions of the Goddess-sanctum (devi-pitha).  

101. The skilled practicioner should make sure that the yantra's coordinates  are aligned in all directions with the sanctum floor.  

102. By means of measuring cord and other instruments a priest should lay  out the yantra, affixing it [and its attendent deities] with aloe wood and ver million (kunkum) mixed with red sandal paste. 

442 MICHAE L D . RAB E  

103. Then the yantra-nyasa puja (the worship associated with the establish ment of the yantra) should be performed with the king present, worshiping  the yoginis invoked at each of the yantra's [peripheral] bindu-points.  

104. By depositing various jewels and other elements, including cakra dia grams engraved on metal discs, each bindu-point should be assiduously wor shiped.  

105. After completion of these oblations the sanctum floor should raised [to  seal them in place]. This royal yantra ceremony assures victory, the destruction  of all obstacles.  

106. Thus the king's aspirations for victory are fulfilled and all siddhis are  granted. Purification of the sanctum and the entire temple grounds is also  achieved without a doubt.  

Silpa Prakasa 2.498 - 539  

THE TRUTH ABOUT EROTIC ART (KAMAKALA TATTVA)  

498. In this context [of the ornamentation of exterior temple walls], hear the  rationale for erotic sculpture panels (.kdma-bandhas). I will explain them ac cording to the received tradition among sculptors (silpa-vidya).  

499. Kama is the root of the world's existence. All that is born originates from  kama. It is by kama also that primordial matter and all beings eventually dis solve away.  

500. Without [the passionate engagement of] Siva and Sakti, creation would  be nothing but a figment. Nothing from birth to death occurs without the  activation of kama (kama-kriya).  

501. Siva is manifest as the great linga, Sakti's essential form is the yoni. By  their interaction, the entire world comes into being; this is called the activity  of kama.  

502. Canonical erotic art (kamakala vidya) is an extensive subject in author itative scriptures (Agamas). As they say, "a place devoid of erotic imagery is a  place to be shunned."  

503. By Tantric authority (kaulacara) such places are considered inferior, and  to be avoided always, as if tantamount to the lair of Death, or impenetrable  darkness.  

504. Without [first] performing puja to the Kamakala Yantra, any worship of  the Goddess (Sakti-puja) or Tantric practice (sadhana) is as futile as an ele phant's bath.

505. Where this yantra is consecrated, that building may be considered a Tan trie temple (vira-mandira). There all obstacles and fears, and so on, are sure to  be destroyed.  

506. From the mere sight of this yantra all manner of ghosts, demons, and  other hideous creatures are sure to flee far away.  

507. Listen, and I will carefully expound its secrets. [But remember,] this yan tra must never be divulged to anyone who is not a Tantric practitioner.  

THE KAMAKALA YANTRA  

508. The ground for this Tantric figure (vira-bhumi) must be four-sided, either  square or rectangular. Across the total area of this four-square field two lines  should be made.  

509. One vertical and the other horizontal, these lines should intersect at the  "jewel house" [center point]. Starting from the jewel-point, diagonals should  be drawn to the corners, thus dividing the entire figure into triangular yonis.  

510. Vertically extending from the lower baseline to the yantra's center, a nar-444 MICHAE L D. RABE  

row linga should be formed, with a jewel-like rounded top extending above  the center point.  

511. Above this jewel-top the kama-bindu's very essence is marked by a bul bous drop, the bindu that bestows all supernatural powers.  

512. After this, the sixteen matrikas are consigned to [a like number of] tri angle yonis, making sure that each is in captivating contact with the linga.  

513. These sixteen facets (kalas) are all formally conceived as being yonis,  only by virtue of linear conjunction with the lihga, thus becoming [a complete  set of sixteen] facets.  

514. How, then, is the segmented field apportioned so as to constitute the  fifteen [that is, sixteen] principal orifices that are conjoined with the linga?  

515. By what means are those three-sided figures considered to represent yo nis, the totality of which constitute this yantra?  

516. In the upper half, two oblique lines should connect the top central bindu  to the ends of the horizontal center line; similarly, draw lines from the lower  center up to [but not beyond] the corner diagonals.  

517. [The upper side triangles are then subdivided horizontally:] Kamesi is  the first Sakti [assigned to the upper side triangle on the proper right]; Bha gamalika is second [below her]; Nityaklinna is third [to the proper left top  triangle]; and fourth is Bherunda [below her].  

518. [Below] on the proper left set of three fields MahavajreSvan is assigned  the bottom triangle, Sivadutika is beside her [to the linga's proper right].  

519. Beside her, in the [other proper] left corner field, is the citsakti [named]  Vahnivasini, joined with captivating lines.  

520. To her left, and conjoined to the jewel-tip (mani-ksetra) portion of the  lihga is placed the goddess Vajresvari.  

521. Above, on the proper right [and horizontally extended from the linga] is  Tvarita, the steadfast essence of the Sakti facets (kalatmika), and opposite [her,  on the] left, Kulasundari.  

522. In this order are the beautiful fields occupied on the sides. In the great  yantra of the vulva-altar (bhaga-pitha) only six more remain to be enumerated.  

523. Against the lihga's right side is Sakti Kllapataka, opposite her the lovely  limbed Jvalamalini.  

524. Vijaya, the constant Companion [goes across the top left], Kamakalesvari  extends below her to the linga's jewel-tip.  

525. On her side to the proper right, the divine Tripurasundari is placed, [and 

SECRET YANTRAS AND EROTIC DISPLAY 44 5  

above her], opposite Vijaya, [goes Bhairavi], the constant love of Bhairava,  beloved of the powerless.  

526. These are the sixteen Saktis, goddesses who are the very essence of Love  (kdmakalatmika), together constituting the yantra's field; around its outer pe riphery a protective ring of [eight] yoginis [is invoked].  

527. Nirbhara at the upper centerpoint, Rahasyaka in the upper left corner,  Kulotkirna at the middle left, Atirahasya in the lower corner.  

528. At the lower center place Sampradaya; in the next corner Guptatarahgika;  Guptayogini at the proper right center; and Nigarbha at top right.  

529. These are the yoginis of the peripheral field, as distinguished from the  [interior, sixteen-] faceted Love Field. [Finally], the Supreme Sakti, the great  goddess of Love's Facets [or of the Art of Love], Parasakti Maha-Kamakalesvari  [is visualized at] the central drop.  

MEDITATION ON MAHA-KAMAKALESVARI  

530-31. Wearing colorful garments, gracious, [yet] aroused like an elephant  in rut, ever sex-crazed, radiant in a circle of light, with a snare of lotus-flowers,  and making the auspicious yoni-mudra [in right and left hands respectively],  she holds a bow on her [upper] left hand and and in her upper left a spray of  kimsuka (Butea frondosa) buds.  

532. [In a third pair of hands] the Goddess holds a rudraksa rosary while  confering boons and fearlessness (with the varada and abhaya mudras), though  afflicted herself by Kama's five sharp arrows.  

MEDITATION ON KAMAKALA'S LORD, SIVA  

533-34. Just below her, from the jewel-tip [of the yantra's linga] appears Siva,  Kamakala's Lord, his complexion somewhat dark, profoundly still in a seated  yogic pose, almighty, [yet] constantly absorbed in lovemaking to Kamakales vari, mounted in the ajna cakra, always delighting to partake of her sexual  fluids (rajah-pana-ratah).  

535. Wearing the ascetic's garb, [he is] the yogin Kamakalesvara, presiding  lord of the great Kamakala Yantra, the dark Sankara.  

536. This most secret yantra is the ultimate means of protecting any place. It  is a perceptible power aid, and manifestly the [ultimate] bestower of all siddhis.  

537. In all the best Sakta and Saiva temples this yantra must certainly be de ployed; then their fame will remain unmoved, like mountains.  

538. [But] this most secret of secret yantras must not be be seen by just anyone. 

446 MICHAE L D . RAB E  

This is the reason that images of erotic play [should hide] the yantra's align ments.  

539. The considered opinion among tantrikas is that erotic images should  adorn upper panels on pilasters of the exterior temple wall. There erotic sculp ture panels should be mounted in order to delight the general public. 

### 26 The Six Rites of Magic  

Gudrun Buhnemann  

References to magical practices are found throughout ancient Indian literature,  especially the Atharva Veda. Rites of magic are a common topic in Tantric texts,  where we often encounter them in a group called the "six rites." This group  represents a systematization of magical practices. Although elements of folk tra 

ditions are certainly present, the dependence on brahmanical rituals is clearly  evident.  

The Mantramahodadhi (Great Ocean of Mantras), a Sanskrit text that prescribes  the mantras of different deities and ritual practices connected with them, was  composed by Mahidhara at Varanasi, in 1588. Mahidhara wrote the work with  the intention of gathering all significant information on the topic in a single book.  Because of the clarity of its presentation, the Mantramahodadhi - along with the  Nauka (The Boat), the author's commentary written to enable practitioners to  cross the "Great Ocean of Mantras" - has enjoyed great popularity in all parts of  India up to the present day. Throughout the work, Mahidhara enumerates various  deities, the mantras of those deities, and the rites in which the mantras are em ployed and which may be performed, once the mantras have been mastered, for  the attainment of specific objectives. Among the rites are those usually classified  as "the six rites" (satkarmani).  

Chapter 25, the final chapter of the text, comprises 132 verses. Verses 1-102  address broader issues connected with the six rites. Five of these fall under the  category of abhicara, sorcery or destructive magic, and one may be classified as  an auspicious beneficial rite of white magic. The chapter bears some similarity to  sections of the anonymous Prapancasara and Laksmanadesika's Sdradatilaka (es 

pecially 23.121-45), both well-known Tantric compendiums of the tenth to elev enth centuries. The text is precise but highly condensed, and presupposes a thor ough knowledge of Indian ritual practice on the part of the practitioner. Although  the text does not give details about how to perform such rituals - such descrip tions being scattered throughout the work - it provides general information about  the times, materials, and so forth that were considered suitable for these rites. 

448 GUDRUN BUHNEMANN  

Even though the six rites are often mentioned in Tantric literature, the names  used for them vary. The six rites referred to in the Mantramahodadhi are appease ment (santi), subjugation (vasya, vasikarana), immobilization (stambha, stam bhana), enmity (dvesa, vidvesa), eradication (uccata, uccatana), and liquidation  (mar ana).  

Appeasement is defined as the curing of diseases; it is an auspicious, benevolent  rite, whereas the other five rites are of a destructive nature. Subjugation entails  bringing a person under the practitioner's control, especially seducing a woman  against her will. Immobilization means stopping a person's activity. Enmity is  defined as creating dissension or dislike between two persons who are attached  to each other. Eradication means depriving a person of his place, usually with  reference to such activities as breaking an object or removing someone from a  location. Liquidation means taking life. Similar definitions appear earlier in Sar addtilaka 23.121-25. Magical rites performed for these and similar objectives are  also described in Indian Buddhist Tantric texts, such as the Guhyasamajatantra,  as well as in some texts contained in collections of sadhanas (texts describing  methods of spiritual realization) like that published under the title Sadhanamala.  

After defining the rites, Mahidhara states that the practitioner should know  nineteen items before performing a rite. These items are listed in verses 4 and 5  and then explained one by one in verses 6 to 65ab of the chapter. They are: the  deity, the deity's color, the season, the direction, the day, the posture/seat, the  arrangement, the symbolic shape, the gesture, the letters, the rise of the element,  the fire sticks, the rosary, the fire, the material for writing, the fire pit, the small  wooden sacrificial ladle, the large ladle, and the stylus.  

The Nineteen Items  

To each rite a presiding goddess with a specific body color is assigned (verses 6- 7ab; Table 26.1). Flowers of the respective colors are offered before undertaking  a rite. Here the color white is considered suitable for appeasement, whereas the

SIX RITE S OF MAGI C 449  

dark and gray colors are appropriate for destructive rites. In the three-color  scheme commonly found in Indian texts, white, red, and dark (black) are con nected with the three qualities of the Samkhya system of philosophy, namely,  goodness/purity, passion, and inertness/darkness, or with the cosmic functions of  creation, maintenance, and destruction.  

The next section addresses suitable times of the day. The twenty-four hours of  the day are considered a replica of the entire year (verses 7cd-9ab; Table 26.2).  They are divided into the six seasons, with each, beginning at sunrise, lasting four  hours. Each season is favorable to one of the six rites. Each rite is further con 

nected with the direction (verses 9cd-10ab; Table 26.2) the practitioner faces  during the performance. Omitting south and west, the two remaining cardinal  and the four intermediate directions are of significance. The topic of directions is  taken up again later (verses 60-6lab) in connection with the directions in which  the fire pits face. Except for two of the rites, appeasement and liquidation, they  agree with the above scheme.  

Each rite should be performed on suitable days of the lunar month and the  week (verses 10cd-15ab; Table 26.3). The lunar month is divided into two fort nights: the bright half, when the moon waxes, and the dark half, when it wanes.  It is only to be expected that a rite such as liquidation should be mainly connected  with the dark half, whereas the auspicious rite of appeasement should be per formed during the bright half.  

The practitioner is advised to maintain one of six postures in the rites while  seated on one of six animal hides (15cd-17ab; Table 26.4) We do not know how  far this classification was ever observed in practice, but we can perceive a con nection between the characteristics of the animals and the nature of the rites  performed. The hide of the sacred cow is suited for the auspicious appeasement  rite, whereas the hide of the powerful and large elephant suits the act of immo bilization.  

Mahidhara goes on to describe six special methods or arrangements for con necting the mantra or sacred spell to be uttered in each rite with the letters of the  name of the person to be influenced (verses 17cd-23ab; Table 26.5). The sym

This assignment of the elements to the six rites appears again in the discussion  of the rise of the elements (verses 33cd-36), which is determined on the basis of  that part of the nose which the breath touches.  

Next, six ritual hand gestures (mudras) are assigned to the six rites, and three  special gestures are described for the fire ritual (verses 26-29). The letters in scribed in the geometrical figures, or yantras, used in the rites are said to be the  letters governed by a particular element (verses 30-32ab). Details about which  letters are related to which elements are discussed in an earlier chapter (chapter  24, verses 80-81) of the text. There are also six closing words of mantras (verses  32cd-33ab), each connected with one of the six rites (Table 26.7). Svaha, vasat  and vausat have long been employed as exclamations when making offerings in

the fire in a ritual. Namah means "salutation," and is used for offering respect to  a deity or person. Phat imitates the sound of bursting or breaking. These six  closing words also appear in nyasa rites, that is, the imposition of syllables, deity  names, and so forth, upon the practitioner's body. These rites are a part of the  worship ritual.  

An interesting topic briefly touched upon in verses 33cd-36 is that of the rise  of elements, which is observed from the part of the nose where the breath touches.  It was observed that the breath does not pass equally through both nostrils at all  times, but touches certain parts of the nostrils over various intervals of time.  Certain rites or actions can be performed successfully when a certain element is  predominant (Table 26.8). This branch of knowledge is also known as "rise of  breath" (svarodaya) and is addressed in independent treatises. It is a method often  used for making predictions.  

Rosaries are commonly used to count the number of repetitions of mantras.  Mahidhara gives some information about the material for the beads of rosaries,  their number, and the method of rotation (verses 40-44). Instructions regarding  the fire ritual (homa), which is an ancient Indian practice, follow. Fire sticks of  different woods, smeared with different substances, are offered in the fire ritual,  which constitutes a portion of the rites (verses 37-39). The offerings are made  into different fires, which are produced by rubbing sticks of different types of  wood together. The different flames of the fire are worshiped for each rite. They  are called "tongues," because they consume the offerings. An almost identical list  of the names of the tongues appears earlier in Saradtilaka (5.23). To each of the  rites a fire pit of a particular shape is assigned, which faces a particular direction  (verses 60-61ab). The materials for the two ladles used in pouring libations into  the fire are specified in verses 61cd-62ab.  

After the fire ritual, brahmans, who represent deities, are fed. This ritual feeding  of brahmans also figures in other rites. The number of brahmans fed varies with  the rite (verses 49cd-55ab). Their blessing is said to destroy the sin that accrues  from the performance of destructive magic.  

Mahidhara describes different substances used as ink substitutes in drawing a  yantra as part of the rites, and suitable materials on which to draw the yantras

(verses 55ab-59). Depending on the nature of the rite to be performed, different  materials are used for the stylus, and certain days are recommended for making  that instrument (verses 62cd-65ab).  

Following his discussion of the nineteen topics, Mahidhara addresses other  issues, such as the appropriate diet for the practitioner (verses 65cd-67), sub stances and vessels used for pouring libations (verses 68-70), and the body pos ture that is to be maintained (verse 71).  

In his concluding discussion of these ritual procedures, Mahidhara declares  that he has described the desire-oriented rites only for the sake of persons who  are attracted to sense pleasures, based on instructions he has found in the works  of earlier preceptors (verses 72-76ab). Mahidhara extolls the superiority of the  worship of deities without any desire for personal gain, as well as of the attainment  of the highest knowledge, the realization of the unity of the individual self (atman)  with the universal principle (brahman; verses 76cd-81).  

The text then continues with a discussion of a preliminary ritual, to be per formed for determining the success of the rite (verses 82-87). Not every mantra  is suitable for every individual. The practitioner prays to the god Siva to reveal  "the truth" in a dream. Auspicious and inauspicious dreams are listed in detail  (verses 88-97ab). Finally, the signs by which one recognizes that the practitioner  has attained mastery over the mantra are given. The practitioner is again advised  to strive for the highest knowledge and emancipation (verses 97-101).  

A critical edition of the Mantramahodadhi is not yet available. The translation is  based on my new edition of chapter 25, published as appendix 2 of my study,  The Iconography of Hindu Tantric Deities. Vol. 1, The Pantheon of the Mantramaho dadhi (Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 2000), Gonda Indological Studies series, no. 9.  This volume also provides detailed information on the Mantramahodadhi and its  author. I have used the printed edition entitled Mantramahodadhih satikah (Bom bay:'Srivenkatesvar Steam Press, 1910, 1962), as well as the manuscript repro duced in lithographic form in Mantramahodadhi, edited by Raghuvara Prasada  (Lucknow: Smarahimsakadatta Press, 1872), and the three following manuscripts:  Manuscript 1008 of 1891-1895, and 1138 of 1881-1892 (dated 1789), both  held in the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, India; and Manuscript  0793 (dated 1757), held in the library of the Centre of Advanced Study in San skrit, University of Poona, India.  

In the following translation of Mantramahodadhi 25.1-102, the text is divided  into subsections, each with a separate heading. These headings are not part of  the Sanskrit text, but were introduced to help orient the reader and facilitate  understanding.

THE SIX RITES AND THEIR DEFINITIONS  

I shall now explain the six rites, which grant success [if] the [correct] proce dure [is followed]. The following are called the rites: 1. appeasement, 2. sub jugation, 3. immobilization, 4. enmity, 5. eradication, and 6. liquidation. "Ap peasement" is the destruction of diseases, and so on."Subjugation" is the state  

of one who executes a command. "Immobilization" is obstructing an activity.  "Enmity" is the dislike between two affectionate people. "Eradication" is dep rivation from a place. "Liquidation" is the taking of life. These are the defini tions of the six rites. (Verses 1-3)  

THE NINETEEN ITEMS A PRACTITIONER OF THE RITES  SHOULD KNOW  

One should practice the six rites after knowing the following [nineteen items]  precisely: i. the deity, ii. the deity's color, iii. the season, iv. the direction, v.  the day, vi. the posture/seat, vii. the arrangement, viii. the symbolic shape, ix.  the gesture, x. the letters, xi. the rising of the element, xii. the fire sticks, xiii.  the rosary, xiv. the fire, xv. the material for writing, xvi. the fire pit, xvii. the  small wooden sacrificial ladle, xviii. the large ladle, and xix. the stylus. (Verses  4-5)  

I - II. THE PRESIDING DEITIES OF THE SIX RITES AND THEIR COLORS  

1. Rati, 2. Vani, 3. Rama, 4. Jyestha, 5. Durga, and 6. Kali are the deities [of  the rites]. They are 1. white, 2. red, 3. yellow, 4. variegated, 5. dark, and 6.  gray. At the beginning of the rite [the practitioner] should worship them with  flowers of the [deity's] respective color in sequence. (Verses 6-7ab) 

SIX RITES OF MAGIC 455  

III. THE SIX SEASONS AND THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE SIX RITES  

The six seasons are spring, and so forth. Day and night come in sequence [as  they are mentioned]. The duration of each season is considered to be ten times  twenty-four minutes [four hours]. The wise man should connect 1. winter  [November-January], 2. the [season] called spring [March-May], 3. the cool  season [January-March], 4. summer [May-July], 5. the rainy season [July-Sep 

tember], [and] 6. autumn [September-November] with the six rites in se quence. (Verses 7cd-9ab)  

IV. THE SIX DIRECTIONS THE PRACTITIONER FACES DURING THE RITES  

The directions are, in sequence, 1. northeast, 2. north, 3. east, 4. southwest, 5.  northwest, and 6. southeast. (Verses 9cd-10ab)  

V. DAYS OF THE LUNAR MONTH AND OF THE WEEK SUITABLE FOR THE RITES  

He should perform the respective rites while repeating the mantra [and] facing  the respective direction. And the second [lunar day] and seventh as well as the  fifth [and] the third [lunar day] in the bright half [of the month] coinciding  with a Wednesday or Thursday is approved of in the 1. appeasement rite.  Equally, the fourth, ninth, sixth, [or] thirteenth lunar day [of the bright half]  coinciding with a Thursday or Monday is recommended in the 2. subjugation  rite. And the eleventh, tenth, ninth, and again the eighth coinciding with a  Saturday or Friday is prescribed in the 4. enmity rite. The rite called 5. eradi cation should be performed on the [following days] for attainment of success:  the fourteenth or eighth in the dark [half of the month], when it coincides  with a Saturday. When the fourteenth and eighth day occuring in the dark  [half of the month], [and] when the new moon day [and] the [day] coming at  the end of the [dark half, that is, the first day of the bright half] coincide with  a Sunday, Saturday and Tuesday, [the time] is auspicious for 3. immobilization  and 6. liquidation. (Verses 10cd-15ab)  

VI. SIX SUITABLE POSTURES AND SEATS FOR MANTRA REPETITION  

In appeasement and other [rites], he should maintain in sequence the most  excellent posture: 1. the lotus, 2. svastika, 3. vikata, 4. cock, 5. diamond, and  6. bhadra. Having sat on the hide of 1. a cow, 2. rhinoceros, 3. elephant, 4.  jackal, as well as 5. a sheep or 6. buffalo, he should perform the repetition [of  the mantra] in the rites of appeasement, and so forth. (Verses 15cd-17ab)  

VII. SIX ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE LETTERS OF THE MANTRA AND THOSE OF THE  VICTIM'S NAME  

Having explained the seats in this way, the arrangement is now being explained.  The following are considered the six arrangements in the rites: 1. granthana, 

4 5 6 GUDRUN BUHNEMANN  

the [arrangement] called 2. vidarbha, 3. samputa, as well as 4. rodhana, 5.  yoga, and 6. pallava. And now the definition of each of these six is stated:  1. There should be one syllable of the mantra, then a syllable of the [victim's]  name; again a syllable of the mantra and a syllable of the name. In this way,  granthana is described.  

2. In the beginning, there are two letters of the mantra, then one letter of  the name; in this way [it is done] again and again. [Thus] vidarbha is explained  by the most excellent connoisseurs of mantras.  

3. Having first uttered the mantra, he should then recite the complete name  [and] at the end the mantra in inverted order. This is called samputa.  4. The mantra [inserted] in the beginning, middle, and end of the name,  however, is rodhana.  

5. The mantra [inserted] at the end of the name, on the other hand, is yoga.  6. The name [appearing] at the end of the mantra is pallava. (Verses 17cd 23ab)  

VIII. THE SYMBOLIC SHAPES OF THE ELEMENTS  

The symbolic shape of water is said to resemble a half moon, marked with two  lotuses on both sides; it is recommended in the 1. appeasement rite.  The symbolic shape of fire, however, for 2. subjugation is a triangle endowed  with svastika[s].  

A square connected with thunderbolt[s], however, is the symbolic shape of  earth for 3. immobilization.  

A circle is the [symbolic shape] of ether for 4. enmity.  

A [circle] marked with six dots, on the other hand, is the symbolic shape of  wind for 5. eradication; the fire shape [described before is the symbolic shape]  for 6. liquidation. (Verses 23cd-26ab)  

IX. SIX HAND GESTURES FOR THE SIX RITES; THREE HAND GESTURES FOR THE FIRE  RITUAL AND THEIR DEFINITIONS  

The 1. lotus, 2. noose, 3. mace, 4. pestle, 5. thunderbolt, and 6. sword should  be the six hand gestures in the six rites. Now the [gestures] for the fire ritual  are being told: "[female] deer," "goose," [and] "sow" are the three hand gestures  approved of in the fire ritual.  

When the middle finger, ring finger, and thumb are joined, the gesture is  considered the "[female] deer."  

When all except the little finger are joined [the gesture] is considered the  "goose."  

When the hand is contracted it is the "sow." The definitions of gestures have  been stated. For appeasement and subjugation, the "[female] deer" and "goose"  are employed; for immobilization and others, the "sow." (Verses 26-29) 

SIX RITES OF MAGIC 457  

X. THE LETTERS: LETTERS ASSIGNED TO THE MOON AND THE ELEMENTS EMPLOYED  IN THE YANTRAS OF THE RITES; THE SIX "CLASSES" OR CLOSING WORDS OF  MANTRAS  

Practitioners of mantras state that, in the six rites, the seed syllables of a yan tra consist of the letters of the moon, water, earth, ether, wind, and fire. The  [sixteen] vowels [and] sa and tha are the letters of the moon. The letters of  the [five] elements have been mentioned [in 24.80-83]. These [letters] with out the letters of the moon, should be taken in rites, such as subjugation.  Some specify 1. sa, 2. va, 3. la, 4. ha, 5. ya, [and] 6. ra [equivalent to water,  earth, ether, wind, fire] as the letters of the moon, and so forth. (Verses 30- 32ab)  

In rites such as appeasement, the most excellent connoisseurs of mantras  should know the following six as "classes" in sequence: 1. namah, 2. svaha, 3.  vasat, 4. vausat, 5. hum, and 6. phat. (Verses 32cd-33ab)  

XL THE RISE OF THE ELEMENTS DETERMINED BY OBSERVING THE TOUCH OF THE  BREATH ON THE NOSTRILS  

Should the breath move below both nostrils, then the rise of the water [ele ment] is to be known, which grants success in the 1. appeasement rite.  When the movement of the breath resorts to the ridge of the nose, it is the  rise of the earth, [the element suitable] for 3. immobilization.  When it moves in the middle of the nostrils, it is the rise of ether, which is  auspicious for 4. enmity.  

When the breath moves above the nostrils, it would be the rise of fire, [and]  then there is success in two rites, for 6. liquidation and 2. subjugation.  When the breath moves sideways, the rise of wind should be recognized [as  suitable] for 5. eradication. (Verses 33cd-36)  

XII. THE FIRE STICKS SMEARED WITH DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES AND USED IN THE  FIRE RITUAL FORMING PART OF THE SIX RITES  

Durva [used as] fire sticks, smeared with the clarified butter of a cow, [is  used] for I. appeasement. Pomegranate shoots smeared with the clarified but ter of a goat [are offered] in a fire ritual for 2. subjugation. Fire sticks from  the raja tree smeared with clarified butter from a sheep [are used] for 3. im mobilization. Fire sticks from the thorn apple [tree] smeared with atasi oil  [are used] for 4. enmity. [Fire sticks] from the mango [tree] smeared with  mustard oil are approved of in the 5. eradication rite. [Fire sticks] from the  khadira [tree] smeared with mustard oil are recommended for 6. liquidation.  (Verses 37-39) 

458 GUDRUN BUHNEMANN  

XIII. ROSARIES: MATERIALS USED, FINGERS EMPLOYED IN ROTATION AND NUMBER  OF BEADS  

The [following] rosaries should be known in sequence in rites beginning with  appeasement: those made from 1. conch shells, 2. lotus seeds, 3. the fruits of  the nimba and arista [trees], 4. the teeth of the deceased, 5. the teeth of a horse,  [and] 6. the teeth of a donkey.  

The wise man should rotate the rosary placed on the middle finger with the  thumb in 1. appeasement, 2. subjugation and acquisition [-related rites, and]  in mantra repetition whose aims are worldly enjoyment and liberation. The  wise man should repeat the mantra [rotating the rosary] by joining the ring  finger and thumb in the rite of 3. immobilization. However, the wise man  should repeat the mantra by joining the index finger and thumb for 4. enmity  and 5. eradication, [and] by joining the little finger and thumb for 6. liquida tion.  

The number of beads in an auspicious rite would be 108, half of it [54], or  half of the [half, 27]. In destructive magic, the number [of beads] is 15. (Verses  40-44)  

XIV. FIRE RITUAL: FIRE STICKS USED IN LIGHTING THE FIRE; THE TONGUES OF THE  FIRE; AND THE RITUAL FEEDING OF BRAHMANS  

1. Appeasement [and 2.] subjugation [are performed] in the ordinary fire, 3.  immobilization in a fire lit by vata [sticks], [and] 4. enmity [in a fire] lit by  bibhitaka [sticks]; the remaining two [rites, that is, 5. eradication and 6. li quidation, are performed in a fire] located in the cremation grounds. In an  auspicious rite, the connoisseur of the mantra should light the fire for the fire  ritual with fire sticks from the bilva, arka, palasa, or ksira trees; in an inaus picious [rite, with sticks] from the visa and bibhitaka, nimba, thorn apple, and  Slesmataka.  

In the rite of 1. appeasement, he should worship the tongue of the fire called  Suprabha; in 2. the subjugation rite, indeed, [the tongue] called Rakta; for 3.  immobilization, the one called Kanaka; for 4. enmity, the tongue Gagana; and  for 5. eradication, Atiraktika. For 6. liquidation, on the other hand, he should  worship Krsna. However, [he may worship] Bahurupa in any case. (Verses 45 - 49ab)  

In rites, such as appeasement, he should also know the special number [of  brahmans] to be fed. For 1. appeasement [and] 2. subjugation, he should feed  brahmans [numbering] one-tenth the [number of offerings in the] fire ritual.  That would be the best rite; the mediocre one, on the other hand, is [per 

formed] with [the feeding of brahmans numbering] one twenty-fifth [the num ber of fire offerings]. The feeding of brahmans, on the other hand, [numbering]  one one-hundredth [the number of offerings] of the fire ritual, that is, indeed,  the lowest [rite]. For 3. immobilization, the feeding of brahmans is held to be 

SIX RITE S O F MAGI C 459  

double [that is, one-fifth] the proportion [of offerings given] for appeasement;  for 4. enmity [and] 5. eradication, three times [the number of offerings in the  fire ritual, and] for 6. liquidation, [the prescribed number] equals the [number  of offerings in the] fire ritual. Brahmans should be fed with pleasing foods,  should have been born in a very pure family, should know the Veda and [its]  supplements, and should be pure, [and] devoted to virtuous conduct. One  should consider them deities [and] should worship them. They should be  bowed to repeatedly. They should be gratified with sweet words [and] by of ferings of gold, and so forth. [The practitioner] obtains his wish before long,  once he has received their blessings. The sin that accrues from destructive  magical rites vanishes by the [auspicious] utterance of brahmans. (Verses  49cd-55ab)  

XV. MATERIALS AND SUBSTANCES FOR DRAWING YANTRAS  

Sandalwood paste, yellow pigment, turmeric, domestic smoke [-soot], charcoal  from the funeral pyre, [and] the eight poisonous substances [are employed] in  drawing yantras for appeasement, and so on. He may certainly also take those  previously described [in 20.22-118] writing materials. The eight poisonous  substances are black pepper, pippali [long pepper], dry ginger, excrement of  vultures, citraka [wood], domestic smoke, juice of the thorn apple [tree], and  salt. For 1. appeasement [and] 2. subjugation, the most excellent connoisseur  of mantras should draw the yantra on birchbark; for 3. immobilization, on tiger  skin; for 4. enmity, on donkey skin; for 5. eradication, on a banner cloth; [and]  for 6. liquidation, on human bone. Whatever receptacles were mentioned in  the yantra chapter [20.12-13], they are also approved of. (Verses 55cd-59)  

XVI. THE SHAPES OF THE FIRE PITS AND AUSPICIOUS DIRECTIONS  

In the rites beginning with appeasement, the fire pit has [the form] of (1) a  circle, (2) lotus, (3) square, (4) triangle, (5) hexagon, or (6) half moon, in the  directions (1) west, (2) north, (3) east, (4) southwest, (5) northwest, and (6)  south, in sequence. (Verses 60-61ab)  

XVII.-XVIII. MATERIAL FOR THE SMALL WOODEN SACRIFICIAL LADLE AND THE  LARGE LADLE  

In [rites of] appeasement and subjugation, the small wooden sacrifical ladle  and the large ladle are golden and made from the fig tree. In rites such as the  one for immobilization, both are indeed held to be of iron. (Verses 61cd-62ab)  

XIX. THE STYLUS: DIFFERENT MATERIALS USED AND THE SUITABLE TIME FOR  ITS MANUFACTURE  

The stylus is made of gold, made of silver, [or] made from jati [twig] for  1. appeasement; for 2. subjugation, [it is] made from durva sprouts; for 3. 

4 6 0 GUDRUN BUHNEMANN  

immobilization, from the agastya tree - or it could be made from the raja tree;  for 4. enmity, however, from the karanja [twig]. For an auspicious rite, the  wise man should make the stylus on a pleasant day; for 5. eradication, from  bibhitaka; for 6. liquidation, however, from human bone. For an inauspicious  rite, on the other hand, [the wise man should make] it, on the rikta days [that  is, the fourth, ninth, and fourteenth day of the lunar month], on Tuesday, or  on visti [-karana, that is, one of eleven divisions of the day]. (Verses 62cd 65ab)'  

THE PRACTITIONER'S DIET  

Now food, material for pouring libations, and the vessel for the [libations] are  described. For 1. appeasement [and] 2. subjugation, food fit for sacrifice [is  recommended]; for 3. immobilization, rice pudding; for 4. enmity, masa and  mudga beans; for 5. eradication from a place, wheat; for 6. liquidation, rice  with red lentils, as well as syama(ka) [grain], [and] pudding from goat milk.  [Thus] the foods of the practitioners of mantras who perform the rites have  been stated. (Verses 65cd-67)  

SUBSTANCES FOR POURING LIBATIONS  

For 1. appeasement [and] 2. subjugation, water mixed with turmeric is pre scribed for the pouring of libations, [and] slightly warm [water] with black  pepper, and so on, for 3. immobilization as well as 6. liquidation. Water mixed  with the blood of a sheep is recommended for 4. enmity and 5. eradication.  (Verses 68-69ab)  

VESSELS USED FOR POURING LIBATIONS  

A golden vessel should be [used] for pouring libations in the 1. appeasement  and 2. subjugation rites; for 3. immobilization, a clay vessel; for 4. enmity, one  made of khadira [wood]; for 4. eradication, one of iron. For 6. liquidation,  however, a fowl's egg [should be used]. (Verses 69cd-70)  

BODY POSTURES MAINTAINED WHILE POURING LIBATIONS  

For 1. appeasement [and] 2. subjugation, he should pour libations while seated  on a soft seat; for 3. immobilization, while resting on both knees; for 4. enmity,  and so on, while standing on one foot. (Verse 71)  

DRAWBACKS OF DESIRE-ORIENTED RITES  

Thus the procedure for the six rites has been stated for the satisfaction of the  connoisseurs of mantras. After having properly performed the types of nyasa,  and having performed the self-protection, the desire-oriented rites should be 

SIX RITES OF MAGIC 461  

performed; otherwise, there would be defeat. The mantra can become the en emy of the practitioner who has performed either auspicious or inauspicious  desire-oriented rites; therefore, he should not become attached to it. The desire oriented rite described by previous teachers was explained for the satisfaction  of those whose minds are attached to [sense] objects; but it is not conducive  to welfare. Those who are attached to desire-oriented rites can only [obtain]  limited results. Those who worship God without desire attain all siddhis [su pernatural powers]. (Verses 72-76ab)  

SUPERIORITY OF WORSHIP WITHOUT SELFISH MOTIVES  

[The practitioner] should avoid attachment to whatever performances were  stated [prior to the discussion of the six rites as appropriate] for each mantra,  for attaining happiness, and should worship the deity without desire. In the  Veda, three sections have been given: ritual, worship, and knowledge. The  means is described in two of these sections; in the third, the goal is stated.  Therefore [the practitioner] should perform what is stated in the Veda and  worship the deities, by means of which a pure-minded man obtains the highest  knowledge. The individual soul, consisting of consciousness which has entered  the body, is the complete brahman itself. Knowing this, he is liberated. And  having obtained a human body, he should worship the deities. He who is not  liberated from existence is a great sinner. Therefore the most excellent of men  should strive to obtain knowledge of the self by rites and the worship of deities,  [and] by eliminating the group of enemies, such as desire. (Verses 76cd-81)  

RITUAL FOR DETERMINING FUTURE SUCCESS BEFORE ATTEMPTING THE  PROCEDURE OF PERFECTING A MANTRA  

[The practitioner] who wishes to perform the worship of a deity should first  consider the future. Having taken a bath, performed the twilight [ritual], and  so on, [and] having recollected the lotuslike foot of Hari, he should lie down  on a bed of kusa [grass and] pray to the bull-bannered [Siva]: "O Lord, Lord  of the God of gods, bearer of the trident, who rides on a bull! Announce, O  eternal one, the good and bad, while I am asleep. Salutation to the unborn,  three-eyed, tawny, great-souled one. Salutation to the handsome, omnipresent  lord of dreams. Tell me the truth in the dream regarding all matters completely.  O great lord, by your grace I will accomplish success in the ritual." Having  prayed to Siva with these mantras, he should sleep calmly. In the morning he  should tell the preceptor the dream he had at night. The connoisseur of the  mantra should himself reflect on the [significance of] the dream, without the  [preceptor, if he is unavailable]. (Verses 82-87)  

AUSPICIOUS DREAMS  

The vision of the following in the dream is auspicious: a phallic symbol [of  Siva]; the disks of the moon and sun; [the goddess] Sarasvati; the [river] Gan-

4 6 2 GUDRUN BUHNEMANN  

ges; the preceptor; crossing the Ocean of Blood; victory in battle; worship of  [the fire god] Agni; residing in a chariot [yoked with] peacocks, geese, and  ruddy geese; sexual intercourse; mounting a crane and acquisition of land; a  river; a palace; a chariot; a lotus; a parasol; a girl; a tree with fruits; an elephant;  a lamp; a yak; a flower; a bull and horse; a mountain; ajar with liquor; heavenly  bodies; stars; a woman; sunrise; heavenly nymphs; ascending palaces, or moun 

tains and chariots; going through the sky; consuming liquor and meat; applying  feces [to the body]; sprinkling with blood; eating rice with curd; coronation  as a king; a cow, bull, and banners; a lion; a lion throne; a conch; a musical  instrument; yellow pigment; curd; a sandalwood [tree], or a mirror. (Verses  88-93)  

INAUSPICIOUS DREAMS  

The following are not auspicious in a dream: [the sight of] a man anointed  with oil; a dark-colored one; a naked one; a pit, a crow, and a dry thorny tree;  an outcaste; a man with a long neck, and a palace without roof. In the case of  a bad dream, he should perform an appeasement. He should repeat the mantra  with concentration. For three years, obstacles may arise for him who performs  mantra repetition. Should he be devoted to the mantra repetition regardless of  the host of obstacles, having faith in success, he attains success in the fourth  year. (Verses 94-97ab)  

INDICATIONS OF THE PERFECTION OF THE MANTRA  

Tranquillity of mind, contentment, hearing the sound of a drum, of a song, of  the sound of beating time; the vision of heavenly musicians; seeing his luster  as equal to that of the sun; the conquest of sleep and hunger; beauty, health,  composure, [and] the absence of anger and greed - if the connoisseur of the  mantra notices these and other signs, he should recognize the perfection of the  mantra [and] the deity's grace. Then he should make additional effort in mantra  repetition for attaining knowledge. One who has attained knowledge will have  his purpose accomplished. He is liberated from existence, knowing that the  self is the highest brahman, as explained by the Vedanta [texts]. (Verses 97cd 101)  

CONCLUDING VERSE  

I worship that Brahman, the all-pervading Lord who, in the form of various  deities, grants man [fulfillment of his] desire. (Verse 102) 

### 27 The Worship of Kali According to the Todala Tantra  

Sanjukta Gupta  

To many Hindu Bengalis, Kali is the most important divinity. Identified with the  great Goddess, Devi Bhagavati, she subsumes all other goddesses. She is held to  be equal in status to Durga and their annual festivals, which occur close to each  other, are celebrated with the greatest grandeur: feasts are held, gifts are ex 

changed, and new clothes are worn in honor of the Goddess. Both Durga and  Kali, facets of the same supreme Goddess, are fierce and aggressive. The Goddess  is the embodiment of the divine power, potency, and dynamism. After the great  dissolution of the worlds she regenerates the creation and sustains it until the  time arrives when she must withdraw it into herself. She possesses both negative  and positive elements in her divine personality. She is the nurturing Mother of  created beings as well as the sovereign cosmic ruler who maintains cosmic law  and order through her invincible power and irresistible energy. She punishes the  evil and rewards the righteous. Above all, she protects all her creatures and is  especially kind and sweet to her loyal devotees, like an indulgent mother to her  devoted children.  

The cult of Kali has a long history of development in which her character has  undergone many changes. In an essay on "Saivism and the Tantric Tradition,"  Alexis Sanderson explains that in the ninth and tenth centuries C.E., the Kashmiri  Tantric exegetes classified and systematized Tantric texts according to the various  cults, mainly of goddesses and fearsome gods. The main emphasis was on specific  mantras and esoteric practices associated with those mantras, one of which is  called the Seat of Awareness (vidya-pitha). The texts dealing with the most esoteric  Kali cults are associated with the vidya-pitha. The practices they prescribe include  the so-called left-hand tradition (vama-marga), antinomian practices that involve  alcohol, blood, and sex; these came to be called Kaula practices. The name vidya.  here denotes esoteric mantras that are considered embodiments of the supreme  knowledge or awareness that is indeed Kali. Here she is called Kali not because  of her dark complexion but because she absorbs and transcends Time (tola), and  is thus the eternal transcendent reality (Kalasamkarsini). Kali thus became the464 SANJUKTA GUPTA  

supreme godhead of this cult transcending even Siva. This Kali cult developed  through various streams and survived in the cult of Guhyakali, worshiped in  Nepal as Guhyesvari and in Mithila (Bihar) even today (Sanderson 1990: 138- 54). At the same period in Kashmir, there grew up a strong parallel Tantric cult  known as the cult of the three goddesses, the Trika. They are Para, transcendent;  Parapara, transcendent as well as material; and Apara, material. The second and  the third are related to the cosmic process of creation; the second is the state in  which the transcendent unity of reality is disturbed and the goddess experiences  the stir of polarized existence within herself, which heralds the next moment in  the cosmic evolution of diverse creation.  

As Sanderson points out, these two cults affected one another. "The cult of the  three goddesses and that of Kali were not sealed off from each other in the manner  of rival sects. The Jay adrathayamala shows that the devotees of Kali had developed  their own versions of the cult of the three goddesses. The Trika in its turn assim 

ilated these and other new and more esoteric treatments from the left. Conse quently we find a later Trika in which Kalasamkarsini has been introduced to be  worshipped above the three goddesses of the trident" (Sanderson 1990: 146).  This tendency continued throughout the history of the Kali cult and is clearly  noticeable in the Sakti-samgama Jantra (1.1.28-47), in which the three goddesses  of the vidyas - Kali, Tara, and Chinna, that is, Chinnamasta - form a kind of  triad. Indeed, Sanderson has described how the adherents of the Kali cult inter preted the name Kali. "So, as Abhinavagupta tells us in his Tantraloka, the auton omous consciousness which is the Absolute is called Kali (i) because it throws,  in the sense that it projects the universe, causing to appear as though beyond it  . . . ; (ii) because through it the projection returns to ('goes to') its identity as  cognition . . . ; (iii) because it knows the projected, in the sense that it represents  it as identical with its own identity . . . ; (iv) because it enumerates the projection,  in the sense that it distinguishes each element from all the others within its own  unity . . . ; and (v) because it sounds, in the sense that when it has dissolved the  projection it continues as the resonance of internal self-awareness" (Sanderson  1990: 164).  

In the Mahavidya cult, the primary goddess-emanations from Kali the supreme  and absolute consciousness form a horizontal triad at the cosmic differentiated  level, that is, Mahamaya, Sundarr and Bhairavi, to replace the Puranic triad of  Brahma, Visnu, and Rudra/Siva (Brown 1974: 118-80). Although Brahma and  so on were not totally removed from their cosmic functions, they moved to a  subservient position.  

The Todala Tantra, translated below, was probably composed relatively late, in  the fourteenth century C.E, It is a small Tantra that contains ten chapters (patalas)  with 398 verses. It became very popular in Bengal, especially in the early modern  period, and has been quoted as a scriptural authority in many Bengali priestly  handbooks such as the Purohita-darpana on the ritual worship of Daksina Kali,  also called Adya Kali. Our text is mainly interested in the ritual worship of Kali  and other Mahavidyas. It mentions all the Mahavidyas, who are here more than 

WORSHI P O F KALI 465  

ten in number, and also mentions their companions, who are different manifes tations of Siva. It succinctly gives all the ritual sequences needed for the worship  of the first two Mahavidyas, including the esoteric formulas (mantras) and the  accompanying process of meditation (see Gupta 1977: 125-57). It also records  a complete program of Siva worship with mantras and so on, which seems to be  the same for every manifestation. According to it, it is imperative to worship Siva  immediately after worshiping the relevant Mahavidya.  

In the traditional way, the text is presented as a dialogue between Siva and his  divine spouse Parvati, who is the pupil and the interlocutor, whereas Siva is the  teacher of the sacred science (sastra). Very little theological or ontological dis cussion is found in the text, though often it refers to the ultimacy of Kali. The  text gives important information about the esoteric meaning of the mantras of the  first three Mahavidyas and the practice of Tantric yoga; the esoteric kundalini yoga receives special treatment. Inheriting the Krama tradition of monistic power theism (sakti-advaya), the Todala Tantra asserts that esoteric yoga is higher than  esoteric rituals, as the latter involve differentiated awareness whereas yoga does  not. This is elaborated by means of a description of kundalini-yoga, giving a  detailed parallel of the microcosm with the macrocosm. Kundalini-yoga leads to  release from samsara as the yogin becomes one with the Goddess, having severed  the veil of delusion, maya, by means of vidya. In connection with esoteric yoga  practice, our text gives three important yogic postures: the yoni mudra, svalpa  yoni mudra, and kakicancu mudra. All are postures for practicing kundalini yoga,  where controlling the flow of air in the body by blocking all natural outlets of air  is of the highest importance. Although it presents mantras and rituals concerning  the Mahavidyas, the treatment is so brief that the text needs to be supplemented  by other handbooks, such as the Tantrasara of Krenananda or Kaulavalinirnaya  of Jnananandagiri (see Goudriaan and Gupta 1981: 139, 144).  

In order to understand the theological background of our text, we have to turn  to other scriptural sources from the medieval period (roughly 1200 to 1800 C.E.).  They mainly belong to eastern India, and some may be from Bengal. By this time  the Tara-Ugratara-Ekajata cult of the Buddhist Tantric tradition merged into the  Kali and other Mahavidya cults presented in the Todala Tantra. To understand  the history and nature of Kali, the supreme Goddess, in eastern India in the  medieval period (roughly 1200 C.E. to 1800 C.E.), three texts can be considered  the most important. One is the Sakti-samgama Tantra (SsT), a large compendium  of the rituals and mantras and other esoteric practices associated with Kali and  her other manifestations. This text, as well as the Tantrasara and the Devima hatmya (DM), which constitutes the final section of the Markandeya Purana, have  shaped the Tantric philosophy, theology, and practice of the Kali cult in Bengal.  There the Devimahatmya is simply called Candi (the fierce lady), and devout Tan 

tries recite it daily. In fact Kali's iconography, as followed by the traditional image  makers, shows traces of the description of the goddess Kali in that text.  The Devimahatmya represents Kali as a minor emanation of the Goddess, a  demonic figure, fearsome and grotesque. Having emanated from the angry third 

466 SANJUKTA GUPTA  

eye of the supreme Goddess to help the Goddess in her battle against the demon  host of Sumbha and Nisumbha, she was employed to lick up every drop of blood  of Raktabija, the demon general. Raktabija's peculiarity was that even a drop of  his blood shed on the earth produced countless clones. Kali's lolling tongue sym 

bolizes this blood-licking task. Her demonic nature is also symbolized by her  fangs and by the countless severed heads and limbs dripping blood that cover  her body. She is intoxicated by drinking blood, and in her frenzy she laughs  loudly, baring her upper teeth.  

The Kalika Purana (KP), on the other hand, describes Kali as possessing a  soothing dark complexion, as perfectly beautiful, riding a lion, four-armed, hold ing a sword and blue lotuses, her hair unrestrained, body firm and youthful (KP  5.52). A third view is found in such Tantric texts as the Sakti-samgama Tantra,  where Kali, naked, is seated on the supine body of Siva, immersed in the pleasure  of reverse sexual intercourse with him. These three separate views of the supreme  goddess Kali have influenced her modern iconography, although the third variety,  the goddess seated on the inert body of Siva, is rarely used outside esoteric wor ship. In the Sakti-samgama Tantra, though, we get two quite different descriptions  of Kali. In her supreme state, Kali is, as Sanderson describes, just the light of pure  consciousness, but in the creating state she is depicted in a form more awe inspiring than charming.  

The supreme Goddess is forever associated with the supreme god Siva, the pair  forming an indivisible unit. But in this late tradition, Kali often supersedes Siva  and acts independently to initiate creation. Although creation is based on her  aspect as Maya, this often appears to be a biological activity. This point is em 

phasized in the iconography of Kali and Tara, both of whom appear to be having  coitus with Siva, who is lying like a corpse. Siva's representation as a corpse  emphasizes his total inertness and passivity in the act of creation; the initiative in  creation belongs to the Goddess. Therefore Siva is not a corpse but is only de 

picted as one. The Todala Tantra emphasizes this point. Kali's association with  Visnu as Visnu-maya is also underscored in this tradition. In order to enhance  the supremacy of the Goddess, the Devimahatmya took over the early Vaisnava  myth of the creation of the earth from the marrow and fat of two demons called  Madhu and Kaitabha, and replaced Visnu with Devi as the slayer of the demons.  The Kalika Purana, in fact, calls the cult of the supreme Goddess Vaisnavi Tantra,  and the main mantra, which is a salutation to the supreme deity with some  mystical syllables added, indeed addresses that deity: Om hrim srim vaisnavyai  namam. This has been noted by Brown: "Thus does the Devi Bhagavati, although  eternal, manifest herself again and again for the protection of the world, O King"  (Devimahatmya 12.36), clearly echoing the famous description of Visnu/Krsna's  avataras in the fourth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita (Brown 1990: 133-34). Both  the Todala Tantra and Sakti-samgama Tantra make some sort of equation between  the ten avataras of Visnu and the ten great vidya emanations of the Goddess. Her  closeness to Visnu/Krsna is often mythicized when she is cast as Visnu's sister or  the embodiment of Visnu's maya. In late tradition the Goddess superseded all  three cosmic gods - Brahma, Visnu, and Rudra. 

WORSHIP OF KALI 467  

The Sakti-samgama Tantra describes the creative activity of the goddess Kali as  follows: Daksina (compassionate) Kali, the primeval goddess, was dancing the  dance of cosmic dissolution surrounded by howling jackals and other carrion devouring beasts. The destroyed universe lay at her feet like a heap of corpses.  Kali is pure consciousness, totally transcendent, the unique Being. She subsumes  both Siva and the divine Power, Sakti. At a certain primordial moment, Kali  suddenly saw inside herself her own mirror image or shadow, which is indeed  delusion, Maya. In that Maya, Kali created the imagined form of Siva, who became  the primeval god and Kali's spouse. Kali then created empty space, and the chaos  of the destroyed universe disappeared as she engaged in sexual intercourse with  Siva, taking the reverse position and the active role. After a long coitus, Kali  produced one fetus, which developed into a perfectly beautiful girl whom Kali  called Sundari, the beautiful lady. Her beauty completely deluded Siva, who  wanted to put into words his agitation and longing. Siva's longing and desire for  self-expression produced Speech, which from its central unity developed into the  system of sounds, letters, and language, and became all-pervasive. Siva, however,  on creating Speech, first addressed the goddess Sundari as his heart's desire, the  loveliest in the three worlds, the exquisite sovereign deity and the ocean of nec tarlike compassion. Next Siva addressed Kali as most terrifying, howling like a  jackal, cruel-fanged and fearfully ugly, with lolling tongue and frightening roar.  As Siva uttered these two sentences addressing the two goddesses, Kali, as if  offended, suddenly disappeared, leaving Siva with Sundari, the product of delu sion, to get on with the task of creation. Kali, who is transcendent and the essence  of the creation, transformed herself into the abstract cosmic dynamic power. But  Siva became utterly despondent and confused without Kali; therefore the com 

passionate Kali removed Siva's confusion and infused him with unimpeded cog nitive knowledge and desire to procreate. Moreover, in order to infuse him with  power she taught Siva the method of Tantric kundalini yoga and gave him as his  partner the beautiful goddess who is indeed the mother of the universe, Ambika,  the cosmic Creatrix (SsT 1.1.22-45).  

This myth neatly puts forward the idea that the transcendent supreme divinity  is female; that she is the goddess Daksina Kali, who contains both the cosmic  male and female polarity; that she is the sovereign cosmic ruler who regulates the  system of creation; and that the creation is based on cosmic delusion, which is  her mirror image. This divine delusion, named Maya or Mahamaya, is Kali's divine  capacity, which ensures that in spite of the perfect oneness of Kali and Siva, the  latter is separated in an imaginary form by means of Kali's delusory power. Siva  is then deluded into thinking himself to be a separate divinity from Kali and so  feels the attraction of the delusory image of Sundari. Thus the main idea of mo nism, which emphasizes the unity of a single universal essence, and establishes  the illusoriness of the dualistic worldview, is put forward through a creation myth.  The polarized male and female cosmic divinities are results of delusion. In reality,  the supreme goddess Kali is unique and immutable, yet she is the source and  foundation of all creation. Kali, the eternally existent Reality, transcends both  creation and the dissolution of the creation. The appearance of her beautiful 

4 6 8 SANJUKTA GUPTA  

mirror image, Maya, heralds creation as an evolutionary process, and at that point  of primeval creation Kali, the pure consciousness who exists beyond the reach of  speech and phenomenal creation, disappears behind delusion and its influence - desire - and becomes the cosmic dynamic energy activating the ongoing process  of creation. Siva at the point of creation is the primordial conscious entity, Purusa.  He possesses vidya, omniscience, and iccha, sexual desire, to procreate; and he  is called Sadasiva who, together with Sundari, becomes the primordial couple  (SsT 1.1.103-6). In Tantric ontology, he is Siva-tattva, the cosmic self. The evolv 

ing Sakti/Maya, who is identical with the supreme Goddess, is known as Vidya tattva. Together with the individual self, Atma-tattva, they constitute the cosmic  realities who are ultimately one and same.  

The nature of the supreme goddess, Mahadevi, and that of supreme delusion,  Mahamaya, are expounded in the Devimahatmya. The Goddess is called Maha maya, the great delusion when she is seen as responsible for the unsatisfactory  and transient nature of this life. The real cause of this is human desire for pos sesion and procreation, and Mahamaya deludes individuals by making desire their  innate quality. But paradoxically the Goddess is also identified as supreme knowl edge, Vidya, which releases individuals from their bondage of desire and the  consequent endless succession of lives and deaths. This is one of the many par adoxes that constitute the mystery of the Goddess's divine nature.  

Another important statement in Devimahatmya identifies Maya with Prakrti  which, in the dualistic Samkhya philosophy, is the primordial evolving matter.  This identity was first recorded in the Svetasvatara Upanisad (4.9-10). Coburn  (1996: 34) explains this as follows: "On the basis of such passages (DM 1.59 and  4.6) it seems safe to say that the Devi" Mahatmya has shifted the focus of the  Samkhya school and the Svetasvatara Upanisad by understanding prakrti not as  the material shroud or possession of spirit but as itself supremely divine, as Devi  herself." The Sakti-samgama Tantra (1.100) confirms this view by saying that the  supreme Sakti, that is, the Goddess, is Prakrti whereas her mirror image is the  evolving power Mahamaya. Thus Prakrti here refers to the supreme Goddess, who  ultimately is the unique source and origin of all, there being nothing outside of  her.  

The Todala Tantra endorses this theological tradition in its accounts of the  nature of the goddess Daksinakali and her other Vidya emanations. Other im portant texts for the development of Kali and her Mahavidya cult are the Cinacara krama Tantra, Matrka-bheda Tantra, Gupta-sadhana Tantra, Kalika Purana,  Brahma-vaivarta Purana, Brahmanda Purana and other Tantric records of that pe riod. The salient feature of this tradition is the total supremacy of the goddess  Kali. In the words of Brown (1990: 217-18),  

of the two genders, the feminine represents the dominant power and the authoritative  will in the universe. Yet both genders must be included in the ultimate if it is truly  ultimate. The masculine and feminine are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality,  which goes beyond but still encompasses them. The Devi, in her supreme 

WORSHIP OF KALI 469  

form as consciousness thus transcends gender, but her transcendence is not apart  from her immanence. Indeed this affirmation of the oneness of transcendence and  immanence constitutes the very essence of the divine mother, as presented in the  Purana (Devi-bhagavata). And here we see what may be called "the ultimate triumph"  of the goddess in our text. It is not finally, that she is infinitely superior to the male  gods - though she is that, according to the myths in the Devi-bhagavata - but rather  that she transcends her own feminine nature as Prakrti without denying it.  

The speciality of the Sakti-samgama Tantra myth is that it neatly puts forward just  this point. Prakrti or the feminine source of the universe is Mahamaya, who is  not Kali but her mirror image. Kali transcends her own evolving mirror image.  In the universe of Mahamaya, both delusion and cognition function. In the case  of Siva, his delusion is restricted to his sexual desire for Sundari, whereas his  cognitive knowledge is otherwise untrammeled. In this sense, it is possible to find  a parallel between the three goddesses Kali, Mahamaya, and Sundari and the three  goddesses Para, Parapara and Apara of the Trika tradition. Sundari corresponds  to the third deity of the Trika triad, that is, Apara (SsT 1.1.102). The Todala  Tantra (1.7-8) confirms this with the statement that she is called the fivefold  lady, Pancami, because she is differentiated as the five cosmic elements.  

Kali and the Cult of the Ten Mahavidyas  

The Todala Tantra describes the ritual worship of the ten sacred esoteric formulas,  the Mahavidyas. The word vtdya has various Tantric connotations. The great God dess is Vidya because she is perfect knowledge unimpeded by any differentiated  or discursive cognition - cognition without any reference to anything cognized.  This pure cognition brings about release. Vidya also connotes an esoteric formula  which, empowered by its Sakti deity, is capable of bestowing on its Tantric wor shiper great powers (bhukti) and eventually salvation (mukti). These ten Mahavi dyas or great mystic formulas are those of Kali, Tara, Sodasi (also known as  Sundari or Tripurasundari, meaning the Beautiful One in the Three Worlds),  Bhuvanesvari (Sovereign of the Three Worlds), Bhairavi or Tripurabhairavi (the  Fierce Lady), Chinnamasta (the Beheaded Lady), Dhumavati (the Gray Lady, who  is depicted in iconography as a widow with a crow as her symbol), Bagala (the  goddess of battle), Matangi (the goddess of the hunter tribes), and Kamala  (Laksmi). It is obvious that originally the number of formulas was not fixed at  ten. Early texts, such as the Todala Tantra, mention a few other formulas, includ ing those of Durga, Annapurna, and Kulluka. The first two are universally popular  goddesses, and the third became very important in the esoteric practices of the  mantras and vidyas. The Sakti-samgama Tantra, being an encyclopaedic text, men tions both a group of ten Mahavidyas and also other lists of Mahavidyas not  confined to ten members.  

The importance of this group of great formulas and their power goddesses grew 

470 SANJUKT A GUPT A  

enormously in late Tantric, tradition and the goddess Kali became foremost  amongst them. She is considered the original power deity, designated Adya, the  primeval lady. The Todala Tantra deals only with the mantras and ritual worship  of Kali and Tara, whereas Sundari is treated in a rather fragmentary fashion. But  the full treatment of their mantras, especially the monosyllabic seed (bija) mantras,  to some extent covers the other Mahavidyas too, except for Dhumavati. This last  is a somewhat problematic figure: it is difficult to understand why she is included  in this group of power goddesses. Like other ordinary deities, such as Ganesa,  her seed mantra simply consists of the first syllable of her name, dhum. Thus,  although the formulas of each of these goddesses are different, their identities are  not always easy to determine and differentiate. It is also difficult to date the  beginning of their popularity or the crystallization of the group of ten. The Brhad dharma Purana (BdhP) presents the myth of how the ten Mahavidyas appeared in  the following manner:  

Siva's wife Sati heard that her father Daksa was arranging the performance of  a huge sacrifice to which all the gods and other celestials were invited except  herself and Siva. Incensed, she told her husband that she was going to her father's  sacrifice to teach him a lesson in sensible behaviour. Siva knew Daksa's animosity  toward himself and Sati, and feared that Sati would be insulted, with catastrophic  results, and so tried to dissuade her from going. Sati became irritated, and changed  into her true Kali form, which she had suppressed when she had agreed to be  born as the beautiful daughter of Daksa and Prasuti, in order to marry Siva. Upon  seeing her terrifying transformation, Siva became completely confused and began  to run away. Even her reassuring words failed to stop him. Then the Goddess  appeared in one of her manifestations in each of the directions as Siva tried to  flee. Finally, at Siva's request, the Goddess explained that she herself was the  supreme reality Kali, the source of all phenomena. At the request of Daksa and  his wife, she had manifested herself as their exquisitely beautiful daughter Sati  and then married Siva. The ten manifestations who were blocking Siva's way in  every direction were her own vidya-manifestations. Before him, that is, to the east,  appeared the Mahavidya Kali; above him, Tara; on his right (south), Chinnamasta;  to his rear, (west), Bagala; on his left, (north), Bhuvanesvari; to his southeast,  Dhumavati; to his southwest, Sundari; to his northwest, Matahgi; to his northeast,  Sodasi; and immersed in his self was Bhairavi. At this revelation of the real identity  and powers of the Goddess, Siva apologized to her for assuming spousal authority  and stopped resisting her departure to her father's home. As a result, Daksa was  ruined, but escaped with his life; Sati, however, lost her life out of the anger and  shame caused by her father's actions (BdhP 2.6.65-89, 128-52).  

Let us now attempt to find out who these ten Mahavidyas are. There seems to  be nearly no difference between Kali and Tara in the eastern tradition. The Ma hacinacara-krama Tantra 2.37 explains that in the Mahacina tradition, antinomian  practices are essential for Tara worship. The Todala Tantra agrees about these  special features of Tara. Although the Todala Tantra prescribes for Tara's worship  the use of the five esoteric ingredients (meat, fish, alcohol, woman, and sexual 

WORSHI P O F KALI 471  

fluids) that signify vamacara practice, it appears to believe that these practices are  not essential for Kali worship. Perhaps this is why this text has been taken in  Bengal to be the scriptural authority for the nonesoteric worship of Kali, both in  temples and in private homes. Other texts like Brhat-nila Tantra and Maha-nirvana  Tantra assert that these practices are essential for Kali worship. However, the  Mahdcinacara-krama Tantra, having said that the four goddesses Daksina Kali,  Tara, Sundari, and Bhairavi share the same style of worship, informs us in a later  statement (2.38) that the latter two goddesses share another, presumably more  orthodox, style of worship (that is, daksinacara), but that the former two must be  adored with antinomian practices (that is, vamacara). In the Brhat-nila Tantra,  Tara is called Nilasarasvati and is described as resting on the corpse, that is, Siva,  in a fighting attitude with her left leg advanced and her right drawn back, young  and smiling yet of awe-inspiring appearance, garlanded with severed heads, short,  pot-bellied, powerful, and wearing a tigerskin. She has four arms and her tongue  is lolling. She has flame-colored matted tresses held on the top of her head in a  single mass on which the face of Aksobhya is placed. She is also addressed as  Ekajata and Ugratara. The popular iconography of Kali, as already noted, is not  very different from Tara's, except for the hair: Kali's hair is loose and disheveled.  All these peculiar features of Tara show her close affinity with the Buddhist god dess Tara (Saviouress), who is very popular among the Buddhists of Tibet and  other Himalayan regions. The Todala Tantra and Sakti-samgama Tantra also name  Aksobhya as Tara's spouse, although a curious myth is offered in the Todala Tantra  to explain how Siva came to be known by that name. The Todala Tantra gives  her seed mantra as strim. Another source, namely, the Pancaratra Laksmi Tantra,  equates Tara with the supreme divine Power that is identical with Vac, the goddess  Speech (Gupta 1972: 177-83; 286-96).  

Sodasi and Bhuvanesvari are, it seems, variations of Sundari and Bala and be long to the cult of Tripurasundari or Lalita; on this, see the Parasurama-kalpa  Sutra (PkS). Bhairavi alias Tripurabhairavi also belongs to the same cult. Chin namasta or the Beheaded Lady is depicted as a goddess standing in a fighting  posture with her left leg forward and right leg drawn back. Her right hand holds  a sword with which she has just severed her own head. Three streams of blood  flow from her neck; that on her left is being drunk by a minor goddess called  Dakini, that on her right by Varnini, and the middle one spouts upward and is  being drunk by the goddess's own severed head. She stands on a prone woman  who is in coitus with a supine man lying under her. This couple is considered to  be Madana, the god of sexual desire, and his wife Rati, sexual pleasure. The  goddess is the embodiment of the powerful mantra hum, and is addressed as  Vajravairocani, which again points to a Buddhist goddess (Kinsley 1997: 144- 66). A curious myth is recounted in Sakti-samgama Tantra 4.5.152-73 to explain  this gory iconography. The goddess suddenly left her spouse Siva in the midst of  their amorous play. When she reappeared, Siva asked her why she had disap peared so suddenly and why now she looked so pale. The goddess explained that  she had had to go to bathe together with her friends Dakini and Varnini, who 

472 SANJUKT A GUPT A  

were hungry. After their bath, the goddess had provided meals for all three of  them with her own blood as it gushed from her severed neck.  Bagala or Bagalamukhi is a golden-complexioned form of Tripurasundari, the  deity who presides over deadly weapons. It is difficult to identify Dhumavati, who  is tall, dark, rough, and sick-complexioned. Her hair is thin and matted, and her  disposition is restless and bellicose. She wears soiled clothes and rides a chariot  with a banner displaying a crow. She is seen as an incarnation of all that is sordid,  antisocial, and inauspicious in women, an antithesis of the goddess Sri. She is  depicted as a widow, who has allegedly gobbled up her husband Siva in a fit of  hunger. She was born from the smoking fire of the destruction of Daksa's sacrifice  and the death of Sati. Frowning, she howls desolately and carries a winnowing  fan. Laksmana Desika, the commentator on the Saradatilaka Tantra (24.9-14),  states that Dhumavati is the same goddess as Jyesthya.  

The last two Mahavidyas are again familiar to the Lalita cult. Matangi is the  same as Syamala in that cult. She is mainly considered to be the deity presiding  over such fine arts as the power to compose poetry. She is exquisitely beautiful  and is dark complexioned, but otherwise closely resembles Lalita in appearance  (PkS 6.1-39). The tenth Mahavidya is goddess Laksmi alias Sri alias Kamala,  the spouse of Visnu - although she too is closely related to the mantra of  Tripurasundari.  

Tantric Esoteric Practice  

The Todala Tantra belongs to the corpus of Tantric scriptures that make up the  Mantra marga or Mantra path. The term Mantra marga means the entire Tantric  paradigm of ritual worship and meditation. Every mantra possesses a paradig matical ritual system of its own, a pattern that has become more or less fixed,  with variations to fit the relevant mantra and its deity, as well as the performer's  intended application (Gupta, Hoens, and Goudriaan 1979: 121-57). Mantra marga is followed by Tantric practitioners for two broadly defined purposes: lib eration from the bondage of endless transmigration (samsara), or rewards such  as supernatural power and achievements - mukti and bhukti respectively. The  Todala Tantra is more concerned with mukti and hence does not deal with the  esoteric worship of any Mahavidyas other than the first three: Kali, Tara, and  Sundari (or Bhuvanesvari). Seekers of mukti are more respected than seekers of  power and achievement, although the latter are held in awe and are much sought  after by lay devotees for personal gain, such as protection from disease and mis fortune, and destroying enemies.  

The four important constituents in such esoteric Tantric worship are the pre liminaries, invocation, ritual service, and conclusion.  

Preliminaries. First, the divine is represented by esoteric formulas, hand gestures  (mudras), symbols of the deity worshiped mainly on a diagram (yantra), and 

WORSHIP OF KALI 47 3  

sometimes an image and a pitcher full of water. Second, the practitioner (sadhaka)  must have been properly initiated by a competent sectarian guru. Third, the wor shiper, the symbol of the deity, and the objects used for offering must be physi cally and mystically purified. Fourth is the ritual of security. Tantric esoteric  practices are considered to be full of dangers. Often they are personified as harm ful spirits that obstruct the worshiper's every movement. Therefore the worshiper  must take measures to remove these spirits from the sacred area of the ritual  worship, by making threatening sounds; by stamping one's foot, clapping, or  snapping one's fingers; by frowning and looking angry, and scattering threatening  objects such as white mustard seeds; by making threatening gestures imitating  shooting, and so forth. The fifth, and perhaps the most important, preliminary  rite is called nyasa. This means the installation, limb by limb, of the sacred man tras, which are the sonic manifestation of the divine, onto the material body of  the worshiper, thus replacing the mundane body of the worshiper with a sacred  body. The same installation is performed onto the deity's symbol for the same  purpose.  

Invocation. The goddess is invoked, first into the center or heart of the worshiper,  and thence onto the seat he has ritually prepared for her adoration.  

Ritual Service. The deity is first adored in meditative imagination, in which all  the objects of offering are of an abstract nature. Next, the Tantric practitioner  worships the Goddess with various objects of material enjoyment. This is followed  by the service of the Goddess's spouse, Siva, and then her entourage, the minor  gods and goddesses encircling her. This is followed by the offering (ball), which  in the Mahavidya cult almost always implies an animal sacrifice, that is, beheading  an animal in front of the image. The animal offering is followed by a fire sacrifice.  Then a short meditation is done by means of repeating the main mantra a certain  number of times (japa). The ritual offerings culminate, for the followers of the  vamacara, with the offerings of the five objects (meat, fish, etc.). Finally, the  worshiper offers the deity all the merit he has accrued from performing the service.  He also offers himself to the goddess. These last two ritual acts refer to two very  important concepts: renunciation and loyal devotion. The first requires an utter  annihilation of one's ego and greed. Even the greed for accumulating merit for  the ego-person must be destroyed. The second is rooted in the concept of bhakti,  which came to mean total surrender to one's adored deity. The devotee offers all  that belongs to himself and then offers his individuality as well.  

Conclusion. Having invoked a fierce manifestation of the Goddess and worshiped  it with some parts of the already offered objects for his own success and that of  his ritual service, the worshiper recites certain set formulas for his physical well being, and then recites hymns to the Goddess. Having partaken of a little of the  offered food as the Goddess's grace, the worshiper has fulfilled his daily obligatory  ritual service of his Goddess and is free to follow his normal way of life.474 SANJUKTA GUPTA  

Tantra Ritual Practice  

The Todala Tantra does not discuss Tantric initiation, and indeed, it does not  discuss any theological concepts at all. It starts by describing the procedure for  the ritual worship of Kali. The first ritual act is to worship one's guru mentally.  The guru is identified with the supreme deity Kali when she is united with Siva  immediately prior to creation. This text is meant for experienced Tantric practi 

tioners who are versed in the Tantric meditation on the kundalini, the contracted  and inert form of the creatrix goddess Kali as she remains immanent in every  creature (Eliade 1969: 200-67). The aim of Tantric meditation is to arouse the  kundalini by means of breath control (pranayama) and one-pointed meditation  (dhyana) on the practitioner's deity, who when awakened longs to unite with Siva  and swiftly flies upward through the innermost passage of the practitioner's yogic  body, which contains six spiritual centers. At the top of this passage, just above  the practitioner's body, the creating Goddess is united with Siva, and this divine  area, transcending the creation at a point prior to creation, is imagined as a sphere  or a lotus with countless petals (sahasrara cakra). This united yet differentiated  stance of the supreme Goddess and Siva is what the Tantric practitioner endeavors  to understand and identify with. This is liberation because it transcends creation.  The practitioner's guru is already liberated and is thus one with this two-in-one  divinity. Even before the practioner actually leaves his bed, he performs the kun dalinl meditation on his guru while repeating his name, declaring his total sub mission to him. Only then does he start his daily obligatory ritual acts (Gupta  1979: 130-39).  

Bhutasuddhi  

The next important ritual is the purification of the practitioner's material body,  which is composed of five cosmic elements (bhutasuddhi). This is again a form of  meditation: the practitioner meditates on each of the five ontological elements,  starting with the element of solidity/earth and ending with ether/undefined space.  He eliminates each element by dissolving it into the element preceding it. Thus  in his imagination he contracts the entire differentiated creation in its microcosmic  form, arriving at the center of the countless-petaled lotus circle, where the energy  of the Goddess burns away the impurities of his microcosm, eliminating any  residual elements. Saturated and rejuvenated by the nectar produced by the coitus  of the divine couple, the microcosm is recreated, pure and consubstantial with  the divine. The import of such daily meditative rites as bhutasuddhi is to repeat  the process of internalizing the theological explanation of salvation as a direct  experience of one's true identity with vidya, nondual pure awareness, which in  turn is but the supreme goddess Kali in her transcendental form. 

WORSHIP OF KALI 475  Mantra and Nyasa  

After this renewed confirmation of his consubstantiality with Kali, the practitioner  can replace his purified mundane body with the divine personality, that is, vidya,  through the rite of nyasa. In this rite the mantras and their sonic source (matrka),  the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, are the most important concepts. Mantras are  the sonic forms of their deities, just as the images are their visual forms. The  mantras of Kali and Tara are therefore considered to be the mantra bodies of these  two goddesses. The Todala Tantra explains the concept of the Goddess's mantra  physique in its sixth chapter. It is a Tantric custom to analyze the mantra of a  deity into several components. The most important part is the seed or bija mantra.  Mahavidyas like Kali or Tara have several such seeds, one of which is considered  to be chief. The seed is the essence of a mantra. After the seed(s) comes the name  of the deity. As the complete mantra is a sentence, the name is either inflected as  a vocative, or is declined in the dative when it is followed by the term namas,  which means "obeisance." Conventionally, formulas known as vidyas are consid ered to be of feminine gender, which requires them to end in svaha. But in the  case of the mantras found in the Todala Tantra, several seed mantras are often  inserted before the word svaha. It is interesting to note that this word is used for  offering Vedic oblations, and is mythologized as the name of the fire god Agni's  spouse. However, a practitioner receives his personal esoteric mantra from his  guru who, knowing the initiate's special disposition, chooses a specific variant of  his chosen deity. This then becomes the initiated practitioner's main or mula  mantra. The main mantra, which is considered the full physical form of its deity,  is divided into six main limbs (angas). These are the heart, the head, the tuft of  hair, the eyes, the weapon, and the armored torso. These six limbs symbolize the  deity's entire body. In the rite of nyasa the worshiper first invests his hands and  fingers with sacred formulas and then invests his six limbs with the same parts  of his main mantra. Because the supreme goddess is Vac, Speech, the worshiper  uses the matrka mantra for some specific nyasa, since that is the Goddess's pri mordial manifestation. In the worship of Kali, matrka nyasa is performed in six  different ways.  

Mudra  

Mudra has more than one meaning. Its primary meaning is "seal," but in Tantric  terminology, mudra means a hand gesture or a posture of seated meditation (usu ally called asana), and in the context of the five esoteric ingredients of offerings  to the Goddess, it may either mean a female partner for ritual practice or just a  snack. There are many uses of mudras or hand gestures as the practitioner pro ceeds mentally to encounter divine and spiritual beings in his rituals. All actions  at this stage are accompanied by miming, and often they are so graphic that it is  easy to understand their meaning. For instance, for the dhyana or envisaging of 

476 SANJUKT A GUPT A  

the deity, the worshiper utters the deity's mantra of her iconography while acting  out in gestures the deity's special attributes. Thus, while uttering Kalika's dhyana  mantra - "Om, you seated on a corpse, of fierce appearance with terrifying teeth,  who bestows desired objects [on her devotees], who laughs [all the time], who  has three eyes, holds in her hands a skull and a sword, whose hair is untied and  tongue is lolling out incessantly drinking the blood [of the asuras]. One should  envisage you, O Goddess, [as] having four arms whose other two hands gesture  fulfilment of the devotee's wishes and who promises protection" - the adept ges tures with his fingers, graphically symbolizing the attributes described in that  mantra. These are called the yoni, bhutini, vara, abhaya, khadga, and munda  mudras (see Figure 27.1).  

The Devanagari edition of the Todala Tantra was published in 1970, in Tantra sarngraha part 2, edited by Gopinath Kaviraj from the Yoga-Tantra department of  Benares Sankrit University, Varanasi. There are several Bengali published editions,  as well. The edition I have used is Todala Tantra, edited, translated, and com mented on in Bengali by Pancanana Sastri (Calcutta: Navabharata Publications,  1976).

WORSHIP OF KALI 479  

12cd-13cd. One should worship Siva as a headless trunk (kabandha) by the  right side of Chinnamasta [the Beheaded Goddess]. He who does tantric ritual  worship of Kabandha [Siva] certainly becomes the lord of all tantric perfection  (siddhi). Dhumavati, the great Vidya, is manifest in the form of a widow [hence  there is no form of Siva by her side].  

14. The one-faced great Rudra (the Fierce One) is worshiped by the right hand  side of Bagala. He is famed as the annihilator [performing the contraction] of  the creation.  

15. By Matahgi's right side one should worship Matahga Siva. He indeed is the  Daksinamurti who is in the form of universal bliss.  

16. [A worshiper (sadhaka)] should worship Sadasiva in the form of Visnu by  Kamala's right side. O great sovereign Goddess, there is no doubt that he would  achieve perfection (siddhi).  

17. By the right side of Annapurna [a sadhaka] should worship the great sov ereign god [Siva], the bestower of great liberation (moksa), who is the manifest  brahman and who possesses ten faces.  

18-19ab. [He] should carefully worship [Siva as] Narada by the right side of  Durga. The syllable na stands for the creator, and the syllable da always rep resents the protector. Because the syllable ra symbolizes the destroyer Narada,  it is held [to represent the great god Siva who creates, sustains, and destroys  the universe].  

19cd-19ef. For all other Vidyas, the seer (rsi) [of the vidya] mentioned in the  formula is indeed her [the vidya-sakti's] husband and should be worshiped by  her right side.  

Explanation of Siva's Transformation into a Corpse  

Who Nonetheless Has Sexual Union with the Goddess  

The blessed Goddess asked:  

20. The [great Sakti] who is the first great Vidya and also the second supreme  Bhairavi who is the mother of the three worlds and is eternal - how can she  be mounted on a corpse?  

The blessed Siva answered:  

21-23. O great Goddess! she who is the primordial [divine being], herself  Death/Time, exists [identified] as the heart [essence] of the glorious Siva in  the form of the destroyer. Therefore the supreme Death/Time (Mahakala) is  the destroyer of the universe. But when Kali as the embodiment of destruction  manifests herself in her true form, immediately at that very moment, O God 

dess, Sadasiva appears in the form of a corpse and at that instant, O Lady with  dancing eyes, she [Kali] appears mounted on a corpse. 

480 SANJUKTA GUPTA  The blessed Goddess said:  

24. The great god Sadasiva as a corpse is a lifeless body. How could it then  perform the sex act?  

The blessed Siva answered:  

25. At the time that great Kali [actively] manifests herself, Sadasiva is devoid  of active power. When, O Goddess, he is united with sakti, then he appears in  the form of Siva; [but though] when devoid of sakti he is virtually a corpse,  he still does not lose his manliness [his phallus].  

End of the first chapter, called a dialogue between Hara and Gauri,  of the most excellent of all Tantras, the Todala-tantra  

CHAPTER TWO  

Brief Enumeration of Kundalini Yoga  

The blessed Siva said:  

1-4. Listen O Goddess! 1 shall briefly recount the essence of yoga [meditation  and Tantric mental adoration].  

The [human] body is like a tree [in reverse form] whose roots are on top  and branches hanging beneath. All the sacred places of the universe exist within  this body. The very form of the macrocosm exists in the microcosm [of the  human body]. There are thirty and a half million sacred places in the macro 

cosm, O You who are praised by the heroes [Tantric practitioners]! Out of all  of these, only a hundred and forty thousand sacred places are visible. Out of  these, only fourteen [are noteworthy], and out of these [fourteen], only three  are auspicious. Amongst these [three again], O supreme sovereign Goddess,  [the one called] Mahadhira bestows liberation (mukti).  

5. Vasuki [the divine serpent] is indeed Mahamaya [the cosmic goddess of  delusion], who is manifest in the form of a serpent, coiled three and a half  times, and resides in the region under the nether region (patala).  

6-8. O supreme sovereign Goddess, listen carefully while I recount the seven  heavens [upper regions] in their proper order. [These are] the region of the  earth, of the atmosphere, of the celestials, then the region of maha [of the great  saints], the region of jana [generation], the region of tapa [austerity] and, O  Lady with an elegant face, the region of satya [truth]. Here ends the list of  seven regions. O eminent lady! now listen carefully to the enumeration of the  nether regions. [These are the regions of] atala, vitala, sutala, talatala, mahatala,  patala, and after that rasatala.  

9-17ab. The liberating [yogic duct, called nadi] Mahadhira ranges from ras atala to the end of satya, which exists inside the central [channel, that is, the 

WORSHI P OF KALI 481  

spinal column, meru]. Mahavisnu Siva resides in the satya region and Vasuki  is full of intense longing to meet him. When Vasuki, having pierced the six  regions (cakras), rises up [to that region of satya], all the other flowing rivers  [that is, the ducts] become upward flowing. In the body [the microcosm], O  sovereign Goddess, the ducts remain in the following order. If [the sadhaka]  presses down air through both the ida and pingala ducts, which have the sus umna between them, O sovereign Goddess, while repeating the prana mantra  [so'ham], then the coiled one [Vasuki] starts [moving upward through the  susumna] following the order of the [six cakras], until she approaches the  eternal and immutable lotus [the sahasrara cakra]. With anxiety the coiled one  enters that eternal abode. Simultaneously all other down-flowing [ducts] start  flowing upstream. At that moment, O Goddess! [the sadhaka] should concen 

trate on the garland of letters. Then while repeating mentally 108 times his  chief (mula) mantra [received from his preceptor at the time of initiation] the  intelligent [sadhaka] should bring the coiled one back to his muladhara cakra  [her original resting-place] in the same way, while refreshing the gods of the  six cakras with the nectar [from the thousand-petaled lotus].  

Yogic Mudras, or Special Physical Positions for Kundalini Yoga  

17cd-22ab. Now, my dear, I shall describe another yoga posture called the  yonimudra [the previous one was called sakti-calanl].  

The mantra practitioner first sits down on his seat facing the east or the  north. With his arms he firmly holds his two knees and then, O Queen of the  gods, he brings his nose near the knees while sitting upright [that is, keeping  his back straight]. O Queen of the gods, [as before] he presses air down by  inhaling (but, O great Goddess! does not let the air escape by exhaling), and  simultaneously continues repeating the prana mantra. At the same time, as  described before, he should repeat [his chief mantra] 108 times in his upright  pose, [only this time ] he repeats [the mantra ] in reverse order. While thus  [repeating his mantra], O You of glorious face, he brings [the kundalini] back  to the basic root cakra [muladhara] through the same path while refreshing  the gods of the six cakras with nectar.  

22cd-25. My dear, this yonimudra removes all illness. O Goddess, without  elaborating I can just say that it destroys great diseases and, O Goddess, without  exaggerating I can say that this mudra causes the realization of the mantra,  brings about the direct perception of one's [true] self, and bestows on the  practitioner the great liberation, mahamoksa. Had I possessed a hundred faces  I would not have been able to exhaust all its details; but with only five faces  how much can I enumerate? A Tantric practitioner practicing this mudra be 

comes as beautiful as Cupid even if he began as a leper.  

Here ends the second chapter of the Siva-Parvati dialogue  

in the Todala Tantra which is the best of all Tantras 

4 8 2 SANJUKTA GUPTA  

CHAPTER THREE  

The blessed goddess asked:  

1. 0 God of gods, great God, the saver from the ocean of transient and recur ring life [samsara], O Ocean of compassion, please tell me the great mudra  called baddhayoni.  

Siva answered:  

2-4ab. Listen, O Goddess, I shall briefly tell you the method of baddhayoni.  O great Goddess, the mantra practitioner covers his anus with the tip of his  penis. Then, O great Goddess, the intelligent practitioner gradually applies his  fingers [to cover other apertures of his body] starting with the thumbs, to  [cover] his ears, [and then in turn [covering his] eyes, nose, and mouth [with  rest of the pairs of fingers of his hands].  

4cd-7 . [Thus covering all his bodily apertures] he should then inhale through  his nose and fill his mouth with air and as before press it downward [through  the ida and pihgala ducts]. When [the coiled goddess unites with Siva] the  practitioner should envisage the primaeval Sound (sabda-brahman) and then  envisage the garland of syllables (varnamala) while repeating his main mantra.  Then, repeating the mantra so'ham, he brings, O Goddess, [the kundalini back  to the muladhara cakra] through the same central channel. On the way he  refreshes all the cakra gods [with the nectar produced by the union of the  goddess and Sadasiva]. O great sovereign Goddess! O spotless One! I shall tell  you [later] the achievements of one who peforms this [kundalini yoga seated  in baddhayoni posture].  

Kali's Mantra or Vidya  

The blessed Parvati asked:  

8. O omniscient Isana! O most excellent of the erudite, who possesses all  wisdom! O master of gods! please tell me the rare description of Kalika's mantra  system.  

The Bija [Seed] Mantra.  

The blessed Siva answered:  

9-13 . O ever-blissful Goddess, listen to my account of the excellent Kalika  mantra; even the mere discussion of its nature makes a man liberated in this  life. For the first [seed mantra], cull the syllable ka, add to it i, r, and the  bindunada [double nasalization, symbolized by a sickle shape topped by a point  representing the normal nasalization]. O auspicious One! this is the very rare  perfect vidya, the queen of all vidyas. 

WORSHIP OF KALI 483  The Vidya  

Now listen to me explaining the next one. First utter this seed [mantra krim]  three times. Then cull the syllable ha connected with the nasal bindu and the  vowel u [hum], [and utter] it twice [after the first three]; and now I tell you  the next one [that is the third seed mantra]. Then, O sovereign Goddess [utter  the syllable ha joined with r, i, and the nasal, and repeat it again [hrim hrim ];  then add [Kalika's ] vocative, then again three of the first seed mantra, then  twice the kurca mantra [hum] and twice the maya mantra [hrim] and finally  svaha. This mantra of twenty-five syllables is the queen of all vidyas and is very  rare.  

14. When this great vidya is preceded by the vagbhava mantra [aim, the  seed mantra of the supreme speech, Vac], its inherent deity is Srikali; when  preceded by the pranava mantra [Om], its deity is known as Siddhikalika.  

15-16. When the mantra consists of two of the goddess's own mantras [krim]  followed by one kurca mantra [hum], O great Goddess, this trisyllabic supreme  vidya is known as Camundakalika. There is no vidya like this one for bringing  about success. The six-syllabled vidya [krim krim krim phat svaha] and the  three-syllabled vidya [krim krim hum] are of equal power.  

17-18ab. O auspicious one! three of [Kalika's] own seed mantra [krim krim  krim] followed by the [vocative] smasanakalike, then again the three seed man tras and finally svaha, [together] constitute the fourteen-syllabled mantra that  is worshiped in all the three worlds.  

Eight Forms of the Kail Vidya  

18cd-21ab. Daksinakalika, Siddhikalika, Guhyakalika, Srlkalika, Bhadrakali,  Camundakalika, and the supreme Smasanakalika and Mahakali, O Goddess!  These are the eight [forms of goddess Kali]. O sovereign Goddess! First utter  Kali's own seed mantra, then her name in the vocative followed by another  Kalika seed mantra, and finally add svaha [krim kalike krim svaha]. These eight  forms of Kalika's mantra are secretly expressed in all Tantras.  

The blessed Goddess said:  

21cd-23ab. I have [now] heard the very secret mantras of the great Kalika.  Now I wish to hear Tara's royal mantra. O ISana! if you love me do tell me her  mantra, whose mere mention prevents one from drowning in the ocean of  [transitory] existence.  

Tara Bijas  

Sri Siva answered: 

484 SANJUKTA GUPTA  

Having uttered the moon seed [sam] add the syllable of fire [r] and t to it, to gether with the left eye [i]. My beloved, this royal mantra, this single-syllabled  vidya [strim] is venerated in three worlds, liana [h] united with the nasal and  the left ear [u] [forms] the monosyllabic vidya [hum], which is [Tara's] second  royal mantra.  

The Tara Vidya  

23cd-32ab. Siva [h] with the fire [r] and the left eye [i] and the nasal added  to it [hrim] [should first be uttered]. Then the first seed [strim] and then the  second [hum], then utter the weapon, astra mantra [hrim strim hum phat].  

Different Forms and Efficacies of the Tara Vidya  

When this vidya is preceded by pranava [Om], then [the Goddess] is called  Ugratara. When without the pranava this vidya is called Ekajata, the bestower  of supreme liberation (moksa). With neither pranava nor astra mantra [that is,  hrim strim hum], this trisyllabic vidya is called Mahanilasarasvati. When the  [trisyllabic] vidya is preceded by the vagbhava [seed mantra], it bestows [on  the practitioner] the status of the god of speech. This supreme vidya when  preceded by the seed mantra srim bestows wealth and prosperity. When this  great vidya is preceded by the seed mantra maya [hrim], it bestows sure success  and perfection (siddhi). When it is preceded by the kurca [hum], it reveals the  entire system of speech. When this supreme vidya is preceded by the seed of  the sky [ham], it bestows the liberation of total resorption. When this geat  vidya starts with the prasada [seed mantra, haum] it brings about the union of  the practitioner with Siva. When this mantra starts with the seed [mantra] of  prana [prum] it bestows on the practitioner the fulfilment of whatever he  wishes. When this supreme vidya opens with the seed of Kali [krim] it bestows  both liberation and prosperity.  

Ritual Worship of the Deity  

32cd-50abc. Now 1 shall describe the method of worshiping Kali and Tara.  Arising in the morning, the practitioner who knows his mantra [and its method  of meditation] first mentally worships his guru in the topmost cakra consisting  of a thousand petals. Then, having pierced the six cakras, he should repeat his  main mantra 108 times. Thereafter, having bowed down [to his preferred deity]  he should perform his ritual bathing. He should start this bathing ritual with  the following declaration of his intention (samkalpa): "Today [here he men tions the day and date and then] the solar month, [I bathe myself] for the  pleasure of the deity." Then he bathes in the pure water.  

Then he should utter Om and then gange ca, followed by yamune, then  having uttered godavari, sarasvati, narmade and sindhu kaveri he utters the  words asmin jale sannidhim kuru [Om the rivers Ganges, Yamuna, Godavari,  Sarasvati, Narmada, Sindhu, and Kaveri please abide in this water]. [While  uttering this mantra the practitioner] with the hand gesture called the goad 

WORSHIP OF KALI 48 5  

(ankusa) should [in imagination] pull these sacred rivers from the orb of the  sun and settle them [in the water in which he is bathing] by carefully showing  four relevant hand gestures. Then having protected the water with the hand  gesture called the fish [and scooping a palmful of water and covering it with  the other palm], the worshiper repeats his [deity's seed] mantra [krim] eleven  times. Then, throwing this water toward the sun, he should repeat his main  mantra twelve times while [in imagination] washing [Kalika's] feet three times.  Then [in imagination] he should three times bathe himself with that rinse water  flowing from [Kali's] feet while repeating the mantra. This is done by showing  the gesture of the water pot (kumbha) while repeating his main mantra three  times.  

Then, O Queen of gods! he should decorate his forehead according to the  custom of his sect. Then he performs acamana [ritual cleansing of his mouth  and hands] with water while uttering the mantras of the three tattvas - at matattva, vidyatattva, and sivatattva. The mantras consist of each tattva pre ceded by pranava and ending with svaha [this is the name of the wife of the  god Agni, Fire].  

[At this point he has left his bathing place, cleanly and decorously attired,  and reached the actual place of worship, carrying a pitcher full of water brought  from the water source. In this water pitcher] he invokes the sacred rivers with  the same gauge ca, etc., mantra [following the aforesaid procedure]. Then he  dips a bunch of kusa grass into the sanctified water and with it sprinkles water  on the ground [where he will hold his ritual worship]. Then in the same way  he should sprinkle himself seven times. Then he performs his anganyasa. Then,  O Goddess of the celestials, he with his left hand [scoops up water] and repeats  three times the [paficabhuta] bija mantras: ham, Mam,yam, lam and ram. Having  thus encapsulated that water with that pancabhuta mantra, the practitioner  should sprinkle himself seven times with his finger in the gesture of tattva  [reality] while uttering his main mantra. This act at once removes all his sins.  

Then, O great sovereign Queen, the adept transfers the rest of the water from  his left hand to his right and in imagination inhales it through his ida duct  [inside his left nostril], which water then cleanses his inner body. Thereafter,  he should exhale that water through his pingala duct [inside his right nostril].  Here he imagines that water to be black and the embodiment of sins; he im 

mediately throws the water onto a slab of rock with the mantra phat. Then he  should wash his hands, perform acamana and, having performed breath con trol, offer libation to his lineage god and then offer arghya [an offering of a  few rice grains, tips of durva grass and sanctified water] to the Sun god and  arghya to his chosen deity.  

50d-53. Thereafter he should repeat the great words of the [Kalika] gayatri  [the famous Vedic mantra with which brahmans worship the Sun every day,  as follows]: first one should take the pranava [Om], then utter kalikayai, then  vidmahe; then smasanavasinyai dhimahi, then tan no ghore pracodayat. While486 SANJUKT A GUPT A  

uttering this mantra, the worshiper should three times scatter the consecrated  water upward.  

54ab. Then, O great Goddess, having performed anganyasa the worshiper  again performs acamana.  

Tara's Gayatri is Described with a Brief Mention  

of the Deity's Dhyana as the Sun Deity  

54cd-56ab. O great Goddess! Having envisaged in meditation one's chosen  deity [here Tara] in the orb of the sun, one should utter Om tarayai vidmahe  mahograyai dhimahi tan no devi pracodayat. Then, having performed breath  control, he should repeat this mantra 108 times.  

Now, O Queen of gods, I offer in the form of aphorisms (sirtrakara) an  account of the system of worship  

Preliminaries  

56cd-58. First proclaim universal well-being (svasti-vacana), then the an nouncement of one's intention to worship (samkalpa). Next, one should care fully place the pitcher [full of consecrated water], followed by the act of aca mana with mantras; next comes the setting the pitcher of water for arghya for  

general purposes; then sprinkling the entrance [with consecrated water for  purification], finishing that ritual by worshiping the entrance. Then, having  removed the three categories of hindrances [concretized as evil spirits, belong ing to the ground, atmosphere, and close to the body of the worshipper and  the material objects around him gathered for the ritual] he removes [other evil]  spirits [with mantras, sprinkling of water and threatening gestures].  

Starting the Actual Worship  

59-60ab. Having adored the seat, the intelligent worshiper first of all bows  down to his guru. Then he purifies his hands, claps them three times, and then  performs the rite of consolidating and safeguarding the area surrounding his  person (digbandhana). Then he encompasses himself with fire. Then he per 

forms bhutasuddhi.  

Nyasa  

60cd-64ab. He should then first perform the nyasa of the six limbs of the  matrka [the full Sanskrit alphabet], then the nyasa of the matrka on his inner  body. Then he utters the dhyana mantra [the mantra that gives the deity's  iconography] of the matrka. He should perform the same nyasa on his external  body. Then he performs the nyasa of the seat of the deity (pitha) before com 

pleting his breath control. Then he performs the nyasa of the sage, and so on  [the sage poet, the meter, and the deity of his mantra]. Then he performs nyasa  of his hands and his limbs [identifying them with] the letters of the Sanskrit  alphabet. Then he performs the six types of nyasa [of his main mantra]. Then 

WORSHI P OF KALI 487  

he performs vyapaka [extended] nyasa. With concentration he performs the  nyasa of the tattvas; then, O Goddess!, he performs the nyasa of the seed  mantra. He performs the vyapaka nyasa in seven different ways using his main  mantra. Then in deep concentration he visualizes his deity, whereafter he wor 

ships that deity mentally [with imagined ingredients].  

Adoration of the Deity  

64cd-68ab. [The adept] prepares the consecrated special liquid for special  argyha. Then he worships [the deity's] seat. Next he again performs the visu alization of the deity in deep meditation (dhyana) and this time he sees her  with her eyes open. [All the time he utters specific mantras and appropriate  gestures to accompany his ritual acts.] Then he in similar manner welcomes  the deity. Then while purifying all objects of offering he shows the gestures of  the cow's udder, and so on. [These are called the dhenu mudra, the symbol  for the celestial cow whose milk is nectar; the avagunthana mudra, which  symbolizes safety and cover; the galini mudra which symbolizes the fusing of  the sacred and the mundane water; and the naraca mudra, which symbolizes  iron arrowheads to ward off any polluting evil spirits]. Then he performs the  nyasa of the deity's six limbs. Then he performs the rite of establishing life [in  the image or other representation of the deity]. Then he worships [with offer 

ings] his principal mantra and its deity, the Goddess. Then he requests the  Goddess to authorize him [to exercise the power of the mantra]. Then he  worships the deity's attendant deities like Kali, and so on. [They are Kali,  Kapalini, Kulla, Kurukulla, Virodhini, Vipracitta, Ugra, Ugraprabha, and Dipta.  The second circle of her assistants consists of Nila, Ghana, and Valaka, and the  third circle consists of Matra, Mudra, and Mita]. Then he worships her atten 

dant mother-goddesses Brahmi, and so on, and their Bhairavas, Asitahga, and  so on. [They are Brahmi, Vaisnavi, Mahesvari, Camunda, Kaumari, Aparajita,  Varahi, and Narasimhi; and Asitahga, Ruru, Canda, Krodha, Unmatta, Kapali,  Bhisana and Samhara.]. Then he worships [the deity's consort] Mahakala. Then  he worships the Goddess's [weapons, that is,] her sword, and so on. Next he  worships the lineage of his guru. Then the ritualist repeats the worship of Kali.  This is followed by the offering of bali [a sacrificial animal, or in some cases  nonvegetarian food for the spirits]. This is followed by the fire sacrifice. Then,  having performed pranayama [as a preparation for japa], he performs mantra  repetition (japa) of his main mantra [which is a form of one-pointed medita tion]. Finally, the intelligent worshiper dedicates the merit of his japa to the  deity and then performs pranayama for a second time.  

Esoteric Worship of the Goddess with Alcohol and Other Ingredients  

68cd. At this moment the worshiper may, O Goddess, collect [esoteric ingre dients such as] alcohol [meat, fish, fried food/a partner for intercourse, and  the sexual fluids]. 

4 8 8 - SANJUKTA GUPTA  Concluding Section of the Worship  

69-71 . Afterward, the worshiper offers the deity arghya and also dedicates  himself to the Goddess. Then he recites the Goddess's eulogy and then recites  her protective kavaca ["armor," a special hymn used as a mantra, which guards  every part of the worshiper's body]. Finally he prostrates himself. Afterward  he mentally utters the formula, "I am Siva," while making the gesture of bidding  her farewell. He then draws a diagram on the southwestern corner and offers  arghya and other offerings to the goddess Ucchistacandali. He then himself  puts a mark on his forehead with the sandal paste offered to the Goddess and  partakes of some of the offered food. Thereafter he can do whatever he wishes.  

Alternative Brief Ritual  

Alternatively, the initiated Tantric ritualist who has composed and fixed his  mind in devotion and meditation may perform a shortened version of the wor ship.  

First he performs the nyasa of the poet-sage, and so on, of his main mantra;  then he purifies his hands [with nyasa] followed by nyasa of his fingers and  the extensive nyasa of his body. Then he performs the nyasa of his six limbs.  Then he claps his hands three times [to remove obstructing spirits], then en 

circles his surroundings with [a fiery barrier]. Then he performs breath control  followed by dhyana on his mantra deity and then mentally performs her wor ship. Then he prepares and places the pitcher of arghya water, and worships  the seat [of the Goddess]. On that he invokes the Goddess after having med itated on her image. Then he performs her ritual welcome, and so forth, fol lowed by establishing life in her symbol, jivanyasa or pranapratistha, and finally  worships the supreme Goddess. Then he worships the attendant deities Kali,  and so on, as well as the eight Saktis, Brahmi, and so on, along with their  bhairavas. Then having worshiped Mahakala he worships his guru's lineage as  well as the Goddess's attributes and weapons such as the sword. This is fol lowed by a repeat of the worship of the Goddess. Then the foremost of all  worshipers practices breath control before performing his japa. He dedicates  the [merit of his] japa to the Goddess's hand. He performs the concluding  breath control, prostrates himself, recites the Goddess's panegyric and kavaca  and causes the special arghya to be offered. He then dedicates himself [to the  Goddess] and bids her farewell with the gesture of resorption. He draws a  diagram on his southwestern side and worships Ucchistacandali. In conclusion,  he partakes of some of the offered food and then he may do as he pleases. 

### 28 Ritual Manual for the Protective Fire Offering  Devoted to Manjusri, Chuin Lineage  

Richard K. Payne  

Every Tantric tradition has its own version of the homa, a votive ritual in which  offerings are made into a fire. In one form or another the homa is found from  Mongolia to Bali, from south India to Japan. The homa is also a link to the Vedic  ritual tradition and the broader Indo-European religious culture that includes  Iranian, Greek, and Roman ritual traditions.  

The homa ritual presented here is from the Shingon tradition of Japanese Bud dhism, specifically the Chuin lineage, which predominates in contemporary Ja pan. The Shingon tradition was established in the ninth century by Kukai, who  is also known by his posthumously awarded title "Kobo Daishi" and is sometimes  simply referred to as "the Daishi" meaning "the Great Teacher." He traveled to  China (804 to 806) with the specific goal of initiation into the Buddhist Tantra,  and received authority for the dual lineage of the Mahavairocana and Tattvasam graha Sutras.  

The homa is one of the most important rituals that Kukai brought to Japan,  and it became the final of the four rituals practiced in the training of Shingon  priests. The East Asian Tantric Buddhist tradition knows five kinds of homas,  identified according to the purpose for which they are performed: protection  (santika), increase (paustika), subjugation (abhicaraka), subordination (vaslkar 

ana), and acquisition (ankuia). Each is conducive to awakening in a dual sense.  For example, the homa of subjugation both enables the practitioner to overcome  enemies, either human or demonic, and to overcome the mental and emotional  errors that obscure the naturally enlightened mind.  

The ritual translated here is for protection, the kind most commonly performed  in contemporary Japan. This homa takes as its chief deity Manjusri, the bodhi sattva of wisdom. Manjusri is one of the best known of the Mahayana bodhisatt vas, playing a central role in such popular sutras as the Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra. 

4 9 0 RICHAR D K. PAYNE  

In this homa five sets of offerings are made. The first is to Agni, the Vedic fire  god who is almost invariably the first deity evoked in the homas of the Shingon  tradition. This is followed by a set of offerings to the lord of the assembly, a figure  that, like the chief deity, can vary from homa to homa. In this case the lord of  the assembly is Hayagriva, a horse-headed manifestation of Avalokitesvara, the  bodhisattva of compassion. Hayagriva is also known to the Hindu tradition, where  he is identified with Visnu.  

The central set of offerings is to Manjusri, the chief deity of this ritual. This is  followed by sets of offerings to the bodhisattvas accompanying Manjusri, sur rounding him in the mandala, and to a set of Vedic deities and astral groupings.  

These five sets of offerings are structured very similarly to one another - a fact  that allows for the abridgment of the version of the ritual instructions given here.  The basic pattern or syntax of each of the five sets of offerings is: 1. preparation  of the altar-hearth, offerings, and practitioner; 2. visualization of the deity to be  evoked within the practitioner's own body and in the altar-hearth; 3. evocation  of the deity by inviting him to leave his original location in the cosmic mandala  (the totally of being as it actually is, that is, as experienced by an awakened one,  a buddha) and to become identical with the deity as visualized in the hearth;  4. making of offerings to the deity; and 5. departure and leave-taking, in which  the identification is dissolved and the deity returns to his original location. The  model for this ritual structure is the feasting of an honored guest, and is rooted  in the Indic origins of the homa. This systematic structure is also evidenced by  the fact that the offerings prescribed here are to be embedded in a longer ritual,  as indicated by the first line's reference to "the additional recitations," a particular  point in the ritual into which these offerings are to be embedded. Often, however,  the portion of the ritual preceeding the homa offerings is performed at some  earlier time, perhaps the day before.  

The efficacy of this ritual is understood to result from the three-way identifi cation between the practitioner, the deity evoked, and the hearth. This identifi cation is effected by the practitioner's visualization. Thus, the mouth of the hearth,  into which offerings are made, is visualized as identical with both the mouth of  the deity and the mouth of the practitioner. The physical offerings are identified  with the practitioner's own self-frustrating emotional habits and intellectual mis conceptions. Just as the fire burning on the hearth is understood as purifying the  offerings, making them appropriate for the deity's consumption, the fire is also  the fire of wisdom, purifying the emotional habits and intellectual misconceptions.  The fire is both the deity's awakened mind and that of the practitioner. Thus, one  is offering one's own emotional habits and intellectual misconceptions to oneself  for purification in the fire of one's own awakened mind.  

Like other ritual manuals, the present text assumes a great deal of knowledge  on the part of the practitioner. Hence, the instructions at times only identify a  well-known ritual action by name, such as "universal offering and three powers,"  which are a pair of brief recitations found together in nearly every Shingon ritual.  It is expected that the trained practitioner will have these memorized, though 

FIRE OFFERIN G T O MANJUSR I 491  

individual practitioners often add the information to their own manuals. This  assumption of prior knowledge makes for a "telegraphic" style in the ritual in structions, which I have preserved in my translation.  

As with many esoteric systems, Shingon employs a set of associations between  the body and mind of the practitioner and the alternate worldview that the tra dition teaches. Each finger of the hands forming the mudras is identified with  one of the five elements: little finger with earth, ring finger (known as "nameless")  with water, middle finger with fire, forefinger (known as "head") with wind, and  thumb (known as "great") with empty space. This five-element system originates  in India and is part of the Indian religious culture brought to China and Japan as  part of the Buddhist tradition. This system of five elements was given particular  importance in Shingon as a way for practitioners to experience themselves as  identical with the cosmos as an awakened totality. The five elements also appear  graphically as five cakras, though the term is used somewhat idiosyncratically  here, since cakra is usually understood as a wheel. In the five-elements system,  earth is a yellow square or cube, water a white circle or sphere, fire a red triangle  or pyramid, wind a black half-circle or hemisphere, and empty space a blue  raindrop. Other aspects of Indian religious culture found in this ritual include  the repeated request that the deities perfect the practitioner's supernatural powers  (siddhis), the use of phonemes (as written in the Siddham script) as part of vi 

sualizing the deity's presence, and the activation (called here "empowerment") of  various elements of the ritual through the recitation of mantras.  

Likewise, many of the implements employed in the ritual, such as the ladles,  originate in Indian religious culture. The vajra, however, is even older, repre senting as it does the thunderbolt - the weapon of the high god across the entire  Indo-European religious culture. In the esoteric Buddhist tradition it is explained  as representing the qualities of awakened consciousness: like a thunderbolt, it  suddenly illuminates the night of our confused and frustrating existence. It is also  stronger than anything else, breaking the rock of our entrenched habits. The  Shingon tradition makes use of three forms of the vajra: one-pointed, three pointed, and five-pointed. At the start of the ritual, these are arranged on a plate  (the "vajra plate") on the altar in front of the practitioner.  

Not only is the altar itself the hearth upon which the fire is built, but it is also  a mandala. As the ritual enclosure in which the deities are evoked, it is enclosed  by a rope of five strands, each strand the color of one of the five elements. In  front of the practitioner the rope is raised to form a "gateway." Ritually identical  with the deities, the practitioner is able to enter the mandala through the gateway  to make offerings and perform the other ritual actions.  

The homa rite was appropriated by other Japanese religious traditions. For  example, a homa using large logs and performed outdoors is found in the Shu gendo tradition of mountain ascetics. Similarly, at least one of the nativist Shinto  traditions initiated in the nineteenth century also incorporated a homa, despite a  rhetoric of purifying Shinto of Buddhist influences.  

In contemporary Japan, one can observe this Tantric rite or its variant forms 

4 9 2 RICHAR D K. PAYNE  

quite easily. In some temples it is performed every day, in others on a monthly  or annual basis. The performance of the homa throughout so much of Japan  indicates the deep influence of Tantric Buddhism on Japanese religious culture.  

The present translation of the homa to Manjusri is based on Soeda Takatoshi,  Monju Soku Sai Goma Shiki Shidai, Goma Zenshu, no. 35 (Osaka: Toho Shuppan,  1982).

Following the additional recitations, hang the rosary on the left wrist, through out the homa.  

First, empowerment of Mahavairocana: form the wisdom fist mudra, recite  the mantra Om vajradhatu vam.  

Next, empowerment of the lord of the assembly: form the Hayagriva mu dra - make the empty bowl mudra with both hands, the two head and two  nameless fingers bent into the palm, their backs joined together; the two great  fingers are aligned, but do not touch the two head together. Recite Om amrt odbhava hum phat.  

Next, empowerment of the chief deity, Manjusri: form the empty bowl mu dra - the two middle fingers touch the back of the two nameless fingers, the  two great fingers are aligned, and the two head fingers bent - then the blue  lotus mudra. The preceding mudra is turned up so that the two middle, two  nameless, and two little fingers are placed above the two great fingers, and the  two great fingers are shaped like a sword. Recite Om a ra pa ca na.  

Next, visualize the three identities using the dharmadhatu meditation mu dra. Contemplate the following: the heart of the Tathagata is identical with 

FIRE OFFERIN G T O MANJUSR I 493  

what actually exists, what actually exists is identical with the fire of wisdom;  the hearth is identical with the body of the Tathagata; the fire is identical with  the dharmakaya fire of wisdom; the mouth of the hearth is identical with the  mouth of the Tathagata; the fire is nothing other than the wisdom within the  practitioner's body. Thus, the mouth of the Tathagata's body, the mouth of the  body of the hearth, and the mouth of the practitioner's body are all three the  same.  

Next, empower the poppy seeds: take the censer and place it in the left corner  of the altar. Next, take the bowl of poppy seeds from the left table and place  it where the censer had been; empower using the single-pronged vajra, reciting  the mantra of the Fire Realm seven times [there is an oral instruction: recite  the single-syllable chant twenty-one times]; at the end scatter the poppy seed  to the four directions, to the four corners, above and below, with the right  hand. Beginning from the northeast corner, recite the chant of the Fire Realm  once for each of the directions, throwing a total of ten times. Then return the  bowl to its original location.  

1. FIRST, THE SECTION FOR AGNI  

Start with Agni's mudra and name: grasp the right wrist with the left hand;  bend the thumb of the right hand, placing it in the middle of the palm; the  remaining fingers extend straight out. Empower the four places; recite Om  agnaye santika svaha.  

Next, take the rosary and recite the short Agni mantra 108 times.  Next, take the ball incense, chip incense, and flowers, placing them in order  beside the hearth. Next, take the vajra bell and place it where the ball incense  had been on the left table. Next, take the three-pronged vajra and hold it in  the left hand. Next, take the powdered incense and worship offerings from the  right table and then place them beside the hearth. Next, untie the string around  the twenty-one pieces of sapwood, turn the base toward the practitioner, and  place it on the vajra plate. Throw the string into the hearth. Next, take the  pincers and insert the offering wood, piling it up in the hearth in sequence.  From the orientation of the practitioner, in sequence from left to right place  six sticks in line; eleven sticks total. Next, with the pincers, insert a piece of  pine into the flame of the lamp on the right and place it under the right corner  of the firewood.  

Next, take the fan and fan the flames: hold the fan partially open in the right  hand, recite the mantra, and fan three times; imagine a syllable ham on the  surface of the fan; it changes, becoming a wind cakra, recite Om bhuh jvala  hum, three times. Close it in the right hand and return to its original location.  

Next, purification: sprinkle the wood in the hearth three times, sprinkle  directly, recite the kili kili chant: Om kili kili vajra hum phat.  Next, empower the firewood on the hearth: using the three-pronged vajra,  empower by reciting the kili kili chant three times.

Next, invite Agni, form Amitabha's meditation mudra.  

First, visualize one's own body: visualize a syllable ram above your heart moon cakra; this changes, becoming a triangular fire cakra. Your entire body  becomes this fire cakra; the fire cakra changes, becoming the white body of the  four-armed Agni, blazing flames completely surround his body; this is the great  body of the vast dharmadhatu.  

Next, empower oneself: form the mudra of Agni, recite the short chant,  adding the appropriate phrase: santika svaha; empower the four actions.  Next, request Agni to enter into the hearth: take one flower, empower it by  reciting the short chant of Agni three times, place it on top of the firewood in  the hearth.

### 29 The Purification of the Body  

Gavin Flood  

The Tantric tradition's most elaborated source for the purification of the body  and its ritual identification with the cosmos is the Jayakhya Samhita, one of the  three most important revealed texts of the Pancaratra, the tradition of Tantric  Vaisnavism, probably composed between the seventh and tenth centuries c.E.  The Pancaratra Samhitas are regarded by the tradition as revelation and are di 

rectly parallel to the Saiva Tantras or Agamas, though these were not recognized  by the Pancaratrins. The status of the Sarhhitas within Vaisnavism as a whole is  ambiguous, though an early Sri Vaisnava teacher, Yamuna, defended their status  as revelation.  

The chapter translated here, which takes the form of the Lord addressing teach ings to the sage Narada, concerns the purification of the body, or more specifically  the purification of the elements (bhutasuddhi) within the body, as part of the  description of a sequence of ritual acts. These rites are part of the practitioner's  daily ritual activity (nitya karma) in order ultimately to attain liberation (brah masamapatti). The purification of the body is integral to Tantric ritual and prepares  the practitioner to worship the deity; as the famous Tantric adage goes, "only a  god can worship a god." The distinctively Tantric nature of the bhutasuddhi in  the Pancaratra can be seen by its absence from worship in the related, orthoprax  Vaikhanasa tradition, and its occurrence in the Jayakhya may be the earliest in  Sanskrit literature. The general ritual sequence of Tantric worship is as follows:  first, the purification of the body or bhutasuddhi "destroys" the gross or physical  body in the imagination; second, a divine body is created through visualization  and nyasa or the imposition of mantras upon the body; third, there is internal or  mental worship of the deity (manasayaga); and finally, external worship (bahya 

yaga) concludes with making offerings into the fire-pit (kunda).  The bhutasuddhi itself involves a complex process of visualization in which  the practitioner or sadhaka identifies his body with the universe, particularly the  five elements of earth, water, fire, air, and space, and visualizes phenomena as sociated with each of the elements. As in other Tantric systems, the Pancaratra 

510 GAVI N FLOO D  

hierarchical cosmology is recapitulated in the body. The Jayakhya divides the  cosmos into the pure creation (suddhasarga) and the material creation (pradhan ikasarga). Within the pure creation the Lord, referred to as Vasudeva, Narayana,  and Visnu, manifests his six qualities of knowledge (jnana), majesty (aisvarya),  power (sakti), strength (bala), energy (virya), and splendor (tejas) in his emana tions (vyuhas). These emanations, Vasudeva, Samkarsana, Pradyumna, and Ani ruddha (the latter three being referred to in the Jayakhya by the names Acyuta,  Satya, and Purusa), in turn produce further manifestations, the powers (vibhavas)  and incarnations (avataras), all of which are "contained" within the body (these  various manifestations are referred to in verses 97-98).  

Apart from the particular Pancaratra cosmology, the text also contains reference  (at verse 82) to the six paths (adhvans). This is a well-known cosmological scheme  from the Saiva traditions and is divided into the three ways of sound (vacaka)  (comprising varna, mantra, and pada) and the three ways of objects or referents  (vacya) (comprising kala, tattva, and bhuvana), also known as the ways of time  {kaladhvan) and space (desadhvan). These "paths" are mapped onto the body in  the ritual systems of Saivism and are simply assumed in the Jayakhya, though the  text remains true to Pancaratra cosmology. The Pancaratra absolute is located at  the crown of the head (called the dvadasanta) above the aperture of the absolute  (brahmarandhra). Space, air, fire, water, and earth are identified with the body  from the head to the soles of the feet. During the rite described in our text, the  sadhaka visualizes various segments of his body being pervaded by one of the  elements: the earth from knees to feet, water from thighs to knees, fire from navel  to anus, air from throat to navel, and space from the brahmarandhra to the ears.  This pattern is the same for the Saiva Siddhanta, and texts such as the Somasam bhupaddhati, a standard ritual manual, give roughly the same correspondences.  In the Jayakhya, each element is visualized before the sadhaka, breathed into the  body where it pervades its appropriate place, absorbed into its mantra, then into  its subtle cause, and breathed out. Thus the element of air is visualized as a yellow  square, which is then breathed in with the filling breath (puraka) until it pervades  the area from the knees to the feet. While the breath is retained (the kumbaka  breath), it is absorbed into its mantra, then into its subtle cause, smell, and  breathed out (the recaka breath). The same process occurs with each of the ele ments, water being absorbed into taste, fire into form, air into touch, and space  into sound.  

Fundamental to this system, and indeed to all Tantric ritual systems, is the  cosmology of Samkhya and the hierarchy of the categories (tattvas) in which the  subtle elements (tanmatras) of sound and so on (here referred to as powers  [saktis]), give rise to the gross elements. On a cosmic scale, the gross elements  are a manifestation of the subtle, so in ritual intended to return the sadhaka to  the source of the cosmos, the process of manifestation is symbolically reversed.  This process is accomplished through the repetition of sacred formulas or man tras, each element having its own mantra. Having absorbed each element into its  mantra, into its subtle cause and emitted it through the breath, the sadhaka should 

PURIFICATIO N OF THE BODY 511  

lead his soul, located in his heart-center, up the subtle channel that runs through  the center of the body, out through the aperture of the absolute - a mental act  symbolic of liberation. There his soul is identified with the mantra of Visnu, and  the text (verse 62), echoing the Vedantic notion, describes this state as being  beyond the sun, moon, and stars. He then imagines his body being burned from  the feet upward, until it resembles a pile of ashes, which are swept away to the  four directions by a flood of water arising from his meditation. Through this  process, the gross, physical body is symbolically destroyed in order that a divine  body can be created. Verse 72 describes this as the six coverings (sadkostka) being  burned like grass. These "coverings" or "sheaths" - energy (sakti), magical illusion  (maya), "setting in motion" (prasuti), matter (prakrti), the cosmic egg (brahmanda),  and "the body of the soul" (jivadeha) - surround both the purity of the soul and  vast levels or regions of the hierarchical cosmos. These regions are described in  chapter 6 of the Laksmi Tantra and correspond to the six sheaths of the Upanisads  (the annamayakosa and so on). As in the Upanisads (e.g. Chdndogya Upanisad  8.1.3), the universe is here contained within the body. The sadhaka's divine body  is made of light from the energy of mantra and contains the Pancaratra hierarchy  of deities, which are emanations of Narayana. This construction of the mantra  body or body of light is identified with the subtle body, called the "city of eight"  (puryastaka) (verse 94) because it comprises the five subtle elements along with  the intellect (huddhi), ego (ahamkara), and the mind (manas) of Samkhya cos mology. As the subtle elements give rise to the gross elements, so the gross or  physical body can be seen as an emanation of the subtle.  

With the destruction of the physical body, the sadhaka then draws his soul,  referred to in the text (verse 95) as an "image" (bimba), back down through the  central channel (susumna) to the heart within the "new" body. He is then ready  to perform the next stage of the rite described in the following chapter - the inner  worship (antarayaga) or mental worship (manasayaga), in which offerings are  made to Narayana in the imagination. Although the Pancaratra is a theistic tra 

dition in which the Lord is the transcendent creator of the cosmos and the inner  controller (antaryamin) located in the heart of all beings, the present text presents  a picture of the self as being both identical with him and distinct. Although the  text does not use the term, this is a typical "difference-in-identity" (bheddbheda)  kind of theology that resists any absolute distinction between the self and the  Lord. Indeed, the self and Lord are identified in verse 70, though elsewhere there  is a clear distinction: the Lord, for example, has the six qualities (listed above) in  contrast to the devotee, whose body is bereft of these qualities (verse 15). Yet in  spite of the ritual identification of self and Lord, many passages retain a sense of  the Lord's distinction. Echoing the Bhagavad Gita (18.65), where Krsna tells Ar 

juna that "you are dear to me" (priyo 'si me), Bhagavan in this chapter of the  Jayakhya (100b-101a) tells Narada the same. Indeed, our source refers to a "mys tical" text that is probably the Gita.  

Mantras are one of the key concerns of the Jayakhya, and the chapter on the  purification of the body contains some details of their formation. The text assumes 

512 GAVI N FLOO D  

the general Tantric understanding and classification of mantras as comprising the  seed (bija) and the body (pinda) of the mantra, and that mantras correspond to  different levels of the Pancaratra cosmos. The "complete" (niskala) or "root" man tra (mula) mantra is given to the sadhaka by the guru, here the famous six syllabled Vaisnava mantra, Om visnave namah. Each of the elements purified in  the rite has its own mantra, comprising the seeds and the name of the element  in the dative case, and the text describes their formation (17b-19), with different  syllables named as deities. Thus the syllable sa is called Sahkara, sa is called Agni,  

and so on, and these are combined to form the bijas of the mantra.  Accompanying the repetition of mantras is the practice of visualization. The  verbs used in the Jayakhya for this process of ritual meditation or visualization  are from the roots smr (to remember, recall), dhyai (to meditate), bhu (to exist, to  come into being), and cint (to think), generally used in the third person optative  case. I have generally rendered these terms as "visualize" because of the visual or  imaginative practice referred to, though unlike the English word they do not have  the implication of unreality in the ritual context. I have left the terms mantra,  "sound formula," and mandala, "ritual diagram" or "circle," untranslated, along  with proper names.  

This translation of chapter 10 of the Jayakhya Samhita is taken from the printed  edition of the text, although I have referred to two manuscript transcripts. For  verse 95b I have followed the manuscript transcript R2195 and read svamantra  rather than svatantra. The edition used is Embar Krishnamacharya, ed., Jaya 

khyasamhita, Gaekwad's Oriental Series no. 54 (Baroda: Oriental Institute, 1931).  The two manuscript transcripts are numbers R2195 and 2182 in the transcript  library of the Centre d'Indologie, Pondicherry. I should like to acknowledge dis cussions that have greatly helped my understanding of the text, with the Saiva siddhanta Tattvajna, R. Subramanian, and Dr. T. Ganesan, both at the Centre  d'Indologie, Pondicherry, and Dr. David Smith of Lancaster University.

The Realization of Concentration  

The Lord spoke:  

1-2. O Narada, placing a blade of panic grass, a flower, a leaf, or sesamum in  the tuft of hair on his head, [reciting] the weapon mantra with holy water, and  holding a pot filled with water, [the practitioner] should go to a lonely, unfre quented, but charming and clean place.  

3. He should meditate upon the mantra situated in the middle of his heart,  whose body is the fire of awakening, and not gazing into the distance, he should  silently restrain the breath.  

4-5a. When he reaches that place, he should emit his own mantra through  the nose; then having fixed the weapon mantra outside of himself, he should  strike the earth with his foot. He should meditate with mantra upon the com plete (sakala) Visnu seated upon Garuda.  

5b-6a. Sitting in a special place, he should assume an agreeable posture on  sacred grass, on a hide, or on a cloth over a wooden plank for the purpose of  worship.  

6b-7. O Brahman, praising the Lord with a devout mind and receiving a men tal command from the lineage of teachers, with his head bowed to them, he  should perform all action mentally, as has been established.  

8. After consecrating the seat with holy water muttered over with the root  mantra, [the practitioner] should offer the mantra again for its purification,  snapping his fingers.  

9. Hear this, O Narada. He should then perform the purification of the hands,  on both palms, on the backs of the hands and on all the fingers.  

10. Purifying them with the weapon mantra, he should practice mantra repe tition and meditation. Then, after purifying his hands, he should purify the  place.  

11-12. Meditating on the god whose form is flames, whose splendor is like a  thousand suns, covered with millions of flames, vomiting flames from his  mouth, [the practitioner] should fill the entire universe up to the World of  Brahma with that [visualization].  

13. He should flood the directions, making them blaze with the splendor of 

514 GAVI N FLOO D  

his mantra, and meditate upon the entire circle of the earth baked, like a clay  pot, by the fire of his mantra, O Best of the Twice-Born.  

14. This purification of the place of worship occurs due to the outpouring of  the waves of nectar. Now hear, O Sage, about the purification of the elements  [in the body] in exact order.  

15. Know that the body, like Indra's net, comprises the five elements of earth,  water, fire, air, and space, but is bereft of the six qualities of knowledge and  so on.  

16-17a. It is impure, without autonomy, arising from blood and semen, de caying. For as long as it is not purified correctly and continuously with con centration, it will be unfit for things such as mantra, imposition (nyasa), and  so on.  

17b-19. [The practitioner] should join the five letters "Sankara" [sa], "Agni"  [sa], "Soma" [sa], "Surya" [ha], and "Antaka" [ksa] in sequence together with  "Dharesa" [la], "Varaha" [va], "Anala" [ra], "Kambu" lya], and "Pradhana"  [ma]. He should then use all these along with the primal deity possessing  lordship of the three worlds, at the crown [the anusvara, that is, the nasalized  phoneme m], O Twice-Born.  

20. In sequence these are the seed syllables of earth, water, fire, air, and space.  The syllables hum and phat should be placed at the end of the names of the  earth and so on, O Narada.  

21. [The practitioner] should utter [the mantras] three times for the purifi cation of the elements, each preceded by the syllable Om. They are established  in sequence according to the superiority of the five Lords of the elements [that  is, Om slam prthivyai hum phat; Om svam adbhyah hum phat; Om sram tejase  hum phat; Om hyam vayave hum phat; Om ksmam akasaya hum phat].  

22. The five [deities] Aniruddha, and so on, and Satya [are the Lords of the  elements and] have been previously referred to. [The practitioner] should utter  [their mantras] in sequence, accompanied by their powers.  

THE PURIFICATION OF THE EARTH ELEMENT  

23. Expelling the Lord through the right nostril, he is placed in the middle of  a circular mandala that has the appearance of a thousand suns and resembles  the color of molten gold.  

24. Then [the practitioner] should meditate upon his mantra-self seated in the  highest place, twelve fingers above [at the crown of the head].  

25. Below that circle of light, the lords of the cosmic principles (tattvas) are 

PURIFICATIO N OF THE BODY 515  

added, and below them he should meditate upon the complete mantra-body  in due sequence.  

26-27a. [The practitioner] should then visualize a quadrangular, yellow earth,  marked with the sign of thunder, connected with the five sounds and so on  [that is, sound, touch, form, taste, and smell], filled with trees and mountains,  and adorned with oceans, islands, good rivers, and walled towns.  

27b-29. With an inhaled breath, he should visualize [that earth] entering his  own body from outside, and uttering the mantra [Om slam prthivyai hum phat],  he should imagine it as tranquilized, pervading in due order from the knees to  the soles of the feet, by means of the retained breath. Then, O Twice-Born, [he  should visualize the earth] gradually dissolved in its mantra-form, and this  mantra-king dissolved in the energy of smell.  

30a. After that he should emit the energy of smell with the exhaled breath.  

THE PURIFICATION OF THE WATER ELEMENT  

30b-31. Water is the power in the great substratum called water, comprising  oceans, rivers, streams, and the six essences of herbs, and whatever water crea tures there are, creatures in the other world.  

32-34a. It has the same form as a half moon and is adorned with the sign of  the lotus. After visualizing that aquatic power outside of himself, [the practi tioner] fills his body with it by means of the inhaled breath, very gently, from  the top of the thighs to the knees. O Twice-Born, he should meditate on his  body as its own, complete mandala, pervaded by the inhaled breath.  

34b-35. After meditating on that water mantra [Om svam adbhyah hum phat]  called the substratum in the center of that [mandala/body], the entire aquatic  power dissolves in that [mantra]. Then that [mantra dissolves] in the energy  of taste, [which in turn dissolves] in the mandala of fire.  

THE PURIFICATION OF THE FIRE ELEMENT  

36-37a. With the exhaling breath, he should emit the effulgent power whose  form is a triangular world, adorned with brilliance, containing lightning, the  moon, the field of stars, gems, jewels, and minerals.  

37b-39. It contains beings with self-luminous bodies and sky-goers without  bodies, and svastikas and lights are established [within it]. Tiger of sages, once  he has penetrated that great power he should then visualize the effulgent subtle  element established within the mandala. As before, uttering [the mantra Om  sram tejase hum phat] he should visualize [the fire element] entering him by  that same method.516 GAVI N FLOO D  

40. Holding it [in the mind] and making it pervade from the navel to the anus,  he should meditate upon that total, effulgent power, O Brahman.  

41. That [element] is pacified in the body of the mantra, and the mantra, whose  nature is fire, dissolves in the energy of form, which is made of consciousness.  

THE PURIFICATION OF THE WIND ELEMENT  

42. The mantra-body itself is dissolved by its own energy. Exhaling, [the prac titioner] emits the energy into the substratum of wind.  

43-44a. He should then visualize that airy power outside of himself, accom panied by effulgent forms like a red stone, filled with many different smells  and qualities.  

44b. He should visualize it in this way with its own mantra \Om hyam vayave  hum phat] called the Dharana.  

45. Having thus meditated upon this essence and uttered the mantra, he  should destroy it, very softly through the nostril by the method previously  described.  

46-47. He should meditate upon [the wind element] pervading from throat  to navel. Then, by the method previously described, he visualizes the wind  power dissolved in its ruler, and, O Sage, that into the great energy called touch.  That energy is indestructible.  

THE PURIFICATION OF THE SPACE ELEMENT  

48. He should project into the mandala of space in the great substratum called  sound, this energy itself, endowed with power, eternal and invisible, [by which  he is] pervaded.  

49-51. Then, O Twice-Born, he should visualize that total power called space  outside this body. It is filled with various sounds, formless like collyrium, and  filled with innumerable perfected beings who are without bodies and made of  sound. He should meditate upon the support mantra called space [Om ksmam  akasaya hum phat] in the middle of that. Always supporting itself by its own  potency, the mantra of sound is formless and pervades the powers (vibhavas).  

52. Establishing [the visualization] accurately with the imagination, and hav ing infused [the power of space] into his body in the aforementioned way, [the  practitioner] should become pervaded by it.  

53. Space [pervades] from the ears to the orifice of the absolute. With that  power, fixed by the inhaled breath, the yogin [restrains] time.  

54. Afterwards, O Sage, he should meditate upon [space] transformed into its 

PURIFICATION OF THE BODY 517  

own mantra. The support mantra called space is then dissolved in the power  of sound.  

55. He should experience that indestructible energy going forth through the  orifice of the absolute, joining with the four energies of smell and so on.  

56. He should keep in mind the untainted, complete mantra [Om visnave na mah] that is beyond space, and beyond the energies of truth and so on.  

57. Know that sixfold, partless [mantra] previously mentioned. In stages, by  means of mantra, he should bring each elemental power to its home.  

THE STATE OF LIBERATION  

58. Individualized consciousness, like a quivering star, is next to be meditated  upon as at peace, departed from the cage of the elements [that is, the body].  

59-60. Through the gradual process [just described], within his body com prising the five energies [of the elements], and within the supreme mantra  devoid of extension, [the practitioner] sees his own self in the space of the  heart by means of the self, like a mountain resplendent as the sun. This [self]  is the Lord, supreme, pervading, and covered with vibrating light.  

61-62. Then, established in the body of the mantra, he should practice the  supreme concentration (samadhi). The supreme mantra body is manifested in  the succession of letters. By means of the energies, the bounds of the sky, the  sun, and so on are transcended, and having cognized that transcendence, [the  practitioner] is established in that condition.  

63. From worshiping the essence of mantra [the practitioner] becomes dissat isfied with worldly affairs and holding to the rope of knowledge, [he perceives]  the truth of the self in the six syllables [of the mantra Om visnave namah].  

64-65. He should visualize his own self, by his own self, arising from the cave  of the heart. That flame from the fire of mantra arises through the path of the  subtle channel from the brilliant [heart]. [That channel] is the susumna, re sembling the stalk of a lotus. Visualizing it going to the aperture of the absolute  [at the crown of the head, he knows] this to be a good path, O Narada.  

66. Having emitted his own self, very gently, by the wind of consciousness,  [the practitioner] should fix the particular sixfold mantra [Om visnave namah]  there.  

67. Lord, may he attain this [supreme state] that arises from the supreme body.  This is the unparalleled mass of splendor [previously] proclaimed, O tiger  among the twice-born.  

68a. [The self/Lord who] stands in the enter of the circle of light is delighted  by the joy of his own joy. 

518 GAVIN FLOOD  

68b-69. The truth of the self is established in the [various] states of being, O  Narada. His nature is consciousness, alone, freed from the body, the real. The  great joy that arises, that is the supreme power of Visnu (Saktivaisnavi).  

70-71a. Having made [himself] indistinguishable from him [the Lord], the  soul is the agent of undiminished action. Wherever she [Saktivaisnavi] arises,  there she yet remains. Know that, Narada, to be the ineffable, the freedom from  ideation.  

BURNING THE BODY  

71b-72. So, sitting down in his own place, having abandoned the elemental  body, established there he should burn the body with the exception of the  subtle elements of power. Then, the six worthless coverings of the self have  the form of burned grass.  

73-74a. With the fire arising from the birth of the mantra and due to his  intention, [the practitioner] should fix the support of the entire universe,  which is endowed with the four refuges [energy, knowledge, strength, and  lordship], above the body in the space established above the Lords of the world.  

74b-75. Starting with the seed syllable [the pranava] and ending with the  name expressing the fire of desire itself, [the practitioner] should visualize the  body, blazing from the feet. After that, O Twice-Born, the fire is calmed and  [the body] resembles a pile of ashes.  

76-77. Meditating upon his reduction to ashes, [he should use the mantra]  tyam preceded by the syllable Om and ending with namah. Then he floods the  ashes to the directions with the water, sprinkled with his own mantra, arising  from his meditation and having the appearance of milk.  

THE CREATION OF A RADIANT BODY  

78-79a. He should meditate upon the universe, moving and unmoving, which  has the appearance of a milky ocean, with [the mantra] svam, with the lamp  [mantra] as the second [term], understood as before.  

79b-80a. The nectar of the twice-born, continuously meditated upon, is made  to fall as a mass of streams from its elevated position, flowing out from the  fourth state.  

80b-81a. Having placed the energy of Visnu there in the middle [of the  ocean], which is his support [that is, Visnu's throne] and is the seed of every thing, he should visualize a lotus arising from it.  

81b-82. [The practitioner] should visualize [himself as] Lord Narayana in the  middle of that [lotus], as the essence of mantra, the essence of the truth of the 

PURIFICATIO N OF THE BODY 519  

six paths, white, brilliant, beautiful, surrounded by a triadic mandala [with  three rings], and shining with vibrant rays.  

83. O Twice-Born, he should meditate upon the complete, solitary, pure body  of the five true mantras, bursting with the energies of the mantras.  

84. He should visualize the five elements of space and so on, the Lord's fivefold  mantra, and the power of space [and the other elements] flowing from that.  

85. He should visualize this body born from the union [of the elements], from  the cage of the powers, having the appearance of a thousand suns and a hun dred brilliant moons.  

86. In this way he has produced a body that is supreme in liberation and  enjoyment, having the appearance of pure crystal, bereft of old age and death.  

87-88a. O Tiger among Sages, having thus been [re]born by means of energy  from that waveless place, [the practitioner] has gradually achieved the innate  fulfillment of all living beings.  

88b-90a. He should then rest in his own joy, from the great joy that is yet his  own joy. His own form is from the solar, celestial circle. [This body] shines  like millions of suns, glimmers with its own radiance, its form is like the col ored balls of the kadamba tree and it is pure like the pollen of the blue nisambu  flower.  

90b-92. Having brought his self from its own place, by means of the self, O  Twice-Born, let [the practitioner] enter his own mantra-body through the ap erture of the absolute as before. [He thus goes] to the inner lotus of the subtle  body by the path of the moonlight-channel. Then meditating on his own  speech, which is the support of all the worlds, the complete word [the entire  mantra] creates total satisfaction.  

93-94. [The practitioner] should mark on himself the "deathless" mantra end ing with namah. This mantra to be known is the "savior," and it denotes the  self. Then the whole mantra is the lustrous body, and [the practitioner] has  attained a body of light [which comprises] the five [subtle elements] and the  ego [that is, the subtle body].  

95. He should sprinkle his body with the flood of nectar from his own mantra.  Then pulling down the image [of his soul through the susumna], he fixes his  own mantra in his heart.  

96. The circle of light that is one's own shining form [created] from one's own  bliss, is the supreme, waveless energy, comprising great bliss.  

97-98. The path of the central channel is the complete body of the mantra  (pindamantra). [The practitioner] should visualize the energies, the group of  mantras, the five Lords of Protection, and the assemblage of powers (vibhavas),

as [within] the body. [He should visualize] that blazing totality as different yet  nondifferent [from himself].  

99. O Narada, this complete, elemental purity arises due to three kinds of  cause: gross, subtle, and supreme.  

100. You are a devotee, unwearied, of firm intellect, and your soul is devel oped. You are dear to me, as declared by the mystic [text].  

101. As you are in me, O Brahman, so he [the Lord] will be in you. This should  not be made visible to another who is inferior.  

102. This supreme, meritorious concentration gives the purification of the ele ments. Whosoever practices only this goes to the eternal abode.  

103. What more is there, O Brahman? Having praised the one with conscious ness joined to the [Lord's] body, [the practitioner] with a calm, cultivated soul  should worship God.  

Here ends the tenth chapter of the Jayakhyasarhhita of the Pancaratra, called  the realization of concentration.

### 30 A Tantric Meditation on Emptiness  

Donald S. Lopez, Jr.  

From the origins of Tantric Buddhism in India, origins that remain in many ways  mysterious, questions have been raised about the relation of Tantra to the pre existing traditions of Buddhist thought and practice. These questions have been  faced by scholars and practitioners throughout the Buddhist world over the course  of centuries, and continue to intrigue modern scholars of Buddhism. One way of  posing the questions has been: Does Tantra represent a complete and autonomous  system that replaces and surpasses all that has come before, or is Tantra a sup plement to be appended to the traditional path?  

Such questions were debated at great length in Tibet, and the text translated  below represents the views, offered in the form of a meditation manual, of one  of the most influential Tibetan participants in the debate over the nature of Tantra.  He is Tsong kha pa (1357-1419), whose followers would become the dGe lugs  (Gelugpa) sect of Tibetan Buddhism, the largest and most powerful in Tibet. One  of the hallmarks of Tsong kha pa's thought was his insistence on the harmony  between the exoteric and esoteric teachings of the Buddha or, as Tsong kha pa  put it, the compatibility of Sutra and Tantra.  

Tsong kha pa's most famous work, The Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (Byang  chub lam rim chen mo), sets forth the practice of a single individual from the first  sense of dissatisfaction with the sufferings of the world to the bodhisattva's insight  into the nature of reality. Tsong kha pa describes an evolution: one moves from  being a person who seeks only a better rebirth in the next life, to someone who  seeks to escape entirely from the cycle of rebirth (the Hinayana motivation), to  someone who seeks to become a buddha in order to provide the means for all  beings in the universe to escape from the cycle of rebirth (the Mahayana moti vation). Thus, for Tsong kha pa, there is a clear and intentional continuity between  the Hinayana and Mahayana paths.  

He finds a similar continuity between the exoteric and esoteric teachings of the  Buddha. For Tsong kha pa, Tantra is a form of Mahayana Buddhism: like others,  he divides the Mahayana into two parts, called the perfection vehicle (paramita-

524 DONAL D S . LOPEZ , JR.  

yana in Sanskrit, phar phyin theg pa in Tibetan) and the secret mantra vehicle  (guhyamantrayana in Sanskrit, gsang sngags theg pa in Tibetan). Both were taught  by the Buddha himself for bodhisattvas, persons who have vowed to achieve  buddhahood in order to free all beings in the universe from suffering. The secret  mantra vehicle (also known as the Tantric vehicle and the Vajra vehicle) was set  forth by the Buddha for "bodhisattvas of sharp faculties," that is, particularly  intelligent bodhisattvas whose compassion is so great that they are in a great hurry  to achieve buddhahood for the sake of others and have the capacity to use ex traordinary means to do so. For these rare bodhisattvas, the Buddha revealed a  more rapid path to enlightenment.  

The next question that faced Tsong kha pa (and other Tantric exegetes) was  precisely what it was about Tantra that made it a more rapid path; what were the  extraordinary means that the Buddha provided to allow the path to buddhahood  to be traversed more quickly than by the exoteric, or Sutra, path. Tsong kha pa,  following the lead of Indian scholars, approached the question in terms of method  and wisdom, the two factors deemed essential for the attainment of buddhahood.  Method encompasses the various ethical practices of the bodhisattva, practices  such as giving gifts, maintaining patience in all circumstances, keeping vows, and  developing deep states of concentration. Wisdom was the knowledge of the final  nature of reality. If Tantra was superior to Sutra, that superiority was to be found  in one or both of these domains.  

Tsong kha pa argued that there could be no wisdom more profound than that  set forth by the Buddha in the Perfection of Wisdom Sutras, and explicated by  the great master Nagarjuna. This wisdom was the knowledge of emptiness, the  fact that everything in the universe is devoid of an independent or intrinsic nature,  that everything in the universe, from physical forms to the omniscient conscious 

ness of the Buddha, is contingent, depending for its existence on its causes, on  its parts, or on a designating consciousness. Nothing exists in and of itself, nothing  is able to stand alone. To believe that anything, whether it be a person, a material  object, or an idea, exists autonomously, without depending on anything else, is  ignorance, and this ignorance is the cause of all suffering in the universe. To  understand that everything comes into being through other factors, that every 

thing, in Buddhist terms, is "dependently arisen," to understand that everything  is devoid of this falsely imagined independence - this is wisdom; and this wisdom  is essential to the attainment of liberation from rebirth, whether one follows the  Hinayana or the Mahayana, whether one follows the perfection vehicle or the  secret mantra vehicle. Thus, for Tsong kha pa, there is no difference in the pro 

fundity of the highest wisdom in Sutra and Tantra. The superiority of the Tantric  vehicle must therefore be found in the domain of method.  

Tsong kha pa argued that there was an important difference between the way  that method and wisdom were practiced in the Sutra vehicle. The purpose of  wisdom was to create the mind of a buddha, a mind that was in constant and full  awareness of the nature of reality, that is, of emptiness. In order to achieve such  a state, the bodhisattva was to meditate on emptiness now. There was thus a 

MEDITATIO N O N EMPTINES S 525  

similarity between the cause (meditation on emptiness) and the effect (realization  of emptiness). But the method component of the path lacked such a similarity.  Here, the goal was to achieve the magnificent form of a buddha, a body adorned  with the major and minor marks of a superman and endowed with all varieties  of supernormal powers. The exoteric technique was for the bodhisattva to engage  in limitless compassionate deeds. Tsong kha pa thus discerned a disjunction be 

tween the cause (compassionate deeds) and the effect (the body of a buddha). He  reasoned, therefore, that the Tantric vehicle offered a faster path to buddhahood  because it had a special method that did not occur in the Sutra system. He called  this method "deity yoga," and it involved visualizing oneself as a buddha: one  imagined oneself as having the magnificent body, speech, and mind of a buddha  now. This method was superior to performing compassionate deeds (which Tan 

tric bodhisattvas must also do) because of the similarity of the cause (imagining  oneself to be a buddha) to the effect (being a buddha). This method, this deity  yoga, was not only a superior method of achieving buddhahood; for Tsong kha  pa it was the essential method. It was his position that all bodhisattvas must  eventually enter the Tantric path to become buddhas, and that all bodhisattvas  who have achieved buddhahood in the past have done so via the Tantric path.  

The text translated below provides a striking example of Tsong kha pa's views  on what is, and is not, unique to the Tantric path. It is an early example of what  would become an important genre of dGe lugs literature, the "instructions on the  view" (Ita khrid), where "the view" is the correct view, that is, the correct under 

standing of emptiness. In contrast to philosophical texts that set forth elaborate  proofs of emptiness, supported by quotations from the Indian masters, works in  this genre are meant to serve as meditation manuals, providing specific and prac tical instructions on how to gain a deep understanding of emptiness. What is  particularly interesting and unusual about the text translated here is that it pro vides such instructions for a Tantric practitioner.  

It is a common tenet of Buddhist meditation theory that the ordinary human  mind is too weak and distracted to be able to understand reality (in this case,  emptiness) with sufficient depth and clarity to destroy the bonds of suffering and  rebirth. It is therefore necessary to transform the mind into a suitable instrument  for the understanding of reality, and this is achieved by developing a level of  concentration superior to that of everyday experience. Buddhist texts provide  elaborate descriptions of the levels of concentration that can be attained, and  identify one, called "quiescence" (samatha in Sanskrit, zhi gnas in Tibetan), as the  minimum level of mental strength at which emptiness may be understood in a  transformative way. Understanding emptiness at this level of concentration is  called "insight" (vipasyana in Sanskrit, lhag mthong in Tibetan). Specific instruc tions are provided for developing this level of concentration; in the Tibetan tra dition, these most commonly involve the sustained visualization of a golden image  of the Buddha. But as will be recalled, for Tsong kha pa the superiority of Tantra  lies in its extraordinary methods, and so here he offers a different set of instruc 

tions for developing quiescence, more complicated than that found in the exoteric 

526 DONAL D S . LOPEZ , JR.  

instructions, but designed to bring the meditator to the level of quiescence more  quickly.  

It is also Tsong kha pa's conviction that the emptiness taught in the Sutras is  identical to that taught in the Tantras.Thus, it is not surprising that, after pro viding Tantric instructions for developing quiescence, he goes on to provide in structions for meditating on emptiness that are in no way Tantric. Whether one  is following Sutra or Tantra, he argued, the reality and the path to its understand ing are the same. Tsong kha pa is emphatic here, as he is in all of his writings,  that there is only one route to the vision of emptiness, and that route is reasoning.  Emptiness is not self-evident. Indeed, to the unenlightened it is counterintuitive,  because things appear to be real when in fact they are not. One must therefore  seek diligently and dispassionately for the essence, for the self, that one falsely  imagines to exist. Tsong kha pa thus provides detailed instructions for searching  for the self among the places where is could possibly exist.  

The text begins with a statement, in Sanskrit, of homage to the bodhisattva  Manjusri. It is appropriate that Tsong kha pa invoke Manjusri here because he is  the bodhisattva of wisdom, and the text is devoted to instructions for developing  wisdom. But the bodhisattva is also invoked as the special protector of Tsong kha  pa, who is said to have often met face-to-face with the bodhisattva. This homage  is followed by a series of verses, with the remainder of the text presented as a  commentary on those verses. Tsong kha pa declares that the statement, "I will set  forth the mode of being just as it is, relying on the varieties of the dependently  arisen," summarizes the entire practice. The mode of being is emptiness, but it is  a central tenet of Madhyamaka (the Middle Way School of Buddhist philosophy)  that emptiness cannot be understood without making skillful use of the various  phenomena of the universe, the dependently arisen. Tsong kha pa will present in  some detail which of these phenomena are to be utilized, and how one is to gain  a vision of the nature of reality. After a cursory statement of standard Tantric  preparatory practices (regarding one's guru as a buddha, offering simulacra of the  universe to the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and reciting the purificatory mantra  of the buddha Vajrasattva) - all designed to accumulate merit and remove obsta cles and thus clearing the way for successful meditation - Tsong kha pa instructs  the practitioner to meditate on dependent arising in "positive and negative order."  Here dependent arising does not refer to the general Madhyamaka tenet of the  mutual dependence of the phenomena of the universe, but rather to a specific  sequence of dependence or cause and effect. This is the famous twelvefold de pendent origination that some early texts identity as the content of the Buddha's  enlightenment. In brief, it sets forth the sequence of ignorance, karmic condition,  consciousness, name and form, sources, contact, feeling, attachment, grasping,  birth, aging, and death. Although this list is widely interpreted, it is often seen as  a description of how ignorance leads, over the course of one lifetime to the next,  to aging and death - as Tsong kha pa explains. To meditate on these in the  positive order is to examine the sequence, seeing how one leads to another. Such  understanding induces a sense of revulsion toward samsara. To meditate on theMEDITATIO N O N EMPTINES S 527  

list in the negative order does not mean to go through the list backward but to  negate each element. Thus, by stopping ignorance, one stops karmic conditions,  by stopping karmic condition, one stops consciousness; and so on. The point is  that by destroying ignorance, the first cause in the sequence, the edifice of samsara  will collapse.  

Tsong kha pa then turns to detailed instructions on how to conduct a medi tation retreat designed to result in the achievement of the state of concentration  (or samadhi) called quiescence. After finding a place that is physically conducive  to practice, the meditator sits down and visualizes himself or herself as the chosen  buddha or bodhisattva, in this case the bodhisattva Manjusri. The guru is visu alized as a miniature buddha, seated on a lotus at one of three places: the top of  the meditator's head, in the throat, or at the heart. With these Tantric visualiza tions in place, the meditator declares the Mahayana motivation to deliver all  beings to buddhahood and undertakes the meditative session proper with that  motivation.  

The cultivation of quiescence takes place over three stages, focused on the body,  speech, and mind of the meditator visualized as a buddha. In the first stage, the  meditator is a white Manjusri. On the crown of the head sits his or her teacher  in the form of a miniature white buddha Vairocana. At the center of Vairocana's  heart is a flat moon disk, upon which stands the syllable Om. Directly in front of  the meditator's eyes (or, if preferable, directly across from the heart) a small moon  disk floats in space. Seated upon it is a miniature blue buddha Aksobhya. Finally,  the meditator visualizes a white drop the size of a pea on the ground directly in  front of where he or she is seated. With this somewhat complicated visualization  in place, the actual meditation begins. The meditator shifts his or her attention  in sequence between three points: the blue buddha in front of the eyes, the Om  at the heart of the buddha seated on top of the head, and the drop on the ground.  As mentioned above, the standard Sutra version of quiescence meditation is much  less complex; the meditator simply visualizes a golden buddha in space. Here,  the meditator must maintain a clear visualization of himself or herself as the  bodhisattva Manjusri while shifting attention among three objects in sequence.  Tsong kha pa specifies that the meditator should dwell on each object for between  seven and one hundred "manis," that is, the length of time it takes to say the  famous mantra Om mani padme hum. The process is then repeated, substituting  a yellow buddha Ratnasambhava for the blue Aksobhya in front. Next, the yellow  buddha is replaced by a red Amitabha, a green Amoghasiddhi, and a white Vai rocana. In this way, the buddhas of the five lineages are taken as the object of  concentration in the space in front of the meditator, with the remainder of the  visualization remaining the same. After this, the buddhas of the three lineages are  used, followed by one lineage, where the buddha Vajradhara or Vajrasattva is  visualized.  

Tsong kha pa turns next to the instructions for meditation on the speech of a  buddha. Here the meditator visualizes himself or herself as a red Manjusri, with  the lama taking the form of the red buddha Amitabha, residing not at the crown 

528 DONAL D S . LOPEZ , JR.  

of the head but in the throat, the seat of speech. At his heart is the letter ah,  symbolizing the purification of speech. In the space in front, the meditator vi sualizes not a moon disk with a buddha seated upon it but a moon disk with  letters standing upright upon it. These letters are in nineteen groups: the three  root mantras Om, ah, and hum, the vowels of the Sanskrit alphabet in eight groups,  and the consonants of the Sanskrit alphabet in eight groups. The meditator is to  focus on each of these eighteen groups in sequence as the third component in  the rotation, focusing concentration in turn on the ah in the center of Amitabha's  heart, the drop on the ground (now red in color), and letters or group of letters  on the moon floating in space.  

In the meditation on the mind of a buddha, the meditator visualizes himself  or herself as a blue Manjusri, with the lama in the form of the blue Aksobhya at  his heart, the seat of the mind. In the lama's heart is the blue letter hum, repre senting the purification of the mind. In the space in front, a nine-pointed blue  vajra stands upright on a moon disk. The meditator shifts focus among the hum  at Aksobhya's heart, the drop on the ground (now blue), and the vajra. The vajra  is what Aksobhya holds in his hand. After focusing on the vajra, the meditator is  to substitute what the other four buddhas of the five lineages hold in their hands:  a jewel, a lotus, a sword, and a wheel.  

Among the more interesting elements in Tsong kha pa's texts are his instruc tions on how to deal with experiences (nyams) that may occur as a result of  meditation. This is a technical term that refers to the various apparitions, hallu cinations, and visions (both visual and auditory) that may occur in the course of  meditation, but that are not signs of authentic success in the practice. They are  instead the side effects of concentration on the various energies or "winds" that  course through the body. All manner of visions may occur, and it is important  not to give them credence or let them distract attention from the meditation.  Tsong kha pa does not deny that some of these experience may indeed be verid ical; they are not necessarily all hallucinations. He therefore provides techniques  for determining whether the various supernatural beings that materialize before  the meditator are real or not. If what appears really is a buddha or bodhisattva,  one should ask them to bestow magical powers (siddhis). If the meditator is simply  overwhelmed by a multitude of apparitions, he or she should shift attention to  the first of the apparitions to appear, until it disappears. Tsong kha pa also offers  some fascinating remedies for dealing with the concentration of energies in the  head that result from increased concentration.  

Having provided the technique for turning the mind into a suitable instrument  for the realization of emptiness, he turns next to instructions intended to bring  about such realization. He approaches the topic in terms of the classic categories  of the selflessness or lack of self, of persons and phenomena. It should be un 

derstood that self in this sense does not mean a soul but rather a quality of  independence. In this sense, it can be said that everything in the universe, both  persons and other phenomena, is devoid of self. He states at the end of the text 

MEDITATION ON EMPTINESS 529  

that it is essential that one first have some idea of what this self is like before one  sets out in search of it. In keeping with Tsong kha pa's dictum that the emptiness  taught in the Tantras is identical to that taught in the Sutras, there is nothing that  one might identify as "Tantric" about his instructions for meditation on emptiness.  He makes use of the classic Buddhist categories - such as the five aggregates, the  six sources, the five elements - and subjects each to analytical scrutiny, breaking  each down into its constituent parts, searching for a self, and finding none. This  apparently tedious procedure is deemed necessary in order to come to the con fident conclusion that the insidious self is not to be found anywhere. This "non 

finding" is the absence of self, or emptiness. He examines both the things of  samsara, such as the human body and a clay pot, and the things of nirvana, such  as the body, speech, and mind of a buddha, and finds them all to be devoid of  self, all to be empty. This is what Tsong kha pa calls the equality of mundane  existence and peace.  

For reasons of length, the final portion of the text is not translated. Here Tsong  kha pa provides a philosophical discussion, replete with quotations from the  Madhyamaka masters Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, and Candrakirti, of precisely what  emptiness means, dwelling at length on the classic Madhyamaka category of the  two truths.  

Tsong kha pa concludes with a declaration of his conviction that Nagarjuna  offers the authentic path to the knowledge of emptiness, whether one follows the  path of Sutra or Tantra. The text ends with Tsong kha pa's prayer, requesting  blessings from the buddhas and bodhisattvas, for himself and for all beings in the  universe.

Written Instructions on the Madhyamaka View  

by Tsong kha pa  

Namo Guru Aryamanjusriye  

I will set forth the mode of being just as it is, relying on the varieties of the  dependently arisen.  

I go for refuge, amass the collections, clear away obstructions, and meditate  on dependent arising in positive and negative order. Having the nature of the  body, speech, and mind of a buddha and relying on advice on the profound,  I - a fortunate practitioner of enlightenment - am absorbed in samadhi, know 

ing that all phenomena of samsara and nirvana, appearance and emptiness - whatever is dependently arisen - are without intrinsic nature.  Neither body, speech, and mind nor the collected aggregates is established  as the self. There is also no self apart from them. Therefore, understand that  this is the meaning of selflessness.  

The aggregates and the sources, the elements, what arises from the elements,  virtue and nonvirtue, appearance and emptiness, samsara and nirvana, all phe nomena, whatever is dependently arisen is without intrinsic nature.  

Free from production, cessation, and abiding, beyond expression as existent  or nonexistent, as is or is not, free from elaboration, indivisible. Whoever un derstands this profound peace passes beyond sorrow. These are the virtuous  vajra words of instruction on the view of the equality of mundane existence  and peace.  

Homage to the lama and the venerable protector Manjughosa. Here, in order  to set forth the instructions on the view of the equality of mundane existence  and peace, there are three topics: the preparation, the basic practice, and sub sequent identification of emptiness [not translated here]. The statement, "I will  set forth the mode of being just as it is, relying on the varieties of the depend ently arisen," summarizes everything.  

First, the statement of the preparation, "I go for refuge, amass the collections,  clear away obstructions." Cultivate guru yoga, which causes blessings to de scend, draw mandalas, which brings about the amassing of collections of merit,  and meditate on and repeat the hundred-letter mantra, which causes obstruc tions to be cleared away. Most of this can be learned elsewhere.  

Second, the actual practice has two parts, the ordinary and the special. First,  "Dependent arising in positive and negative order." Meditate on dependent  arising in positive and negative order in order to renounce samsara and in  order to understand that ignorance is the root of all faults. Meditate on depen 

dent arising in positive and negative order so that you can understand that, in  order to attain liberation and omniscience, you must abandon the view of self,  the conception of "I," and realize the meaning of the mode of being. 

MEDITATIO N O N EMPTINES S 531  

The first of these is meditation on the positive order. Ignorance is the con ception of self, holding that which arises in dependence on the coming together  of the five aggregates to be a person and a sentient being. When one is under  the power of the conception of self, you conceive yourself, which in fact is  selfless, to be self, and you hold the impure to be pure and unhappiness to be  happiness. Through being deceived by the four inverted views [seeing the im pure as pure, the impermanent as permanent, unhappiness as happiness, and  the selfless as self], you think, "This is my companion, my friend, my ally, and  my blood relative, this person helped me, this person is on my side." You amass  limitless karma produced entirely by desire. Also, you think, "This is my en emy, he is on the other side that does me harm." You amass limitless karma  produced entirely by hatred. Similarly, there is the desire that wants nothing  but happiness, fame, resources, riches, honor, and marvelous things for your self and those who clearly believe in you and are on your side. And there is  the hatred that wonders whether those who are clearly on the other side will  bring nothing but insults, ill repute, poverty, destitution, a short life, many  illnesses, bad luck, and masses of problems. Having come under the power of  such desire and hatred, the afflictions rise like the current of a river: dissension,  quarreling, covetousness, harmful intent, wrong view, killing, taking what is  not given, sexual misconduct, senseless speech, harsh speech, divisive speech,  and lying, and also jealousy, contentiousness, contempt, and pride. Having  amassed limitless collections of sins, there arises a collection of karmic con ditions that serves as the cause of experiences impossible to bear, the endless  sufferings of the unfortunate realms. This occurs solely in dependence on the  conception of self.  

In dependence on that karmic condition, consciousness arises. In depen dence on consciousness, there is name and form. Name is fourfold: feeling,  discrimination, compositional factors, and consciousness. Form is the embryo  that grows in stages from the mixing of the father's semen and mother's blood.  In dependence on name and form, the sources arise and in dependence on the  coming together of three - the sense organ, the consciousness, and the ob ject - contact occurs. In dependence on that, feeling arises, which experiences  things as pleasurable, painful, or neutral. In dependence on that, attachment  arises: if the feeling is pleasant, there is attachment that desires not to separate  from it; if the feeling is painful, there is attachment that desires to get rid of it;  if the feeling is neutral, there is desire to remain equanimously. In dependence  of that, there arises grasping, which experiences the object directly and appro priates it. In dependence on that, there arises existence, which brings about  the experience of the sufferings of the unfortunate realms and of samsara. In  dependence on that, there arise the collections of the unfortunate realms and  rebirth. In dependence on that, aging and death arise. Aging is the complete  maturation of the body. Death is the complete abandonment of the body.  

Furthermore, in dependence on the ignorance and karmic condition, and  the consciousness from a former life, everything from the name and form 

532 DONAL D S . LOPEZ , JR.  

through the existence of this life arise; in dependence on that the birth, aging,  and death of the subsequent life arise. Furthermore, in dependence on the  ignorance, karmic condition, and consciousness of this life, everything from  the name and form through the existence of a future life arise. In dependence  on that also the birth, aging, and death of a future life arise. Understand all  past and future lives in that way. Thus, all sentient beings powerlessly undergo  endless sufferings impossible to bear, like the water on the waterwheel of the  twelvefold dependent arising.  

Second, meditation on dependent arising in the negative order. In that way,  all the sufferings of the unfortunate realms and samsara have the nature of the  conception of self. Therefore, by abandoning the conception of self, all the  sufferings of the unfortunate realms and samsara will be stopped. As long as  one has not abandoned the conception of self, all sufferings will rise like the  current of a river because the nature of all causes and conditions of all suffering  is that conception of self. For example, as long as a great ocean exists, there  will be drops of water.  

Question: What abandons that conception of self? Answer: It is abandoned  by the wisdom that understands selflessness. Question: Can't it be abandoned  otherwise, by virtuous deeds? Answer: Even those, because they are branches  of the conception of self, cause afflictions in some situations, particularly in  cases of desire, hatred, jealousy. There are afflictions that arise in dependence  on the qualities of scholarship, such as pride that thinks, "I have become a  great scholar by virtue of study and contemplation," and "I am wise." There is  jealousy and contention, contempt, and insulting others in every way. Also,  some who have attained and abide in the sources of quiescence in an isolated  place have good qualities to varying degrees. Because of their experience, they  think that they are superior in all ways to other scholars who do not abide in  an isolated place. They produce afflictions such as contempt for and jealousy  of excellent beings like monks. Furthermore, whatever virtues might be per formed - giving, maintaining ethics, cultivating patience, undertaking effort,  being absorbed in concentration - serve merely as antidotes to the afflictions.  Even though some temporary happy effects arise, it does not bring about the  attainment of the final happiness of liberation and omniscience, nor does it  abandon all the obstructions, because it lacks the wisdom that understands  selflessness. Thus, virtuous deeds other than the wisdom that understands self lessness are not able to abandon the conception of self. As long as you conceive  of "I" in dependence on aggregates that are conceived as a self, there is no  opportunity to be liberated from the unfortunate realms and the sufferings of  samsara. The noble Nagarjuna said, "As long as the conception of the aggregates  exists, the conception of the I exists. When the conception of the I exists, there  is action; from that comes birth." And the master Candrakirti said, "Homage  to the compassion for transmigrators who are powerless like a bucket traveling  in a well through initially conceiving of a self, 'I,' and creating attachment to  things, saying 'This is mine.'" 

MEDITATIO N O N EMPTINES S 533  

Therefore, yogins are not attached to body, life, acquisition, honor, poetry,  or, in the end, even to food and drink. Like someone trying to put out a fire  on his body or head, they make great effort and practice austerities . They rely  on a teacher who has the signs of the Mahayana, they practice the profound  instructions, they understand that the five aggregates lack intrinsic nature, and  they put an end to the conception of self. By putting an end to the conception  of self, they stop the coming together of karmic conditions. By stopping that,  they stop the coming together of consciousness. By stopping that, they stop  name and form. By stopping that, they stop the sources. By stopping that,  contact; by stopping that, feeling; by stopping that, attachment; by stopping  that, grasping; by stopping that, existence; by stopping that, they stop birth.  By stopping that, they stop both aging and death. Thus, know that all suffering  together with its causes arises from the conception of self and the source of all  benefit and happiness is the wisdom that understands selflessness. These set  forth the statement, "Meditate on dependent arising in positive and negative  order."  

The second, the special actual practice, has two parts, setting forth the initial  training and setting forth the stages of practice. First, avoid staying in the low  part of a house because lethargy increases there and the upper part of the house  because excitement increases there. Make the place of meditation in the middle  of the house, under a roof, where there is the right amount of heat and cold.  Also have the right amount of food and drink. Get rid of all conditions con 

tradictory to the practice of virtue, like bad friends. Make arrangements for all  the concordant conditions like food and clothing. You must be able to abide  only in the practice of virtue without needing to do anything other than abide  in the practice and benefit beings.  

The second has two parts: setting forth quiescence and setting forth insight.  Regarding the first, it says, "Having the nature of the body, speech, and mind  of a buddha and relying on advice on the profound, I - a fortunate practitioner  of enlightenment - am absorbed in samadhi." This has two parts: setting forth  the entity of quiescence and identifying the subsequent experiences. The first  has three parts: cultivating samadhi in dependence on the nature of body, the  nature of speech, and the nature of mind. Here, the three preparations for  all practices are meditating on your body as the body of the tutelary deity  (yi dam), meditating on the lama in any of the three places [the crown of the  head, throat, or heart], and cultivating love, compassion, and the aspiration  to enlightenment; cultivate the aspiration to enlightenment, thinking "I will  definitely bring all sentient beings, equal to the limits of space, to the level  of complete buddhahood. For that purpose I will practice these profound  instructions."  

The nature of body has three parts: meditation based on the five lineages,  the three lineages, and the single lineage. The first: meditate on yourself as a  white Manjusri. On the crown of you* head is [your lama in the form of] a  white Vairocana. At his heart is a white Om on top of a moon. In space in front 

534 DONAL D S . LOPEZ , JR.  

of the point between your eyebrows, visualize on a moon a blue Aksobhya a  span or just an inch in size. All three have one face and two hands in the  posture of equipoise. At the points where the fourth fingers and thumbs touch,  they hold [the stems of] blue lotus flowers. On top of the blossoms next to  their ears, there is a vajra and bell. They sit with their legs in the vajra posture.  They are adorned with silk and precious ornaments. They are peaceful, and  smiling, their bodies radiant and beautiful. Meditate on them as appearing but  without intrinsic nature, like a reflection in a mirror.  

Meditate on a white drop on the ground, on a straight line from the point  at the tip of your nose; it is suitable for it to be just the size of a pea or a little  bigger. You can draw it or imagine it. Sit with your two legs in the vajra posture  and your two hands in equipoise. Place your body, straighten your spine, point  your eyes at the tip of your nose, draw in your chin, put the tip of your tongue  on your palate, and straighten your shoulders. As for your mind, without con 

ceiving any activities in the three times - past, present, and future - to be good  or bad, be in equipoise, shifting the visualization in turn from the deity either  between the eyes or at the heart, the Om at the heart of the teacher [on the  crown of your head], and the drop [below] the tip of the nose. Also, whatever  occurs, such as your legs hurting or your eyes burning and watering, do not  break the posture. Don't touch anything; there is benefit in remaining just as  you are. Although you remain focused in visualization for a long time on only  one base of visualization, it is difficult to eliminate thought. Therefore, don't  remain on any one base of visualization longer than the time of counting one  hundred manis. But don't do it for a very short time; be in equipoise on each  for just the time of counting seven or ten manis.  

Next, the others are not different from before. In the place of the blue deity  in front, visualize the others individually: a yellow deity, a red deity, a green  deity, and a white deity. Do five cycles of visualization. Using these bases of  visualization, you stop the conception of subject and object and wish to abide  in the samadhi in which the mind is without thought, such that you do not  lose focus on the base of visualization. Whatever other conceptions of subject  and object are produced, totally eliminate diffusion and abide undistractedly  in the state of mind of being without thought.  

Second, based on the nature of the three lineages. The others are similar to  the above. Meditate, doing cycles of visualization on the white, red, and blue  deities, respectively, in front of you. No matter how short [a time] you do each  of these cycles of visualization, do not do them less than five days each. Third,  cultivate samadhi based on one lineage. Meditate on either Vajrasattva or Vaj 

radhara in front of you; the other parts are like above. Thus, based on the  nature of the body, there are nine objects of visualization.  

At the time of cultivating samadhi based on those, if the mind still will not  remain settled due to excessive excitement, meditate on the lama in your heart  instead of on the top of your head. Meditate on the deity in front at a point  across from your heart and hold the mind as before. If you meditate too much, 

MEDITATION ON EMPTINESS 535  

the body and mind get too tense and problems will occur such as heart wind,  and you will not want to remain in meditation. Therefore, don't lose the physi cal posture; remain relaxed. Relying on the mental base of visualization, having  eliminated totally the diffusion and contraction that occurs from the dispersion  and gathering of thought, remain in equipoise in the state of relaxation without  distraction within the state of nonconception. Do not move even for a moment.  

Put aside all activities of body, speech, and mind temporarily; do not analyze  or investigate, have no hopes or doubts. If you have something virtuous to do  physically or verbally that is very important, do it at noon or when you have  finished eating and drinking. Otherwise at those times, go for refuge, meditate  on the unpredictability of death, and on love, compassion, and the aspiration  to enlightenment for just a bit. Apart from these [times], only meditate; med 

itate in the early evening and dawn because your awareness is clear at those  times. If you become exhausted doing other things during the day, don't de prive yourself of sleep.  

Second, the cultivation of samadhi based on the nature of speech. Meditate  on yourself as a red deity and your lama in the form of a red Amitabha at your  throat. Imagine a seed syllable in place of the deity in front and imagine a red  ah in place of the Om at the lama's heart. Everything else is the same as above.  Also, in the space in front on a moon disc are three cycles of visualization of  Om ah hum, eight cycles of visualization in eight sections - [1] a a [2] i i [3]  u u [4] ri ri [5] li li [6] e ai [7] o au [8] am ah - and eight cycles of visualization  in eight sections - [1] ka kha ga gha nga [2] ca chajajha nya [3] ta tha da dha  na [4] ta tha da dha na [5] pa pha ba bha ma [6] ya ra la va [7] sa sa sa ha ksa  [8] ya ra la va da da - making nineteen cycles of visualization. Greatly con densed, there is one cycle of visualization of the three seed syllables and a cycle  of visualization each for the vowels and consonants [making] three cycles of  visualization. Thus, for all the visualizations, alternate, meditating on the letters  in front, not one but in sequence, and alternate as before, remaining on the  letter ah at the lama's heart and the letters.  

Whatever experiences occur due to meditation - experiences of bliss, ex periences of being empty, experiences of clarity, seeing things, hearing  things - don't reject them or accept them, don't be discouraged or pleased;  sustain the same samadhi. Act similarly regarding rough experiences, danger ous beasts, and vicious nonhumans that come during waking experience, in  dreams, and in visions. Anything unpleasant that they do are experiences. In  the same way, innumerable buddhas and bodhisattvas come. Whatever oc curs - their teaching the dharma or making prophecies - are experiences.  Whatever happens, like offerings made to you by sons and daughters of gods,  are experiences. Therefore, sustain samadhi without rejecting or accepting  them. If there are reasons and signs that it is not an experience, decide by  means of dividing the various types into three categories: if it is your deity, ask  for actual achievement (siddhi). If it is an experience, sustain what you were  doing before. If it is a nonhuman, having analyzed the situation, instruct the 

536 DONAL D S . LOPEZ , JR.  

kind who will become supportive of your practice and expel the kind that  creates obstacles.  

Regarding apparitions, if measureless apparitions occurs, take the first ap parition that occurs as the base of visualization. Without letting others enter  your awareness, remain in equipoise on the first. Then, when the apparition  fades, be in equipoise on whatever occurs next. When that fades, take what  arises newly as the base of visualization. In that way, sustain it as before as  long as there are apparitions.  

Whatever physical postures and glances have been explained to you, do not  produce them. Without strongly tightening the mind, relax the entire body  and the mind and don't lose hold of the essential parts of the posture, the  unmistaken glance, and the mindfulness of the undistracted mind. This is most  essential. If the body is sick, at midday and when the stomach is empty from  not eating food, use whatever exercises that help. Furthermore, because sick 

nesses of cold, fever, and so forth occur, take the right kind of medicine.  Third, cultivating samadhi in dependence on the nature of the mind. You  are the blue deity. At your heart is your lama in the form of a blue Aksobhya.  At his heart on a moon disc is a blue hum. On the ground at the point of the  tip of your nose is a blue drop. The way that all of them abide, their ornaments,  hand implements, and so forth are as before. In the place of the deity between  the eyebrows is a blue nine-pointed vajra on a moon disc. Meditate on it as  appearing clearly but without intrinsic nature. As before, based on the visual ization of the three - the hum at the lama's heart, the drop on the ground, and  the vajra - be in equipoise.  

Whatever you do - getting up, moving about, speaking - do it skillfully and  slowly; don't lose hold of undistracted mindfulness. This is extremely impor tant. When you sleep, focus on the visualization of the lama at the heart and  sleep without distraction. When you have completed this visualization cycle,  in place of the vajra in front, base the visualization on a jewel, lotus, sword,  and wheel. The rest is as before. Visualize the symbols: five visualizations based  on the hand implements of the five lineages. If a definite certainty of being in  quiescence does not arise, meditate on the implements of the five consorts, the  four doorkeepers of the mandala, and the thirty-two implements of [the wrath ful buddha] Bhairava, respectively. If there is excessive lethargy on those oc casions, meditate on the lama at the crown of your head. Visualize the imple ments in front and the drop and meditate as before.  

When the mind has become very clear, the winds will increase upward.  When there is a swelling at the Brahma aperture [at the top of the skull),  itching, or your head hurts, tie your belt around your head. Put a container of  jewels such as 'gu rtse on top of your head. Imagine that the Brahma aperture  is blocked with a golden crossed vajra. Put your two legs straight out with your  two arms in line with your feet and imagine that on the soles of your two feet  there is a white letter a. Focus on the visualization of that. If that doesn't help,  transform your mind into a blue hum on a thousand-petaled white lotus on aMEDITATIO N O N EMPTINES S 537  

base of gold. Emerging from the anus, think that it comes gently to rest. Then,  imagine a series of hums from your own heart, [going] from your anus in that  way and melting into the earlier hum. Do that until it helps. Or, rise, imagining  yourself as the deity, making vajra fists [index and little finger extended and  middle and ring fingers held by thumb] crossed at the heart and crouch with  your two heels together touching your thighs, hold your breath, and jump. If  nothing comes from that, cover your head with your hand and put your heels  together or separately and softly rub and hit your thighs. Furthermore, if you  have pain, understand it having compared it with the needs and circumstances  of any of the qualities of [the deity] Isvara.  

Second, identifying visions. Any experience that occurs based on the body - the body shaking or bliss - is physical experience. The utterance of Sanskrit  language and the unintentional utterance of verses is verbal experience. Re garding the mind, producing the samadhis of happiness, bliss, and the non conceptual, no matter how auspicious, is to be understood as experience as  long as insight is not produced. As signs of conjunction with the earth wind,  water wind, fire wind, wind wind, and space wind, there is, respectively, physi cal heaviness, cold, warmth, lightness, and becoming empty through the vision  of having no body. Regarding apparitions, seeing smoke, fireflies, mirages,  hooks, drops, the sky free from clouds, rainbows, sun and moon, stars, and  golden earth, and so forth, fire, water, the body of the Tathagata [the Buddha]  the six abodes of rebirth, and the billion worlds - whatever apparitions appear  are signs of the conjunction of wind and mind. Therefore, know that they are  apparitions. Hearing sounds like a bee, poetic Sanskrit verses, heart mantras  of the deity, whatever occurs, good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant, know to be  experiences that are aural apparitions. By practicing without adopting or dis carding, rejecting or accepting such visions, you will produce the samadhi of  insight.  

Second, the practice of insight has two parts, meditation on the selflessness  of the person and meditation on the selflessness of phenomena. Regarding the  first, it says, "Neither body, speech, and mind or the collected aggregates is  established as the self. There is also no self apart from them. Therefore, un 

derstand that this is the meaning of selflessness." This has two parts, meditating  on the body, speech, and mind as without self, and meditating on the five  aggregates as without self. The first has three parts, meditating on body, speech,  and mind as without self. First, adopt the physical posture and gaze as before.  Remain like that and meditate, knowing through scripture and reasoning that  this body of yours is not established. There are six objects of consciousness,  such as form [sounds, odors, tastes, objects of touch, and phenomena]. Form  includes the head, legs, arms, chest, intestines, flesh, blood, pus, marrow, the  sense organs, winds, channels, warmth, impurities. None of these individually  is established as the body. Therefore, the body is not established anywhere  apart from them. By analyzing well in that way, you will not find any body  anywhere. Eliminating dispersion and agitation by the conception of subject 

538 DONAL D S . LOPEZ , JR.  

and object, be in equipoise on just that. If the mind becomes dispersed, decide  that the body is not established anywhere as before and is not to be found. Be  in equipoise on just that. By meditating in that way every day, decide that the  body cannot be found and meditate on the fact that the parts of the body are  not established when they are divided individually. Thus, regarding the head,  the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, mouth, teeth, lips, hair, brain, flesh, blood, bone,  pus, tears, mucous, saliva, the upper skull, the lower skull, and the body hairs  individually are not the head. Therefore, having analyzed well that the head is  not to be found anywhere, place yourself in equipoise on just that as before.  Understand it in that way. Similarly, the ear is not established. The ear is not  established anywhere in the ten directions; having divided each of the direc tions into minute parts, it not established anywhere. Understand everything in  that way.  

Know that the entity of speech is also not established. Second, understand  that the speech of the past has ceased, the speech of the future has not been  produced, and present speech is not established as "This is it." Speech cannot  be found anywhere. Be in equipoise on the state of just that. Third, the mind  does not abide from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet and does not  exist elsewhere. It also does not exist anywhere between the head and feet. In  that case, the mind is not found anywhere. Be in equipoise on the state of just  that. Third, thus, because body, speech, and mind are not established any where, those three are not self, the self is not other than them and the self is  also not established in between. Therefore, be in equipoise in the state that  begins with that not finding of the self.  

Second, meditation on the five aggregates as selfless. First, regarding the form  aggregate, if you analyze individually color, shape, touch, smell, and taste, they  are not the self. Similarly, if you analyze them individually in terms of parts - the cardinal directions and particles - they are not established as the entity of  form. Be in equipoise in the state of just that. Second, the feeling aggregate:  feeling is the experience of pleasure, pain, or neutrality. By analyzing whether  they abide outside, inside, or between the body, they are not established as the  entity of feeling. Thus, be in equipoise in the state of just that. Third, medi 

tation on the nonestablishment of discrimination. Be in equipoise on the dis crimination that discriminate objects individually, as in the case of feeling.  Fourth, meditation on the conditioning factors aggregate as not established.  Understand that conditioning factors, which have the nature of attachment and  aversion, rejection and acceptance, are like feeling, and be in equipoise. Fifth,  meditation on the entity of consciousness as not being established. The collec tions of consciousness that individually apprehend objects such as form do not  abide in the top or bottom of the body or outside, inside, or in between; they  do not abide in the cardinal directions of the body, or above or below; they do  not abide someplace other than those. Therefore, be in equipoise in the state  of not finding. Therefore, when the five aggregates are analyzed individually,  they are not established anywhere. Therefore, the five aggregates are not the 

MEDITATIO N O N EMPTINES S 539  

self. The self is also not the five aggregates; a self is not established apart from  the five aggregates and the five aggregates also are not intrinsically established.  Be in equipoise in the state beginning with the nonobservation of the self  anywhere and understand that the self is dependently arisen in the sense of  not being intrinsically established. Until you have generated a pure ascertaining  consciousness, which decides that the self is dependently arisen, meditate re 

peatedly on the object of observation.  

Second, meditation on the selflessness of phenomena. It says, "The aggre gates and the sources, the elements, what arises from the elements, virtue and  nonvirtue, appearance and emptiness, samsara and nirvana, all phenomena,  whatever is dependently arisen is without intrinsic nature." This has two parts:  meditation on the impure phenomena of samsara as selfless and meditation on  the pure phenomena of nirvana as selfless. The first has two parts: meditation  on objects as without intrinsic nature and meditation on subjects as without  intrinsic nature. Regarding the first, meditate on everything, like the five ele ments, the five things that arise from the elements, the constituents, sources,  as without intrinsic nature. First, meditation on the earth element as not in trinsically established. Observe something made of earth. By analyzing its  shape, color, feel, and so forth individually, it is not established as earth.  Through analyzing it in terms of its cardinal directions and particles, it is also  not established as earth. Be in equipoise in the state of earth not existing in trinsically. Understand the same thing about water. Regarding fire, it arises in  dependence on tinder, the effort of a person's hands, and so forth. If these are  analyzed individually, it does not arise from any of them. Upon analyzing the  shape, color, feel, and so forth, they are not fire. Be in equipoise as before.  Observe wind. It does not arise from the cardinal directions or above and below.  Upon analyzing its shape individually, it is not established, as before. Space  does not first come from any direction; it does not then go back again. Because  the present entity is not established anywhere, the five elements are not intrin sically established. Be in equipoise in that way.  

Meditate on the five things arisen from the elements as not intrinsically  established. Observe something like the visible form of a pot. Its shape, color,  feel, mouth and neck, belly base, inside and outside are not established as the  pot individually. Therefore, be in equipoise as before. In the same way, observe  sounds, odors, tastes, and objects of touch individually. Upon analyzing the  individual aspects of the cardinal directions, above and below, the three - inside, outside, and in between - the top and bottom, the shape, the color,  sound, odor, taste, the feel do not arise from any of these. They are not inher 

ently established. Therefore, be in equipoise in the state of that.  Thus, all conditioned phenomena, such as the aggregates illustrated with the  five elements and the five things arisen from the elements, the constituents,  and sources are naturally free from elaboration, and unconditioned phenom ena, illustrated by space, are naturally free from elaboration. In general, un derstand that just as the two types of phenomena are free from elaboration, all 

540 DONAL D S . LOPEZ , JR.  

phenomena are dependently arisen, in that they are without intrinsic nature,  free from elaboration, profound, tranquil, not intrinsically established as the  entity of anything whatsoever.  

Second, meditation on subjects as not intrinsically existent. An eye con sciousness arises in dependence on the conjunction of the eye sense organ, a  form, and a prior substantial cause, and so forth. Upon analyzing that, the prior  substantial cause is not the eye consciousness, the two - the eye sense organ  [and] the object (that is, the form) - the color, the shape the feel, the outside,  inside and in between, the cardinal directions, above and below, and the middle  area: [these] are not the eye consciousness. It does not abide in any of those  individually and it does not go to or come from any of those. The eye con sciousness does not intrinsically exist. Be in equipoise in the state of that non finding. In the same way, the ear consciousness, the nose consciousness, the  tongue consciousness, the body consciousness, and the mental consciousness  arise respectively in dependence on the conjunction of their respective sense  organ and substantial cause; that is, the sound, odor, taste, object of touch, or  phenomenon that is its object. However, upon analyzing them individually,  they do not intrinsically exist. Therefore, be in equipoise in that understanding,  as above. Thus, all phenomena of samsara comprised by objects and subject  exist as entities in the analysis of dependent arising; they are not intrinsically  established. Understand them to be like illusions, dreams, and mirages.  

Second, the meditation on the phenomena of nirvana as not intrinsically  existent has three parts: meditation on the body, speech, and mind of a buddha  as not intrinsically existent. First, meditation on the appearance of a form body  lacks intrinsic existence. Take the body of the Tathagata as the basis of visu 

alization and consider the limbs of the body like the head and hands, the senses  organs like the eyes, the thirty-two major marks like the crown protrusion, the  eighty minor marks like copper-colored fingernails, and the hair pores. By  analyzing them individually, none of them is established as the body of the  Tathagata. Similarly, it does not arise from the cardinal directions, above, be 

low, the aggregates, constituents, sources, elements, what arises from the ele ments, the impermanent, the permanent, conditioned phenomena, uncondi tioned phenomena, the appearing or the empty, samsara or nirvana. Thus, it  does not abide in the entity of any of those. It does not go into any of those.  Therefore, be in equipoise on it being free from elaboration and without in trinsic nature.  

Second, regarding speech, take the three seed syllables [Om ah hum] as the  object of observation. The vowels and consonants are expressed as speech in  accordance with thought, as well as the sixty branches of euphonious speech,  are without intrinsic nature, like the sound of an echo. Where does sound  come from? The throat, tongue, teeth, flesh, bones, bloods, the inside the body,  outside the body, in between, above or below? Where is it now? Then, where  does it go? Understand through analysis that it does not come from any of  those; it does not abide, and it does not go. Be in equipoise. 

MEDITATION ON EMPTINESS 541  

Third, take any of the hand implements, like the vajra, as the object of  observation. By analyzing their outside, inside, and in between, their big parts  and small parts, their top and bottom, shape, and color individually, none of  those is the vajra, and so forth. They are not naturally established by anything;  they are free of all elaborations; they have become like space. Therefore, be in  equipoise.  

Thus, the body, speech, and mind of the Tathagata are dependently arisen.  They are established as real when they are not analyzed. As entities of medi tative equipoise, which are analyzed with reasoning, they are not established  as the nature of anything at all; they are free from elaboration, passed beyond  being objects of speech or thought; they cannot be illustrated by anything; they  are free from all extremes. Understand all phenomena of samsara and nirvana  in the same way. The nature of everything is indivisible and of the same nature.  Therefore, when you understand that it is beyond adopting and discarding,  negation and proof, and all signs of apprehended and apprehender, subject and  object, understand that you have attained peace with regard to the profound  samsara and nirvana. Meditate until you have understood it in that way.  

It is of great importance to search for the person prior to meditating on the  selflessness of person; to search for something separate, such as form, prior to  meditating on the selflessness of phenomena; to search for the body of the  Tathagata prior to meditating on nirvana as without intrinsic nature; to inquire  into each of the objects of observation, to study them and, indeed, on the  occasion of observing with insight, to seek with scripture and reasoning to  prove, for each of the objects of observation, that reality is dependent arising  and the absence of intrinsic nature. Until you have the ascertainment that  decides on dependent arising, there is no opportunity to create the experience  of insight.  

[The section on the identification of emptiness is not translated here.]  

This instruction on the view of the equality of mundane existence and peace  has been put into letters by dPa' bo rdo rje in accordance with the words of  the venerable Manjughosa, adorned slightly with scripture and reasoning of  the pure Madhyamika tradition of the noble Nagarjuna and his son [Aryadeva]  and the glorious Candrakirti. All the scriptures of the Teacher are included in  the two, Sutra and Tantra. All the topics of Sutra are included in two stages.  All the topics of Tantra are included in two stages. In the system of Nagarjuna  and his son, the two - the ultimate explained from the perspective of the ex oteric perfections and the clear light explained from the perspective of the  esoteric secret mantra - are asserted to be the same. Therefore, I have faith  only in the system of Nagarjuna and his son and I follow Nagarjuna and his  son in their system of extracting the Buddha's intention from the Sutras and  Tantras as well. These instructions indeed set forth the very pure Madhyamika  view. However, the actual practice contains instructions on the clear light as  described in the Guhyasamaja Tantra. Therefore, in the section on quiescence, 

542 DONALD S. LOPEZ, JR.  

the method of cultivating samadhi based on the five lineages and four consorts  is unique to Tantra.  

NAMO SRI GURU MANJUGHOSAYA *  

I make supplication to the Conqueror Vajradhara, the protector of existence  and peace, who does not abide in existence or peace, who, through wisdom,  expels the bonds of existence and who, through compassion, casts the love of  his own peace far away.  

I supplicate the protector Manjughosa, body of wisdom concentrating into  one the limitless treasure of wisdom of the conquerors without number, ex ceeding the number of particles in a billion lands.  

I supplicate the feet of dPa' bo rdo rje, all of whose webs of doubt were  cleared away in direct perception by Manjughosa himself through the power  of great waves of prayers made long ago.  

I pray to be able to create faith and devotion effortlessly at all times by merely  calling to mind the kind lord, the root of all qualities of virtue and goodness,  mundane and supramundane.  

I pray to have little desire, to know satisfaction, to abide in peace and dis cipline, to seek liberation from my heart, to speak honestly, to act conscien tiously, to rely on superior companions, to create pure appearances impartially.  

I pray to remember that there is no time and that it is not just words to say  that death is definite and the time of death indefinite, to turn away completely  from attachment to fame and honor, to create a mind free of doubt.  

I pray to create compassion effortlessly by knowing all embodied beings as  kind mothers, to remember the sufferings of the weary, and turn away from  the wish for my happiness alone.  

I pray to understand, exactly as it is, the meaning of profound dependent  arising free from extremes, the single medicine removing all sickness of ex treme views, the intention of the supreme noble Nagarjuna and his son.  

With this virtue as an example, may all the roots of whatever virtue is created  by myself and others in the three times become causes only of unsurpassed  enlightenment and never fructify even for an instant as causes of what does  not agree with supreme enlightenment: profit, fame, retinue, resources, wealth,  and honor.  

May this pure prayer be realized by the power of the blessings of the con querors and their excellent children, by the incontrovertible truth of dependent  arising, and by my own pure intentions.  

This cluster of grain of achievements, a prayer to teachers of the dear lineage  of blessings, was written by the glorious bLo bzang grags pa of rGyal khams,  who has heard much, at O' de gung rgyal of Lha zhol, the king of snow moun tains in the snowy range. 

### 31 Japanese Tantra, the Tachikawa-ryu,  and Ryobu Shinto  

Bernard Faure  

Scholars have often tried to define Buddhism through its theory of causality. The  Buddhist conception of karmic retribution, although derived from Brahmanic  thought, is usually presented as the most significant advance, not only over Brah manism but also over such other religious trends as Daoism and Confucianism,  which emphasized a system of cosmological connections based on "correlative  thinking." In this respect, it is significant that Tantric Buddhism also emphasized  cosmological connections rather than linear causality, and seems to have returned  to the Vedic conception of man as a microcosm. This macro-microcosmic con ception of the universe as emanating from a first principle is a major departure  from early Buddhism which, never overly concerned with cosmogony, instead  focused on ontogeny; that is, on the series of causes forming the so-called twelve linked chain - from ignorance to birth and death - leading to the emergence of  the individual.  

Tantra, an offshoot of the Vedic-Brahmanic and yogic traditions, is first of all  a system of correspondences between microcosm and macrocosm, man and the  universe. Whereas early Buddhism was defined by its ascetic world rejection and  its conception of man as an ultimately otherworldly being, Tantra may be defined  as its reintegration of the world into the soteriological path - since man and the  world are now fundamentally identical. By reintegrating the world into its prac 

tice, Tantra also reintegrated sexuality, one of the world's main driving forces.  Consequently, sexuality and fertility came to constitute basic elements of the  Tantric worldview. If the return to primordial unity remains the distant horizon  of this metaphysical teaching, Tantric practice is by contrast governed by a fun 

damental duality, usually defined in sexual terms. Thus, Tantra is in a true sense  a nondual dualism: whereas the theory emphasizes nondualism, the practice is  by and large characterized by dualism.  

Tantric Buddhism is therefore not, as some still believe, a degeneration of Bud-

544 BERNAR D FAUR E  

dhism caused by the deleterious influence of popular Indian culture. It is rather  a highly philosophical and ritual synthesis, a development of the notion of the  Two Truths (that is, ultimate and conventional truths). This feature accounts for  the fact that Tantric Buddhism was readily able to integrate another complex  cosmological system, the Chinese theory of yin and yang and of the five agents.  It is this synthesis, effected during the eighth and ninth centuries in China and  Japan, that became the core of Japanese Tantra. Japanese Tantra - or at least its  mainstream, redefined as "esoteric Buddhism" (mikkyo) - attempted to "purify"  itself of the sexual elements that characterized Indian Tantra; that is, to elude  sexuality and return to the strictly ascetic conception of early Buddhism. This  attempt was not entirely successful, however. In any case, it is important to see  that sexuality in Tantra is of an eminently cosmological and ritual nature. The  union of the male and female principles is seen as the source of all things, ex pressed in Tantric mythology as the sexual union of the god or buddha with his  female partner, who represents his energy (sakti).  

By becoming the main discourse of medieval Japanese ideology, Tantric Bud dhism contributed to the "Indianization" of Japan. Matters were, of course, more  complex, since in the meantime Japan had already integrated the principles of  Chinese cosmology. This integration took another step forward with the rise of  the Tachikawa-ryu. This branch of Shingon has been traced back to a priest named  Ninkan (fl. twelfth century). After being exiled to the town of Tachikawa (in Izu  province), Ninkan studied yin-yang cosmology (onmyodo) and incorporated cos mological elements into Shingon doctrine. His teaching soon flourished, and,  according to tradition, was systematized by Raiyu (1126-1304). However, the  Tachikawa-ryu was eventually declared to be "heretical." The reasons alleged were  essentially doctrinal, having to do with the "immoral" elements in the Tachikawa  teachings. This led to the interdiction of the Tachikawa-ryu and to the destruc tions of its scriptures, at the end of the Muromachi period. Nevertheless, Tachi kawa ideas, which in some respects were a resurgence of Indian Tantra, continued  to influence Buddhist discourse and even provided significant components for  the late medieval and early modern worldview.  

In India, Tantric Buddhism had already assimilated local Hindu gods into its  pantheon. This synthesis was so successful that Buddhism, losing its sharp dis tinctive features, was eventually reabsorbed into the fold of Hinduism. On the  contrary, in Japan, a similar synthesis triggered a reaction and led to the emer gence of a distinctly "Japanese" religion named Shinto. This tradition, which  emerged in centers like Ise Shrine, finds its origins in a particular brand of Jap anese Tantra, the so-called Ryobu Shinto. This new ideology, according to which  Shinto deities were the local manifestations of "original" buddhas, led, for in stance, to the identification of the sun goddess Amaterasu with the buddha Vai rocana (Dainichi, "Great Sun" in Japanese), and of the two shrines of Ise with the  two great mandalas of Shingon (the Womb realm and Vajra realm mandalas).  These two mandalas were used in the Tachikawa-ryu as symbols of sexual polarity,  the Tachikawa influence being very strong in this Tantric Ise tradition. 

JAPANESE TANTRA 54 5  

This "nondual dualism" is illustrated in such works as the Ise denki, or, to give  its full (and rather enigmatic) title, the Ise shosho Nihongi yushiki honsho nin denki  (Transmitted Record of the Nihongi, of the Consciousness, Fundamental Nature,  and Humanity, produced by I-Se). According to its colophon, this work was  copied in 1537 at the Myoo-in, a temple near Ise, after being transmitted by the  priest Sonkai (1472-1543) to his disciple Ryokan. The Ise denki is divided into  ten sections, which treat of various aspects of the esoteric Buddhist tradition with  regard to Ise. Here we will present the first three sections, describing the main  phases of the cosmic emanation process - which are also, in reverse order, those  of the soteriological process. Even so, it will be difficult to provide a simple idea  of the text's intricate symbolism, encoded in multple layers of meanings that  appear at first blush to be mere repetitions of numerical symbols (sets of polarities,  triads, and pentads). On closer examination, the text describes a mandala, that  is, in a dynamic form, the cosmogonic or psychogenic process of emanation (and  resorption). The following is but a preliminary attempt to decode some of these  meanings.  

The name Ise is interpreted here in a very idiosyncratic fashion, typical of  medieval exegesis. The two graphemes (Sino-Japanese characters) of this com pound are used to symbolize the fundamental polarity out of which everything  arises. Thus, "I" and "Se" become the Tantric and Shinto equivalents of the Chi nese yin and yang. They are also symbols of (and symbolized by) the two great  Shingon mandates. In other Ryobu Shinto texts, the two principles of yin and  yang (and the two mandalas) are associated with the two primordial Shinto deities  Izanami and Izanagi, whose lovemaking brought about a Genesis of sorts. This is  why, in the following translation, I will read the term as I-Se, to emphasize that  it is the cosmological polarity, more than the geographical toponym in the Kii  peninsula, that is being referenced.  

1. ON THE HARMONIOUS UNION OF HEAVEN AND EARTH OF I-SE  

In the so-called harmonious union of Heaven and Earth of I-Se tradition, beings  are the flower, earth is the tathagata Vairocana of the two Womb and Vajra  realms; and beings are the fundamentally unborn calyx of the letter a. Thus, it  is written: "If your own mind is pure, all the buddhas dwell in it; when the  mind with a single voice recollects the letter a, all the buddhas constantly  preach the Law." The letter a in question is none other than the two characters  I-Se, and it is the origin of man and woman. This is why it is said in the esoteric  teaching: "All beings have in their chest a letter a, whose sequence is as follows:  within the lotus appears the moon disk; and within the moon disk appears the  letter a, which transforms into five colors: blue, red, yellow, white, and black."  Under this letter a is a three-pronged vajra, representing the six sense faculties  of beings. It is also said that the two buddhas and the four bodhisattvas dwell  there, sharing the six kinds of ritual implements. . . . Thus, the one-pronged 

546 BERNAR D FAURE  

vajra is the stem of the lotus flower; it is the body of all beings. The five-pronged  vajra is the root of the lotus flower; it is the right and left feet of beings. The  three-pronged vajra is the petals of the lotus flower; it is the right and left arms  of beings.  

In I-Se, we find the gate of the letter a, the first of the forty-two letters. The  five-pronged vajra is the great earth of the Dharma realm; it is called the "Palace  of Suchness." The three-pronged vajra is the unborn principle and wisdom  inside the mind; it is the retribution earth of the retribution body. The one 

pronged vajra is the essence of the principle outside the body; it is the won derful domain of ultimate reality.  

It is also said: "The letter a is the bodily karma of the dharma body; the  moon disk is the verbal karma of the retribution body; the lotus is the mental  karma of the metamorphosis body." These three bodies of the fundamental  essence of the three periods are also symbolized as follows: the one-pronged  vajra is the bodily karma of dharma body; the three-pronged vajra is the verbal  karma of the retribution body; the five-pronged vajra is the mental karma of  the metamorphosis body. When above and below unite harmoniously, one  speaks of the dharma body of the six great elements. All classes of beings  without exception are endowed with this nature. Thus, in the interval of the  unconditioned sound, the phoneme a arises and the fruits of buddhahood are  perfected. If one knows and realizes this letter a, even the four serious offences  and the five transgressions turn into the merits of the mandala. If one cultivates  this letter, the three poisons - ignorance, greed, and hatred - are transmuted  into the secret practices of yoga.  

The "harmonious union of heaven and earth" is the union of I-Se. "I" is the  tathagata Vairocana of the Womb realm; "Se" the tathagata Vairocana of the  Vajra realm. It is also said: "When one consider the origins of the letter a, it is  the tathagata Vairocana of the Womb realm; it is heaven. It is none other than  I-Se. With the letter ba (va in Sanskrit), again: it is the tathagata Vairocana of  the Vajra realm, the earth; it is also I-Se. If one divides the human body into  five sections, the top of the head corresponds to the realm of the buddhas; the  right arm to that of the bodhisattvas; the left arm to that of the pratyekabud dhas; the right leg to that of the devas; the left leg to that of the sravakas. When  one thus unites the heaven and earth of I-Se, the letter is on the tip of each of  the fingers of the four hands and each of the toes of the four feet. These letters  correspond to the bodhisattvas of the forty-two stages. The two highest stages  are those of the two buddhas of I-Se, who are are man and woman. The man's  stage is always that of a buddha body. Man is ruled by heaven, woman by the  earth. This is what is called the union of heaven and earth. The seed-letters  born from "I" are red; those born from "Se" are white. . . . This is called the  harmonious union of heaven and earth, of the two Womb and Vajra realms.  

Because Indian metaphysics takes the Word or Speech (vac) to be the ultimate  principle, we need first to explain briefly Indian conceptions regarding language.JAPANES E TANTR A 547  

Most significant in this respect are the forty-nine or fifty phonemes of the Sanskrit  phonetic system, called matrkas or "little Mothers" because they are seen as the  source of all sounds - hence of all things. Incidentally, these phonemes served as  model for the Japanese kana syllabary, attributed to Kukai (774-835), the founder  of Shingon. There is another arrangement of forty-two phonemes, called a-ra-pa 

ca-na after the sequence of its five first phonemes. It is this arrangement that is  mentioned here in association with the forty-two stages of the bodhisattva's career.  In both cases, the first of these phonemes is the syllable a, which came to take  on mystical values, not only as the symbol of all beginnings but also as constitutive  of all other syllables; and furthermore, as the marker of the negative (as in English  and French, two other Indo-European languages). This phoneme thus came to  express the ultimate principle, from which everything emanates. As a vowel, a is  also the first of the sixteen vowels of the Sanskrit "garland of letters," which  includes m (the anusvara or bindu) and h (the visarga), two phonemes said to  give birth to the series of consonants, from ka to ha. If this vocalic-consonantal  sequence is perceived in cosmogonic terms as symbolizing the emanation process,  the reverse sequence indicates the resorption process, which is that taken by the  Tantric practitioner who is intent on returning to its source. This is why our text  emphasizes the uttering of the single sound: this inarticulate sound is the nada,  the primal manifestation of the absolute, the knowledge of which is tantamount  to deliverance. This is the sound that corresponds to the phoneme m, the bindu  ("dot" or "drop"), marked graphically by a dot above the syllable. This bindu is  a "drop" of phonic but also photic, or luminous, energy, that is temporarily col lected before again dividing itself to create the multiplicity of consonants and the  totality of things. This nasal resonance is said to be born from the union of the  god and his Sakti, an idea expressed graphically by two bindus, red and white,  fusing to form a "mixed bindu." The bindu, in short, is the point of convergence  and expansion; it symbolizes, therefore it is, the Absolute; or rather, it represents  the point of contact with the source of energy. Hence the importance of mantras,  and their magical but also cosmogonic efficacy, uniting sound and breath, and  the cosmic and human planes.  

To summarize: from the phonetic standpoint, the energy of sound, born from  the sexual union of the god and his consort, first creates the sixteen vowels, before  concentrating into the bindu, and then disseminating, through the visarga (graph ically represented as two bindus) into the consonants. In cosmogonic terms, the  initial duality first expands, forming a first level; then concentrates into a drop,  which subdivides into three or five elements to form a second level, before further  engendering the multiplicity of things. From the standpoint of generic Tantric  meditation, this may be visualized as the generation of three mandalas: the prac titioner first visualizes the god and his Sakti in sexual union. This vision merges  into a single point of pure light (the bindu), from which another mandala arises,  divided into five colored sectors. At the center is an eight-petaled lotus, which  serves as a dais for the god, from whom emerge the four deities of the cardinal  directions, who in turn produce the four subordinate deities of the four inter-

548 BERNAR D FAURE  

mediate directions. The practitioner then visualizes another mandala, the jewel  palace, representing the human world, at the center of which the god and his  consort are engaged in sexual union, surrounded by lesser deities.  

This dynamic may also be expressed in terms of the mantra Om (a-hum, in  Japanese a-un). Here again, the emanation process starts with a duality, or rather  the union of two principles, and resorbs into unity with the "adornment" of the  bindu. For reasons that have little to do with phonetics, the two phonemes and  the bindu, a-u-n, are replaced in the Ise denki by the two ideograms I-Se. The  "harmonious union" of these two principles is not only phonetic but also sexual,  and indeed the sexual metaphor pervades our text, giving some credibility to the  claim that Tachikawa rituals involved sexual intercourse between the priest and  his female partner. Whatever the case, the phoneme a is said to change into five  phases (and five colors), giving rise to a fivefold symbolism that is another leit motiv of this text. These "five as" (called the "five turns" or the "five dots" of  the a, because they are expressed graphically by dots) are: the short a, the long  a (a), the bindu (am), the visarga (ah), and finally the synthesis of all these: ahm  (or ah).  

The phoneme a is also said to be "the jade gate" of a woman; that is, her vulva,  the source of all buddhas and human beings. As we will see, the female womb is  assimilated to the ultimate principle, the primordial chaos, before the emergence  of the buddhas and of the world. This image is reminiscent of Courbet's famous  painting of a woman's vulva, entitled "The Origin of the World." In Japanese  Tantra, this letter a, as ultimate principle, is also the cosmic buddha Vairocana,  represented at the center of the mandala (or cosmic realm) that emanates from  him. In Indian Tantra, the deity is often represented in cosmic union with his  sakti (or female energy), whereas in Japanese Tantra this element is often down played (it is implied, however, in the fact that Vairocana is androgynous). This  conception of the deity as a polarized (and sexualized) couple, masculine and  feminine, is the central characteristic of Tantra. Here, the reference to the "two  buddhas of I-Se" in the context of sexual union is more in line with the Indian  conception.  

Whereas Indian culture favors orality, Chinese and Japanese cultures emphasize  the written letter - as shown by this text. Thus, the grapheme a (together with  its phoneme) comes to play an important role in the Shingon meditation known  as "Aji-kan" (contemplation of the grapheme a). In this meditation, the practi 

tioner is told to visualize the clear white disk of the full moon, and in this disk  the letter a (written in a particular script known as Siddham) on a lotus. This  visualization is a dynamic creation process, the creation of a mental mandala from  the central buddha Vairocana, through the four buddhas of the cardinal directions  (in the sequence E, S, W, N) and the four bodhisattvas of the ordinal directions  (SE, SW, NW, NE), down to the peripheral deities and the multiplicity of sentient  beings. Our text merely alludes to the principal phases of this process, as they  are visualized - that is, enacted - by the practitioner. But here, instead of the  emanation process - from unity to multiplicity - we are dealing with a resorption 

JAPANES E TANTR A 549  

process in three phases - from multiplicity (symbolized by the lotus and its pet als), through oneness (symbolized by the moon disk), to the ultimate principle  (the letter a). The basic schema - simply alluded to here, but more explicit in  Indian sources - remains the same: the energy of the two principles is first re sorbed into one point (bindu), before evolving into a pentad, from which multi plicity evolves. In the embryological terms of section 3, the drops (red and white)  of mother and father unite to form a bindu, which evolves into a formed embryo  possessed of five limbs; the subsequent birth of this pentadic being marks the  emergence of another level of reality or consciousness: the creation of a new  world, the "jeweled palace," which the Ise denki calls the "Palace [or Capital] of  Suchness."  

The phases of emanation are often described as being three or five in number.  The three phases are here described in terms of the three most common types of  vajras, a ritual instrument used in Shingon ritual. The number of prongs of the  vajra (one, three, or five) lends itself to all kinds of symbolism. This is particularly  true of the five-pronged vajra, called the "human-shaped vajra" owing to its vague  resemblance to the human body. Our texts manipulate these numerical categories  ad nauseam, in order to reinforce the equivalence between macrocosm (the uni 

verse) and microcosm (the human body). Here, the three types of vajras first  correspond to the three parts of the lotus (the stem, the root, and the petals), as  well as to the three sections of the human body (the head and torso, the legs, and  the arms). They also represent the three types of karmic retribution caused by  acts of the mouth, body, and mind. Thus, reaching the level of the letter a means  returning to the source of everything, the stage before anything whatsoever arises;  and it cancels all the evil karma one may have accumulated in the past. Likewise,  the three symbols of the lotus, the moon, and the letter a correspond to the three  bodies of the Buddha, from its most down-to-earth form, the metamorphosis body  (nirmana-kaya) to the most absolute, the dharma body (dharma-kaya) - with both  relative and absolute being mediated by the retribution body (sambhoga-kdya),  seen only by beings who have acquired merits through practice.  

The text mentions six buddhas; that is, the two buddhas of I-Se and the four  buddhas of the cardinal directions. Here, as in Indian Tantra, Vairocana is rep resented as a divine polarity. These six buddhas, symbolizing the six elements of  Shingon Buddhism, are also represented by ritual instruments, namely, two sets  of three vajras, symbolizing, respectively, the microcosm (the human body) and  macrocosm. These three vajras also represent the three levels of reality, the three  mandalas: the five-pronged vajra symbolizes the pentadic human world (the "Pal ace of Suchness"); the three-pronged vajra the intermediary level of the duality  of the two principles; and the one-pronged vajra the ultimate reality. Thus, the  sequence from five-pronged to three-pronged to one-pronged vajra represents the  cosmic resorption from pentadic reality to duality to unity, as experienced sym bolically by the practitioner. Again, the two series of three bodies symbolized by  the three symbols (the letter a, the moon disk, and the lotus on the one hand;  and the three types of vajra on the other) represent the bodies of the buddha 

550 BERNAR D FAUR E  

Vairocana and of sentient beings, whose "harmonious fusion" constitutes the  "dharma body made of the six elements" - that is, the body of the enlightened  being, or of the embryo in the mother's womb.  

Recall that the process of emanation begins with the sexual union of the two  polar opposites, the male deity and his female sakti (energy) or, in Ryobu Shinto  terms, the "I" and "Se" of Ise (the character se, not so incidentally, happens to  mean "energy"). This union is presented in Chinese cosmological terms as a union  of heaven and earth, of yin and yang. In Tantric terms, the emanation process is  first a phonetic one, from the first to the last of the forty-two phonemes of the a 

ra-pa-ca-na sequence. In the translated passage, the first two letters a and va (or  vara with the bindu) symbolize the "two buddhas of I-Se," that is, Vairocana in  his two aspects, in the Womb and Vajra realms. The remaining forty letters are  associated (and written on) the twenty fingers and toes, realizing a microcosmic/  phonetic body, as well as the soteriological path of the bodhisattva's career, with  its forty-two stages. These letters are said to be either female or male, arising from  the female principle ("I") or the male principle ("Se"). Their respective colors, red  and white, refer to the Indian (and Sino-Japanese) belief that the human embryo  is formed by the union of the blood of the mother and the semen of the father.  The two letters a and va are also the first of the sequence a/va/ra/ha/ka, repre senting the syllables of the five elements (earth, water, fire, wind, space).  

2. ON THE EIGHT-PETALED LOTUS OF I-SE  

The "eight-petaled lotus" is the great earth of the dharma realm of the har monious union of the two Womb and Vajra sections. The above-mentioned  "harmonious union" of the two male and female bodies, with their four arms  and four feet, is this "eight-petaled lotus." It is the source of all things. Thus,  "capital of the suchness of innate awakening" refers to the gate of the letter a,  the first of the forty-two letters. One also calls this the making of the Tathagata.  The two dharmas of consciousness and body are called "unborn." The Dharma  gate of the two truths, conventional and ultimate, means that all things under  heaven are the body of the Buddha; everything contains this lotus. You must  inquire well into this and realize its truth. Without the ultimate reality of the  suchness of ultimate and conventional truths, in which concentration and wis 

dom are harmoniously united, nothing could come to life. Like the forms of  the seeds of the five wheels, the Buddha's mind sustains the sweet and won drous practices of the Three Secrets. All the actions of sentient beings, without  exception, are contained in the sound of the wisdom of ultimate reality. What  a pity! Failing to realize this from lack of wisdom we are born in this world,  and in the end we die, having forgotten the great merits of innate awakening.  It is a shame not to have realized I-Se until now. The resonance of the voice  at the moment of birth, all this is the suchness of I-Se. This is why it is said in 

JAPANES E TANTR A 551  

the scripture: "The actions truly manifested by all beings, the awakening re alized by the buddhas, the wondrous and subtle practices: all of these have to  be like what the Buddha spoke." It is also said: "He explained that verbal char acteristics, words and speech, are all mantras; corporeal characteristics, actions  and movements, all are secret seals (mudras); mental characteristics, thoughts,  all are secret contemplation." This is why, when sentient beings are born, the  eight-petaled lotus of the mind/heart is the great earth of the fundamentally  unborn letter a. When one is born, one expresses through words the wondrous  practice of I-Se; when one dies, too, one returns to the great earth of the such ness of innate awakening. "Fundamentally unborn" means that one must re alize the principle, for a long time constantly playing on the terrace of the  secret words; "to obtain the wondrous practice of Sha-na" simply means that  one must become the mind described in this teaching. The eight petals are the  letter a, and this letter a is the jade gate of woman.  

In this second section, the symbolism of the lotus is brought to the forefront.  The eight-petaled lotus in question is that found at the center of the Womb  realm mandala. It represents the emanation process of the world, but also, in  human terms, sexual union - and the Tachikawa-ryu did in fact graphically  represent a man and woman making love on a giant lotus as an expression of  its ultimate secret. This lotus also represents the mother's womb, the source  of all beings, whence the phoneme a. It finally expresses, in ontogenic terms,  the mind/heart of the embryo, from which various types of consciousness arise.  The sexual union is further expressed by various polarities such as conscious ness and body, ultimate and conventional truth, or concentration and wis 

dom - the two main elements of Buddhist practice. One such polarity seems  to imply a play on words on the expression sha-na, which is an abbreviation  for Vairocana, but also a reference to the two Chinese demonstrative pronouns:  the "this" and "that" that symbolize duality.  

Here again, we have an emphasis on the identity between the microcosm  and the macrocosm, between the various phenomena and the cosmic buddha  Vairocana. This identity is expressed in terms of the five wheels (cakras) of the  Indian tradition, or of the "three secrets" of the Shingon tradition. The primal  cry of the child at birth is said to be the primordial name of I-Se. In other  sources, the two phonemes a-un (or a-a, ha-ha) are the orgasmic sounds uttered  at the peak of sexual union. Not only these sounds, but all others, are seen (or  heard) as mantras; that is, as expressions of ultimate reality, as the voice of the  cosmic Buddha. Likewise, all gestures are mudras, symbolic gestures, gestures  of Vairocana; and all thoughts are Vairocana's contemplation. In the Shingon  tradition, these represent the "three mysteries" of speech, body, and mind.  Thus, this section illustrates the reintegration of the world into the soteriolog ical path. 

552 BERNARD FAURE  3. METHOD OF INITIAL COMPLETION OF I-SE  

The first stage is illustrated by a circle, in which are written two letter a's in  Siddham script, above two Sino-Jap»nese characters meaning red and white;  and, at the center, Mind and Lewdness.  

The essence and flesh of the mother, symbolizing the Womb realm (eastern  direction), represent the mind of one suchness of the harmonious union of I Se. The essence and bones of the father, symbolizing the Vajra realm, are the  virtue of energy of the harmonious union of heaven and earth. This is the  essence of the five limbs [according to the I-Se teaching]; it is the primordial  body, the seed-syllable ran, the beginning of the passions of greed and love,  when father and mother have intercourse, and the two drops, red and white,  unite harmoniously. The red letter a is the efficiency of the mother's emission;  it is the seed-letter that constitutes the flesh of beings. The white letter a is the  breath of the father's emission; it is what constitutes the bones of beings. These  two letter a's, red and white, are the universal body of the Vairocana of the  two Womb and Vajra realms; they constitute a buddha body in which causes  and effects are constantly abiding. This is why the Vairocana of the two realms  as well as the five hundred Worthies and the seven hundred Worthies are  enshrined in the body of beings. This awakening of I-Se means to become a  buddha in this very body.  

The second stage is illustrated graphically by a kind of vessel with two horns, in  which are inscribed the letters a and ban.  

It corresponds to the tathagata Ratnasambhava. It is called Wisdom of the Equal  nature. It is the buddha of the south, the gate of practice. In two seven-day  periods, the embryo's body become like this. It is called "three-pronged vajra."  Its right and left extremities are the Vairocana of the two Womb and Vajra  sections. Its seed is called abudon. The two red and white colors merge. It is  the stage of the two moons.  

The third stage is illustrated by a kind of trident, in which are inscribed the letters  a, ban, un.  

It corresponds to the buddha Aksobhya of the western direction. It is called  Wisdom of Wondrous Contemplation. It is the bodhisattva gate. It is the stage  called pesi. After three seven-day periods, the body thus has the shape of a  three-pronged vajra. The bones harden, and on each side two arms appear. The  three-pronged vajra shape symbolizes the three secrets; it is also the three  bodhisattvas, the three bodies, and the form of the three-petaled lotus. "Three  seven-day periods" means that, in the matter of harmonious union, one spends  three months in the womb; thus it is called "three sevens." The soul is now 

JAPANESE TANTRA 55 3  

present and active: this is when the divine power of I-Se begins. This is the  initial stage of awakening.  

The fourth stage is symbolized by a five-wheel stupa, inscribed with the five  Siddham letters a, ha, ra, ha, kha in ascending order.  

This shape represents the Buddha Sakyamuni of the northern direction. [As  wisdom,] it is called Wisdom of the Perfection of Action. It is also what one  calls the nirvana gate. It is the stage called ghana. In the fourth seven-day  period, the embryo already has a body like this. This shape is the tathagata of  innate awakening, the body which produces the wisdom of the buddhas of the  five sections. The four Confucian virtues - humanity, righteousness, propriety,  and wisdom - also correspond to this.  

The fifth stage is illustrated by a small buddha, with two letter a's in Siddham  script, above two Sino-Japanese characters meaning red and white.  

This stage is that of the buddha Vairocana at the center. It is the wisdom of  the nature of the dharmadhatu body. It is the buddha with the ten thousand  perfected merits. It is the stage called bano bonga. During the fifth seven-day  period, such a body is formed. This form is the perfectly completed body of  the effects of buddhahood. By focusing one's contemplation on the bodhisattva  who aspires upward, one comes to dwell in the unconditioned, where one no  longer knows even the beginningless self. However, as a result of the contem plation of the bodhisattva going downward to convert beings, one becomes a  buddha endowed with the ten thousand practices, according to the right prin 

ciple of I-Se.  

The fifth seven-day period is the fifth month. It represents the totality of the  nine months. The number of days now exceeds 38 days, and when 275 days  have elapsed, birth takes place. In this, there are differences, based on the  poverty or wealth of that person. When nine months have been spent in the  womb, nine full moons disks have appeared, and one leaves the fundamental  nature of I-Se.  

"Becoming a buddha in this very body" (sokushin jobutsu) is a fundamental con ception of Tantric Buddhism, popularized in Japan by Kukai. After describing in  symbolic terms the sexual union that is the source of both the cosmogonic and  the ontogenic processes, the text proceeds to describe the transition from duality  to multiplicity as a process of embryonic gestation in five stages. The five gestation  stages in Indian medicine are kalalam (gararan in Japanese), arbudam (abudon in  Japanese), pesi (heishi in Japanese), ghana (kennan in Japanese), and prasakha  (harashakya in Japanese): these correspond to five periods of seven days each,  after which the embryo is said to be completely formed. According to Indian (as  well as Chinese and Japanese) embryology, the flesh of the embryo comes from 

554 BERNARD FAURE  

the mother, and the bones from the father. The two elements (blood and semen)  are here represented graphically by two letter a's, one red, the other white, sym bolizing the two mandalas, the two realms of reality. The Womb realm corre sponds to the mother (blood, the flesh, the red letter a), the truth of Suchness;  whereas the Vajra realm corresponds to the father (semen, bones, the white letter  a), to energy. Note here the inversion from Indian Tantra, in which the male  element - the god - is the unmoving principle, whereas the female element - the goddess, his Sakti - symbolizes his energy.  

This embryo is, literally, a "buddha in this very body" - and the five stages  correspond to the five "wheels" (cakras) and the five elements that constitute the  body of the cosmic buddha Vairocana, as well as of all beings. Childbirth was  traditionally perceived negatively as a fall into the world of suffering, produced  by karmic retribution - and the second part of the text will develop this notion.  But in the first part, the gestation process and the birth that ensues are sanctified  as a process of awakening, and they are those of the bodhisattva who, instead of  wishing to rise toward nirvana, decides in his compassion to be reborn in this  world, in order to save sentient beings. To illustrate that this gestation process is  also a process of awakening, the five embryonic stages are identified with the five  gates of Buddhist practice (production of the thought of awakening, cultivation  of practice, bodhi, nirvana, and upaya or skillful means), the five directions (east,  south, west, north, and the center), and the five buddhas.  

Vairocana, endowed with the five buddha wisdoms, is the beginning and end  of this process. As we saw earlier in the vajra symbolism of the human body, each  stage is now symbolized by a different type of vajra. Thus, the human embryo is  none other than Vairocana. But just as the five buddhas first emanate from Vai 

rocana, so too, when this body becomes differentiated, the five buddhas first  appear at each stage of its gestation. The gestation process is thus a sort of tem poral mandala. Out of these buddhas and their wisdoms, the entire world will  appear, and this is tantamount to the birth of the child, the creation of another  mandala. These five stages are sometimes followed by others, but usually the  remainder of the gestation process is implied. Sometimes the nine months are  represented by the phases of the moon, illustrated by nine superimposed moon  

disks - an echo of the cakras of the subtle body of human beings.  Thus, the new human being is the perfect Vairocana, the coming together of  the Womb and Vajra realms, of the two mandalas. In this body reside all the  gods - that is, all the energies - of the universe. It is a divine body, a perfect  microcosm. The idea was already found in such Hindu texts as the Upanisads,  according to which "the gods dwell in the body, like cows in a stable." This  equivalence of the body of Vairocana with that of sentient beings is also achieved  ritually through the practice of nyasa, "imposition." Nyasa is the cosmologization  or divinization of the body (or of an object), which is effected by touching its  various parts, depositing the corresponding deities or energies in them, and "seal ing" them with appropriate mudras (symbolic gestures). Through these macro and microcosmic correlations, which allow for the superimposition of a cosmic 

JAPANESE TANTRA 555  

diagram on the grid of the body, man is cosmicized, while the cosmos is divinized  (and ultimately, humanized). Man becomes a universe in expansion (and resorp tion), that is, a living mandala.  

The five wheels (cakras) or elements (earth, water, fire, wind, space) are sym bolized by the five seed-syllables (byas): a, va, ra, ha, kha. The practitioner con templates these five wheels and their bijas on his own body: the section below  the hips corresponds to the earth wheel, and its seed-syllable is a; the navel  corresponds to the water wheel (va); the heart to the fire wheel (ra); the space  between the eyebrows to the wind wheel (ha); the top of the head - and the  twelve-inch space above it - to the space wheel (kha). Thus he becomes Vairo cana. These five wheels or elements evolved in ancient India as a combination of  the five shapes of the Vedic fire altar (square, circle, triangle, half-moon, dump ling), the five colors (yellow, white, red, blue, black), and the five cakras and  sections of the human body, according to the spiritual physiology of yoga.  

Tantric Buddhism recognizes not only five elements, but six; the sixth element,  represented by the seed-syllable vam, is consciousness. Kukai was apparently the  first to assert that the six elements are the permanent, nonborn realities of the  Dharma realm (and no longer simply the composite, impermanent elements of  the phenomenal world). In the Vajra realm, the five wheels are formed by the  turning of the letter va, whereas in the Womb realm they are formed by that of  the letter a. In both realms, they are also formed or symbolized by the a, va, ra,  ha, kha sequence. In the Mahavairocanasutra, one of the principal scriptural au thorities of East Asian Tantra, we already find the five great elements associated  with the five shapes and the five seed-syllables (a vam, ram, ham, kham). This  synthesis allowed for the development of the five-wheel stupa (gorinto in Japa 

nese). In this stupa, which is unique to Japanese Tantra, the seed-syllables a, va,  ra, ha, kha are inscribed on the front of each element (the five building blocks of  different shapes of the stupa), whereas vam (consciousness), placed on the back,  pervades all five elements.  

The embryo, once fully formed with its five limbs, is an eminently pentadic  being. Because, according to Buddhist notions of transmigration, its gestation  takes place in the liminal phase between a previous life/death and a subsequent  rebirth, it came to be assimilated to the early Buddhist notion of "intermediary  being" (antarabhava), the paradoxical entity surviving after death to form a link  with the next life - whence, perhaps, the association with such a prominent fu 

nerary symbol as the stupa. Whereas the fivefold gestation process served to  emphasize the temporal aspect of cosmogonic emanation, the five-wheel stupa  served as a convenient mnemonic device for summarizing the structural relation ships betwen various elements of reality - at the pentadic stage of its emanation.  

The five-wheel stupa is described in the fourth section of the he denki in terms  of the grapheme a, whose five constitutive elements (brush strokes) are used to  illustrate various pentadic series (the five buddhas, the five directions, the five  aggregates of personality, and so forth). This equivalence is also represented di 

agrammatically at the end of the text. Other sections elaborate specific points. 

556 BERNARD FAURE  

Section 5, which marks the beginning of the second part, discusses the impurity  of the human body. Now described in more physiological terms, it is no longer  the "subtle body" of yogic physiology but rather the mortal body, made of flesh  and bones, bound for the cemetery. However, the microcosmic interpretation is  not entirely absent, since its twelve great bones and 354 small bones are said to  represent the twelve months and 354 days of the lunar year. But we are now in  the realm of conventional truth, and the text itself emphasizes its use of the Two  Truths theory when it refers to the twofold gate of purity and impurity. Section  7 discusses the ultimate principle of I-Se, the suchness to be realized by buddhas  and sentient beings alike. It emphasizes the identity beween buddhas, kamis, and  humans; or, in more Confucian terms, between buddhahood and "humanity."  Section 8 is an explanation of ultimate awakening (sambodhi) in terms of the three  Sino-Japanese characters that form the name of the buddha Amida. Its identifi cation of these characters with the three bodies of the cosmic buddha Vairocana  suggests an influence from the work of the Shingon reformer Kakuban (1095- 1143), who identified Vairocana and Amitabha (Amida). Section 9 deals with the  "eight sufferings" of the human body (birth, old age, and so on), and describes  human life in rather grim terms. These sufferings, however, can be voided when  one realizes the ultimate truth of the mantra of I-Se. Section 10 concerns "em powerment" (adhisthana in Sanskrit; kaji in Japanese), the ritual through which  humans are metamorphosed into buddhas, merging the two great mandalas  within their own body. Such mystical/sexual union of the androgynous practi tioner is what one calls "becoming a buddha in this very body." Once this is  achieved, nothing more needs to - or can - be said.

### 32 Assorted Topics of the Great Completeness by  Dodrupchen III  

Anne Carolyn Klein  

Oral commentary by Khetsun Sangpo Rinpoche  

The Great Completeness tradition is considered the highest of the hierarchically  arranged ninefold path described by the most ancient order of Tibetan Buddhism,  known as Nyingma. Great Completeness, or Dzogchen (rDzogs chen) entails,  above all, discovery of one's actual, and utterly natural, condition. This condition  is also known as the base, and the process of coming to recognize it is the path.  Through such recognition the fruit, one's own buddhahood, becomes manifest.  All three - base, path, and fruit - are in important ways identical, not causally  related or sequential. This text describes base, path, and fruit in terms of three  delightful and spontaneous qualities: smoothness, splendor, and freshness.  

Dzogchen is sometimes even called a path without meditation because once  one fully realizes one's own mind-nature or base there is no need for effort of any  kind. Until then however, practice is necessary for clearing away the internal  obstructions that prevent one from clearly experiencing the profundity of one's  own being. Nyingma is the only Buddhist tradition in which Dzogchen exists,  though Dzogchen is also prominent in the Tibetan Bon tradition, where it is  likewise regarded as the most exalted of the nine vehicles described there. Both  Buddhism and Bon Dzogchen emphasize simplicity, purification, and the possi bility of uncovering enlightenment in this lifetime. We will say more of this  shortly; first, a bit of background.  

Medieval and Modern Masters of the Great Expanse Practice  

A variety of Buddhist textual traditions elaborate the practice of Dzogchen. One  of the best-known bodies of literature, and the one from which the following 

558 ANNE CAROLY N KLEIN  

selection is taken, is the Essential Heart of the Great Expanse (kLong chen snying  thig). This lineage traces its spiritual roots to one of the most revered figures of  Tibetan religious history, the fourteenth-century scholar and meditation master  Longchen Rabjam (kLong-chen pa Dri-med-'od-zer, 1308-1363), said to be the  author of 263 works, 25 of which are still extant. In the late 1700s, the renowned  yogin-practitioner, Jigme Lingpa ('Jigs-med-gling-pa Rang-byung rdo-rje, 1729- 1798) had three visions of Longchen Rabjam, as well as powerful visions and  overwhelming awe with respect to Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava), whereby  he was inspired to codify the Great Expanse liturgies into their present form. It  was the power of his devotion and confidence in these two masters, rather than  his intellect or scholarly endeavors, that gained him full realization of Dzogchen  practice and philosophy. To this day, Longchen Rabjam's brilliant philosophical  structuring of Dzogchen realization, his evocative verses, and the poetically ex pressed devotation of Jigme Lingpa remain hallmarks of the Heart Essence of the  Great Expanse style of study and practice.  

The Great Expanse relies significantly on a unique literary genre of special  importance in the Ancient (Nyingma) school. These are works said to have been  hidden either in the ground or, as in the case of Jigme Lingpa, in the minds of  special persons who are prophesied to discover them, usually through visionary  experience. Through such Treasures (gTer ma), which include major works of  Great Expanse literature, Nyingma continually renews itself, while still maintain 

ing allegience to the past.  

In Tibet, each lineage, and even each monastic college, has textual and Treasure  traditions unique to it. The historical background and monastic context of our  text is therefore of interest. Its author is the third in a line of reincarnate lamas  that began with the first lama in the Dodrupchen lineage, Jigme Thrinley Ozer  Cjigs-med-sphrin-las-'od-zer, 1745-1821), who at the age of thirty-nine was  named principal holder of the Essential Heart of the Great Expanse lineage by  Jigme Lingpa himself, from whom he received the Great Expanse teachings in  their entirety. Thus, he is referred to as the first Dodrupchen Rinpoche; Rinpoche  is a title of honor that literally means "Precious One," and is used mainly in  referring to recognized reincarnations and sometimes to persons regarded as very  highly accomplished in this life. Subsequently, the first Dodrupchen Rinpoche  founded Drodon Lundrup Monastery in the Do Valley and Pemako Tsasum Khad riling Monastery in the Yarlung Valley. His successor, the second Dodrupchen  Rinpoche, known as Jigme Phuntshog Jungnay, established Dodrupchen Mon astery on the Tsangchen plain of the Do Valley.  

This monastic college occupies a key place in the intellectual and intersectarian  history of Tibetan Buddhism. By the time of the third Dodrupchen (rDo Grub  chen Jigs-med-bstan-pa'i-nyi-ma), author of the text translated here, this mon astery's curriculum incorporated Gelugpa authors of philosophical texts, in par ticular Jamyang Shayba, as preparation for its study and practice of the Great  Completeness. As discussed by Tulku Thondup in Masters of Meditation and Mys tery, this intersectarian tradition was continued in the nineteenth century by Shab-

TOPIC S O F THE GREA T COMPLETENES S 559  

gar Tshogdrug Rangdrol (1781-1850), a teacher of Alag Dongag Gyatso. Alag  had also studied with the great Patrul Rinpoche (1808-1887), author of the  recently translated Words of My Perfect Teacher, a richly storied discussion of the  foundational practices of Dzogchen. Alag and his own student, our author, the  third Dodrupchen, were both teachers of the four great abbots of Dodrupchen  Monastery. Dodrupchen himself studied with three of the most famous Nyingma  masters of the past century; in addition to Patrul Rinpoche, the prolific and bril liant philosopher Ju Mipham (1846-1912) and Mipham's extraordinary student,  Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820-1892), were his teachers.  

In all these ways, the narrative of Dodrupchen intertwines with the illustrious  history of Nyingma masters in eastern Tibet. Especially in the context of an eso teric and often philosophically abstract tradition like Dzogchen, it is important to  remember that its most venerated examplars, like Tibetan practitioners in general,  were deeply embedded in a familial and social context that grounded their en deavors.  

The father of the third Dodrupchen was prophesied by Guru Rinpoche to be  Dudjom Lingpa, the first Dudjom Rinpoche (1835-1903). In this way, his family  position combined with his reincarnation lineage to allow him to be intimately  connected with both the Great Expanse and the Dudjom traditions, this latter  being another important Dzogchen lineage within Nyingma. The connection be 

tween these lineages is replicated in the person of Khetsun Sangpo Rinpoche,  whose oral commentary expands on the text translated here. Khetsun Rinpoche  teaches the Essential Heart tradition and constructed the Dudjom Temple in  Baudha, outside Kathmandu, now the site of a sacred reliquiry containing remains  of the second Dudjom Rinpoche, who died in 1987.  

The third Dodrupchen incarnation, known as Jigme Denba Nyima ('Jigs-med bstan-pa'i nyi-ma, 1865-1926), was especially renowned for his ability to make  connections between the Tantric systems of Nyingma and the later schools of  Tibetan Buddhism. In Tibet it was common for even great scholars to restrict their  focus to works of their own orders, but Dodrupchen studied the writing of all  four Buddhist orders; the present Dalai Lama has called him the best scholar of  the commentarial literature in any of the Tibetan orders. The oral interpretative  tradition that began with Jigme Lingpa is still alive today. The fourth Dodrupchen,  Thubten Thrinley Palzang, is based in Gantok, Sikkhim, and visits the United  States every two years to teach at his center in western Massachusetts; the great  Dilgo Khentze Rinpoche was among the most prominent modern bearers of this  tradition.  

Other important recent and contemporary teachers in this tradition include  Lama Gompo Tsayden (d. 1991) (himself a student of Dilgo Khentse Rinpoche)  whose students, especially a number of nun retreatants, still practice at his mon astery in Amdo; Tulku Thondup, considered a reincarnation of Konchog Dronme  (one of the four great abbots of Dodrupchen Monastery), currently a close asso ciate of the fourth Dodrupchen, and author/translator of the most authoritative  English works on this tradition; and Khetsun Sangpo Rinpoche of Baudha, author 

560 ANNE CAROLY N KLEIN  

of a thirteen-volume work on Tibetan history who has taught widely in Japan,  France, and the United States, and has established a monastic training institute  outside Kathmandu, where he supports and trains Nyingma monks. Trulzhig  Rinpoche was invited by the Dalai Lama to represent the Nyingma school at the  historic Year of Tibet program held in New York's Madison Square Garden in  1991. He is currently abbot of Thupten Choling in Solo Kumbu, Nepal, the largest  monastery and nunnery in Nepal. Khetsun Sangpo Rinpoche and Trulzhig Rin poche are the only senior lineage holders of certain Soaring Path practices which  originated with a former incarnation of Trulzhig Rinpoche known as Dongag  Trulzhig Lingpa.  

Another senior yogin whose repertoire importantly includes the Heart Essence  tradition is Chatrul Rinpoche, now eighty-six and famous for, among many other  accomplishments, having spent six years prostrating his way from eastern to cen tral Tibet. He resides and teaches above the Kathmandu Valley, an area sacred to  Nyingma since Padamsambhava meditated in its caves in the seventh century. His  student Lama Tharchin Rinpoche founded a practice and study center near Santa  Cruz, California. Lama Tharchin is tenth in a lineage begun by Palchen Namkha  Jigme, who studied with the first Dodrupchen; he also teaches and maintains  practices from the Dudjom lineage. Nyo Shul Khen Rinpoche is another contem porary figure whose main tradition is the Essential Heart; he belongs to a branch  of the Kathog Monastery in East Tibet. Founded in 1109 by Kathogpa Tampa  Desheg, this is the oldest of the four principal Nyingma monasteries of Kham; its  main lineages are those associated with two great Treasure discoverers of the  seventeenth century, Dudul Dorje and Longsel Nyingpo. Active in Tibet today  are Khenbo Jigme Phuntsok Adzom Choktul Paylo Rinpoche, considered an in carnation of Jigme Lingpa as well as the son of the famous Adzom Drukpa (early  twentieth century), who received visionary transmission of the Heart Essence from  Jigme Lingpa. Essential Heart is also the lineage of Sogyal Rinpoche, founder of  Rig pa Fellowship. In the West, groups centered on this lineage include the  Dzogchen Foundation in Boston and Dawn Mountain in Houston; Tara Mandala  near Pagosa Springs, Colorado, often hosts teachers from this tradition as well.  The worldwide Dzogchen Community based in Conway, Massachusetts, founded  by Chogyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, also incorporates practices from this line age into its diverse liturgies  

Introduction to the Text  

In the Tibetan context, religious texts are not treated, like much of Western lit erature today, as independent emissaries, carrying their information to anyone  who takes them home and makes of them what she or he will. Rather, one is  introduced to a text - such as the one translated here - by a lama trained in its  traditions, whose oral commentary embroiders on the written words and whose  person is understood to embody the text's essential meaning of compassion and 

TOPIC S O F THE GREA T COMPLETENES S 561  

wisdom. On the advice of the Dalai Lama, I studied the present text in 1980, and  was fortunate to do so in conjunction with the oral instruction of Khetsun Sangpo  Rinpoche.  

Assorted Topics of the Great Completeness (rDzogs chen thor bu) is one of Dod rupchen's shorter works. It contains three essays, the first of which is translated  here. In it, as the author himself states, he has "amply applied" what surfaced in  his mind without the apparatus of sutra quotations. In this way he crystallizes  basic principles of Great Completeness. Most important among these is that this  tradition, like Chan or Zen, understands the complete path to be already present  in one's own mind. The actual nature of the mind is regarded as the womb  igarbha) of one's own buddhahood, for a buddha is by definition one who has  gone (gatha) through and to that very nature. Such enlightened beings are there fore known as "Ones [who have] Gone Thus" (tathagathas), and one's own nature  is known as the tathagathagarbha. It is to be uncovered through meditating in  accordance with a text like this one.  

The Great Completeness is a path of discovery, not the cultivation of newly  emerging qualities. It is a path that allows full openess to the mind-nature, or  base. It also involves becoming free from all the tendencies, or predispositions,  that are said to stain the mind-basis of all unenlightened beings. These predis 

positions are the residue of past mental, verbal, or physical actions. Above all,  then, one seeks to discover one's own open awareness (rig pa). In this way, one  becomes aware of the base, one's actual nature, which is described as a union of  primordial purity, sometimes described as similar to the emptiness taught in Mid 

dle Way (Madhyamika) philosophy, with the spontaneous occurence of whatever  qualities display themselves within the base. To discover this is to allow the nat ural, but usually thwarted, process of self-settling to unfold, in the same way that  the waves of a lake, which, if unstirred by winds or engines, will naturally subside.  

This point is clear from the opening verses of the text. In accordance with time honored Buddhist custom, Dodrupchen begins with a verse of refuge in Manjusri  (also known as Manjughosa) usually described as the embodiment of all buddhas'  wisdom. The author then immediately reframes this as a refuge not in an external  figure but in one's own open awareness. The full manifestation of this open aware ness, together with all its spontaneous good qualities, is tantamount to enlight enment. Because primordial wisdom (ye shes in Tibetan, jnana in Sanskrit) is a  full and natural settling into one's own deepest being, this open awareness is the  source of enlightenment. Through practice, this naturally open awareness (rig pa  in Tibetan, vedana in Sanskrit) can be distinguished experientially from the or dinary contrived and conceptual mind. Dodrupchen therefore points out that  recognizing rig pa is the true meaning of refuge in Manjughosa.  

Like other Buddhist schools, Dzogchen often presents its teachings under the  three main headings of the base, path, and fruit. Our text focuses on the special  meaning of these terms in this tradition. Dodrupchen explains each in terms of  three adjectives associated with the name Manjughosa ('Jam-dpal-ye-shes-sems 

pa in Tibetan, Manjughosa or Manjusrl-kumara-bhuta in Sanskrit): smooth 

562 ANNE CAROLYN KLEIN  

(manju), splendid (ghosa), and fresh or youthful (gzhon nu in Tibetan, kumara in  Sanskrit). Like other Mahayana schools, Dzogchen recognizes that each buddha  has three dimensions or bodies (kayas). The emanation body, such as that dis played by Sakyamuni, the historical Buddha, is what ordinary persons like our selves can see. Resplendent Dimension (sambhogakdya) buddhas manifest their  own pure lands, and there teach bodhisattvas who are highly developed enough  to see and hear them. Like the buddhas' own bodies, these lands and all they  contain are made entirely of light, and are conjoined with the buddha's own mind nature, the formless Actual Dimension (dharmakaya) buddha from which the  

other two emanate. All buddhas exist in all three dimensions.  The nature of the mind, also called the base, is the same whether one is en lightened or not: its natural freedom from conceptual dualistic appearance is its  smoothness; its external luminous manifestations are its splendor; and its unifi cation of primordial and spontaneous qualities are its freshness. To be fully pres ent to this basic nature is to recognize the great completeness of one's own being.  Such presence is always direct and experiential, never discursive or intellectual.  There are two methods for discovering and fully manifesting open awareness.  The first is known as the primordially pure Setting Free path, meaning that the  mind frees itself from its bonds of dualistic focusing on objects. This, according  to Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, is like cutting the rope around a stack of kindling - in one sense nothing changes, but the wood is no longer bound. This ease of  being is the path's smoothness. The path's splendor has to do with the second of  the Great Completeness practices, known as the Soaring path because, within the  primordial purity that characterizes the Setting Free path, a variety of appearances  spontaneously emerge, multicolored and moving. These are the light and splendor  intrinsic to one's own being. They are most elaborately described in the more  esoteric Dzogchen teachings of the Soaring path, and in descriptions of the various  light visions, especially of peaceful and wrathful deities, which occur in the in termediate state (bardo) between death in one life and birth in another. The Tibetan  Book of the Dead is the most famous exposition of these experiences in the West.  (In Tibet, it is only one, relatively obscure, volume in a vast literature devoted to  this topic). Indeed, the iconography of vision and a detailed concern with near death, bardo, and rebirth experiences, is a special feature of the Dzogchen school,  which was probably the first to introduce them in Tibet.  

Dzogchen teaches that because these Soaring Path appearances are fundamen tally the same in nature as ordinary sensory appearances, it is possible for a fully  accomplished yogin to transform the physical body into a body of light, known  as a rainbow body. The accomplishment of such a rainbow body is considered a  unique effect of the Dzogchen path. The path's freshness refers to the vitality of  meditative experiences that emerge through Setting Free and Soaring. The fruit  or effect of the path is an open awareness in the continuum of one who has  smoothed away the obstructions to enlightenment: that open awareness is splen did because it is now embodied in the form of enlightened beings, and it is fresh  because it has a continuous clarity that never grows dull.  

Our text combines language unique to the Great Completeness tradition with 

TOPIC S O F TH E GREA T COMPLETENES S 563  

occasional references to classic Middle Way philosophy. It is addressed primarily  to the yogin, rather than to the philosopher. It briefly indexes the types of med itative experience associated with the paths of Setting Free and Soaring. In ad dition to its descriptions of one's nature as smooth, splendid, and fresh, all of the  important terms of this text - open awareness mind nature (sems nyid), the natural  condition ignas lugs), appearance of light Cod), dynamic display (rtsal) - refer to  specific meditative experiences that have been known and described by practi tioners for centuries. It is obvious, yet worth reiterating, that these experiences  cannot be had by reading about them. Indeed, for most of us these special  Dzogchen words have no actual referent, or at best only an imaginary one. For  persons who have experientially identified their mind nature, the section describ ing the smoothness of the fruit is read as a set of explicit instructions for medi tation.  

These later sections of the text also touch on the physiology fundamental both  to Tibetan esoteric practices and Tibetan medicine - descriptions of channels  within the body that are associated with the process of meditation. How exactly  does one gain open awareness, and what is its relationship to the ordinary mind?  Our text does not tell us; it assumes that this knowledge will have been received  already through other means, both oral and meditative. Thus, in a traditional  Tibetan context, none but initiated meditation practitioners would read a text  such as this. Nor would they read it on their own, left to construe it as they might.  Rather, they would study it with a teacher accomplished in both scholarship and  meditation, who would provide oral commentary, like the one included interli nearally here. And they would meditate. For such practitioners, the text helps  clarify the relationship and significance of their own meditative experiences. In  the altogether different academic context in which this text is now presented - through the generosity of several teachers of this tradition, especially Khetsun  Sangpo Rinpoche - it serves the entirely different function of providing a glimpse  into the vocabulary and structure of an ancient esoteric tradition that will be  taking its place among the vital living traditions of the twenty-first century.  

The text translated here can be found in The Collected Works of rDo Grub chen  'Jigs-med-bstan-pa'i-nyi-ma, 5 vols. (Gantok: Dodrupchen Rinpoche, 1975), vol.  5, pp. 179-87. In order to give some flavor of the interplay between written  and oral traditions, small segments of Khetsun Sangpo Rinpoche's commentary  on this work are included interlinearly. I have also included some remarks from  Lama Tharchin, who in 1984 kindly entertained numerous questions arising  from my work on this text, as well as insights provided by Tulku Thondup, author  of numerous works on this lineage; and the Dzogchen master Namkhai Norbu  Rinpoche.

Assorted Topics of the Great Completeness  

Salutation  

Acknowledging open awareness, I give homage to the primordially pure, stain less, and authentic (nyug ma) Manjughosa who is endowed with the splendor  of excellent, spontaneous appearance.  

People like ourselves offer homage within a conventional perspective, bowing  down in a conventional sense with body, speech, and mind. The author's homage 

TOPICS OF THE GREAT COMPLETENESS 565  

is enacted within a recognition of the indivisibility of base and the fruit. These  are actually one taste, indivisible. Thus, although the author here makes homage  to Manjughosa, if he were thinking of a conventional Manjughosa, this would not  be an homage concordant with the ultimate or actual view; it would be an homage  made within a conventional perspective.  

Promise to Compose  

I will discuss the meaning of the name, Manju-sn-ghosa-jnana-manas-vira, "he roic glorious mind, the smooth and splendid primordial wisdom."  

Main Text  

Non-dualistic primordial wisdom, the enlightened mind of all Conquerors  [buddhas] without exception, is known as heroic mind, a primordially fresh  wisdom that is smooth and splendid. Because the buddhas' primordial wisdom  

is none other than the primordially free, spontaneously occurring, open aware ness, taking it as the path from now on is the way of the natural Great Com pleteness.  

This path does not function as a cause (of wisdom) in the sense of virtuous action  leading to a positive effect, as in the theory of karma. In the Great Completeness,  to take the effect (wisdom) as the path means to recognize that the natural con dition of one's mind is obscured only by the adventitious obstructions that prevent  liberation (nyon sgrib) and omniscience (shes sgrib). These obstructions, consisting  of everything from gross nonvirtue to the most subtle tendency to perceive objects  as real, are in no way intrinsic to the mind. Like the sky, which is without any  obstructions whatever, the mind's actual nature is utterly clear. Because adven titious obstructions obscure our actual nature, practitioners seek to abandon them  and accumulate the collections of merit and wisdom. However, from the view point of its own way of being, the actual nature is beyond conventions of "some thing to be abandoned or achieved" and "someone who abandons or achieves."  The topics to be understood regarding this state are the base, path, and fruit.  

A. EXPLAINING THE MEANING OF THE BASE AND ITS DESCRIPTION AS SMOOTH,  SPLENDID, AND FRESH  

SMOOTH  

Smoothness is the primordially pure essence (ngo bo), the actuality (chos nyid)  of all phenomena. It is beginninglessly free from the eight elaborated extremes  [described in detail in Madhyamika] of production, cessation, permanence,  annihilation, coming, going, being one, or being many because [the base and  its primordial purity] impartially pervade, without any bias, all phenomena,  from forms through to omniscient consciousnesses. There is no phenomenon,  not even the merest atom, which is otherwise. 

566 ANN E CAROLY N KLEIN  

The base is the same for unenlightened sentient beings and for buddhas. The  "time of the base" (zhi dus) occurs when one is neither in cyclic existence nor  nirvana; neither a buddha nor a sentient being. When primodial wisdom arises  from this base, one is a buddha; when ignorance arises, a sentient being. (Lama  Tharchin)  

The difference between being enlightened or not lies with whether or not one  realizes the natural state which is the actuality of one's base. However, even when  we are born into cyclic existence, born into the mud of desire, hatred, and ig norance, the actuality of our own minds, like the lotus flower, is not covered by  the defilement of mud. The mind's natural state is utterly without contrivance,  and self-settled. It is [the ordinary consciousness] relaxed into its own nature.  The emptiness that is the actuality of one's own mind (rang gi sems gyi chos nyid  stong ba nyid) is the nature of all buddhas. It is not newly established but has  existed all along, for it is the completely present base which is the tathagatagarbha  element in all living beings.  

Since [the essence] has neither production nor true establishment, how would  even lack of production be imputed in relation to it? In the view [of the Great  Completeness], this essence is beyond conventions of understanding, expres sion, and use.  

All worldly beings live within the conventions of knowing, expressing, and un derstanding. To say "the name of this is water" allows you to understand some thing as water; it is a correct convention. However conventions cannot express  the ultimate, actual state.  

This base is free from the various predispositions on the basis of all (kun gzhi  in Tibetan, alayvijnana in Sanskrit), and from all that remains of those predis positions [that is, the body]. It is also free from the minds and mental evolutes  

(sems las byung ba) of the three realms, as well as from ignorance.  Even though errors arise as its dynamic display, [open awareness] is not  covered by the stains of error, just as even when clouds arise in the sky, the  sky is not covered by them. Because the internal sky (dbyings in Tibetan, dhatu  in Sanskrit), having no foundation and no root, is free from the roughness of  any sign [of conceptuality, therefore the base that is united with one's own  aware presence] is called smooth.  

SPLENDID  

What is splendid? Your own spontaneous nature [is splendid]. The ocean of  divine figures and the primordially fresh consciousness is neither sought else where nor newly established, but is complete where it rests. Thus, even though,  in terms of how [phenomena] appear [apparent] impurities do arise; in terms  of how it is (gnas tshul), [open awareness] is established as a great primordial  wisdom. [Therefore, the way the mind appears and its genuine state are dif-TOPICS OF THE GREAT COMPLETENESS 567  

ferent.] The mind's essence neither improves when errors are purified nor  worsens when adventitious obstructions occur due to error.  In terms of its appearance, because [open awareness] dawns as outgoing  energy (thugs rje), compassion (snying rje) emerges for all living beings. Be cause [open awareness] dawns as light, there shine rays having the nature of  the five primordial wisdoms. Because [open awareness] dawns as primordially  fresh consciousness, it dwells in an innate open awareness purified of mental  stains. Because [open awareness] dawns as the figures of deities, space brims  with deities of purest (dangs ma) clear light.  

To say that open awareness "appears as light" refers to a meditative experience  (mnyam) of light shining forth. This light is actually the radiance of the five pri mordial wisdoms that shine through the empty actuality of one's own mind. They  are the glow of primordial wisdom.  

Because open awareness dawns nondualistically, there is no holding onto same ness or difference. Because open awareness is free from extreme positions, the  primordial wisdom which is the complete base appears in its own clarity. Be cause it dawns as primordially pure wisdom, the appearance of nirvana is un ceasing; because it dawns as impure cyclic existence, the six realms of rebirth  appear like illusions.  

The precious interiority - that is, the spontaneously occurring base - serves  as a base for appearances through the eight doors. Because this becomes the  base for the good qualities of liberation, it is known as "splendid."  

FRESH  

Internal karmic winds act as the root of the contaminated mind. Due to their  movement, you are trapped in cyclic existence as if inside a vase. Yet, contam ination does not enter one's actual nature (chos nyid in Tibetan, dharmata in  Sanskrit). Your actual nature has a freshness that is a deathless permanence, a  stability without illness, freedom from aging and deterioration; a freshness that  is utterly beyond momentary change. Because [the natural condition of mind  is] an amalgamation of all unsurpassed good qualities, it has the meaning of  heap or kaya, this is what it means to call [a buddha manifestation] a body.  The word "fresh" in the [Dzogchen] phrase, "fresh and vaselike body" signifies  the union of primordial purity and spontaneous occurrence.  

It is called a "vase" in the sense of containing everything, with nothing lacking.  (Chogyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche)  

B. AN INDICATION OF PATHS AS SMOOTH, SPLENDID, AND FRESH  

SMOOTH  

The first of these, smoothness, has to do with the principle of the path of Setting  Free (khregs chod). One gains certainty in the view that the mind of enlight-

568 ANN E CAROLY N KLEIN  

enment itself - the open awareness in which there is no occurrence whatever  of anything that goes under the rubric of either the afflicted or the purified - is a great expanse free from extremes. For one who relies on the essential  precepts on meditation and behavior, all appearances (such as sights, sounds,  and other knowable things) emerge as aids [to one's practice, rather than as  distractions from it].  

Once you have experienced your own open awareness, you seek to maintain  unwaveringly the continuum of mindfulness and awareness of the natural state  of your own mind, regardless of what types of conceptual thoughts arise. All  these thoughts, like wood taken for fire, only help your awareness: they do not  do it any harm.  

When one relaxes freely in the great primordial spacious expanse of an au thentic self-settling, [one is] unimpeded and without activity. Like a thief en tering an empty house [which he neither harms nor helps], there is neither  the establishment of good thoughts nor the elimination of bad ones; these are  the dynamic display [of open awareness].  

Therefore, like whirling a lance in empty space, [such thoughts] neither help  nor harm [open awareness], nor does one have any grasping inclination either  to be free of appearing objects or to engage with them or anything whatsoever  that appears at the [sense] doors. Like a lion at whom a stone is thrown, one  investigates the source [of conceptuality] itself. In this way, all thought accu 

mulations are primordially liberated and smoothly vanish into the expanse of  equality, so that appearances to the six collections [of consciousnesses, con sisting of the five senses and the mind] become aids to the primordial wisdom.  

If one throws a stone at a lion, he goes after the person who threw it, unlike a  dog, who ignores the threatening person and just chases after the stone. In a  similar fashion, if when thoughts arise one thinks "This is an excellent thought"  or "This is a terrible thought" one is like the dog who observes where the stone  has fallen. Correct meditation will not come at all. Like the lion, we should attend  to the source, where the thoughts came from.  

At that time, do not bind with [a beginner's] stringent mindfulness the pure  meditative experiences which are the sapience of Samantabhadra, and do not  provide causal conditions for ordinary error. Without placing yourself in chains  of stubborn bondage, and without entering through the narrow aperture of a  meditation focused on objects, maintain a continuity of great ease, looseness,  self-settling, relaxation, and liberation. Because [the path-aware open aware 

ness which maintains the mind-and-body continuum in this way] is free from  the rough touch of a conception which adheres [to objects], it is called smooth.  

When the eyes focus, you have valid cognition in the sense that the object you  observe is valid. However, although such seeing is valid in terms of the world,  when it comes to the view of Dzogchen, it is like a harmful poison. Whenever 

TOPIC S O F TH E GREA T COMPLETENES S 569  

valid cognition focuses on an object, some conception of a self still remains. Even  this valid cognizer is a grasping; therefore, it is necessary to eliminate completely  all valid cognizers that focus on objects.  

Conceptual thoughts are always arising. We cannot be free of them. You need  to distinguish between the [ordinary] way of thinking and the instructions on  mindfulness of the natural state.  

SPLENDID  

The meaning of "splendid" has to do with Soaring. When one takes up any of  the postures - that of the lion, elephant, or sage - the very clear channels of  light that are the [1] watery luminosity of expansiveness [that is, the eyes] are  directed upward, downward, or straight ahead. Thereby the [2] pure-space luminosity initially appears as a pervasive deep blue light. Then, from this,  within a circle of five colored lights are arrayed the five groups of [3] empty  orbs of luminosity. In between these are the [4] self-arisen-wisdom luminosi 

ties [a series of shapes appearing as] a vajra (diamond-like) chain, laid out like  a string of pearls, or as a golden chain. These are the radiance of the innately  clear, spontaneously perfected open awareness which is the primordial wisdom  of open awareness in its own place.  

These last three [namely, the pure-space-luminosity, the empty-drop lumi nosity, and the self-arisen wisdom luminosities that appear as the vajra chain]  will become, respectively, causes for the pure land, palatial residence, and body  of [yourself as] a buddha. In addition to these four luminosities there is the  [5] heat-flesh luminosity and [6] the luminosity of the soft white channel, also  called a "crystal piping." When one adds these two, which have clear hollow  insides, there come to be six luminosities.  

In addition to these six, there are three [additional luminosities], adding up  to nine. These are: [7] the precious primordial wisdom that is a union of  emptiness and clarity - this is renowned as the basic luminosity, the natural  condition; [8] the intermediate state (bardo) luminosity, whose internal radi 

ance, shining externally, is an appearance of the base during the intermediate  state; and [9] the effect luminosity, which is the hollow interiority of the spon taneously occuring completion. However, the luminosities occasioned on the  path are those explained above [as the nine luminosities].  

In this way, through the hidden and manifest doors, and through the treasure  comprised of the secret qualities of the Ones Gone Thus, you manifestly see  the appearance of the body and land of a Conqueror, and hear the intrinsic  sound of your actual nature. Therefore, [the open awareness that is the path]  is called "splendid."  

FRESH  

"Freshness" is a meditative experience of union. The current open awareness  is not illustrated by ordinary examples. Beyond verbal exprssion, it is free from 

570 ANN E CAROLY N KLEIN  

the bondage of hope and fear, a union of open awareness and emptiness that  dwells [in a manner] free from [the ordinary] mind.  

The initial seeing of the vajra chain-continuum, which is the radiance of  open awareness, is the actual nature [of open awareness] become manifest [and  is the first of the four levels of the spontaneous Soaring path (thod rgal)]. When  the appearances, which are light, become clearer, and appearances of orbs of  light increase further, the vajra chain-continuum becomes steady. When, at  the end [of this level], one sees the unaccompanied [Buddha] bodies, one has  arrived at the second level of the spontaneous Soaring path known as the  "increase of experience."  

When there is only one figure appearing, this is like half of the increase of clear  appearance. It is not the end. This has to do with the degree to which the mind  is accustomed to this practice.  

From the time when the bodies become joined in union until all appearances  are perceived as clear light is the third level of the Soaring path called the "full  measure of open awareness." [At that time] the external, the internal, as well  as the secret (respectively, the material body, the mind's mass of thoughts, and  the manner of appearance of the bodies and luminous orbs) are extinguished  into the actual nature. This is an extinguishing into what is beyond mind [and  the fourth level of the Soaring path known as] the extinguishing into the actual  nature.  

At this time, one's own material body becomes almost like a rainbow. Sun light passes through it, leaving no shadow. Thoughts and predispositions for  thoughts are extinguished, as are the appearances of deities' form, the drops,  and primordial wisdom, and so forth. This is the extinguishing that is beyond  mind.  

If one who has gained power over birth [and death] wishes to effect the  welfare of all beings through arising in the body of the Great Transformation  ('pho chen), then at the time of gradually extinguishing appearances, one arises  in a rainbow form. One does this by focusing open awareness on the five fingers  of one's hand, which appear as light.  

Nyingmas consider the body of Great Transformation to be the superior of three  types of rainbow bodies; it is this that Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra are said  to have attained. This rainbow form (ja' sku) is not to be confused with 'ja' lus,  usually translated as "rainbow body." Those with rainbow bodies are said to  disappear into another dimension, whereas the practitioner of the Great Trans 

formation creates a unique body of light that can appear to others for their benefit,  and even if, due to lack of suitable disciples, it does not manifestly appear for  some time, it does not entirely disappear. (Tulku Thondup)  

If one's body does not effect great waves [of activities] for others' benefit  through gaining power with respect to engagement, one at that point disap-

TOPIC S O F TH E GREA T COMPLETENES S 571  

pears into the spacious expanse of the original sphere, just like mist evaporat ing. This is extinguishment into the natural state, the aware presence ready to  unite with the final fruit. Because stainless and extraordinary meditative ex periences open up at those times like a fresh young flower, open awareness,  the path which is a union of primordial purity and spontaneous occurence is  called "fresh," like a youthful person of great zest.  

C. HOW THE FRUITS [OF THE PATH] ARE SMOOTH, SPLENDID, AND FRESH  

SMOOTH  

What is its smoothness? Abandonment of (1) desire and so forth that obstruct  liberation and (2) adherence to uncontaminated phenomena and so forth that  obstruct omniscience, together with the very subtle karmic inner winds [as sociated with them]. Smoothness is [also] the progressive pacification of all  characteristics of [a grasping] mind, the clearing away of all adherence to du alistic conceptions right where they are.  

Because one is free of that which obstructs the actual nature of the natural  nirvana [through which one attains buddhahood], the nirvana purified of ad ventitious [obstructions] becomes manifest. The four demons are overcome.  These are: (1) the demon that is the contaminated aggregates, (2) the demon  that is the lord of death, cutting off one's lifetime; (3) the demon of the afflic tions, that prevents liberation, and (4) the god-child demon that is the inter ferences [preventing] attainment of enlightenment. One is freed from all elab orations of existence, nonexistence, "is," "is not," and so forth, and is immersed  in the total attainment of the great spacious sphere of neither production nor  cessation. Being free from the rough feel of obstructions [to liberation and  omniscience], the resulting open awareness is smooth.  

SPLENDID  

What is splendid? [A Buddha's omniscience that] simultaneously knows how  and what things are and that manifests the twenty-one types of primordial  wisdom knowing the stainless. In the Magnificently Ornamented Highest Pure  Land [oneself, as a buddha] appears in great resplendence (sambhoga), pos 

sessed of the seven qualities of being (1) greatly enjoyable, (2) a conjoining  [of method and wisdom], (3) great bliss, (4) without inherent existence, (5)  fully compassionate, (6) an uninterrupted continuum, and (7) ceaseless.  

In the Pure Land of Natural Emanations, the appearances of the teacher - the Form Conqueror, Feeling Conqueror, Compositional Factor Conqueror,  Discrimination Conqueror, and Consciousness Conqueror - appear in their  own way. Thereby, by acting for the sake of pure disciples who appear in other  retinues, a Resplendent Buddha which is half an Emanation Buddha [appears];  and, for the sake of impure disciples, there are emanations such as art [trees,  statues, images], rebirth and so forth, effecting the welfare of living beings. 

572 ANN E CAROLY N KLEIN  

The five Conquerors refer to the purification in their own place of the five ordinary  aggregates - form, feeling, and so forth. The effect of this purification is that they  now appear as buddhas. The last, the Consciousness Conqueror, refers to the  purification of all thoughts, in their own place.  

This Resplendent dimension is a great spontaneous activity; it is neither spo radic, biased, nor bound by effortful thought. Finding this very profound and  extensive body is an unsurpassed treasure of good qualities, and for this reason  [the aware presence which is the effect] is called splendid.  

FRESH  

The meaning of [the fruit's] freshness is this. The dissolution of all appearances  of dynamic display into the spacious expanse free of extremes and center - into the actual nature - is the very secret, precious, spontaneously perfected  interiority. It is also the great unchanging, unceasing, indestructible subtle  wisdom. Moreover, one's great omniscience is completed as a clarity undar 

kened by the obscurations of sleep, fainting, lack of discriminatory capacity,  or the two absorptions. One has abandoned even the most subtle production  [of thoughts] in the manner of ordinary mentality as well as inconceivably  subtle movements [of the winds]. Therefore, [the open awareness which is  your own omniscient mind] is permanent and pure, possessing an unchange 

ability as extensive as space.  

Consider this somewhat extreme example: if you meet a person who does  not age, it is suitable to say that such a person remains perpetually youthful.  The completed fresh and vaselike body is said to be like that.  

Through these [explanations], I have indicated the Great Completeness  which is smooth and splendid.  

The Great Completeness, open awareness and emptiness,  

Free from mind, smooth and splendid,  

Unspeakable, inconceivable, inexpressible,  

Is the actual profound and natural condition.  

In consonance with Words provided by my omnipresent Lama  I have made a very brief clarification  

By which virtue may those with minds, extensive as space,  Become Conquerors over all bonds of mental analysis  

And see, in the manner of sightless vision,  

Manjusri, in whose aware presence  

Cyclic existence and nirvana are not separate.  

Due to the injunctions that came my way from the mouth of the precious  omnipresent Lama to do this I, Jigme, leaving aside elaborations such as the  use of scriptural quotations, amply applied whatever I remembered. 

### 33 On the Seal of Sambhu: A Poem  

by Abhinavagupta  

Paul E. Muller-Ortega  

The "Anubhava-nivedana-stotra" or the "Song of Praise Intended to Communicate  the Direct Experience of the Absolute" is a poetic composition in Sanskrit attrib uted to the eleventh-century Kashmiri Tantric master, Abhinavagupta. It is one  of but a handful of short poetic works or hymns of praise (stotras) attributed to  this important Tantric philosopher and theologian. Probably written toward the  end of his life as a kind of elegant summary of the author's vision of Saiva mys ticism, the poem is an evocation of the experience of the ultimate consciousness  

known as Siva, the achievement of the highest goal of Saiva Yoga.  In the religious and spiritual literature of Hinduism, stotra is a well-known  compositional category that is quite varied in its form. It generally denotes a  eulogistic hymn of praise directed at a particular object that the author wishes to  praise. Any number of stotras of varying length, meter, and style were composed  in praise of deities, religious teachers and reformers, and many diverse holy ob jects of veneration.  

The "Anubhava-nivedana-stotra" is unusual in that it was written not so much  in praise of a deity as in praise of this Tantric author's own state of achieved  mystical illumination. It might be said that the poem forms a conceptual window  through which the author, a great master of medieval Tantric Saivism, allows the  reader to peer into this state of mystical illumination. Although a complex phil 

osophical theology lies in the background of all that the author says, nevertheless  the poem evokes a simplicity beyond all of the philosophical and ritual complexity  that encompass it: the Tantric master's direct adoration of the unity of the absolute  consciousness called Siva.  

Abhinavagupta accomplishes this, in part, by centering his poem on the so called sambhavl mudra, here rendered as the "seal of Sambhu": a sophisticated  formulation of the highest stance of the Saivite yogin's achievement of mystical  illumination (verse 1). Sambhu ("producing happiness") is a name for Siva, also 

574 PAUL E. MULLER-ORTEGA  

known as Mahadeva, the great god of medieval Tantric Saivism. Although a per sonal theistic reference is not excluded, in this case Siva primarily denotes the  state of ultimate consciousness that lies beyond all limitation: the transcendent,  ultimate consciousness. Through a consideration of this central idea, the poem  unfolds to give expression to the brand of nonduality (advaya) that is fundamental  to the Saivite sadhaka or mystic's understanding of reality.  

The Author of the Poem  

Born sometime between 950 and 975 C.E to a rich and noble brahman family in  the city of Srinagar, Abhinavagupta grew up and matured in an atmosphere su percharged with religious devotion and dedication to learning. Abhinavagupta's  father, Narasirhhagupta, claimed descent from one Atrigupta, who had been  brought to Kashmir by King Lalitaditya (725-76f C.E.). Abhinavagupta's mother,  Vimala, died when Abhinavagupta was still young, and there is no doubt that her  death affected him greatly.  

The family were devout followers of Siva, and Abhinavagupta began his early  studies of Saivism with his learned father but quickly began visiting teachers in  Kashmir and elsewhere. While he was studying literature and poetry, he was  spontaneously overcome with an intoxicating devotion to Siva. In his own sub 

sequent self-understanding, this event would be seen as the initial impulse of  Siva's Saktipata or the descent of divine grace. Following this event, he seems to  have studied very widely in all of the fields of philosophical, religious, and literary  knowledge that were available to him. His love of learning and his spiritual search  led him to travel to Jalandhara, where he encountered the Tantric master Sam 

bhunatha, who initiated him into the practices of the left-handed Kaula tradition.  This early period of study and spiritual practice lead to a mature life dedicated  to the absorption of knowledge in an atmosphere of extreme religious fervor.  Abhinavagupta never married and spent his life living in the homes of his many  teachers. At the height of his fame, he was revered as a charismatic Tantric master  

whose authority as a guru or teacher was enhanced by the fact that he was con sidered to be a Mahasiddha, that is to say, a highly perfected and accomplished  mystic. A prolific writer, he was the author of twenty-one still extant works (and  there are references to titles of twenty-three others now apparently lost). We have  no definitive information about Abhinavagupta's death. Local Kashmiri legend  has it that the great master walked into a cave with 1,200 of his disciples and  simply disappeared.  

The intellectual context of Abhinavagupta's writings is very broad, in part due  to his relatively late date in relation to the earlier traditions of Indian philosophy  and religion. In addition to the revealed literature of the Agamas and Tantras, and  the texts produced by his predecessors in the Saivism of Kashmir, Abhinava 

gupta's work resonates with practically all that precedes him in Indian thought,  including the traditional Brahmanical or Vedic literature, the debates of the vari-

SEAL OF SAMBH U 575  

ous philosophical traditions, the mysticism of the yogins, the various devotional  (bhakti) traditions, as well as the varieties of Buddhist and Jaina philosophical  discourse.  

As a result, Abhinavagupta is considered to be one of the most sophisticated  and definitive theoreticians of medieval Hindu Tantra. His work as an authori tative interpreter of the revealed scriptures of Saivism was deeply intertwined with  his life as a devotee of Siva. His Tantric synthesis - termed the Trika-Kaula be cause of its skillful melding of doctrinal and ritual elements drawn from these  two Saivite preceptorial lineages - is so compellingly accomplished that it sub sequently became the normative formulation of what is later known as Kashmir  Saivism.  

Writing in a fluid and often difficult Sanskrit, Abhinavagupta composed a large  number of influential works of philosophical theology including the Isvara-pra tyabhi)nd-vimarsinl (Commentary on the Recognition of the Lord); the Tantraloka  (Light on the Tantras), and the Paratrimsika-vivarana (The Long Commentary on  the Thirty Verses on the Supreme). Although he must be counted among the first  rank of India's greatest thinkers, outside Kashmir his name was practically for gotten until the early twentieth century.  

Sambhavi-mudra or the Seal of Sambhu  

At the core of the "Anubhava-nivedana-stotra," Abhinavagupta focuses on the  Sambhavi mudra, the seal of Sambhu. He does this in order to describe the par adoxical state of the yogin who does not close his eyes to the outer world (verse  1), yet who never loses sight of the innermost consciousness. This description of  mystical attainment is characteristic of the Saiva Tantra, and it differs greatly from  the much more rigidly enclosed or purely introversive definitions of achieved  mysticism found in earlier traditions of Indian thought.  

From a doctrinal point of view, the articulation that Abhinavagupta gives in  these longer works of the nondual Saivism of Kashmir is to be distinguished  philosophically by its assertion that what is termed "Siva" - the absolute and  primordial consciousness - is advaya or nondual. Moreover, this nondualism dif 

fers in important ways from the advaita taught in the various schools of the  philosophical Vedanta. For the Kashmiri nondual Saivites, the nondualism or  advaya of Siva does not in any way imply that the world and all who dwell in it  are an illusion or not real. Instead, Abhinavagupta asserts that this world is real  precisely because it is only Siva - the absolute consciousness.  

However, the assertion of the reality of the world does not fall into "naive"  realism - asserting the ultimacy of the reality of the world as world. Instead, it  seeks to articulate the enlightened and transformed vision of the mystic for whom  the paradoxical omnipresence of Siva has become a tangible experience; this is  the abiding in the sambhavi mudra. Thus, Siva's nonduality encompasses without  contradiction the arising of duality and diversity within it. 

576 PAUL E. MULLER-ORTEGA  

This stance or gesture of consciousness has often also been called the bhairavi  mudra, the seal of Bhairava (a name for a form of Siva). An anonymous verse  often quoted in the texts of the tradition describes the bhairavi mudra as follows:  "Even though gazing outside, the eyes neither opening nor closing, one should  direct one's attention within. This is the seal (mudra) of Bhairava, concealed as  the best secret of all the Tantras." Curiously, this verse begins with the same term  in Sanskrit that begins Abhinavagupta's poem: antar-laksya, literally, that which  is to be perceived within, referring to the innermost object of perception. This is  Siva, the highest consciousness to be recognized or perceived inwardly by the  yogin as the true and deepest nature of both the inner Self and the outer world.  

Thus, whether it is called the Sambhavi mudra or the bhairavi-mudra, this term  describes a kind of bifocal mystical vision that involves the simultaneity of outer  sensory perception and inner yogic vision. When this vision is achieved, the  Saivite yogin need never repudiate the outer "thisness" (idanta) of the objects of  perception in an exclusively introversive, closed-eyed samadhi or meditative ab sorption. Instead, his outer vision is transformed so that it does not finally fall on  the world's apparent "outwardness" or "manifestness" (verse 1). Rather, what is  truly seen is the hidden interiority concealed within the world's apparent objec 

tivity, an interiority in which the separateness and duality of the world have  melted into the all-pervasiveness of the paradoxical and boundaryless conscious ness known as Siva.  

This theme of the melting or dissolving (vilina, linata, galita, mentioned in  verses 1,2, and 3) of the world into the unitary consciousness is widespread in  Saiva mysticism. Abhinavagupta tells us that it is achieved by the grace (prasada)  of the master, and this state is described as affording access to the highest con 

sciousness beyond both the ordinary conditions of awareness, and the states of  purely introversive meditative absorption (verse 1). In order to understand in  more detail the play of meanings that combine in great richness around the notion  of Sambhavi mudra, we now examine in more detail what Abhinavagupta means  by a mudra.  

The Meanings of Mudra  

In Sanskrit, the term mudra most commonly denotes a seal in the sense of any  instrument used for sealing or stamping. In the ancient Indus valley civilization,  there were carved stone seals engraved with a variety of designs and used to  imprint this design into the wet clay of a pot or other object. In this same sense,  ancient India knew of other seals such as metallic signet rings or other engraved  implements that could be pressed into melted wax. The plot of a classical Sanskrit  play, the Mudrd-raksasa or "Raksasa's Ring" (by the sixth-century C.E. author  ViSakhadatta) revolves around just such a signet ring that belongs to the chief  minister of a king, and the authority that the signature engraved on such a ring  would bring to one who was not its rightful owner.SEAL OF SAMBH U 577  

In the context of Indian dance, a mudra is often understood as a stylized  physical gesture of the hands, eyes, or body that carries or conveys symbolic  meanings. Many of these same mudras or symbolic gestures of the body are  encountered in the textual descriptions of Indian deities, and in the artistic rep 

resentation of these deities in sculpture and painting. Thus, for example, there is  the famous cinmudra or "seal of consciousness" displayed by the hands of many  deities. In this sense as well, many varieties of Hindu religious ritual (including  that of Saivism) employ numerous hand mudras as an essential element of their  ritual performances.  

In the traditions of hatha yoga, a mudra carries the meaning of a variety of  physical gestures or poses, or esoteric techniques of a specific sort that often  include some sort of lock (bandha) on the subtle energy of the body. In this sense,  we encounter in the texts of yoga the famous khecari mudra, literally the "seal of  flying through the void," which was interpreted as a difficult technique for swal 

lowing the tongue and thus tasting the nectar of immortality that drips down  inside the accomplished yogin's skull. Another example from hatha yoga is the  aSvim-mudra, the "equine seal," which involves locking the energy in the anal or  perineal region. There are many more such mudras in the traditions of hatha  yoga.  

In a related though slightly different environment, there are the mudras that  involve techniques for Tantric sexual intercourse such as the vajroli mudra  (dubbed in recent literature in the West the "reverse fountain-pen effect") for  reabsorbing ejaculated semen back from the vulva into the male urethra, and  thus, it was thought, absorbing as well the female ejaculatory fluids and orgasmic  energies.  

In the wider ambit of the Hindu Tantra, the term mudra is encountered in the  traditional list of the so-called pancamakara or five Ms, the listing of five "forbid den substances" - each of which begins with the letter M in Sanskrit - that were  thought to constitute an integral part of the transgressive ritual of the Tantra.  Here, the term mudra referred to a parched grain that was thought to have an  aphrodisiac effect (see Bharati, Tantric Traditions, p. 243). However, in Kashmiri  Tantra, and especially in the works of Abhinavagupta, the term mudra does not  appear to have been used with this last connotation. For the Kashmiri traditions,  the list of the five Ms appears to have been reduced to the three Ms: madya,  consecrated wine; mamsa, flesh or meat; and maithuna, ritual sexual intercourse  (Tantraloka 29.96). Mudra does not appear on this list; instead, Abhinavagupta  devotes an entire chapter of his summa of the Saiva Tantras and Agamas, the  Tantraloka (TA), to explaining the nature of mudra in a different and quite subtle  way (TA 32. 1-3). As we will see, Abhinavagupta presents a theory of mudra that  is intended to explain both its practice and its origins.  

Abhinavagupta first offers a traditional, interpretive etymology of the term mu dra. He says - breaking the term apart into two constituent elements - that a  mudra is described in the traditional texts or sastras as that which gives (ra)  pleasure or happiness (mud). That is to say, Abhinavagupta continues, a mudra 

578 PAUL E. MULLER-ORTEGA  

is the name for that by means of which one attains the intrinsic nature of con sciousness. Most importantly, he adds, a mudra is that which presents the gift of  the Self by means of the body (TA 32.3). Ksemaraja, one of the disciples of  Abhinavagupta and an important Tantric author in his own right, adds to these  traditional interpretive etymologies of the term mudra. In his comment on sutra  19 of his Pratyabhijndhrdayam, Ksemaraja says a mudra is so called first, because  it dispenses joy (muda) as a result of being of the nature of the highest bliss  (paramananda); second, because it dissolves or melts (dravanat) all spiritual bond age; and third, because it seals (mudranat) the entire universe into the state of the  transcendent consciousness (turiya). All of these interpretations convey different  aspects of the tradition's understanding of mudra.  

Then Abhinavagupta becomes even more specific and technical. He tells us that  a mudra is a pratibimba, a counterpart form or reflected image, in contrast to the  bimba or the original image or form. Abhinavagupta goes on to assert a double  causal relationship between these two images or forms. He says that the counter 

part image or form arises or is produced from the bimba, the original image or  form, but that the original image or form can be produced or made to arise from  the pratibimba, the counterpart form. In order to understand what Abhinavagupta  means by all this, we can begin by adopting an additional terminology of trans 

lation and say that, in this definition, Abhinavagupta is telling us that a mudra is  a sign, and that the sign (pratibimba) is the counterpart of that which is signified  (bimba).  

To illustrate: even in English, the term "seal" carries two different meanings. It  means either the engraved or otherwise carved or decorated implement or tool,  or the imprint that is created by that tool or implement.  

In the first case, the design on the imprinting tool might be called the bimba  or original image, and the design left behind on the wax might be called the  pratibimba or counterpart image or form. In this case, then, the bimba or engraved  tool gives rise to the pratibimba or waxen seal. It is this pratibimba that Abhi 

navagupta wishes to call the mudra.  

We also recall Abhinavagupta's claim of a double causal directionality: prati bimba arises from bimba, but also bimba arises from pratibimba. In what sense  can the original image be said to arise from the counterpart image? Or, in what  sense can a sign give rise to that which it signifies? We here arrive at the first of  two important uses of mudra in Saiva yogic mysticism: first, the practice of mudra  as strategic method that gives rise to yogic attainments, and second, the sponta neous mudras that are born from the supreme consciousness. A mudra is, first,  considered to be a bodily "sign" of consciousness; by practicing it, the experience  of that consciousness can be attained. In this first usage, the context is that of the  not yet realized yogin who takes up the practice of mudra as a method by means  of which to attain yogic results or transformation. Specific poses, hand gestures,  or sensory or mental techniques are practiced by the yogin in the attempt to  precipitate the experience of some change or alteration in awareness. In this sense,  the mudra is a bodily technique consciously and strategically applied as part of a  yogic methodology designed to achieve the goals of yoga. 

SEAL OF SAMBH U 579  

As Abhinavagupta has told us, a mudra is that which presents the gift of the  Self by means of the body. In this sense, Abhinavagupta explains that there are  at least four different kinds of mudras: those that are made by the whole body  (kaya); those that are made by the hands (kara); those that are made by speech  (vak) (or the mouth or tongue); and those that are made in the awareness or mind  (citta) (JA 32.9b). Thus, by means of the bodily positions, hand poses, esoteric  physical techniques of mouth, tongue, or sexual organ, or, indeed, by means of  meditative techniques performed by the bodily senses and the mind - all of which  are varieties of mudras that are described in the traditions of Indian yoga - there  can arise the experience of supreme consciousness.  

It is in this sense that the Sambhavi mudra of the poem is first presented. It  can be understood initially under this rubric of upaya or yogic method. The seal  of Sambhu is a sign of the ultimate consciousness. By "practicing" that sign, that  which it signifies can be experienced. Specifically, the Sambhavi mudra itself can  be understood as a technique of the breath, mind, and senses for achieving the  highest consciousness by means of the kind of "bifocal" vision described above.  A good description of the technique is found in the Vijndna-bhairava-tantra, which  describes this form of meditative practice as follows (verse 80): "Fixing the gaze  on some outer object and yet at the same time making his mind free of the prop  of all thought constructs, the yogin acquires the state of Siva without delay." In  this mode of understanding, the various practices called mudra are the counter part images of the original consciousness, an experience of which they are meant  to precipitate. Hence, returning to Abhinavagupta's analysis, in this sense, bimba  is born of pratibimba. In the poem we can see that Abhinavagupta is alluding,  particularly in verses 1 and 2, to the Sambhavi mudra as a technique or practice  to be performed.  

In verses 3 and 4 of the poem, however, we encounter a different idea of the  Sambhavi mudra. Rather than being a technique, the Sambhavi mudra is under stood as a description of the highest state of yogic achievement. Here Abhinava gupta seems to insist that he is now telling us about the true mudra (and mantra  and yoga), which is spontaneously produced as a result of the yogin's state of  abiding in the supreme nondual consciousness. Indeed, this reversal is further  emphasized in verse 4 by the verbal play (which verges on punning) in the San skrit words of the verse: he tells us about mantras that have no syllables, mudras  in which no physical gestures are performed, and a yoga in which no pranayama  or deliberate breath control is practiced.  

This reversal is significant, for here the poem speaks about the Sambhavi mudra  as a spontaneous occurrence in the body, which is precipitated not as a practice  engaged in order to attain liberation but rather as that very condition of liberation  itself. In this second mode of understanding the nature of mudra, the directional  causality has reversed, and now bimba, original image, gives rise to pratibimba,  counterpart form. This reversal signals an explanatory Tantric theory for the origin  of mudras (just as the previous analysis was an explanatory Tantric theory for  their use in yogic practice).  

Of the many mudras mentioned in Abhinavagupta's works (and in the wider 

580 PAU L E . MULLER-ORTEG A  

literature of Saivism), there are at least four that seem especially to fall into this  category of mudra as denoting states of achieved mystical consciousness. In ad dition to the Sambhavi mudra, we find the bhairavi mudra used to depict a state  of liberation (as described above). In the Tantraloka, Abhinavagupta praises an other important mudra as primary: the khecari mudra, the "stance of moving or  flying through the void of the supreme consciousness." Abhinavagupta asserts  that all the other mudras of consciousness are derivations or variations of the  khecari mudra (TA 32. 6). As we have seen above, the practice of this mudra was  understood in a very different sense from that interpreted by Abhinavagupta here.  Nevertheless, it is here understood by Abhinavagupta as describing the stance of  the accomplished yogin for whom all possible signs of duality or differentiation  have completely vanished. Another important Saiva mudra relating to the con dition of liberation (mentioned in several places, including in Ksemaraja's Pra tyabhijnahrdayam) is the krama mudra, the "seal of sequentiality" in which there  is the sequential movement (krama) of outer awareness into the innermost con sciousness, and a countervailing (and sometimes simultaneous) movement of the  inner consciousness into outer awareness.  

In addition to these, we find mentioned (in TA 32.4-6a, as well as in the Vijnana bhairava-tantra verse 77, and many other places) mudras with such names as the  trisulimm - relating to the trident; the karankinim - the skeletal; the krodhanam - the wrathful; the lelihanikam - the seal of tasting or licking, as well as many others.  All of these appear to denote "stances" or "gestures" of consciousness of the Saivite  mystic in the ascending evolution toward the highest realization.  

Thus, the Sambhavi mudra refers to stance of the yogin in which the absolute  consciousness is realized in its completeness and totality. It is, therefore, a descrip tion of the state of liberation within the body (jivanmukti) and of the impact of that  state of absolute consciousness on the limited individuality of the practitioner.  

Sambhavi-mudra, the Great Seal of the Absolute  

To understand this poem it is necessary to see that the metaphor of the seal as  implement is here transposed to the impact (saktipata) of the Absolute. It is like  an invisible and transcendent "implement" that emerges from within to "seal" its  design on the person of the yogin. Like wax that has been melted, the mind and  body of the yogin have been "melted" by dedicated yogic practice. The yogin must  be responsive to the impact of this experience of the Absolute. He must not be  rigid, contracted, or given over to tightly limiting and constricting activities of the  body, the vital energy, and the mind. Such constricted "bodily" activities (repre sentative of those of the ordinary person) would only serve to "harden," as it were,  the being of the yogin and to make him unresponsive to the influx of the potency  of the Absolute.  

All the preliminary stages of yoga thus seem to be meant to prepare the yogin 

SEAL OF SAMBHU 581  

for this condition of responsiveness to the influx of the supreme power or sakti.  What is sought, finally, is a kind of existential transparency to absolute conscious ness. Upon reaching the summit of mystical consciousness, the being of the yogin  then reveals the shape of the Great "Seal" of the Absolute, like the signet ring that  is impressed into the warm and receptive surface of the wax. The resulting shapes  and impressions are the mudras of consciousness, even as the force of the impact  of the Seal of the Absolute - the state of liberation - is also called a mudra. In deed, the body of the enlightened yogin is understood to be continuously forming  mudras, some overt, others subtle. Every activity of the enlightened yogin is a  mudra: a "gesture" or "sign" that reveals the shape and character of the absolute  consciousness that is invisibly impressing itself into the receptive yogin's being.  

The mudra as pratibimba or counterpart image, then, refers to the responsive  molding of the yogin's individuality: the mind, breath, body, and demeanor of  the yogin are all shaped by the overwhelming impact of the potency of the Ab solute. It, so to speak, molds the yogin into its own design; it "seals" its imprint  on the being of the yogin. In this way, though transcendent, invisible, and beyond  the reach of the senses, the Absolute nevertheless, by means of the force or Sakti  of its descent into the individuality of the practitioner, reveals its nature in the  transformation of the state of the realized yogin. The state of the mystical expe 

rience of the absolute consciousness - the sambhavi mudra as bimba or original  image or form - can thus be understood to "seal" its effect or invisible design  upon the outer assemblage (this is the sense of the term samsthana in verse 3) of  the body, breath, and mind of the yogin. This creates the many mudras or physical  gestures or responsive demonstrations in the sense of pratibimba or counterpart  image or form of the absolute.  

Such a double understanding of mudra reflects what the Saivite tradition will  call anupaya or "no-practice" (discussed below). It seems to be implicit in Abhi navagupta's definition of mudra that the sense of mudra as yogic practice is sub servient to and dependent upon the sense of mudra as spontaneous existential  gesture of the condition of liberation. Indeed, in the Tantraloka Abhinavagupta  explicitly singles out the spontaneously appearing mudras of consciousness by  insisting that "Whatever bodily configuration appears spontaneously in one who  has ascended completely to the sphere of the absolute consciousness (khecari  cakra), that alone is to be considered a mudra. The rest, which are devoid of the  impact of the absolute consciousness, are simply unnatural deformations of the  body" (TA 32.65).  

This understanding of spontaneously appearing mudras provides us with what  amounts to a Tantric theory of origin for mudras. By implication, we can speculate  that the strategic practice of mudra appears to be the imitation of such gestures,  stances, and poses. What had previously been observed in the posture and de 

meanor of the enlightened yogin as spontaneous manifestations of deep inner  transformation are purposefully imitated by other yogins as a conscious stratagem  for precipitating or reduplicating that very state of illuminated consciousness.  Although the poem does not explicitly take up these themes, they hover in its 

582 PAUL E. MULLER-ORTEG A  

conceptual background, particularly in the sharp contrast between the first two  verses and the last two.  

Sambhavi-mudra and the Nonduality of Siva  

This poem sings about abiding in this space of deepest interiority. What is at  stake for the Saiva Tantric yogin here is not just a momentary breach or prelim inary entry into the supreme consciousness. Rather, the poem extols the state of  the most accomplished Saivite mystic for whom the experience of the great Self  has matured, stabilized, and become a continuous experience, a quotidian state  of being (verse 2).  

Such a state is not understood to exclude the dynamic, swirling, and abundant  variety of the world. Rather, it is the full revelation of the intrinsic and unchanging  source from which this kaleidoscopic drama of samsara continuously emerges  and manifests. Therefore, the nonduality of the ultimate consciousness of Siva is  understood to be continuous with, contiguous, and subjacent to the differentiated  and variegated play of the world. It is the source of all differentiation (srsti), it is  that which underlies, supports, and inheres in the variety of differentiation (sthiti),  and it is that into which the differentiation finally merges (samhara).  

In the final state of vision described by the sambhavi mudra, the "world" reveals  itself to be only consciousness. It is "sealed" with the stamp of Siva's blissful  nonduality. Such a yogin succeeds in tasting the unitary flavor of Siva (ekarasa)  in every moment of the apparently differentiated perception of a supposedly sepa 

rate and objective world. Whether the accomplished yogin gazes within or with out, what is perceived is the boundaryless consciousness of Siva. As a result, for  that yogin, the very distinction between inward and outwardly turned perception  and, indeed, between self and other, between the supposedly only silent and  tranquil absolute consciousness and the apparently only dynamic and active rela tive world - all of these distinctions collapse.  

Because this poem was probably directly addressed to a small audience of  initiated disciples, it unfolds against the background of a shared understanding  of such philosophical argumentation about the nonduality of Siva, as well as of  the complex technicalities of Saiva yoga and its understanding of an ascending  path of mystical consciousness. But although the philosophical theology of Abhi 

navagupta's branch of Saivism posits the notion of advaya or radical nonduality  as a fundamental tenet, the Tantric sadhaka nevertheless seeks to actualize fully  the experience of this philosophical formulation as the direct and unmediated  realization of his daily practice. Indeed, the yogin seeks, finally, a stabilized con 

dition of achieved mystical consciousness that both fulfills and in some significant  sense brings to an end all explicit forms of practice.  

In the yoga of Saivism, central to such a practice are the forms of samavesa or  absorptive meditative merging, of which there are several varieties or degrees of  intensity. For Abhinavagupta, the definitive classification of these is to be found 

SEAL OF SAMBH U 583  

in the Mdlim-vijaya-tantra. There, the yogic methods or means (upayas) for at taining the supreme consciousness are arranged in terms of samavesa. These range  from the so-called anava or "minute," to the sakta or "empowered," to the Sam bhava or "supreme." Thus, the highest method or degree of yogic absorption is  usually termed sambhava: that which relates to Sambhu or Siva. Here, the effort  and technique, the dedicated practice and discipline of the lesser modes of Saiva  yoga have been left behind. The Sambhava upaya involves the highest states of  mystical dissolution of individuality beyond the realm of the thought-constructs.  Furthermore, although effort in any explicit sense has been left behind, such a  "method" is understood to be empowered by the force and impact of the grace  of the master (verse 1). By means of it, the practitioner is led to the ultimately  effortless yogic merging into the englobing consciousness of Siva, the absolute  consciousness.  

The accomplished Saivite mystic is one who - even as his vision falls on the  surface play of existence - is capable of penetrating its pulsating layers and con tinuously discovering, uncovering, and recognizing its ultimate, unitary, and si lent source in the supreme consciousness. The seal of Sambhu, the Sambhavi  mudra, then, is this paradoxical state of Tantric attainment that is neither exclusive  nor repudiatory, nor does it in any way reject the variety of the world's astonishing  play.  

Abiding in the space that encompasses both inwardness and outwardness in  one overarching and paradoxical consciousness, the yogin is capable of seeing  that the world now reveals its deeper layers of being, finally laying bare its ultimate  and secret source in the resplendent domain of Siva: the silent, pulsating core  essence of the supreme consciousness (verse 2).  

Although what Abhinavagupta describes in this poem is certainly rooted in the  technical practice of Saiva yoga of a complex sort, it enters into the zone of what  this and other Saivite traditions characterize as the anupaya or the "method of no  practice." Such a "no-practice method" consists of the summit of the mystical life  where the "practice," so to speak, involves abiding in surrender to the Absolute,  finally yielding the vestiges of limited individuality to the supreme consciousness.  From this vantage point, we can understand this poem as giving expression to  that most rarefied of mystical movements: the final transition from the highest  practice or method of the Saiva yoga - the sambhava upaya - to the anupaya or  "no practice" as the state of liberation and enlightenment itself. Here, the need  for yogic practice, method, technique, and effort with regard to mantra, mudra,  and breath have all been transcended in the stabilized condition of fully illumi nated awareness. Such is the Sambhavi mudra.  

In this poem Abhinavagupta, one of the definitive theologians of a branch of the  later "high" Hindu Tantra, reveals himself as an ecstatic, mystical poet; Abhina vagupta, the masterly theoretician of Saiva ritual, lays bare his own accomplish ment as a yogin; Abhinavagupta, the sober philosopher and capable expositor of  the most subtle forms of reasoned philosophical argumentation, allows himself 

584 PAUL E. MULLER-ORTEG A  

to be seen as an intoxicated devotee of absolute consciousness. As a result, the  poem is less stylistically rigid and formal than many comparable stotras directed  toward deities. It is - within the constraints of the rich technical vocabulary that  Abhinavagupta employs - quite descriptive and evocative. One senses the ex 

treme familiarity with which Abhinavagupta addresses himself to his theme. As  we have seen, in the poem, Abhinavagupta takes features of the technical yoga - in particular the idea of mudra - and transposes them beyond their complexity  

as practice in order to reveal what he claims to be their true nature.  The poem exists against the background of an immense array of Tantric tech nicalities but finally settles down in the intimacy of the Tantric practitioner's inner  state. It is itself an inspired mystical expression, a mudra, if you will, for it attempts  to speak in poetic terms of a state of mystical attainment in such a way that carries  the weight of that attainment. Finally, the poem is not concerned with philo sophical argumentation, nor does it engage in didactic teaching, nor is it instruc tive about the intricacies of the practice of Saiva yoga - or, indeed, of its complex  rituals. It is, in the end, a celebratory exclamation: a stotra or hymn in praise, a  true poem in that it gives expression to the direct experience of the absolute with  elegance and in a way that opens that experience to others. Hence, Abhinava gupta's title for this stotra: a song of praise intended to communicate (nivedana)  the direct experience (anubhava) of the Absolute.  

Though little known outside Kashmir, the short poetical compositions of Abhi navagupta appear to have been central to the lore of Kashmir for a millennium.  They appeared in published form in 1935 in K. C. Pandey's massive study of  Abhinavagupta: Abhinavagupta: An Historical and Philosophical Study, Chowk hamba Sanskrit Studies, vol. 1 (Varanasi: Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office,  1963). Pandey (p. 73) describes finding the Sanskrit text of this poem in a col lection of Abhinavagupta's stotras in the possession of one Harabhatt Shastri of  Kashmir. He warns us, however, that he finds no other authority for attributing  the work to Abhinavagupta. He includes this stotra in Sanskrit (along with a  number of other short works by Abhinavagupta) as an appendix to his book. The  stotra does not appear in the listing of the Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies.  Lilian Silbum tells us that she studied this and other such stotras of Abhinava gupta under the direction of Swami Lakshman Joo. In 1970 she published a  translation of a number of them into French, along with a very useful thematic  and interpretive introduction and commentary. I have translated the stotra as it  appears in Appendix C of Pandey's book (p. 953).

The Song of Praise Intended to Communicate the Direct Experience of the Absolute  

1. The accomplished Tantric yogin, whose mind and breath have been dis solved through complete immersion in the innermost object of perception, the  supreme goal of yoga - such a yogin then abides with a silenced though open  vision, the pupils of the eyes unmoving. Though he [is seen to] gaze still on  the outer world, in truth his vision assuredly does not rest on its [apparent  outwardness]. This is the seal of Sambhu - the sambhavi mudra, the Saiva  "seal" of unitary consciousness, the performing of the ultimate "gesture" or  "stance" of Siva's illumination.  

This state of true and ultimate mystical vision, O Divine Master, is produced  only because of your potent and illuminating grace. This is the domain of  Sambhu, the gracious Lord, the true state of reality which is beyond the ex perience of both the fullness [of the conditions of ordinary awareness], as well  as lying beyond even the [extraordinary] void states [of advanced Tantric medi tation] .  

2. Such a yogin abides with eyes half opened and yet with a mind that is  motionless and serene, his gaze fixed steadily [at the secret portal that opens  to the yogin's subtle perception found] at the tip of the nose. The sun and 

586 PAUL E. MULLER-ORTEG A  

moon [either the "sun" as the means of knowledge (pramana) and the "moon"  as the known objective universe (prameya), or the two breaths and the whole  world of duality that they stir] have dissolved into the great interiority of aware ness that pulsates naturally with the triple vibration [either the vibration of  the energies of will, knowledge, and action or the vibration of the supreme  Sakti that constantly tends toward the manifestation of the visible reality, the  counterbalancing reabsorptive pulsation of consciousness, and the supreme  

pulsation or adya-spanda that abides beyond such polarizing movements].  Here, the yogin achieves the One reality, the domain whose nature is essen tially the pure light of consciousness, devoid entirely of all externality, the  supreme spirit, the true principle, the abode of the highest, the supreme es sence. More than this, what is there to be said of it?  

3. In that state, whatsoever words may emerge from the mouth of such a yogin  are, indeed, transcendentally charged mantras. The aggregate form of the  body - within which the experience of pleasure and pain are constantly aris ing - that very bodily form [of the illuminated yogin] is indeed nevertheless  

the mudra or seal that reveals [the experience of the Absolute].  The spontaneous and natural flow of the breath [which produces the natural  mantric sound hamsa continuously] - that, indeed, is the extraordinary and  highest yoga itself. Having directly experienced the unparalleled splendor, the  illuminating glory of the divine Sakti, in truth, what will then not reveal itself  to me?  

4. The [true and highest] mantra that then reveals itself in that state has no  distinguishable arrangement of syllables or phonemes to be seen within it [for  it is of the nature of the potency of the ultimate consciousness aham itself.]  When the entirety of the [separative or contractive] bodily activities have  dropped away or when the practice of all bodily techniques [engaged strate gically by the yogin] has stopped, then the [true and highest] mudra or seal of  the absolute rises up to reveal itself. As soon as the [separative and dualizing]  flow of the breath has ceased or when the [practice of the] flow of the breath  [that is, pranayama techniques of yoga] have stopped being performed, that,  indeed, is [the true] yoga which then appears.  

In the magnificent festival of mystical illumination that leads to the attaining  of your splendor, what, indeed, does not then reveal itself to the enlightened  wise ones as completely extraordinary?34  

Vajrayoga in the Kalacakra Tantra  

John Newman  

The Vajrayana tradition of Buddhism is the second of two modes of Mahayana  Buddhist practice. In the first of these - the "system of the Perfections" (paramita naya) - the bodhisattva strives to attain the supreme awakening of buddhahood  by means of a lengthy and gradual training in generosity, morality, forbearance,  perseverance, meditative concentration, and wisdom. In the "Mantra system"  (mantra-naya), a synonym for Vajrayana, the bodhisattva develops the same vir tues and knowledge, but uses special magical ritual meditative techniques that  greatly accelerate the process. Because the Vajrayana is primarily a type of mystical  praxis, its sacred scriptures and exegetical literature are mostly devoted to prac tical matters rather than to philosophical doctrine. This has sometimes led to the  misconception that the Vajrayana is merely a body of techniques, and that phi losophy is marginal or irrelevant to its central concerns. In fact the opposite is  true. Vajrayana can only be correctly understood as a ritual-meditative imple mentation of insights developed within the common Mahayana philosophical  tradition.  

The principal philosophical view underlying Vajrayana mysticism is Madhya maka ("the Middle"), which was originally taught by the Buddha in the Perfection  of Wisdom Sutras and later elucidated by Nagarjuna (ca. second century C.E.) in  his Madhyamaka-sastra ("Treatise on the Middle"). Madhyamaka steers a middle  course between the two ontological extremes of a realism that ascribes inherent  existence to phenomena and a nihilism that denies phenomena's causal efficacy.  It does this by asserting that although phenomena are utterly devoid of inherent  existence, they nevertheless originate in dependence on causes and conditions,  and function in an entirely regular and predictable fashion. Thus any given phe 

nomenon can be viewed from two perspectives. When one scrutinizes a phenom enon in search of its intrinsic, independent identity, no such identity is found.  This absence of inherent existence, or "own-being" (svabhava), is its "emptiness"  (sunyata). On the other hand, when one observes a phenomenon as it ordinarily 

588 JOHN NEWMAN  

appears, without engaging in an investigation of its ultimate status, it is seen to  arise within a specific matrix of causes, and it in turn serves to produce specific  effects. This causal regularity of phenomena is called "dependent origination"  (pratitya-samutpada). According to the Madhyamaka view, emptiness and depen 

dent origination mutually entail one another: things are empty of inherent exis tence because they originate in dependence on extrinsic factors, and things are  able to originate and function in causal relationships because they are devoid of  an absolute nature that would preclude such relationships.  

The Madhyamaka ontology of emptiness and dependent origination is closely  related to its epistemology of two truths, "conventional truth" (samvrti-satya) and  "ultimate truth" (paramdriha-satya). Conventional truth is the world of appear ance. For ordinary people - that is, those who have not gained insight into emp tiness and dependent origination - phenomena appear to possess inherent exis tence, and such people hold these appearances to be real, to exist as they appear.  Buddhist adepts who have realized emptiness alternate between two modes of  cognition: while absorbed in meditative concentration on emptiness they perceive  only emptiness, and conventional appearances do not appear to them at all; when  they arise from meditation conventional phenomena reappear and appear to exist  inherently, but adepts understand that these appearances are illusory, and thus  do not cling to them as real. Buddhas, finally, see conventional truth (appearance)  and ultimate truth (emptiness), simultaneously.  

In Vajrayana practice, Madhyamaka doctrine is realized through yogic control  of the mind. Whereas mind in its samsaric state generates and is infatuated by  mundane illusory appearances, the first phase of the Vajrayana path, the "gen eration stage" (.utpatti-krama), harnesses the creative power of mind to produce a  new divine vision of reality. This imaginative vision, called a mandala, is a trans formation of the practitioner's perception, so that ordinary appearances of self  and environment are replaced by an ideal universe inhabited by deities. The  elaborate symbolism of the mandala is a divinization of basic Buddhist psycho logical and metaphysical categories: the deities of the mandala are the phenomena  that make up the practitioner's personality purified through recognition of their  emptiness. During the generation stage, the practitioner first dissolves ordinary  perception into perception of emptiness. Then within this perception of empti ness, the practitioner's mind manifests in the form of the mandala. By conditioning  him- or herself through the mandala practice of the generation stage, the Vajrayana  practitioner gains a deeper understanding that phenomena are devoid of indepen dent inherent existence, that they are instead the products of mental fabrication.  

Whereas the generation stage uses imagination to produce an alternative vision  of conventional reality, the second phase of the Vajrayana path, the "completion  stage" (utpanna-krama), cognizes the ultimate nature of mind itself. The Tantric  yoga of the completion stage ceases sensory perception and ideation. When these  coarse forms of mental activity have been shut down, the "connate luminosity"  (sahaja prabhasvara) of mind appears. Through yogic conditioning, this most sub 

tle form of mind can be awakened so that it becomes aware of its own emptiness. 

VAJRAYOGA IN KALACAKRA TANTRA 589  

This special kind of direct realization of emptiness, unique to Vajrayana, is called  the "transcendental mahamudra siddhi." Mahamudra can be roughly glossed as  the "Great Seal." It is gnosis realizing the mind's own emptiness in a nondual,  nonconceptual fashion: mind is "sealed" by emptiness, and emptiness is "sealed"  by mind. Mahamudra is likened to a divination in which a maiden perceives a  hidden object in a mirror. The appearing object is a manifestation of the maiden's  own mind; the maiden does not "think" of the object, yet she directly perceives  it. Similarly, for the yogin or yogini practicing mahamudra, the subjective aspect  of mind (gnosis) and the objective aspect of mind (the appearance of the mind's  own emptiness) are blended in a single essence so that it is impossible to distin guish knowledge from object of knowledge. This gnosis is called "the gnostic  mind of imperishable bliss" (aksara-sukha jnana-citta).  

The perfect integration of the conventional truth of the mentally fabricated  mandala and the ultimate truth of the connate luminosity realizing emptiness is  called vajrayoga, "adamantine union," in the text translated below. Vajrayoga is  the inseparable fusion of wisdom realizing emptiness and compassion sponta 

neously manifesting appearances in order to guide living beings to freedom from  samsara. Personal names for this transcendent reality include Adibuddha (Primal  Awakened One), Bhagavan Kalacakra (Lord Wheel of Time), and Vajrasattva (Ad amantine Sentient Being). Because vajrayoga surpasses the limitations of dichot omizing, dualistic thought, language cannot fully encompass its true nature. Nev ertheless, language can point toward the transcendent, and the second half of our  text describes vajrayoga in terms designed to undermine reification of the cate gories that define ordinary conceptions of reality.  

The transcendent vajrayoga is heterogeneous because it is the integration of  purified conventional appearance and emptiness. Whereas appearance is a posi tive phenomenon that functions in accordance with the causal law of dependent  origination, emptiness is a mere negation, the simple absence of inherent exis tence. Ordinary thought cannot grasp both aspects of reality simultaneously, yet  "the conventional is embodied in emptiness, and emptiness is embodied in the  conventional": vajrayoga confounds conceptual thought, which is based on the  dichotomy existence/nonexistence. Our text quotes the Astasahasrika Prajnapar amitd ("Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in Eight Thousand Lines") to illustrate this  point: "Mind that is non-mind exists." The perfection of wisdom - the compas sionate wisdom realizing emptiness - is "non-mind" because it is free from con ceptual elaboration and is fused with spacelike emptiness, mind's mere lack of  intrinsic existence. Yet this non-mind "exists" because it is directly perceived by  the awakened person, and it displays myriad forms that serve to awaken others.  

Vajrayoga is "without relation" (niranvaya) because it pervades everything. It  cannot be localized within mundane existence (the "desire," "form," and "form less" existences of Buddhist cosmology) or nirvana (the cessation of the three  realms of existence) because thought defines mundane existence and nirvana as  contraries, and vajrayoga transcends such reifying, dualistic thinking. Similarly,  when fire is generated by spinning a fire-drill on its base, the fire is inseparable 

590 JOH N NEWMA N  

from the totality of the causes that produce it; it cannot be localized in any  particular cause. Like that, vajrayoga pervades the entire universe of the outer  world (bahya), the self (adhyatma), and the transcendent (para).  

As initial realization, vajrayoga is called "supreme, perfect awakening in one  moment" (ekaksanabhisambodhi). When the Vajrayana practitioner first realizes  vajrayoga he or she experiences a moment of "supreme imperishable great bliss"  (paramaksara-mahasukha): blissful connate luminosity embraces its own naked  emptiness. In the Vajrayana system treated here, supreme imperishable great bliss  is repeatedly developed in order to produce 21,600 moments of gnosis. This  number - a conventional designation for the number of human respirations in a  day and the number of years in a cosmic cycle - is a symbol of temporal totality,  the embodiment and transcendence of time. Cultivation of supreme imperishable  great bliss serves as a path that purifies the mind of contaminating stains, even tually culminating in the achievement of perfect buddhahood. From the point of  view of perfect buddhahood, we cannot speak of the conventional momentary  origination, duration, and disintegration of phenomena because awakened mind  is free from erroneous discrimination that reifies cause and effect, one and many,  being and nonbeing, and so forth. Such mind is said to be "devoid of own-being"  (nihsvabhava) because it knows dependent origination and emptiness in a totally  integrated, nondualistic way. This gnosis is also called "reality" (tattva).  

The following translation is a dewdrop lifted from the ocean of the Vimalaprabha  (Stainless Light), the great commentary on the Sri Kdlacakra (Splendid Wheel of  Time), the primary Tantra of the Kalacakra (Wheel of Time) system of Vajrayana  mysticism. The Kalacakra was the last major Tantra produced by the Indian Vaj 

rayana tradition, and the Sri Kalacakra and Vimalaprabha contain a date that  enables us to determine that these texts were completed between 1025 and ca.  1040 C.E. The earliest masters of the Kalacakra included Pindo, a brahman Bud dhist monk born in Java, and Naropa, the famous Vajrayana guru of Naalandaa  monastic university. During the eleventh to thirteenth centuries, the Kalacakra  flourished among the Buddhist elite of northeastern India, whence it was trans mitted to Tibet. In Tibet, the Kalacakra became an important item in the spiritual  repertoire of most Buddhist lineages, and it continues to be studied and practiced  today.  

The translation, "A Summary of the Vajrayoga" (Vimalaprabha 1.3.1 [commen tary on Sri" Kalacakra 1. Id]), is based on my unpublished edition of this passage,  which relies on Asiatic Society of Bengal manuscript G. 10766 and on the printed  edition of the Vimalaprabha, which was edited by Jagannatha Upadhyaya and  published in the Bibliotheca Indo-Tibetica Series, no. 11 (Sarnath, Varanasi: Cen tral Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies, 1986), pp. 42.15-45.3. In the course of  his discussion, the author of the Vimalaprabha cites the following works, in some  cases anonymously: the Sri Kalacakra, which was edited and published together  with the Vimalaprabha, as cited above; the Astasdhasrika Prajadparamita, which  was edited by P. L. Vaidya and published in the Buddhist Sanskrit Texts Series,

Davidson and published in Melanges chinois et bouddhiques, vol. 20 (Bruxelles:  Institut Beige des Hautes Etudes Chinoises, 1981); and the Paramadibuddha, the  Kalacakra mulatantra ("basic Tantra"), which has come down to us only in frag 

mentary form.

A Summary of the Vajrayoga  

Now "yoga in the Sri Kalacakra" [in Sri Kalacakra l.ld] summarizes the vaj rayoga.  

In the Mantra system, the Bhagavan Buddha, depending on worldly and  transcendental truth, indicated two types of meaning in this and other Tantras:  one with worldly convention, the second in accordance with the ultimate.  Provisional meaning is indicated with worldly convention. Definitive meaning  is indicated in accordance with the ultimate. Disciples should understand these  two meanings from a guru's instructions.  

Likewise, in all the other Tantras the subject matter is of two types: one in  accordance with worldly convention, the second in accordance with the ulti mate. That which is in accordance with worldly convention is characterized  by the colors, arms, symbols, and shapes [of the deities in the mandala]. That  which is in accordance with ultimate truth is devoid of the colors, arms, sym bols, and shapes [of the deities in the mandala].  

Of these two, that which is taught in accordance with worldly convention  is [the mandala of deities], a phenomenon of one's own mental fabrication that  produces the worldly siddhis in order to achieve the worldly siddhis in the  outer world and in the self. That which is taught in accordance with ultimate  truth is free from the phenomena of one's mental fabrication in order to achieve  the transcendental mahamudra siddhi that possesses the best of all aspects. It  is directly perceived: an appearance of his own mind manifests in the sky for  the yogin, just as a divination appears in a mirror for a maiden. It produces 

592 JOHN NEWMAN  

the result that is the desired aim. The result is the gnostic mind of imperishable  bliss.  

The unity of these two minds - the vajrayoga consisting of wisdom and  method, the supreme imperishable great aim, the Adibuddha without relation,  Bhagavan Kalacakra - is renowned in all the other Tantras as Vajrasattva. That  very Bhagavan is called the "Nature Body" in the Perfection of Wisdom - in  the Perfection system that is designated as the cause. Thus, when determining  the four functions [of buddhahood] in the Abhisamayalankarakarika [1.17],  Maitreya says:  

[The buddha bodies] are said to be fourfold: the Natural [body], Dharma  body, Enjoyment [body], and Emanation [body], with Activity as well.  

That very Bhagavan is called "connate joy" and the "connate body" in the  Mantra system that is designated as the effect. It has abandoned object and  subject; it is beyond the phenomenality of limited consciousness; it is not fix ated in existence or nirvana; it is the assembly of the buddhas and the congre gation of the goddesses. The definitive meaning of this is that it has the same  essence as the gnosis body.  

This vajrayoga is without relation. It has abandoned eternity and annihila tion. It is beyond worldly examples. It has thoroughly forsaken ideas about  existence and nonexistence. Like a divination in a maiden's mirror, it is not  imagined by one's mind - it is directly seen, an object of experience. It is all  aspects; it originates from the sky. It is completely good, the total cognitive  faculty. It is the connate joy that dwells in the self of everyone. It has completely  abandoned logical reasons and examples.  

The heterogeneity of the unity of existence and nonexistence serves as an  example for this vajrayoga for yogins so that they may destroy all grasping at  positions. It is like the following worldly example: "Since it is heterogeneous  with 'pot,' 'sky-flower' does not exist, because it is entirely nonexistent. Like 

wise, since it is heterogeneous with 'sky-flower,' 'pot' exists, because it is en tirely existent." Because these two are mutually heterogeneous, they are an  example.  

Similarly, since it is heterogeneous with annihilation, existence exists, be cause it is entirely existent. Since it is heterogeneous with existence, annihi lation does not exist, because it is entirely nonexistent. The word "annihilation"  indicates nirvana that is characterized by nonexistence.  

Similarly, the unity of these two, pot and sky-flower, serves as an example  for the transcendent because it is heterogeneous. These two, pot and sky flower, are not unified from the point of view of worldly convention because  they are mutually contradictory. For due to the nature of existence and non existence, that which exists does not not exist, and that which does not exist  does not exist. Since it is contradictory, that which makes mind characterized  by existence does not make it characterized by nonexistence; that which makes 

VAJRAYOGA IN KALACAKRA TANTRA 59 3  

mind characterized by nonexistence does not make it characterized by exis tence.  

Here too, the image that consists of emptiness and compassion - the purified  mind that is like a maiden's divination - is not characterized by form because  it is not made of atoms. It is not characterized by formlessness because it is  present in the void.  

Therefore, the conventional is embodied in emptiness, and emptiness is em bodied in the conventional. Since it is beyond worldly examples, "mind that is  non-mind exists" [Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita 3]: it is free from the charac teristics of eternal and annihilated phenomena, it is indivisible emptiness and  compassion. Because of the heterogeneity of both minds from the point of view  of ultimate truth, nondual vajrayoga is beyond "is" and "is not", and it is the  termination of existence and nonexistence, because the speech of the Tathagata  is without relation.  

Here, the Bhagavan said in the Basic J antra [the Paramadibuddha]  

Nondual vajrayoga, the great bliss, is beyond "is" and "is not". It is the ter mination of existence and nonexistence; it is indivisible emptiness and com passion. (1)  

The vajrayoga without relation is beyond the nature of atoms and it has  abandoned void phenomena. It is free from eternity and annihilation. (2)  

Thus, in other Tantras the Tathagata has said that vajrayoga accomplishes  the mahamudra.  

That pure vajrayoga, being the supreme perfect buddhahood in one moment,  is the great aim, the supreme imperishable, connate joy. It does not abide in  the desire existence, it does not abide in the form existence, it does not abide  in the formless existence, it does not abide in the desire nirvana, it does not  abide in the form nirvana, and it does not abide in the formless nirvana, because  it is not fixated in existence or nirvana. It does not abide in both because they  are mutually contradictory; like sun and shadow, existence and nirvana are not  identical. Just as fire does not abide in the base of the fire-drill, in the fire-drill,  or in the effort of the person's hand, a yogin should comprehend the vajrayoga  everywhere in the outer world, in the self, and in the transcendent.  

The so-called "supreme, perfect awakening in one moment" is a moment of  supreme imperishable great bliss. That supreme buddhahood in one moment  develops all the moments through to the end of the count of the breaths. Then  the supreme, perfect buddhahood completed in that moment is the true, perfect  buddha. After that moment of completion in which all tathagatas obtain su 

preme, perfect buddhahood, all phenomena do not originate, do not abide, and  do not disintegrate, because they are without relation.  

During the moment all phenomena originate they do not abide and do not  disintegrate. During the moment they abide they do not disintegrate and do 

594 JOH N NEWMA N  

not originate. During the moment all phenomena disintegrate they do not origi nate and do not abide. Also, all phenomena do not momentarily originate,  momentarily abide, and momentarily disintegrate in sequence. And this does  not happen simultaneously: at a single time when all phenomena exist, the  

moments of origination, abiding, and disintegration are not identical.  However, you might say: In sequence, the moment of abiding arises from  the moment of origination, the moment of disintegration arises from the mo ment of abiding, and the moment of origination arises from the moment of  disintegration. But that is irrelevant from the point of view of reasoning about  the ultimate: here, another moment does not arise from a prior moment that  has not ceased; likewise, it does not arise from a moment that has ceased. For  example, a sprout does not arise from a seed that is destroyed, and a sprout does  not arise from a seed that is not destroyed. Similarly, since ultimate being does  not exist, there is no one moment, because one and many are contradictory.  With regard to "the supreme, perfect buddhahood in one moment that de velops all the moments" [Namasangiti 141cb]: Being first fully awakened in a  moment of supreme imperishable bliss, one develops the 21,600 moments of  supreme imperishable bliss. After that, when all moments are nonexistent, the  supreme nondual yoga of the buddhas - separate from one and many - is ul timate because it is separate from being and nonbeing. As long as there is  worldly being, phenomena are discriminated by means of one and many be cause of the appearance of momentary mind. When mind is separate from  momentary phenomena, it is called "devoid of own-being."  Therefore, the Bhagavan said that the position devoid of own-being is a  nonposition. So-called "positions" are: existent/nonexistent, being/nonbeing,  is/is not, one/many, eternity/annihilation, existence/nirvana, form/nonform,  sound/nonsound, moment/nonmoment, desire/nondesire, hatred/nonhatred,  delusion/nondelusion. These and others are positions because they are mutu ally dependent. The buddhas' nonfixated nirvana that is separate from this  position is devoid of own-being. Gnosis that is separate from one and many  moments is called "reality" by the victorious buddhas. 

### 35 Jain Tantra: Divinatory and Meditative Practices  in the Twelfth-Century Yogasastra of Hemacandra  

Olle Qvarnstrom  

The study of Jain medieval Sanskrit texts reveals a Tantric influence on the two  main traditions of Jainism - Digambara and Svetambara - both in the sense of  ideas and practices and in the sense of a literary class. This influence was restricted  neither geographically nor confessionally, and manifested itself within different  literary genres and contexts. Its impression is also visible in iconography and art.  

The questions of the precise extent to which Tantra penetrated into Jainism,  the historical development of Jain Tantra, and its indebtedness to Hindu and  Buddhist Tantra are at the present stage of research not entirely clear, even though  their outlines have been sketched by scholars such as John Cort and Paul Dundas.  Many Tantric texts are still only available in manuscript form. Few have been  critically edited. For various reasons Jain Tantra has not caught the attention of  Indologists. This has in its turn made it difficult to integrate Jain Tantra into a  broader religious, cultural, and historical framework, as well as to define its dis tinctive character.  

Rather than attempting to give a historical survey of Jain Tantra, the following  study is, therefore, based on a single text: the Yogasastra of Hemacandra (1089- 1172 C.E.). This, the most comprehensive treatise on Svetambara Jainism that has  come down to us, was regarded as a normative account of that tradition even by  

non-Jains. Today it serves as a handbook for the Svetambara community in Gu jarat as well as among their coreligionists in East Africa, Great Britain, and North  America.  

Even though the Yogasastra is neither a Tantric text nor an historical work that  might provide us with a description of the gradual infusion of Tantra into Sve tambara Jainism and its ideological provenance, it is the result of a historical  process during which the incorporation of Tantric ideas and practices was natural 

596 OLLE QVARNSTRO M  

and necessary. The Yogasastra is thus valuable for uncovering the Tantric influence  on medieval and contemporary Svetambara Jainism, since it informs us of the  means and extent of Tantric influence on mainstream Svetambara Jainism. At the  same time, we have to be on our guard for doctrinal elements that do not nec 

essarily reflect the view of either the Jain congregation or the leading circles within  the exegetical tradition, but which are merely the predilections and hidden mo tives of the author himself. This is especially important with regard to the Yoga sastra, since it was written at the request of the author's employer, King Kumar apala, who reigned over Gujarat during this time and who was himself in the  process of converting from Saivism to Jainism. One may therefore assume that  the motive behind the composition of the Yogasastra was in part apologetic and  propagandistic, and that it was linguistically and doctrinally designed to serve the  purpose of converting Gujarati Saivites to Jainism, as well as to propagate a co herent creed among the Jains themselves. As an erudite writer of elegant verse,  Hemacandra was well equipped for such a task. This is confirmed by posterity,  even if, for political and religious reasons, the spread and development of Jainism  during this time and in this part of India had its limitations.  

In the first four chapters of the Yogasastra, Hemacandra, like many of his pre decessors, structures what he perceives as Jain orthopraxy and orthodoxy into  three main categories or "jewels" (ratnatraya): correct faith (darsana), knowledge  (jnana), and conduct (caritra). These are also designated "yoga," a term that is  therefore synonymous with Jainism, which explains the title of the work: Yoga sastra or "Handbook on Jainism."  

The division of Jainism into three jewels is a reformulation of the doctrine of  a twofold dharma or teaching (dvidharma) that was known to Hemacandra and  shared by all Jains. Jainism, according to this doctrine, is founded on two basic  principles. The first consists of theoretical and practical instructions related to  activity (pravrtti), the second of similar instructions related to nonactivity (nivrtti).  Activity includes moral acts and rituals (karma), whereas nonactivity encompasses  intellectual and experiential cognition (jnana). Both posit faith (darsana) in the  teaching and in its principal communicators.  

The main components of Jainism - faith, knowledge, and conduct - comple mented each other and applied to mendicants as well as to the laity. Both groups  were subordinated to the same moral system, both were engaged in ritual activity,  and both sought knowledge through intellectual and contemplative means. The  difference between the doctrine and practice of these two main segments of the  Jain congregation (sangha) and their views on morals and rituals (karma), on the  one hand, and intellectual and experiential cognition (jnana), on the other, can  be analyzed in terms of emphasis, mode of expression, and purpose. They agreed  that no ritual or moral activity by itself could result in liberation (moksa), even if  the activity in question encompassed intellectual and meditative components. In  accordance with the law of karma, any activity whatsoever, moral or ritual, re 

sulted in rebirth, preceded at best by a heavenly existence. The ethical code  separated mendicants and laity in terms of the extent to which the moral vowsYOGASASTRA OF HEMACANDRA 597  

were to be observed. Yet the same ethics brought them together as a religious  group by excluding certain rituals, not least of which were those of what is known  as left-hand Tantra (yamacara). The most significant dividing line was, however,  related to the purpose of moral and ritual activity or, differently expressed, the  art of performing any act, moral or ritual. Whereas lay religion sought to improve  activity mainly by performing rituals and observing moral vows, and was hence  directed toward the first three objects of human activity (purusarthas) - duty  (dharma), wealth (artha), and desire (kama) - monastic religion sought to tran scend activity largely through advanced intellectual, ascetic, and meditative prac 

tices, thereby bringing the performer of ritual and moral activity in contact with  the agent of all activity, the Self (jiva). The monk or nun could then attain the  same moral, ritual, and cognitive perfection as that of the preeminent commu nicators of the Jain faith, the tirthankaras or Jinas.  

The above portrayal of Jainism in the form of three jewels (ratnatraya) or a  double teaching (dvidharma) is based on the first four chapters of the Yogasastra,  which in its turn draws on the Svetambara canonical scriptures (sruta) and the  exegetical tradition (sampradaya) down to the time of Hemacandra. The remaining  chapters of the Yogasastra contain information that gives a slightly different, or  rather, supplementary picture of mendicant doctrine and practice. This latter part  of the text reveals a Tantric influence of Trika Saiva provenance, which by the  time of Hemacandra had entered into mainstream Svetambara Jainism, as medi ated through the Digambara tradition. The relation between classical Jainism and  Tantra is stated in Yogasastra 1.5:  

Yoga [or the three jewels of Jainism] is [like] a sharp-edged axe for the tangle of  creepers of all calamities. It is a supernatural means for [attaining] the happiness of  liberation without [the use of] medical herbs (mula), spells (mantra) or Tantric [teach ings] (tantra).  

Accordingly, Tantra was regarded neither as an essential part of Jain theory nor  as the principal means for attaining liberation. As we shall see, however, it did  penetrate into mendicant divinatory and meditative practice, and promised mun dane as well as soteriological results. Above all else, Tantric influence manifested  itself in a general ritualization, using previously unknown methods and theories.  This emphasis on certain forms of ritual activity may itself be viewed as consti tuting a Tantric influence. Furthermore, and in parallel with the development of  Buddhist Tantra or Vajrayana, the laity was not alone in performing Tantra. Mem bers of the monastic community, including Hemacandra himself, embraced vari ous forms of Tantric practice. These included elements of ritual as well as exercises  of a more meditative, cognitive nature. As Paul Dundas has discussed, the ad herence to a strict ethical code and the absence of a linguistic theory of sacred,  mantric sound, combined with a pluralistic metaphysical philosophy, were factors  that ultimately hampered the general influence of Tantra on Jainism as compared  with the wide-ranging effects it had on Hinduism and Buddhism. As far as Sve tambara Jainism and its principal summa is concerned, the Yogasastra's first four 

598 OLLE QVARNSTRO M  

chapters, containing a description of classical Jain orthopraxy and orthodoxy,  received considerably wider circulation among Jains in India and later abroad  than did the remaining eight chapters, which were of a more Tantric bent. What ever the overall extent of Tantric influence on Svetambara Jainism may have been,  the Yogasastra seems not to have contributed appreciably toward the inclusion of  Tantra into that tradition.  

In the following, I provide two sets of examples illustrating Svetambara Jain  Tantra as it manifested in divinatory and meditative practices, respectively. They  consist of translated passages from the Yogasastra based on Jambuvijaya's critical  edition and furnished with additional information in square brackets from the  autocommentary, the Svopajnavrtti.  

The translated passages from the Yogasastra and the Svopajnavrtti are based on  Muni Jambuvijaya's critical edition, Yogasastram Svopajnavrttivibhusitam, 3 vols.  (Bombay: Jaina Sahitya Vikasa Mandala, 1977-1986). An English translation of  the Yogasastra will shortly be published by the present author under the title, The  Yogasastra of Hemacandra. A Twelfth-Century Handbook on Svetambara Jainism.

Selections from the Yogasastra and the Svopajnavrtti  

The first set of examples is drawn from the fifth chapter of the Yogasastra. This  chapter contains a description of breath control (pranayama) along with an in ventory of various divinatory practices.  

The definition of pranayama basically agrees with that of the classical com mentators on the Yogasutra, the principal textbook on yoga with which Hema candra was familiar and whose fundamental tenets most Indian religions acknowl edged. The use of seed syllables (bija mantras) and the adoption of Tantric  

physiognomy, including the theory of cakras or lotuses (padmas) and channels  (nadis), clearly demonstrate, however, a Tantric influence on the kind of breath  control used by Jain mendicants as an optional precondition to meditation. The  main purpose of controlling the breath was to improve physical health (kayarogya)  and thereby the capacity for intellectual and meditative cognition.  

The knowledge of the breath and its movement in the different parts of the  body was also part of mendicant divinatory practice. The main purpose of this  was to determine the time of death (kalajnana) and foretell future (negative)  events. The span of life could be prolonged thereby, its quality raised, and the  necessary preparations for death carried out fully and properly. This concern was  shared by all Indian religions and especially prevailed during the medieval period.  

The different forms of divination described in the Yogasastra are also mostly of  a pan-Indian character and include the observation of changes in the body  (angavidya), palmistry (samudra), interpretation of dreams (svapnasastra), animal  portents (sakuna), oracular voices (upasruti), and interrogation with the help of  astrology (prasna). Occasionally the divinatory methods are amalgated with Jain  doctrine in combination with Tantric practice. These include the inspection of  the month and number of days during which the breath blows in a certain channel  (nadi), reading of shadows (chaya) in combination with pictorial, geometric sym bols (yantras), potent words (mantras or vidyas) repeated in meditation and ritual,  the mental installation of seed mantras and letters of the Sanskrit syllabary (ma 

trkas) on various parts of the body (angas) through ritual touch (nyasa), and  interrogation with the help of Tantric physiognomy.  

The first example of divination is drawn from Yogasastra 5.173-76. It illustrates 

600 OLLE QVARNSTRO M  

how the time of death was determined by means of invoking a divinity (devata)  through muttering (japa) a spell (vidya) on a given celestial occurence.  

A [female] deity who has properly been made to descend into a mirror, a  thumb, a wall, [or] a sword through [the repetition of] a magical spell (vidya)  will inform [a person] of her decision as to [the time of] death on being ques tioned. The [deity] is realized by muttering the spell Aum naravire tha tha  10,008 times at [the occasion of] a solar or lunar eclipse. If [that spell] is to  be brought into play, one should once more mutter [it] 1,008 times. Then the  deity becomes absorbed into the mirror, and so forth, [and] announces [her]  decision [as to the time of death, in the form of] a virgin. Thus the deity herself,  attracted by the [moral] character of the virtuous worshiper, announces her  definite decision on the duration of life [of the questioner].  

The next example is derived from Yogasastra 5.208-15 and illustrates the use  of yantras, mantras, matrkas, ahganyasa, and shadow reading in measuring a  person's longevity.  

One should first prepare a [hexagonal] yantra that contains the sacred syllable  Aum and place within [that Aum] the name of the person [whose lifetime is to  be determined]. [Inside each] corner [of the yantra should be inscribed] the  letter ra, which is filled with hundreds of flames related to the fire [element].  At the sides, [the yantra should be] surrounded by six vowels, beginning with  a, together with an anusvara [i.e., am, am, im, im, urn, and urn]. On the outside  of every corner should be a svastika mark drawn with one's own handwriting.  [Finally], the four sides [of the square that frames the yantra] should be en 

veloped by a visarga [h] preceded by ya [yah]. [Then] one should [mentally]  install [the yantra] on [one's own] feet, heart, head, and joints. After that,  having turned [one's] back toward the sun at the time of sunrise, a wise man  should observe his own shadow in order to determine his own and another  person's lifetime. If he sees the whole shadow, then [there will be] no death  within a year, but if the ears are absent, death will occur within twelve years.  If the hands, fingers, shoulders, hair, flanks, and the nose are absent, it fore bodes death in the course of ten, eight, seven, five, three, and one year[s],  respectively. If the head or chin are missing, he will die in six months, whereas  if the neck or eyes are absent, [death will occur] in one month [or] eleven  days, [respectively]. If the thorax contains an aperture, death will occur in  seven days, [and] if one were to see two shadows, then one moves close to  Yama [or death].  

The final example of divination demonstrates how a spell is mentally installed  on the body (ariganyasa) in order to consecrate the body and its shadow. The  shadow is then examined and the time of death ascertained. The spell urges the  thunderbolt-handed (yajrapanin) Indra, who overcomes death, and the spear-

YOGASASTRA OF HEMACANDRA 601  

handed (sulapanin) Siva, to show their [true] nature, as propagators of Jainism.  According to Jain legend, a similar device was used by Hemacandra when he  brought Kumarapala to a Saiva temple and had Siva manifest himself in front of  the king and proclaim the superiority of the Jain faith. Yogasastra 5.217-23 reads  as follows.  

First one should [mentally] install the syllable sva on the crown of the head  (cuda) and Aum on the crest of the head (mastaka). Then [one should install]  ksi in the eyes, pa in the heart, and the syllable ha in the lotus of the navel.  Having consecrated one's shadow and eyes by [repeating] the spell [Aum jum  sah aum mrtyum jayaya aum vajrapanine sulapanine hara hara daha daha sva 

rupam darsaya darsaya hum phat] 108 times, [and] having turned [one's] back  toward the sun at sunrise, a competent person who has performed this [type  of] worship (puja) in a proper way should take notice of the shadow of another  when it concerns others' [length of life], and his own shadow when it comes  to his own. If the entire shadow is seen, then death [will] not [occur] in a year.  On the other hand, if the legs, shanks, or knees are missing, death [will occur]  within three, two, and one year[s], [respectively]. If the thighs are absent,  [death will occur] in ten months. If the waist [is missing] one will die within  eight or nine months, whereas if the stomach is absent, [death occurs] in five  months. Again, if the neck is lacking, one will die in four, three, two, or one  month[s]. If the armpit is lacking, [death will occur] in fifteen days, whereas  if the arm is nonexistent, [death will occur] in ten days. If the shoulder is  absent, [death will occur] in eight days, but if the heart is removed, [death will  occur] in twelve hours [or four yamas, "watches"]. However, if the head is  absent, [death will occur] in three hours [or one yama]. If, finally, the entire  [body] does not appear [in the shadow, death will occur] instantaneously.  

The second set of examples of Tantric influence on Svetambara Jainism con cerns meditative practices and, more specifically, virtuous meditation or dhar madhyana. According to canonical and traditional Svetambara Jainism, this kind  of meditation does not result in liberation (moksa), which requires the practice of  the subsequent pure meditation (sukladhyana). In the Yogasastra, however, dhar madhyana is furnished with an additional variety unattested in prior Svetambara  texts. Whereas the canonical form of virtuous meditation does not present any  Tantric influence, this new addition does reflect such an influence, which prob ably originated from Trika Saivism, and stems either from a direct influence or - and this is more likely - indirectly from a Digambara work, entitled the Jnanar nava, written by Subhacandra in the tenth century C.E. This philosopher was then  instrumental in introducing Tantric meditation into both Digambara and Svetam bara Jainism, and thereby also bringing Jain meditation into conformity with  parallel developments in Hinduism and Buddhism.  

Tantric virtuous meditation as presented in the Yogasastra consists of four main  types. We focus on the second of these, called padastha-dhyana, "meditation on 

602 OLLE QVARNSTRO M  

sacred syllables." If not meditated upon as such, these syllables constituted dif ferent spells. Unlike common Tantric linguistic usage, these spells were synony mously labeled mantras or vidyas. Here, Hemacandra deviated from the distinc tion between mantras as letters presided over by male deities and mastered by  

mere repitition, and vidyas as combination of words invoking female divinities  and mastered only through the practice of the prescribed rite (sadhana). The spells  ranged in length from monosyllabic to multisyllabic formulae, and reproduced  meaningless sounds, acronyms of central Jain concepts, and meaningful dogmas  couched in Prakrit rather than in Sanskrit, which was the dominant language of  Indian mantric science (mantrasastra). The spells further show distinct syntactical  features, as demonstrated by Agehananda Bharati. The application of spells in  meditation as well as in divination was criticized by early Jainism, but was grad ually incorporated into it, and had by the time of Hemacandra become one of the  main components of Svetambara Jain Tantra. Judging from the Yogasastra, it was  even looked upon as paramount over the rest of the Jain teaching, which was  reckoned as simply "textual details" (granthavistara). Hemacandra, however, urges  meditators to use only Jain mantras and to avoid those of Hindu provenance,  which were considered part of the "evil sciences" (durvidya). From a historical  point of view, however, Dundas has shown that many of the Jain mantras and  vidyas indicate that Jain involvement in mantrasastra often corresponded to that  of the Hindus. The efficacy of the spells resulted in everything from knowledge  of the scriptures to miraculous powers (siddhis or labdhis), heaven and liberation  (svargapavarga). The majority of spells found in the Yogasastra are variations of  the pancanamaskara mantra or "the reverent salutation to the five [supreme beings  (paramesthins)]." This served as a Jain litany and was used at various ceremonial  occasions. The mantra paid homage to the Jinas or the worthy ones (arahantas),  the perfected beings (siddhas), the mendicant leaders (ayanriyas), the mendicant  preceptors (uvajjhayas), and the mendicants (sahus).  

In the following, I attempt to give a few examples of how the various forms of  the pancanamaskara mantra were used as part of virtuous meditation or dhar madhyana. The first example illustrates how the eight syllables constituting the  first sentence of the pancanamaskara mantra are envisioned as stationed on the  eight petals of a lotus representing the Self (jiva). By intensive and prolonged  meditation on these syllables, with or without Aum, worldly and spiritual goals  are obtained. The mantra Aum is here used in a Jain fashion as an acronym  denoting the five holy beings worshiped in the Jain litany. The letter a signifies  the arahantas (the worthy ones), asariras (the Siddhas, "the perfected beings"),  and ayariyas (the [mendicant] leaders); u the uvajjhayas ([the mendicant] precep tors); and m the munis (that is, the sahus, "the mendicants"). Yogasastra 8.66-71  says as follows:  

One may [further] meditate on the luminous Self in an eight-petaled lotus  which on its petals has [the eight] syllables of the mantra, [na-mo a-ra-ham ta-nam], beginning with Aum respectively. Having installed the first [syllable 

YOGASASTRA OF HEMACANDRA 603  

on the petal] facing east from the circle, one should repeat [this] eight-lettered  mantra 1,100 times. In this manner, the other petals, pointing in due order  from the east, [should be installed with na-mo a-ra-ham-ta-nam, respectively].  The mendicant should [then] repeat [this mantra for] eight days in order to  neutralize all obstacles. When eight days have elapsed, these [eight] syllables,  installed successively on the petals, begin to look as if alive to him, and even  such terrifying beings as lions, elephants, demons (raksasas), evil spirits (vyan 

taras) and others, which [all] cause resistance in meditation, are instantly pac ified. Those who desire the fruits of this world should meditate on the mantra  [na-mo a-ra-ham-ta-nam] preceded by Aum, but those who are desirous of the  state of liberation should meditate on [this mantra] without Aum.  

The second passage constitutes yet another example of how an acronym is used  as an object of Jain Tantric meditation. Analogous to Aum, this acronym is com posed of the initial letters of the names of the five elevated beings celebrated in  the pancanamaskara mantra. The acronym reads a-si-a-u-sa and derives a from  arahanta, si from siddha, a from ayariya, u from uvajjhaya, and sa from sahu. The  different syllables are to be related to the cakras or lotuses positioned in the navel,  head, mouth, heart, and throat. Yogasastra 8.76-77 reads as follows:  

One should [also] meditate on the syllable a [from the mantra a-si-a-u-sa],  located in the lotus of the navel, the syllable si in the lotus of the head, the  syllable a in the lotus of the mouth, the syllable u in the lotus of the heart,  [and] the syllable sa in the lotus of the throat. Similarly one should meditate  on other seed [syllables] which are beneficial to all.  

The final example of Jaina Tantric meditation concerns the most central of all  spells based upon the pancanamaskara mantra, namely arham. This word is the  Sanskrit equivalent of the Prakrit arahanta, denoting the first category of supreme  beings. As the syllables constituting this mantra also are the first and last syllables  of the Sanskrit syllabary, it was the object of considerable speculation in medieval  Tantric texts. The autocommentary on Yogasastra 8.18-22 states, for example,  that "[arham], which begins with a and ends with ha has the letter r in the middle  together with a dot (that is, the character m), that is, the ultimate reality. He who  knows this is a knower of reality." The mantra arham was, however, primarily  used as an object of meditation.  

The following quote demonstrates how to meditate on the mantra arham. This  act is preceded by envisioning an eight-petaled lotus situated below the center of  the navel, comprising a pericarp with a line of vowels as well as petals with the  different classes of letters in the Sanskrit syllabary. The pancanamaskara mantra  is inscribed in all eight of the interstices between the petals, and the sacred syl 

lables Aum and hrim appear on top of each of the petals. Having meditated on  arham, one should imagine that one splits the various knots (granthis) or obstacles  related to the different cakras by means of this very subtle sound as it moves 

604 OLLE QVARNSTRO M  

through the middle path, the susumna channel. This and other additional prac tices finally result in one becoming all-seeing, free from attachment, aversion, and  delusion, worshiped by gods, and merged into the state of the supreme Self (par amatman). Yogasastra 8.8-9 explains this as follows:  

The first letter [of the syllabary, a], should be placed in front [of the lotus]  and the final letter [ha], at its center accompanied by [the letter] r - which is  spotless as snow - a pleasant crescent, and a dot (m). This holy word, arham,  which brings one in contact with the essence of life, [should first be uttered  in the mind] with a short [sound], then with a long, [then with a] protracted,  [then with a] subtle and [finally with an] excessively subtle sound. 

### 36 Cheating Death  

Michael Walter  

Death and dying are significant topics for all religions, including Buddhism. When  Tantra was the dominant form of Buddhism in both northern India and Tibet,  Buddhists displayed a voracious curiosity about this topic. Ritual and meditational  materials show a variety of methods for dealing with the process of decline and  death.  

Sometime before the year 1000, Tantric teachings that dealt with preparation  for death, cremation, and so forth, had been organized into cycles. One group is  a set of teachings by Atisa, an eleventh-century Buddhist master from Bengal, on  the goddess Tara, called the "Thirteen Spells." These teachings provide instruction  in recognizing and preparing for death, as well as in perpetuating the practice of  merit making, a process that allows a Buddhist to accrue merit for spiritual im 

provement and then selflessly to transfer that merit to beings who are not in a  position to obtain such merit. (Tara and the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara are Bud dhist deities who model and display selfless compassion to suffering sentient  beings, and thus are especially to be sought at times of physical danger and  distress.) Six of these teachings, including one entitled "Cheating Death" (mrtyu vancana in Sanskrit, 'Chi bslu in Tibetan) deal with the human lifespan, its length ening, decline, and end. The first teaching is an introduction to the significance  of the spells; the last is on the casting and distribution of tsha tshas, small, usually  circular pressed sacred images made in part from the ashes of the dead, which  are designed to generate merit continuously. By the fourteenth century, such ritual  instructions had attained great size, as exemplified by Karma Gling-pa's gatherings  in the Bar do thos grol cycles. The literal title of these texts, which teach people  how to avoid an evil rebirth, is "Release from the Intermediate State by Merely  Hearing These Teachings." Selections from this cycle have been studied and pub lished as "The Tibetan Book of the Dead"; in fact, the cycles total many hundreds  of pages in length. It is these cycles that include sections devoted to "cheating  death."  

In addition to eight texts on "cheating death" found in the Tantra commentary 

606 MICHAE L WALTER  

section of the Tibetan canon - all taught by or connected with Vagisvarakirti, a  predecessor of Atisa as abbot at the Nalanda monastery and the author of the text  studied here - various recipes, instructions, and rites, with accompanying anec dotal materials and fulsome praises, are also found embedded in medical, al chemical, and Tantric ritual materials. In addition, much supporting anecdotal  and mythological material is also found in histories of Tibetan Buddhist traditions,  biographies of yogins, and even general sketches of the development of Buddhism.  This is because "cheating death" helps one to continue exercising the vows of a  bodhisattva, a Buddhist who has taken a vow to aid suffering sentient beings to  achieve enlightenment.  

The goal of Mahayana Buddhism is enlightenment, with a view to universal  enlightenment: that is, to become enlightened, but to do so in order to help fill  the universe with other enlightened sentient beings who see existence as it is, and  who act selflessly and with compassion because they share the realization of the  Buddha about the nature of all things. The Mahayana view of the nature of things  is that samsara, the endless cycle of births that unenlightened sentients go  through, and nirvana, release from samsara, are ultimately mere concepts of the  unenlightened mind, and are empty of reality. They are, instead, of the nature of  Voidness (sunyata). Insight into the true nature of Voidness is achievable because  we have the Buddha nature within us, and there is a variety of ways in which  Mahayana Buddhist traditions teach its realization. The present text comes from  the Tantric tradition, which aims its followers at buddhahood itself, at realizing  the fully developed Buddha nature within us.  

Tantra, which has been practiced in Hinduism and Buddhism for centuries, is  a set of practices based on two principles. The first is that of subtle physiology.  The body exists on a series of vibrational levels, and our physical body is the  lowest of those levels. We also contain what might be called a subtle body, which  consists of channels through which flow our life energy and our consciousness,  the latter in what are described as "winds." To understand our true nature - the  goal of this yoga - we must gain control over the elements (water, air, fire, earth,  and "ether," that is, space) of which we are made, and the winds just described.  The cosmos is made up of these same elements, and the second principle states  that the structure and function of our subtle body parallels the greater structures  of the cosmos: the planets, stars, constellations, and so forth. This second prin ciple, sometimes referred to as a system of macrocosmic and microcosmic cor 

respondences, allows the yogin to escape human finitude by understanding how  both his individual body and the cosmos are ruled by the same processes.  In terms of dying, a yogin must know how to overcome his internal "time"  mechanism - what we call aging - by controlling it in the same way that Bud dhism and Hinduism believe that external time can be stopped: by stopping the  motion of the sun and moon. The yogin does this internally, in the present text,  by meditating on deities who represent the reality behind the internal sun and  moon, respectively: red Amitabha, the buddha of infinite light, and white Abhaya  Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. (Of course,CHEATIN G DEAT H 607  

people also die from accidents, and so on; such deaths are explained in this text  as death "coming from the gods.")  

The sun dries, burns, and robs beings of their energy. Thus, the yogin's "internal  sun" also causes the desiccation of his life force; at one point this text advises the  yogin to shield his nutritive moisture, called "ambrosia," from that sun, since we  are all born with this ambrosia and it has the potential to give us eternal life if  we protect it from our internal sun and open the body up to its flow. Similarly,  our ambrosia originates near the top of our skull, dripping from our internal  moon. Thus, the way Tantra visualizes internalized universal processes is by ori 

enting them around the body, especially in power centers aligned along the spinal  cord.  

Astrological correspondences are an important part of Tantra yoga. The spinal  cord is a "cosmic pillar" as well, perhaps (from an astrological point of view), as  the Milky Way, around which two "veins" representing the paths of the sun  (heating and drying) and the moon (cooling and moist) twine themselves. These  paths are actually the channels by which breath enters, in the yogin's practice,  through either the left or right nostril, and exits through the opposite nostril. The  breath thereby passes through both the solar and lunar paths, as well as through  the constellations, which are conceived to be located on the twelve "petals" of  that circle which, at the level of the heart, is usually conceived to be a lotus. When  the yogin controls the powers of the sun and moon, and then unites them, he  overcomes their grip on his life-breath and ambrosia, and takes in his grasp the  very process of time in the universe. This also provides the yogin with the ex perience of ultimate transcendence ("enlightenment," in Buddhist terms). Tantric  yogins with perfect practice do not, in fact, die, but pass into subtle bodies that  are eternal; the Knowledge Holders in Part Three below are one such group of  yogins.  

The yogin must calculate the time at which the sun passes through the twelve  houses of his zodiac; as the text shows, it has a set time for transiting, or crossing,  each of these; variations can affect the power or length of life of the yogin. The  yogin should also analyze both outer and inner astrological systems to understand  propitious and nonpropitious times for meditations, and so on, as well as personal  traits (such as susceptibility to illness, and preferred seasons and times of the day  to do things) and changes in his internal states. The yogin's universe becomes  divided into two-hour intervals (the six transits of both the sun and mooon  through the signs of the zodiac in a twenty-four-hour day) as well as time intervals  based on the control of the circulation of this breath. Through continual attention  to these processes, he escapes the control of the sun and signs of the zodiac, and  controls the winds that suppport his mind and consciousness.  

In fact, the ultimate reason why the yogin engages in this yoga is to purify his  consciousness; he uses his control over the heat of his inner sun to cleanse the  impurities in the winds that shape that consciousness. Unenlightened conscious ness is prevented from realizing its enlightened nature because of these impurities,  whereas through these practices they are gradually removed, if the yogin controls 

608 MICHAE L WALTER  

each inhalation and exhalation in what Buddhism calls a mindfulness yoga cen tered on the observation and regulation of breathing.  

Mention was made above of the Buddha nature within us; Buddhist Tantra  develops this through spiritual cultivation (sadhana). A repetition of the "seed"  syllable of a deity will actualize it and bring it clearly into the yogin's conscious ness, so that the deity will merge with the yogin, and become the true "self of  the yogin. This process is accompanied by yogic postures (asanas) and gestures  (mudras), and sometimes dance. This deity represents enlightened being, and the  consciousness of the yogin also becomes enlightened, through two stages of prac tice: these are the development and perfection of the presence of the deity, fol lowed by the dissolution of that deity, such that the yogin comes to realize the  Voidness (sunyata) from which all things - even Buddhas - emerge and back into  which they dissolve.  

It is partly because of the refined state of a yogin's consciousness through this  practice, and partly due to the homologous system described above, that dreams,  omens, and such as presented in the text here provide insight into the yogin's  physical and meditative states. Furthermore, Tantric "subtle physiology" provides  the link between an individual's meditative and visionary experiences and the  external signs that are meaningful for events transpiring in a yogin's practice.  

Buddhism does not depend solely on Tantra and its yogic practices to lengthen  life, or even to attain immortality. Elixirs based on organic ingredients, as well as  mercury- and sulphur-based compounds, are also used, as in Western alchemy.  Even Buddhist medical traditions contain compounds designed to lengthen life.  The effectiveness of many of these preparations rests either on the meditative  practices that accompany their creation or on the "empowering" of compounds  through a blessing by a master, such as when he blows on it. Power over life is  also attained by the yogin through sexual activity with an accomplished consort.  By retaining his semen, the yogin reverses the normal bodily processes; and, here,  as described in Part Three, special power comes from bodily fluids generated  during sexual union. Acts of devotion also have a place here: we see that building  and restoring stupas, circular structures that are circumambulated to gain merit  and show respect for the Buddha, are also means to achieve a longer life. (Stupas  have a central wooden pole, analogous to the spinal column and here called the  "life-tree pole," which is an auspicious object when viewed in a dream). In Part  Three, we see that simply contributing a robe to a monk creates sufficient merit  to hold death at bay.  

In addition, it is maintained in many sources that advanced yogins can create  elixirs or obtain other powers (as mentioned here, an enchanted sword and med icine for the eyes afford the yogin the power to see through matter and the ability  to travel long distances rapidly) as a routine benefit of advanced practices. These  are known as "accomplishments" (siddhis), which the yogin is eventually to dis card as he procedes to complete enlightenment, since to concentrate on them  would be a sign of the yogin's clinging to his ego rather than eradicating it totally.  Much of what has been presented here applies to both Hindu and Buddhist 

CHEATIN G DEAT H 609  

Tantra. The truly Buddhist elements in these teachings come out both in the  visualization of Buddhist spiritual beings, such as Amitabha (buddha of infinite  light), and Amrtakundalin (who represents the process of uniting the sun and  moon, and causing the ambrosia to flow), as well as in the centrality of Sunyata  and belief in the creation and transfer of merit.  

The selections below come from the most extensive teaching in the Tibetan  canon on "cheating" or "tricking" death. It was composed by Vagisvarakirti, and  must have been a standard Buddhist work on the subject - first in India, and  later, through Atisa, in Tibet - but one filled with uncertainties of interpretation,  since a second translation of this text, also found in the canon, is supplemented  with many interlinear notes. The material here is presented with some interpre tation from those notes and other commentaries. These teachings mix divinatory  practices, astrological guidance (most of the materials not included here were  detailed astrological calculations), and Tantric practices, in a set of indications of  death and how to avoid it, especially intended for yogins but also for lay Buddhists  in their analysis of dreams, visions, internal changes, and so on.  

The material presented here is a translation of excerpts from the Teaching on  Cheating Death ('Chi ba bslu ba'i man ngag in Tibetan, Mrtyuvancanopadesa in San skrit) by Vagisvarakirti, as found in The Tibetan Tripitaka, Bstan-hgyur, vol. 59,  pp. 103-110, and in the Sde-dge Bstan 'Gyur, Rgyud 'Grel, vol. 27, columns 236- 66, along with a few elucidations from various commentaries. This work is di vided into four parts: external signs of death; internal signs of death; instructions  for cheating death by external means; and instructions for internal means for  cheating death.

PART ONE  

[The work opens with an homage to Manjusri, the bodhisattva who bequeaths  wisdom, especially that connected with traditional sciences.]  

The Lord of Death manifests all variety of illusion; the answer to this is to  achieve power over old age and death. This teaching being difficult to grasp  by those of inferior intellect - whose minds vacillate - attaining power over  the Lord of Death and the signs of death, the texts on death, and their com 

mentaries, will be explained here.  

Total cheating of the Lord of Death is the realm of liberation itself; extending  for some short time the lives of all sentients is not being liberated. The ceasing  of life-duration, the senses, and the working of the mind is the characteristic  of death. Living on for some time through various means has been explained  to be "the cheating of death."  

Disciplining the senses through practicing the Dharma, one will live as long  as he wishes in samsara; for that long, one accumulates merit, and so on. Acting  so as to cultivate the thought of enlightenment, it will truly arise. So, not seeing  anything more dear than life in samsara, quickly and by many means one will  act habitually to deceive death. Applying means in the right way to this end,  it is not at all difficult to achieve. By the powers of precious stones, spells, and  medicines, a person realizes anything he wishes.  

Signs that death is approaching should be understood by any means neces sary. Although some develop the desire to know the signs of death, there may  also well be hesitation by others about such objects of knowledge, because  these latter are then in a state of well-being. However, when those people who  were well become controlled by painful states, passions, dimness of mind, and  so on, and as a consequence of the fear, suffering, and so on that arise from  those symptoms, signs of death will of course manifest themselves to those  people, as well.  

Through a division into outer and inner, it is intended that the signs of death  are to be analyzed as twofold, the upsetting of the gods and the upsetting of  the elements. Dying from the total upsetting of the gods is explained to be  "coming from the gods"; famine and so on, and lightning, hail, and so on, are  the signs of their being upset. Dying from the total upsetting of the elements  is explained to be "coming from the elements." When the elements are upset,  bile, and so on, and the fire and water elements, and so on, are damaged. When  both are upset, death is explained as "coming from both." When both are upset,  [there is] thunder, and so on, and bile, phlegm, and so on, are damaged.  

Although one may see signs of death at any time, at some times they show  that death is not coming; in an unerring way, they can be examined [by the  yogin] for impediments that damage one's practice of the Dharma. Likewise, 

CHEATIN G DEAT H 611  

any time that one does not see signs of death, even at some of those times  death will appear. At such times, in the lack of [appearance of] a fixed time  for death, it is not that there is a lack of signification concerning a fixed time  for one's death [that is, there are always signs, if one knows how to look for  them].  

When the yogin is permanently established in equanimity, with his mind  accordingly placed in one-pointedness by that practice, he should first closely  examine, briefly, the external signs.  

[What follows here is an excursus on searching for external signs of death.]  

The transiting of the sun, the fifteenth lunar day, and so on, may result in that  illness, and so on, suddenly becoming one's master.  

When the time of death is explained to be "certain," it is not certain only  insofar as there is a mistaken understanding of the signs of death. [For ex ample,] when the far side of one's left cheek shakes, that is a very strong  indicator of death. When one's inner winds and a feeling of cold rush together,  however, one must search elsewhere for any signs of death.  

Signs of death appear in the house of Cancer, in the middle summer month,  and in Capricorn, proceeding through the middle month of winter. On the day  of the sun's transit, in the middle month of summer, the measure of its foot  [that is, the angle of its rays] is at midday; when one looks to the north then,  the shadow there is the true nature [of his lifespan]. On the exact day of transit  in the middle winter month, there are seven measures to its foot; at noon of  that day, if the sky is clear, one should examine his shadow.  

For each month there is an increase of one foot, and [then] there is a decrease  of one. If anything other than this is seen, the yogin should truly fear death.  From the middle summer month until Capricorn, the sun's foot increases.  From Capricorn until Cancer, the sun's foot diminishes. From the middle sum 

mer month they increase in degrees; likewise, from the middle winter month  they decrease in stages. If one sees a change in his shadow [at those times],  one will truly die in one month. If there is an increase of one's shadow when  it should diminish, and a diminishing when it should increase, then, calculating  from that time, one will truly die in one month. If there is too much increase  [of one's shadow] at the time of increase, one will be harmed by various ill 

nesses. Likewise, if there is too much diminishment at the time of diminishing,  death will undoubtedly occur.  

At the end of the middle summer and winter months, timely and untimely  death are accurately calculated from the first six days each of Cancer and Pisces.  The twenty-four-hour days of the middle and last summer months and the  extra days of the middle and last winter months may be either good or bad for  calculating death.  

If someone feels a depression [in the flesh] somewhere between the inner most soles of the feet and the tip of the nose, then, truly, three days hence one  will die at once. At the time of defecating and urinating, if one is simultaneously 

612 MICHAEL WALTER  

seized by [a fit of] sneezing, then, from the moment of being seized, one will  age and die in one year. If one experiences a depression [in the flesh] at the  nape of the neck, after five days he will die. If one cannot see the tip of his  tongue, he will then die in three days.  

If one feels that something is continuously stinging the tip of the nose, he  will die in four months. If one imagines a depression in the spot between his  eyebrows, death is truly imminent. Whenever there is pain simultaneously in  both nostrils, one will die one month hence. For this reason, merit should be  gathered [during that month], cheating death [that is, lengthening this period].  

At night, while uniting the wind from both channels, if one sneezes during  and at the end of the session, one will die five months after equanimity of  meditation has been achieved.  

If one feels pain at the same time in the joints of the little fingers and toes,  death will come in one month's time. If pain occurs at the same time all the  way from the heart to the throat, and if one is not grounded in Dharma practice,  death will occur in half a month. If pain occurs at the same time on three of  one's palms and soles, then, even if one is equal [in strength] to Indra, he will  die in three days.  

Whoever cannot see his left eye in a mirror, and doesn't act to correct this  situation, he will truly die in seven days. When engaging in sex, if someone  doesn't hear a bell when it is rung, even though he is equal to Brahma, he will  die three months from that time.  

On the first day of the waxing moon, if one's semen is black, he will die in  six months; if red, he will be struck with an illness. If pain occurs between the  tip of the nose and the space between the eyes, or at the top of the head, death  is imminent and cannot be averted.  

If there is pain with fever, starting at the toes and going to the navel, one  will certainly die in six months. If there is pain from the toes to the heart,  throat, or even as far as the head, developing by degrees from half a month to  three month's time, one will be dead within one day.  

If one's heart suddenly sinks in the body, death will occur after two weeks.  If the two veins on the sides of the neck are cut, death will also occur in two  weeks.  

If a black spot suddenly appears in the middle of the tongue, then, gritting  one's teeth tightly, one will die in two days from that time.  If the veins behind, inside, and around the ears appear cut, if not on that  day, then in five days, one will die. If the red color of one's nails suddenly  disappears, and if one then doesn't practice mantra, and so on, he will die in  six months.  

If one is meditating and making a threatening gesture, and is suddenly dis turbed by fear and anger, then, to the extent that he is not grounded in the  Dharma, he will die in one or two years.  

Fluid dripping constantly from the eyes, causing one to be mistaken in what  one sees; not seeing one's shadow in water, or in a mirror; also, seeing rainbows 

CHEATIN G DEAT H 613  

at night or groups of stars in the daytime; seeing lightning in a clear sky in the  south, or the Milky Way in the daytime; likewise, seeing a star fall in the  daytime; and seeing geese, crows, and peacocks mixing together: after seeing  these, death will come in two months and two days.  

Likewise, seeing a glow around one's head; a gandharva city [gandharvas are  spirits who dwell in the air and live on scents] at the top of a tree or at the  base of a mountain, or seeing pretas (ghosts) and pisacas (ghouls) or other  fearsome beings; shaking violently; falling down again and again; seeing gold  and silver coloring in vomit, feces, and urine - one who sees each of these  things will die within a month.  

If semen, feces, and urine flow from the body at the same time, the per son who suffers that will die in one year; however, he can be healed by  medicines. Whoever has half his body hot while the other is cold, since  death will come after seven days, that person should begin thinking about  the world beyond.  

That yogin who experiences himself as filled with the letter ha, and whose  breath has become like fire, will see the Lord of Death after ten days. If one  sees a black spot at the base of the ring finger, then, at the end of eighteen  days, he will truly die. If a three-colored chameleon climbs onto someone's  head and then runs away quickly, that person will truly die after five months.  

If no sound comes from the yogin's body when he rubs it with his hands,  and all his limbs feel cold, he will die in ten days. If someone's calves and hands  suddenly twitch and move, and he lacks the thread of the twice-born [castes],  he will die after one or two years.  

When someone fills his mouth each day with water warmed while the sun  is hot, and then blows out his breath, he will see various rainbows that persist  in stages in the midst of that breath. Such people, who are generally very long lived, will fail to see that they have only six months to live.  

All these things are general knowledge; these particular points need to be  made:  

One will die in six months from a change in one's basic nature. If one cannot  see the tip of his nose, he will die in five months. If one becomes deaf, one will  die after four months. If the senses become dispersed and one falls off his seat,  he will die in three months. If one sees light between his eyebrows, he will see  Yama [the Hindu and Buddhist god of death, who gathers the spirits of the  dead in his house] in two months. If one's testicles shrink, he will die after  one month. If the yogin doesn't see his reflection in another's eyes, he will die  in two weeks. If someone can't move his tongue, he will die after ten days. If  one turns away from food, he will meet Yama after five days. If one feels a  pulling at his sides, he will die after three days. If one's whole body becomes  stiff, that person will die in one day.  

During the waxing or waning of the moon, if one's semen becomes black  and this isn't cured, he will die in six months. However, if someone completely  avoids doing things in the dark half of the month, and turns to doing things 

614 MICHAEL WALTER  

in the bright half, then, when the breath exits from the left nostril and enters  [the right nostril], he will be healed again.  

Although one's body may be firm, if his shadow is crooked, he will die in  four months.  

Those learned in such things have taught the following:  

If one sees his shadow going in the southern direction, he will die, it is said.  In such ways, one sees the signs of his perishability. Although such signs  have been explained [by some] to be meaningless, misleading, perverse, and  so on, even if all dreams were untrue, such a criticism would not apply to this  path, which involves a mind strengthened in faith through practice of the  repetition of spells. The gods [that is, the personal deities of yogins] teach in  dreams, and yogins who see the truth in dreams will develop faith in them and  then will look for signs of death in them.  

Whenever lac, kovidara (Bauhinia) or open karavira (Nerium indicum) flow ers appear at the end of a dream, that person will die in six months. When an  offering-lamp to whatever god, or [when] sand or a pile of ashes arises in a  dream, that person will also die in six months. If one heads off to the south,  riding a donkey [in a dream], and does not return, one again has six months  left [to live]. Whoever mounts a monkey and rides toward the south, if he  awakens while he is still there, he will die as above. If one dreams of climbing  up a long stick, the life-tree pole of a stupa, an anthill, or a heap of dust, he  will not live more than six months. Anyone bound [in a dream] by an angry,  black girl will die; she is called "The Mark of Time" and causes death after  seven days. The person who dreams of a woman wearing black clothing and  enjoying a black man, or who dreams of a garland of karavira, will go to the  place of Yama.  

If one dreams of a darkness, a wide-open place, or, likewise, being thrown  into prison; or, if one dreams of falling from a tree, that person will reside with  the Lord of Death. During sleep, if one sees a great tree, grass, or fruitless trees  on his head and body, he will not live beyond six months.  

A body rubbed with red aromatics, ornamented with a red rosary, or smeared  with sesame is to be much feared. Likewise, cutting off of hair, wearing red,  riding an ass, or a person heading quickly to the south - if someone sees such  [visions] as these in a dream, he will die in six months. Incense with a red  rosary, or red clothing - if these are [seen] in someone's dreams, he will die  in eight months.  

The externals of death are beyond number. Since these have been made  known, a yogin should quickly strive to cheat death through spells, and so on,  when he experiences these signs.  

PART TWO  

Now will be discussed clearly the internal signs of death, which are understood  from the appearance of the vital wind. The mouth and the nose are the spheres  of action of the wind. 

CHEATIN G DEAT H 615  

To whatever extent one does not understand well and truly the internal  signs, to that same extent the reality of death will not be truly comprehended  in its external signs.  

The certainty we can have about death is twofold: [Its time] having been  established with certainty, [the signs] can then be explained completely.  If a person, upon reflection, makes an accurate analysis of one twenty-four hour day in some appropriate way, then, calculating from that day, he will  know how much time will elapse until he will die. [This is because] the life force possessed by ordinary sentient beings wanders constantly and in all of  them [in the form of] the vital wind that is based for each of them in their  right and left nostrils. Those [paths] that we call "sun" and "moon" are that  wind, [which] circulates every ninety minutes. The wise yogin will analyze the  wind, since death, and so on, result from a deviation from this regularity.  When death is coming in six months, one should practice mindfulness of  the Dharma. When the order of the wind is disturbed in the last month, friends  and relatives will become troubled. In the last two weeks, because one's mind  has become deranged, the illness will appear to be intolerable. When the mo tion of the wind has been disturbed during the last one, three, four, five, or  six days, contention and quarreling will appear. When the natural state [of the  wind's movements] has been lost, and it moves along the three paths to try to  gain perception, there is no power to become healthy again, and one will die  after half a day has passed.  

[Using the movement of the vital wind to calculate death:]  

Calculating from the time of the sun's transiting in the first month of winter,  if the wind travels five days in the sun, one will die eighteen years after that  time. Calculating from the time of the sun's transiting in the middle fall month,  if the wind travels [in the sun's path] for a period of five days, one will die  after fifteen years. Carrying out the same calculation from the last month of  summer, one will die after twelve years; from the first summer month, one will  die after nine years. Calculating from the time of the transiting of the middle  spring month, if the wind travels [in the sun's path] for five days at that time,  one will die after six years; from the middle winter month, after three years.  

Perceptions about the inner wind and all the paths of the sun should be  examined by learned ones for either timely or untimely death.  Whenever the wind, traveling [through] the body, suddenly enters another  path and so, at that time, quickly exhausts one's life-force, there will no doubt  be death at that time.  

If the yogin perceives his wind to be in the sun [path, that is, the right  nostril], and it travels for half a solar day at the time that the sun is at its  maximum distance from the horizon, it should be understood that he will die  fourteen years after that time. If, for one solar day, a day and night, two twenty 

four-hour days, or three, or four [days], the wind travels on the sun path, one  will die within twelve years. If it travels in such a way through five, ten, or 

616 MICHAE L WALTE R  

fifteen twenty-four-hour days, then, one will die in three, two, or one years,  respectively.  

Likewise, if it travels there for twenty or twenty-five twenty-four-hour days,  then one will die in six or three months. If it travels there for twenty-six,  twenty-seven, twenty-eight, or twenty-nine such days, then one will die in two  months, one month, one-half month, or ten days. If it travels there for thirty,  thirty-one, or thirty-two such days, then one will die after three, or two, or one  day(s), respectively. When the wind travels the sun path for thirty-three days,  one will die that very day; even if one is Visnu, without a doubt.  

This is the appearance of the signification of death.  

Developments regarding the vital wind are to be known through the senses.  There are no indicators more important than the senses.  

I have thus explained the inner signs of death, otherwise known as "omens  of death." Having made those signs known to himself, the yogin should there fore strive to cheat death through meditative concentration, and so on, as  quickly as possible.  

PART THREE  

Having made known to the yogin the collection of omens of death relating to  both the outer and inner signs, I will now make known a condensed set of  indications for cheating death that relates to both sets of signs.  

Because of the workings of body and speech, internal cheating is accom plished through the action of meditative concentration. External cheating  through wealth, spells, and medicines becomes internal as well through the  power of yoga.  

Faith makes possible one's efforts to cheat the Lord of Death, so one should  make oneself firm in faith. Otherwise, even if a yogin tires himself from practice  through body and speech [that is, postures and chanting], no benefit will result.  Indeed, the faithless god Indra will not find any subtle Dharma with his hoards  of wealth for his bodily sufferings. Faith is the most subtle Dharma; it is the  release to Paradise [in the use of] ascetic practice, fire offerings, and wisdom.  Faith is the basis for success in all these methods. One may have wealth, life,  everything - such things mean nothing if one has no faith. Even though there  seems to be some small result due to one's wealth and so on, nothing will  ultimately be accomplished if one has no faith.  

Acting to protect oneself from death by means of the Dharma [that is, by  studying the teachings of the Buddha] has been explained to be "cheating  death." By delighting in irreligiosity and by being heedless, a person behaves  as if he would not remain in this life for even an instant. Even though one  were Brahma, when there is no Dharma practice there is no power to cheat the  Lord of Death. The Dharma of the Holy Ones is true; they delight in giving,  and in enduring ascetic practices. They have the highest love for all - what do  they need from the many other teachings? When one's heart drips with com-CHEATING DEATH 617  

passion for sentients at all times (and because the Dharma is a liberating wis dom), what does one need from the many other teachings? Human life is  asserted in all religious and philosophical systems to be the most excellent of  the elements of existence; if one studies that constantly, he will gradually in crease his distance from the Lord of Death.  

If one eschews nonvirtuous acts, takes the Three Vows for refuge [that is,  the vow to be a lay supporter of Buddhism, the vow of an ordained monk, and  the vow of a Tantric yogin], and keeps the temporary vows or the vows of a  layperson as his Buddhist practice, his distance from the Lord of Death will be  lengthened.  

People are afraid of such things as being thrown into prison or struck [down]  by a great disease; if they are protected from such dangers, their lives are truly  lengthened, and the Lord of Death is cheated. In the devotion that the lowly  and the lordless have in accepting the wonderful moral teachings of the Bud 

dha, they realize the goals of their desires, and their lifetimes truly increase.  By understanding one's father, mother, and elder guru, one has reverence for  the aged, and so on; when one bestows offerings and honor upon them, the  Lord of Death will not approach them. One should likewise revere one's per 

sonal deity. The life [span] of the yogin is increased when, with equal devotion  in undertaking ascetic practices for that being, he constantly and faithfully pays  inward obeisance to it.  

If one repairs cracked or broken stupas with bricks, and so on, a short life  will be lengthened, and this will create the same merit as that of giving alms  to a monk. Life is perpetually extended by creating temples, images, stupas,  and so on, by establishing pleasure groves, and by offerings, and so on, at the  eight great stupas. If one offers feasts, with supplies collected by supplication,  to the sangha, then, after seven days, one will acquire power over a long life  equal to that of Dharmaraja Asoka [a Buddhist "King of Dharma" who ruled  India in the third century B.C.E.].  

When one creates stupas of sand, and casts tsha tshas in the same way, and  then pays homage to those stupas and tsha tshas, the length of one's life will  truly be extended.  

In reading the Mahasamaya (the Sutra on the Teachings of the Great Bodhi sattva Vow) [and other sutras], if someone intones them with reverence, long  life will be achieved and the Lord of Death will be cheated. Likewise, if one  reads all of the Yoga Tantras, and so on, taught by the Buddha, or through the  rites taught in the five texts of protective spells known as the Pancaraksa, one  will come to cheat the Lord of Death. Likewise, by making circumambulations  of such a stupa as that which is constructed with a top-knot, or causing the  recitation of spells, one counters the efforts of the Lord of Death.  

The wise ones who practice such methods cause death and the sun to dwell  far from them. Likewise, drawing mandalas and making fire offerings, mudras,  strewn offerings, and food offerings to yogins will also cheat the Lord of Death.  When one offers food, drink, and bedding, or even merely a robe, for the 

618 MICHAE L WALTER  

possession of the Arya Sanghas [the monks and nuns of the Buddhist com munity] of the four directions, one cheats the Lord of Death.  Undertaking such actions that should be done is the signifier of Dharma and  merit. Through merit, life is extended and, accordingly, the Lord of Death is  cheated. In the same way, even considering increasing the teaching of the  Dharma by a small amount has been taught by the learned to cheat the Lord  of Death.  

Making efforts such as these at practicing the Dharma causes immediate  confidence in spells of accomplishment, medicines, and other matters that  completely clear away the Lord of Death. When one apprehends that the Lord  of Death [can be] kept away from our world by the power of spells of wealth,  medicines of accomplishment, and medical elixirs, one also realizes [the state  of being of a] Knowledge Holder.  

If a yogin understands all the texts there are on testing jewels, then that  learned one will find himself in the possession of a jewel for realizing any wish,  and will even be fit to hold the Jewel of Life of Vajradhara, which is just the  same as the jewel for realizing all of one's wishes. Because these teachings can  bring one precious sapphires as well as other great jewels, there is no doubt  that all the Lords of Death will be repulsed. For these reasons, one should not  raise doubts about the power of such jewels; everyone wishes to have a jewel  with inconceivable powers.  

If one makes offerings in a desolate place before a figure of one's personal  god on cotton cloth, and so on, then, by merely reciting the proper spells, the  cheating of death will come about.  

[An example of this follows:]  

If a yogin repeats this spell 100,000 times, with faith, to Lokesvara, for that  one to truly appear before him, [then] death will truly be cheated. First, say  vairocana; after that, say tare three times; then tuttare and ture two times each;  finishing with svaha - death will be deceived. As it is said in the Tarabhava 

tantra [the "Tantra on the Arising of Tara"]: "When one recites this spell  100,000 times before the eyes of Tara, with curds and honey placed before her,  and with a sprout of durva grass to the east and a fire offering showing its  flames to the north, then the yogin will truly cause death, which has sprung  from the totality of former actions, to be averted."  

One would really do things just this way.  

The spell that is the heart of the Arya Pratisara is the bestower of all magical  powers. One should recite the ten letters of this secret spell, called "Victor over  Death," 100,000 times in the presence of Lokesvara. After that, offer 100,000  fire offerings with white flowers lifted up and cast into melted butter as a means  of pacification for bringing down Avalokitesvara. Following this, by the power  of this spell, the deceiving of the Lord of Death will truly occur: First, say om,  then am; after that, om and am again; then, om mrtyun ja ya ("victory over  death"), and after that, again, om - these are the ten syllables of that spell. This 

CHEATING DEATH 61 9  

was taught by the tathagatas [buddhas] for living a kalpa [the duration of a  universe] or longer.  

Along with the rites explained by those who know, and other preparations  the yogin may wish to use, he should [also] combine medicines [derived from]  Sophora flavescens and urine for regions with great hunger. Sophora flavescens  should always be used either by itself or together with the three myrobalans.  After that, one's body will become firm and he will not see the gate of Yama.  Although there are other such medicines of realization, when one has true faith  in any of them, one's life is extended and one does not see death, because the  power that illness and old age hold over him has come to an end.  

If one eats mercury with gold and silver in it, prepared according to the  correct ritual, it will possess the nature of a medical elixir, and will cheat death.  After a day, or about a month or so, when it has overcome the [mortal] con dition of the body, then, one will, by the rite of administering it as a medicine  through the nose, come to deceive death.  

Some who have died in a number of ways can be seen to live again. One  example [of a method for achieving this] would be that of a man, or of a woman  having her menses: their blood and other bodily elements, which have become  mixed when they emerge in the course of their mutual exchange, are not con 

nected strongly together. Extract two drops of such blood immediately upon  the death of someone. These two drops will be released via a small, hollow  cylinder smeared with butter, so as to be injected into the nostrils. When one  drop emerges from a nostril, it should be rolled into the other. This is done,  in turn, for each nostril. It has been seen that people become alive again in this  way, so this is a recommended procedure for stopping death in this life.  

An indestructible [literally, vajra, "diamond"] body possesses a pleasing  form. When one attains through it a lifetime matching the years in kalpa, such  is truly a turning back of death.  

Some urines protect the body when magically realized according to the rele vant teachings. They will cheat death immediately when drunk or rubbed on  [the body]. Someone who habituates himself to the constant practice of such  teachings, along with the correct use of butter and honey, will cause both  timely and untimely death to be averted.  

It is not proper to cast doubt on the power of such medicines; their potency  appears, in a manner that is inconceivable, everywhere. There is a direct rela tionship between the reverence one shows these teachings in his external re ligious actions and the extent to which one can cheat the Lord of Death in this  life. There is a great degree of fear attached to death, which has great power;  accordingly, there are inner religious actions given here for that fear.  

PART FOUR  

Now, with regard to cheating death:  

Death is explained to be truly cheated when some learned one possessing  inner greatness exerts himself. Such a person is fearless before a king, a thief, 

620 MICHAE L WALTER  

a great mara [there are four maras: these are beings who attempt to seduce  bodhisattvas and yogins into attachment to the world], a tiger, and so on. He  is a mountain, or something like that, free from human bustle, abiding by  himself, wherever it pleases him. Eating-moderately and speaking little, he finds  no pleasure in a strong desire for things. Much of the time, he remains in  meditation and sleeps little, exerting himself greatly in the repetition of spells.  The action of making offerings to a personal deity, and so on, of reading holy  texts, casting strewn offerings, and so on, are efforts he makes with a compas sionate mind for sentient beings of the past, present, and future.  

He realizes what he wishes for through his merit; to accumulate merit, he  must avoid distractions. Because everything is realized through faith, he works  to increase his faith. Through diligence, what one begins is finished; therefore,  he makes diligence a preliminary practice. Because wished-for results can be  assured through meditation, he makes one-pointed effort in that [meditation].  By avoiding distractions, he develops his practice; thus, he diligently avoids  [distractions]. Since everything can be achieved by means of perfect knowl edge, he possesses all knowledge through his great faith and diligence. Because  he sees that suffering arises in the act of dying, he also sees that Dharma  originates from the act of living. Free of all doubt, he practices at all times the  cheating of death through veneration of Amrtakundalin.  

[Now follows the invocation of Amrtakundalin, which opens thus:]  

For that cheating, there are first 100,000 recitations of a spell that, performed  through meditation, is an enemy of obstacles. When it is properly recited, and  when one has made 10,000 fire offerings during this recitation, all obstacles  are repelled.  

These spells remove all maras and obstacles; the yogin who wishes to practice  fearlessly in this way will meditate day and night while reciting them. Residing  in the abode of Ghanavyuha [a Buddhist paradise], he acts as a buddha again  and again through peaceful means. Atop a lotus-moon seat, in a squatting  posture and with a mudra that represents the highest thought of enlighten 

ment, he emanates clusters of white light. While the yogin is meditating in this  way on White Vairocana [a buddha who, although a solar deity, originates  from the lunar center], it is not deserving that he should die and return to the  cycle of birth and death.  

Meditating on Aksobhya [a buddha associated with winter and the sun] and  the other tathagatas, with their colors and mudras, when the yogin bases him self in their divine pride, his body will truly become indestructible. When the  yogin then resides in the union of the sun and moon, there is white Abhaya  Lokesvara, peaceful like the moon and decked out with all possible ornaments,  and red-bodied Amitabha, holding all the marks of complete buddhahood, atop  [his] two lotus feet in a squatting posture. When this lord of yogins centers  his mind on ever more subtle forms of Lokesvara, the Lord of Death himself 

CHEATIN G DEAT H 621  

will die, and illnesses born for the skandhas [the aggregates from which we  construct our illusion of a self] will be destroyed.  

Chant this spell of ten syllables with a mind unwearied by other practices:  Having established first Om, join tare to it immediately; then, tuttare ture; svaha  completes it. Brahma, Siva, Visnu, the Sun, the Moon, the rudras [a group of  spirits who represent storms and wind], dikpalas [the guardians of the direc 

tions], and even Kamadeva [the god of sensual love] - will all conquer death  in this way, [even] as the Lord of Death himself had [done], without so much  as damaging the tips of one of their hairs. White hair, wrinkles, pernicious  conditions, illness, and poverty - all will disappear. The eight great fearful  things - such as fear of a lion, and so on - as well as entire aggregates of  miseries, will be destroyed. Food and drink, clothing, and so on, will be ob 

tained without the effort of gathering them. Magical powers, such as the en chanted sword, eye medicine, quick-foot salve, the good vessel for all wishes,  and others; having a skillful mind; knowing how to speak in verse; immaculate,  unique insight; and other desired magical powers as well - all will arise from  this circle of magic syllables. This is taught in the Cakrasamvaratantra [a teach ing on Heruka, a form of the buddha Aksobhya]:  

Meditate on the form of Heruka [a form of Aksobhya who frightens away  evil spirits and helps yogins]. Having accomplished this, when one has really  become him, meditate on the form of a skull, on a skeleton, or on the form of  an ascetic's staff. Since it is wrong to kill a yogin, death will not come to him.  

All the parts of a yogin will be satiated by drops of ambrosia dripping, in  the form of the moon, at the top of the head, which then appear from all the  pores of his body.  

Completely avoiding all distractions, the yogin should meditate in this man ner for six months; having thereby conquered all illnesses, he will conquer  death, even in the form of the Lord of Death.  

Likewise, practicing mindfulness meditation on inhalation and exhalation  of the breath itself, the yogin should direct his efforts toward other divisions  of the respiratory process. Being certain about the increasing number of  breaths, the yogin will become ageless and deathless. The breath of sentient  beings travels [is breathed in and out] over 21,600 times in the course of a day  and night: the number of these breaths should be called aloud. Because the  syllable by which we bring the deity into our consciousness is the source of  ambrosia, that syllable is repeated each time the wind enters the yogin. And,  since ambrosia is the means by which we remain alive, when one is mindful  of these breathings [in and out], death will not find a hold in his body.  

One should number the breaths that enter the body. According to one  method, [when one is] in one-pointed concentration one counts the breaths  that enter the body up to 100,000 or another [higher] number, in increments.  It is taught that this should be a silent recitation. When one finishes counting  [by] using such a method, he will theft certainly live another five years, even  if his life span has been diminished [for some special reason]. If one repeats 

622 MICHAE L WALTER  

that recitation 200,000 times, and so on, the extension of his liftime will then  be multiplied. Becoming learned in the means for doing this, the yogin should  strive in the recitation of his breaths. [By] enumerating the breaths constantly  and correctly 1,000 times in their inner, rising, one is freed from all illness and  will live as long as the sun and moon remain [in the sky].  

Since the yogin enjoys nothing other than adhering to these teachings, he  will strive not to sleep for even a moment until he has conquered sleep; then,  he will do the same for food, drink, and so on. Because the yogin makes the  travels of the wind manifest in his body, the yogin who strives, in an appro 

priate manner, to attend to its movements will truly conquer death. If he de parts from this but once, for some pleasure, because his mind has become  obscured, he will die because his means have become inappropriate. The  yogin's own body shall become an appropriate means; if the yogin turns away  from that means, his methods will not be appropriate [for realizing his goal].  

One can obstruct the wind by binding it with the "Gesture of the Lion's Play"  [the gesture used by the Buddha to show the fearlessness his teachings instill].  In other words, by conquering death through blocking the wind, the yogin  creates "the cheating of death by obstruction." The yogin should fill up his  body, in stages, with wind, all the way to the bottom of his feet, and then hold  it; this is called "the pot" (kumbhaka). When breath-holding is divided into  small and middling, and so on, it is to assert that there are three sorts of  stoppage of the upper wind. What is called "stopping the upper wind" is ex plained as follows to make its meaning clear: The small [breath-holding] is  thirty-six units in measure; the middling is two times that; the great, three  times. Through such holdings, the yogin becomes victorious over death. When  the yogin has filled himself with breath from this stoppage, he will then lightly  rest his hands on his kneecaps and snap his hand six times, and then begin  the practice again.  

Further, if the yogin suspends his wind for a long period, and examines its  nature constantly during that time, he will render himself victorious over  death, mara, and other enemies. All evils being completely pacified, all virtues  will then spring up in their place. A yogin who is victorious by such methods  will realize his most fervently desired things.  

When one does not meditate on meditation or the lack of meditation, sun yata is realized. The wise one, not meditating on existents, and not meditating  on the absence of existents, completely abandons both. Such meditation is free  of meditating. When a yogin meditates continually on "the sunyata that com pletely avoids grasping," he becomes invisible to the Lord of Death. The dying  that comes from the merest discursive thought will also not see him; indeed,  the many maras and their retinues, and others, will not see him.  

As it has been taught, "This discursive perception known as 'dying,' which  has no place in any existents, is overcome by the miraculously transformed  perception of ordinary beings [that is, through yogic practice]. All the suffer ings of discursive perception are explained as 'the mara of perception.' Over-

CHEATIN G DEAT H 623  

coming mistaken perception by that understanding, the yogin acts in a state  of nonperceptivity."  

Meditating constantly [on the yogin's personal deity], with special emphasis  on reverence based in faith, and so on, the yogin is comfortable in whatever  arises [in meditation] - that this and that are becoming clear, and that, for  example, desire and misery are manifestations of the mind. Treatises are hard  to find wherein these practices are easy to achieve; it is not hard to find these  practices, however, in the world of those who know them. Being skilled in such  practices, and truly established in [the perfections of] patience and heroism,  the yogin who knows how to strive in constructive meditation is a fit vessel  for cheating death.  

Using butter, the heart of a person who has died in old age, and other items,  the yogin uses butter lamps and such for acts of destruction; again, by using  materials such as grain and butter offerings, he will abide [in his body] for the  duration of a kalpa. The same applies to dying from old age in this body: why  shouldn't one live to the end of this kalpa if he has procured these teachings  of realization? Old houses, for example, will stand a long time through main 

tenance, so why shouldn't the bodies of the elderly also endure for a long time  through maintenance?  

There is nothing difficult to achieve through effort; so, do not shirk in your  effort for something that is precious. In time, even slabs of stone are perforated  by the gentle, constant fall of water; fire comes from rubbing sticks together;  water rises out of the earth when it is ploughed. If someone takes pains, there  will certainly be realization. Realized through effort, and correctly, one will  have all results he strives for.  

Human beings in the mouth of the Lord of Death are like boats in the mouth  of a sea monster; if their religious actions are not perfect, they will fall into the  waves of his realm. In a like way, any means of cheating death is taught to be  an enemy of the Lord of Death. A yogin should cultivate the work of meditation  that is realized on the basis of benefiting oneself and others. He should put his  effort into means that will free people from the fear of dying without being  loved. For this reason, there is nothing more pleasing than life.  

When the yogin will have endeavored [to gain understanding] in the texts  on these teachings, and will have understood them, the complete deception  of the Lord of Death will have been explained, with loving care, for future  generations.
