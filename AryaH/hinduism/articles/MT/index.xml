A recent post on the TL brought to mind a curious phenomenon that seems to be one of the factors that draw people into certain bābāisms: the production of apports. This caught my attention early on because I noticed that several votaries claimed to have received bābāistic apports. I have heard of three unrelated bābājī-s (one of them more of a low-profile vaiṣṇava &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;magician&amp;rsquo;&#39;) producing apports.
Shortly thereafter I first saw one such apport, I saw demo by a vaṅgīya magician Sarkar on TV where he produced an apport explicitly as a magic trick.</description>
