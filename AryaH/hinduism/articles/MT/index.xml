      <description>Source: here.
One thing many fellow traditional Hindus have found frustrating about me is my lack knowledge and lack of affinity for the advaita stream of vedanta, and more fundamentally me being a svatantra. My blasphemous views regarding vedas and their apauruSheyatva are also hardly appreciated in their midst. I am not shaken by their views because I am pretty firm in my convictions on these matters arising from ongoing study of the originals, and yAj~navalya always stands out as beacon.</description>

      <description>Good points. Agree with the proposal that most H are not equipped. Anecdotally speaking I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the same &amp;ndash; a certain H fragility &amp;ndash; a newly half-educate H who might &amp;rsquo;ve picked up a tome or 2 of Dick Dawkins &amp;amp; suddenly see himself as possessing a deep insight which obviates the the need for religion. Regurgitating Dick or someone like that he would bellow on to those who might listen or not how meaningless &amp;amp; useless religion is.</description>
