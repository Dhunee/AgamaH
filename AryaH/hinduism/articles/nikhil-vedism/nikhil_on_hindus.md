I have never seen any religion of people as totally and profoundly unconcerned with the Truth as Hindus, orthodox or modern.  Even literal Muslims are more honest than the average Hindu. My hatred for them swells day by day. Lying is part of the moral code of the modern Hindu; they have no shame or innate feeling of guilt in uttering untruth.

Fundamentally, over the past two years I have realized that Hindus as a body are not my "brothers in religion" or "co-religionists".  Hinduism is not a religion but a group of disparate, wildly contradictory religions; and I have less in common with certain types of modern Hindus than I do with Muslims. If there were ever any objections to Vedism that were actually true, I would not convert to another type of Hinduism but I would become some sort of religionless person.

## Anti-trad
Trad Hindus of course must oppose what I'm doing, because Vedism would repræsent an existential threat to their authority if it became more widely practiced.  If Hindus began respecting the value of Truth, they would realize that there's literally no reason to follow any of the contradictory post-Vedic traditions, and that they have been (characteristically) lied to by power-hungry Hindus like that guy for millennia, and the Hindu synthesis would break down.  This is why his kind react so aggressively to Vedism, and call us "adulteresses" and "incels". Whether or not we acknowledge it or like it, trad ideology is an existential enemy of Vedism.

The only problem is that non-Vedists benefit from my work, too.  I don't want to help orthodox Hindus, since they regard me as their enemy and a "crackpot conspiracy theorist".

You should remember that, despite the mutual animosity, you share some common interests with trad and moderns; and furthermore you owe the "trad" ones a debt of gratitude for preserving the scripture you're obsessed about. Gratitude being a vedist good, it would not be out of place to return some favors; not to mention making common cause against "moderns" and mlechCha-s.  (Roughly same dynamic as AryasamAj)

Also BTW, some traditional minded people do admire your work and wish it well (considering the alternatives).
