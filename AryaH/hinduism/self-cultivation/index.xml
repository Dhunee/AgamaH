      <description>Hindu self-cultivation gives one joy, satisfaction, and strength to follow and achieve the various goals of life(puruShArtha), including dharma. This includes attainment of mystic &amp;ldquo;highs&amp;rdquo; as a matter of course. With spiritual practices and saMskAra-s, a hindu gets both intellectual and emotional appreciation for his place in the world-tree.
Anti-self-pity Contrary to some memetic epidemics which focus on grievance studies and victimhood, the hindu way focuses on positivity - always encouraging the urge to pull oneself up.</description>
