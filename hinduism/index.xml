      <description>Union and protection  The protective umbrella of hinduism can resist and push back rabid memes [Eg. Indonesian dayaks - NYT].  Fitness qualification  In its hard classical form, it meets this important qualification: One should never have alleigence to an ideology that reduces one&amp;rsquo;s (overall: individual/ group) fitness (in the biological sense).  Vaccination against bad dogma  A person or society not vaccinated with Chicken Pox is susceptible to Small Pox.</description>

      <description>Source of the problem  Hinduism is not a single fully consistent theological system. Rather, it is a set of coexisting systems which acknowledge each others&#39; deities and lore in various ways. Conceptually, but not at a social/ higher level, it is wrong to bring Hinduism to the level of Christianity/ Islam etc..  Abrahamist diseases more easily map to subclasses of Hindu darshana-s  A view / darshana in the hindu context talks about these 5 issues: 1] jagat (world) 2] jIva (the individual) 3] Ishvara (God) 4] bandha (bondage) 5] moxa (liberation).</description>

      <title>Self cultivation</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/AgamaH/hinduism/self-cultivation/</link>

      <description>The goal Hindu self-cultivation gives one joy, satisfaction, and strength to follow and achieve the various goals of life(puruShArtha), including dharma. This includes attainment of mystic &amp;ldquo;highs&amp;rdquo; as a matter of course. With spiritual practices and saMskAra-s, a hindu gets both intellectual and emotional appreciation for his place in the world-tree.
Anti-self-pity Contrary to some memetic epidemics which focus on grievance studies and victimhood, the hindu way focuses on positivity - always encouraging the urge to pull oneself up.</description>
