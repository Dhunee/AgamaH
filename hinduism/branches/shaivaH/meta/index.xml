The Siddhānta is still very much dominant in TN. But yes, it did not spread much outside TN. Even Umāpati Śivācārya did not propagate it outside TN. The decline of the Siddhānta has two historical phases:
   It was once very dominant in Kāśmīra, Madhyapradeśa, Gauḍa &amp;amp; Utkala deśa-s. By 1000s-1100s, it was rapidly shrinking to the area of the southern states.    Post 1200s: We have evidence suggesting that the Siddhāntāgamas &amp;amp; Aṣṭaprakaraṇas (Siddhānta proper) were well known even in Karṇāṭaka though it was getting immensely diluted in Kērala.</description>

      <description>In the Śaiva context, your Dharma is Śivatvam (Śiva-Ness). To be omniscient, omnipresent &amp;amp; omnipotent is your true nature &amp;amp; therefore your Dharma. Again, Dharma here is not something you do but something you are. Karmas get done through the bodies, instruments, world &amp;amp; objects (tanu-karaṇa-bhuvana-bhoga) supplied by Māyā. The fruits of Karma are also consumed by means of tanu-karaṇetyādi. As Karman is gradually burnt off by experience (whether happiness or suffering), your Karman attains pakvam (maturation) &amp;amp; that individual Śakti of mala acting on your particular soul, in conjunction with your Karman, will also get pakvatvam.</description>
