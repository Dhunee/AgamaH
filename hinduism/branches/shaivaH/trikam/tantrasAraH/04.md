Chapter Four When, for the purpose of attaining one's own innate nature (sva bhāva), thought constructs32 are gradually purified,33 as described in the previous chapter, the course of meditation (bhāvanā), pre ceded by right reasoning, study of appropriate āgama texts, and instruction by a teacher, becomes essential. It is because of the power of thought constructs (vikalpa) that living beings wrongly conceive of themselves34 as bound. A firm conviction (abhimana) regarding one's own nature becomes the cause of freedom from samsāra. When this new vikalpa arises,35 it neutralizes those vikalpas which are the cause of bondage. This new vikalpa becomes the cause of ascent (abhyudaya), enabling one to attain his or her own innate nature. This is as follows: The supreme reality is unlimited by nature and consists of an undivided singu larity of consciousness. It transcends all the principles of limited nature which terminate in Siva. This renders stability to all and is the vitality of the universe. Through it the universe 'throbs' with life, and that is "I" (aham). Therefore, I am both transcendent 

68 TANTRASĀRA 

and immanent. This kind of conviction, however, does not arise in those blinded by māyā, because they lack right reasoning (sat tarka), etc. Vaisnavas and others are restricted to their own scrip tures by the principle of attachment (rāga). For this very reason, they show no interest in studying superior agamas in spite of their being available. In this way, they show jealousy in regard to right reasoning, right scriptures (agama), and the correct instruction of a teacher. As it is said in the Parameśvara Āgama: 

All the Vaisnavas, etc., are restricted by their attach ment to limited knowledge. They fail to understand the nature of the supreme reality only because they are devoid of knowledge.emerging from omniscience. तस्मात् शांभवदृढशक्तिपाताविद्धा एव सदागमादिक्रमेण विकल्पं संस्कृत्य परं स्वरूपं प्रविशन्ति । ननु इत्थं परं तत्त्वं विकल्प्यरूपं स्यात् ?, मैवम् - विकल्पस्य द्वैताधिवासभङ्गमात्रे चरितार्थत्वात्, परं तत्त्वं तु सर्वत्र सर्वरूपतया स्वप्रकाशमेव इति न तत्र विकल्पः कस्यैचित् उपक्रियायै खण्डनायै वा तत्र अतिदृढशक्तिपाताविद्धस्य स्वयमेव सांसिद्धिकतया सत्तर्क उदेति, योऽसौ देवीभिः दीक्षित इति उच्यते । अन्यस्य आगमक्रमेण इत्यादि सविस्तरं शक्तिपातप्रकाशने वक्ष्यामः | किं तु गुरोरागमनिरूपणे व्यापारः, तथाविधविकल्पप्रबन्ध एव सत्तर्क इति उक्तः, स एव च भावना भण्यते अस्फुटत्वात् भूतमपि अभूतमिवस्फुटत्वापादनेन भाव्यते यया इति । न च अत्र सत्तर्कात् शुद्धविद्याप्रकाशरूपात् ऋते अन्यत् योगाङ्गं साक्षात् उपायः, तपःप्रभृतेः नियमवर्गस्य, अहिंसादेश्च यमप्रकारस्य, पूरकादेः प्राणायामवर्गस्य वेद्यमात्रनिष्ठत्वेन क इव संविदि व्यापारः | प्रत्याहारोऽपि करणभूमिमेव सातिशयं कुर्यात्, ध्यानधारणासमाधयोऽपि यथोत्तरम् अभ्यासक्रमेण निर्वय॑माना ध्येयवस्तुतादात्म्यं ध्यातुः वितरेयुः । अभ्यासश्च परे तत्त्वे शिवात्मनि स्वस्वभावे न संभवत्येव । संविद्रूढस्य प्राणबुद्धिदेहनिष्ठीकरणरूप ो हि अभ्यासः-भारोद्वहनशास्त्रार्थबोध-नृत्ताभ्यासवत्, संविद्रूपे तु न किंचित् आदातव्यं न अपसरणीयम् इति कथम् अभ्यासः । 

Therefore, only those keenly touched by the energy of Śiva, 

.

TANTRASĀRA 69 

after following the path of right āgama, etc., purify their vikalpas and enter the supreme reality.36 Here a question can be asked: If this is so, shouldn't the supreme reality also be a form of deter minate knowledge (vikalpa)? The answer to this question is, "certainly not,” because determinate knowledge fulfills its purpose 

simply by removing the impressions of duality. 

The supreme reality is everywhere; it is omniform and self manifesting. The forms of determinate knowledge are not capable of either lending any support to it or refuting it. Right reasoning (sattarka) spontaneously arises in a person keenly touched by Śakti. It is said that this kind of person is initiated by the Goddesses. 

In the case of others, the form of right reasoning arises by the study of scriptures, and so forth. This topic will be discussed at length in the section entitled Saktipātaprakāśana. However, at this point it will suffice to say that the role of the teacher is to select an appropriate āgama text for a disciple to study. The role of agama, on the other hand, is to give rise to the proper type of vikalpa (śuddha-vikalpa), which is instrumental in generating the series of homogeneous thoughts free from doubt. This series of homogeneous determinate thoughts is called right reasoning (sat tarka), and this right reasoning is called meditation (bhāvanā). Through bhāvanā 37 past objects (objects that have gone to rest in the past] that were indistinct, are now made as if present by ren dering them distinct. In this context we can say that no other direct means but reasoning, which is the light of pure knowledge, can serve as the limb of yoga. For example, tapas, etc., belonging to the niyama group, ahimsa, etc., belonging to the yama group,38 various types of prāṇāyāma, etc., all are finally based in objec tive existence. Therefore, what could be their role in regard to consciousness? Even pratyaharā 39 only renders excellence on the level of senses, that is, the instruments of knowledge and action. In the same way, dhāraṇā, dhyāna, and samadhi, if practiced gradually and in this particular order, could grant to the medita tor the identification with the object of his meditation. However, meditation or practice on the supreme reality, which is identical70 TANTRASĀRA 

with Siva and is one's own innate nature, is not at all possible. The practice of one who is established in consciousness is the process of steadily establishing prāna, intellect, and body in it. This is not unike carrying a burden, studying the real meaning of śāstras, or practicing dance. In the case of consciousness, however, nothing can be added or taken away from it.40 Therefore, how can practice (in regard to consciousness) be possible? 

किं तर्केणापि इति चेत्, उक्तमत्र द्वैताधिवासनिरासप्रकार एव अयं न तु अन्यत् किंचिदिति । लौकिकेऽपि वा अभ्यासे चिदात्मत्वेन सर्वरूपस्य तस्य तस्य देहादेः अभिमतरूपताप्रकटीकरणं तदितररूपन्यग्भावनं च इति एष एव अभ्यासार्थः । परंतत्त्वे तु न किंचित् अपास्यम् इति उक्तम् । द्वैताधिवासोऽपि नाम न कश्चन पृथक् वस्तुभूतः अपि तु स्वरूपाख्यातिमात्रं तत्, अतो द्वैतापासनं विकल्पेन क्रियत इत्युक्तेः । अयं परमार्थः-स्वरूपं प्रकाशमानम् अख्यातिरूपत्वं स्वयं स्वातन्त्र्यात् गृहीतं क्रमेण प्रोज्झ्य विकासोन्मुखम्, अथ विकसितम् इत्येनेन क्रमेण प्रकाशते, तथा प्रकाशनमपि परमेश्वरस्य स्वरूपमेव, तस्मात् न योगाङ्गानि साक्षात् उपायः | तर्कं तु अनुगृह्णीयुरपि, सत्तर्क एव साक्षात् तत्र उपायः, स एव च शुद्धविद्या, स च बहुप्रकारतया संस्कृतो भवति, तद्यथा-यागो होमो जपो व्रतं योग इति, 

Now the question arises: "If this is so, then what can be accom plished by right reasoning?” We have already answered this ques tion by saying that the role of right reasoning is only to remove the impressions of duality and nothing else whatsoever. As every thing is of the nature of consciousness, the main purpose of even ordinary practice is to create the desired form in the body, prāna, etc., and put the undesired form in a subordinated place. How ever, it has already been explained that nothing can be taken away from the supreme reality. Even the impression of duality is not something different from consciousness. It is merely ignorance of one's own essential nature. Therefore, it was said that duality is removed by pure determinate thought (śuddha-vikalpa). The supreme essential nature has an innermost nature (svabhāva) that is self-shining, which assumes the state of ignorance through its 

TANTRASĀRA 71 

own freedom. Then gradually, by forsaking it, it first becomes intent on blossoming, then it begins to blossom, and finally it becomes fully blossomed. Thus, by manifesting [literally 'shin ing'], following this sequential order, it manifests itself in its full ness. This shining is the very nature of the Lord, and for that reason the limbs of yoga cannot be the direct means. However, reasoning (tarka) is of great importance here, and right reasoning (sattarka) alone is the direct means. This right reasoning is pure cognition (śuddha-vikalpa), which gets purified through differ ent means, such as through oblation (yāga), offering of food into the fire (homa), repetition of mantra (japa), religious observances .(vrata), yoga, etc. . .

Yāga is offering of all entities to the Lord for the purpose of attaining firm conviction in the form of the determinate knowl edge: "All entities are firmly established in the Lord and there is nothing separate from him." For those who are spontaneously enjoyers of penetration into consciousness, it is easy to make this offering (yāga) to the Lord because it is pleasing to the heart. It is 

72 TANTRASARA 

• 

with this purpose in mind that offerings such as beautiful flowers, sandal paste, etc., are prescribed to be offered externally. Offer ings into consecrated fire (homa) is dissolution of all entities into the fire of consciousness of the Lord, who takes delight in con suming all and making them remain as the flame of fire alone Homa is for the purpose of attaining this steady determinate con viction: "All entities are made of the light." Repetition of a man tra (japa) is for the purpose of enlivening reflective cognitions, but without being dependent on them existing as knowables either externally or internally, and appearing as if they are distinct from the highest reality. This kind of reflective cognition of the highest reality; which is not different from one's own Self, is called.japa: - Religious observance (vrata) is the perception with firm con viction that the body, a jar, etc., are in essence identical with the Lord. This is for the purpose of attaining the supreme Self con sciousness (abhimāna) of the Lord, which is not to be attained by any other means. As it is said in the Srinandisikhā, “The highest vow (vrata) is the harmony of all.” That supreme reality, which is independent from all forms of thought constructs, shines forth through various forms of determinate knowledge which possesses elements of pure knowledge (fuddhavidyā). Yoga, which is a par ticular type of determinate knowledge (vikalpa), and whose nature is the unification with one's own innate nature, exists for the pur pose of establishing one firmly in that ever-shining light.

The essential nature of the great Lord is the 'fullness of his consciousness' (purnasamvitsvābhava). This fullness of con sciousness is his Sakti, 41 which is known as body (kula), capacity (samarthya), wave (urmi), heart (hrdaya), essence (sāra), vibra tion (spanda), glory of power (vibhuti), the three-formed goddess (trisikā), the cause of kalana (kali), one who minimizes (karsini), dreadful (candi), speech (vāṇi), enjoyment (bhoga), knowledge (drk), and the superintending deity of lunar phases (nityā). This Śakti is expressed by these and other appellations based on various grammatical derivations, which are technical terms used in the āgamas. Let this Śakti abide in any of these forms in the heart of å meditator. If this Sakti is viewed collectively, as consisting of the totality of all śaktis, the fullness of consciousness becomes mani fest. The Lord possesses innumerable dynamic energies (śaktis). What more can we say? The entire universe is his śakti. There fore, it is impossible to enumerate all of them in this instruction However, the whole universe can be summed up under three main Śaktis. The supreme energy (Śrīparāśakti) of the Lord is that śakti by means of which this universe, beginning with Siva and ending with earth principle (tattva), is born, seen, and manifested by the Lord in indeterminate consciousness. Srīparāparāśakti of the Lord is that śakti by means of which he projects the universe just like the reflection of an elephant, etc., in a mirror: as different-cum nondifferent. The glorious Aparāśakti is that śakti by means of which he manifests this differentiated universe, in which all these objects appear as different from one another.

That śakti, by means of which the triad of faktis are born, that is, embraced (withdrawn) internally into the Lord through the process of unification (anusandhāna), is the glorious Parāśakti. That śakti (although remaining) Śrīparā is now called śrīmātrsa dbhava,42 Kalakarsini,43 etc. Each of those four śaktis, because of their freedom, shines in threefold manner; that is, creation, maintenance, and dissolution. In this way, the number increases to twelve.44 This takes place in the following way: 

1. First, consciousness only shapes (kalayati) entities 

(bhāva) within. 2. Then it projects (kalayati) them externally as distinct 

forms. 3. Then consciousness accepts external objects as something ___pleasant and desirable, and then it throws (kalayati) them 

internally with the desire to dissolve them within. 4. Next it creates doubt regarding various obstacles in the 

process of dissolution, after which it dissolves those obsta 

TANTRASĀRA 75 

cles as well. 5. After this, the portion of entity shining as doubt, which is 

going to be dissolved, is assimilated (kalayati) within the 

self through the process of withdrawal. 6. Then it creates (kalayati) the agent of withdrawal and 

realizes it as being his own Self. 7. In the process of creating (kalayati) the agent of with 

drawal, it creates some entities as existing in the form of impressions (vāsanās) and some others as existing in the 

form of consciousness alone. 8. Then it creates the wheel of. instruments (of knowledge 

and action), preceded by the process of the activity of manifesting its own nature. 9. Next it shapes (kalayati) the lords of the instruments. 10. Then it creates (kalayati) the limited subject belonging to 

the level of māyā. 11. After this it creates (kalayati) the knowing subject, who is 

intent on abandoning limitations and accepting the blissful 

state of consciousness. 12. Next it manifests (kalayati) the fully bloomed form of his 

own Self. 

Thus, the 'twelve divine Goddesses of consciousness' (dvādaśa Bhagavatyah) manifest themselves, either to all subjects or only one, simultaneously or sequentially, either in two or three. They move in the manner of a circle like a wheel, and also shine exter nally in the form of months, and other minute divisions of time, the signs of zodiac, and finally in the form of pot, cloth, etc. In this way, they nourish the autonomy of the 'Lord of the Wheel (Cakreśvara) and are expressed by the word Śrī Kālī. 

The different meanings of the word kalana45 are: moving, throwing (projecting), knowledge, enumeration, causing all the objects to become objects of enjoyment, sounding, and withdraw ing [assimilating] the objects into oneself. As it has been stated by the teacher Śrī Bhūtirāja: "She is known as Kālī on account of projecting, knowing, and enumerating.” The meaning of Kālī can 

76 TANTRASĀRA 

be seen in detail in various places of my Parātrīśikā Vivarana and the monograms of my hymns. It is the tradition of my teachers that esoteric secrets should not be disclosed in one place, nor is it proper to keep them totally hidden.

All that has been stated about yāga, homa, and so on, should be understood to be only for Maheśvara.46 All perceive those very things that are to be avoided as those that are to be accepted, and also perceive everything from Viṣnu to Siva as Paramasiva. This 

TANTRASĀRA 77 

kind of view is wrong and it should be rejected by yogins fol lowing the path of the Absolute (anuttarayogins). For this very purpose, Vidyādhipati has made great effort in his monograms entitled "Anubhāva Stotra." 

Thus, in each of these five, beginning with yāga and ending with yoga, there are different levels of steadiness to be attained.47 One should act in such a way that one may attain a steady convic tion in them. This kind of yogin should not think, “This food is sanctioned and this food is prohibited, or this is pure and this is impure," and in this way cause suffering to his own self. Purity, impurity, etc., are not invariable properties belonging to the object, but in essence, products of the imagination. Thus, it is stated in the Sripūrva:48 “Purity is not the essential attribute of an object in the same way as the property of being blue, etc., is not the essential nature of an object, for it has been started to be impure on other occasions." In (the case of) an offering of gifts to one who has been initiated, if it is argued that because of directive statement (codana), this offering of gifts is impure with reference to that (directive statement), then it is similar to some other direc tive statement (codanāntara) which may contradict the former, but such a contradictory directive statement is unreal because of [this] incongruity-if it is so argued, then we say, "no," that is not right. The directive statement uttered by Lord Siva himself is sufficiently forceful to annul other directive precepts. It is well-supported by logical reasoning, and also (well-established] in numberless āga mas like the Sarvajñānottara and others. We shall speak of it later in the sequel. Therefore, the rule which is enjoined, in the scrip tures, as the precept to be followed and the thing that is to be prohibited, beginning from the Vedas down to the Tantras of the Lord as understood by the Siddhāntins, such as Kulocchuṣma and others, serves no purpose in this context; therefore the truth of the matter is established. In the Sripūrva and other texts it has been so stated. One should seek a detailed account of it in the Tantrāloka and other texts. 

Bound souls possess a firm conviction of the follow 

78 TANTRASĀRA 

ing nature: "I am dull, I am much-enticed by the bonds of past deeds, I am impure, I am led by others." Upon perfect attainment of a firm conviction contrary and distinct from the above, the same bound soul immedi ately becomes the Lord (pati) with the immanent form of pure consciousness. The perfect yogin should always be mindful that a firm conviction of the aforesaid nature should be attained. He should not endanger himself with doubts [arising from] notions lacking the true nature of things, or by the unsound precepts of dullards.
