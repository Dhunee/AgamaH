### Chakravarti
When a discursive thought (vikalpa) is capable of purifying itself in itself without depending on other means, it loses the functionality which is commonly associated with bonded beings (pasu).[^49]   
Then, by the grace of pure knowledge (Suddhavidyā), it (vikalpa) becomes transformed into the energy of the great Lord, and after taking recourse to it as the 'means' (upāya), it becomes capable of manifesting the knowledge belonging to śakti (śākta).  
This process was explained in the previous chapter.

[^49]:

    The term "bound soul” (paśu), which literally means animal, is a technical term of this system. With the appearance of limitation, the soul, which is essentially composed of pure consciousness, finds itself limited in knowledge and action.+++(5)+++ Its innate nature becomes as if veiled, for which reason it becomes known as atomic (anu).+++(5)+++

    At this level of existence the bonded souls are of great variety because they receive the grace of the Lord, which is based on comparative distinctions of intensity. The right form of intuitive judgment does not arise in all. Therefore, they have to depend on āgama for the rise of that intuitive knowledge. At this stage, there is a need for a spiritual guide.+++(4)+++ A spiritual guide is a person meant to lead the seeker in selecting an appropriate agama for him to study. When the agama is studied properly, pure thought (śuddha vikalpa) arises.  

    However, in the case of those who lack right understanding, purification of thoughts (vikalpas) in this particular way is not possible. Therefore, they need to rely on other means for that purification of thoughts (vikalpas). In short, these means are: meditation, taking recourse to the vital energy (prāṇa), and making the body the instrument of knowledge as a means to attain one's ends.

    The body itself is a gross instrument for the attainment of the highest aim of life. For those who are steadily convinced that a body is the Self, it becomes a suitable means.

### Chakravarti
When, for the purification of discursive thought (vikalpa), one needs to rely on the 'means' (upāya), then he or she can take recourse in the intellect (buddhi), prāṇa, body, jar, and other external objects of a limited nature.[^50] By doing this, one descends to the level of an atom (aṇu) and causes the 'knowledge of limited nature' (āṇava) to manifest in his soul.

[^50]:

    Meditation is performed by the intellect (buddhi). This kind of practice is fruitful for those who think that intellect is the Self. 

    On the other hand, those who are convinced that the vital air (prāṇa) is the Self make the prāṇa a means. In order to remove vikalpas, the aspirant makes use of body (karaṇa), mudra, and different sorts of āsanas.

### Chakravarti
On that level the buddhi possesses a meditative nature,  

and prana is of two kinds:[^51] gross and subtle.  
The former is of the nature of moving upward (uccārana). This moving upward possesses five modalities: prāṇa, apāna, samana, udāna, and vyāna.  
The subtle form of prāṇa is denoted by the syllabic sound (varṇa), which will be explained later. 

[^51]:

    Vital energy is of two types, one general and the other particular. 

    The particular form of the vital air manifests itself in five different ways. They are known as prāṇa, apāna, samana, udāna, and vyāna. These particular forms of vital energy, although manifested distinctly in these five ways and functioning in different parts of the body, are basically resting in the general form of vital air. Their basic nature is to move forward (uccārana).

    The general prāṇa is known as vibration (spanda), pulsation, blossoming, etc. At the start of the creative impulse, after manifestation of void, the consciousness assumes the nature of vital energy.


The body, possessing a specific type of arrangement, is denoted by the word karaṇa.[^52] 

[^52]: Karaṇa is a particular type of ānava upāya which relates to the meditation on the body, etc.

Jars and so forth are external objects, which will be described as the means for the purpose of worshipping the altar and the phallic form (linga).

### Chakravarti
Among all of these means, it is appropriate to give instruction regarding meditation first.It has already been pointed out that the self-shining supreme reality exists externally in all the principles (tattvas). 

Having meditated on that supreme reality in the heart of one's own consciousness, [^53] one should then meditate on the close union of the three, which are fire, the sun, and the moon. In this context, fire stands for the knowing subject, the sun for the instrument of knowledge, and the moon for the knowable objects. 

[^53]: 

    The supreme consciousness is self-luminous by nature. It is only because of its autonomy that it takes on the nature of everything.+++(5)+++ In other words, we can say that it shines in multifarious forms. One should meditate in the core of one's heart because the heart is the essence of all the principles, which abide closest to the heart. 

    First of all the aspirant should meditate with concentration on the uni-flavoredness (samarasya) of prāṇa, apāna, and udāna, represent ing the moon, the sun, and the fire.+++(4)+++ This meditation is to be performed by stopping the outgoing and ingoing movement of vital air in such a way that prāṇa, apāna, and udāna, after giving up the functioning in their respective manners, become one, leaving out all distinctions. 

    As fire blazes up with the churning process of araṇi, in a similar way, the opposing movement of both prāṇa and apāna, being stopped, enters into the current in the middle path, which transforms it into the fire of udāna, known as the great terrible fire blazing upward. This fire is known as the great fire because it consumes the limitedness of the conscious subject, its object, and its instrument of knowledge. Thus, with attaining perfection in such meditation, the meditator becomes free from all limitations and then he makes an effort to attain oneness with the highest subject.

### Chakravarti
One should meditate in this way as long as Bhairava's fire is not manifested by the fanning of the air in the form of meditation.

This fire is to be conceived as being encompassed by the aforesaid twelve flames of energy,[^54] assuming the form of the "wheel," out of which these energies emerge through one of the outlets, such as the eyes, and take their repose on the objective level.

[^54]: 

    The highest subject is supposed to be encircled with twelve energies. They are associated with creation, maintenance, dissolution, and the fourth one designated as nameless (anākhyā). This nameless one, being without limitations, is associated with each of the other three. Therefore the number becomes twelve. They are as follows: 

    - (a) sr̥ṣṭi-sr̥ṣṭi, sr̥ṣṭi-sthiti, sr̥ṣṭi-samhāra, sr̥ṣṭi-anākhyā 
    - (b) sthiti sr̥ṣṭi, sthiti-sthiti, sthiti-samhāra, sthiti-anākhyā

While it is resting on the objective level,

Then, it should be conceived of as being made manifest by the sun in the order of maintenance.  
Further, it should be conceived as being made to dissolve by the all-encompassing fire of withdrawal.[^55]  
Finally, it should be conceived of as being merged into transcendence in order to become one with it.


[^55]:

    The transcendent wheel (anuttara cakra) consisting of twelvefold nature, going outside through the outlets of the eye, etc., assumes the nature of the object. This object is characterized by the moon; the sense organs, representing the sun, are the instrument of knowledge (pramāṇa); while the knowing subject is the fire.+++(5)+++

In this way, the "wheel" attains fullness with no difference from objective existence.  
Then, one should meditate by means of that “wheel" on the residual traces that remain from the entities, and should dissolve them in a similar fashion.[^56]

[^56]: After the destruction of all the objects, they remain existent in the form of residual traces. Therefore, they should also be placed into the flames of the fire of consciousness.

The person who persists with this practice of meditation attains the firm conviction that the series of creation, maintenance, and dissolution are in essence nothing but his own consciousness, which in reality is freedom (svātantrya), shining as creation belonging to one's own innate consciousness.  
In this way, one realizes the state of Bhairava without delay.

However, it is only through practice that one attains all sorts of desired goals.

One should meditate on the Lord, the all-pervading One, the Lord of the “wheel' presiding over those : twelve powers of its rays, who is emerging. outwardly through the outlets (voids, vyoma), and is the agent of creation, and so on. The yogin should meditate on the totality of entities, both external and internal, which have been dissolved into the Self and are going to take repose (viśrānti) therein. Thus, the light of the Self shines forth.

One desirous of moving his vital energy upward (uccāra) should first make it rest (viśrānti) in the heart,[^57] the void, and then through the rising of prāṇa should have it rest in external objects. prāṇa should rise there while being replenished by the moon of apāna, by means of which one experiences one's all-inclusive nature and becomes indifferent to everything distinct from the Self. With the rise of samana, balanced energy, one experiences the state of unification of all objects, which then rest in a state of repose. Then, with the rise of the fire of udāna, the limit 

TANTRASĀRA 83 

ing distinction between subjectivity and objectivity is dissolved. With this consuming fire, which devours objects, knower, and knowledge, and with the subsiding and rising of vyāna, the high est knower, free from limitation, becomes manifest. Thus, it is explained that all the 'stages of rest' (viśrānti) beginning with void (sūnya) and ending with vyāna, are all different stages of bliss. They are as follows: nijānanda, [^58] nirānanda, [^59] parānanda, [^60] brahmānanda, [^61] mahānanda, [^62] and cidānanda.[^63] Universal bliss (jagadānanda) is the one blissful state, which unifies all the other six states mentioned above. This universal bliss is free from rising and setting, and is repose in one's own Self. One should take rest, 

· either in two (different] ways or in every respect, on one of the 

five prāṇas in any of the stages of uccāraṇa. By doing this, one is able to attain the reality of the truth of repose' (viśrāntitattvam), which is different from body, prāṇa, and so on. This is indeed the secret of pronouncing the seed mantras of creation "sa" and dis solution "ha.” By continued unification of these two syllables one should purify discursive thoughts (vikalpa). 

The above-mentioned 'stages of rest' have five stages, each of which depends on the comparative proficiency of the practitioner in absorption. However, if one is well practiced in the above means, then the bliss comes in the beginning' (pragānanda)[^64] because of the glimpse of the fullness of the Absolute. As a result of this, an 'upsurge' (udbhava) takes place for a moment as one gains the firm conviction that he is free from the body. After this, 'shaking' (kampa) follows because the conviction that the Self is identical to the body has been loosened by the overpowering nature of one's 'potentiality' (bala). This is followed by the 'void of sleep' (nidrā) as the tendency toward externality disappears. In this way, the notion of the self dissolves in the nonself, and the notion of the nonself dissolves in the Self because the Self is of the nature of all Then the yogin experiences 'great expansion (mahāvyāpti), hav ing 'firmly rooted himself in the truth' (satyapada), upon which a 'whirl' (ghūrni) takes place. All of these are the stages of the states of consciousness, which begin with the 'waking state' (jāgrat),[^65] 

84 TANTRASĀRA 

and end with the state 'beyond the fourth' (turyātīta). 

These stages become manifest when a yogin enters the triangle, i.e., the 'bulb' (kanda), the heart, and the palate cakras, and the higher 'coiled state' of śakti (ūrdhvakundalini). That state, where the 'moving upward' (uccāra) of the vital energy has its repose (viśrānti), where the entity of knowables has dissolved into a 'tran scendent vibration (paramspandam), where knowables appear in a budding state, and where they where they have fully blossomed, [that state) is known as threefold linga.[^66] The nature of this three fold linga will be described when the occasion for that arises. The highest linga according to this system is called 'Heart of Yogini (Yoginihydaya). Of the above, the principal one is characterized by vibration. When this vibration expresses itself in the form of contraction and expansion with the nature of the 'unity of the two' (yāmala), it attains repose with the form of the 'subtle emission' (visargakalā). Here, I should stop revealing esoteric secrets. The entrance into it (samāvesa), however, remains unrevealed. 

In the beginning, one remains steadily established in one's own innate consciousness; then by 'repose in the object' (prameye viśrāmya), one fills the knowable. Then he quickly dissolves the distinctions of subjectiv ity and objectivity, and takes rest. 

Through expansion one experiences repose [(viśrānti)] on different levels. These levels are six, along with the void (sūnya), and as such they serve as the means. Waking and other states remain merged in this fivefold prāṇa, beginning with prāṇa and ending with vyāna. One well established in the above is able to ascend to (or become established in the abode of the creation and dissolution of 'self-awareness' (vimarśa).

Now on the topic of 'syllabic sound' (varna), which is of the nature of subtle vital energy: ___ In that 'upward movement' (uccāra) of the vital energy, there is a sound (dhvani), which is continuously sounding as if it is imitating the unmanifest.[^67] This sound is called 'syllabic sound' (varṇa). The most important characteristics of this syllable are the seed mantras of creation "sa” and dissolution "ha.” One can attain supreme consciousness by the practice of these man tras. For example, when letters beginning with "ka” and ending with "ma,"[^68] either with or without vowels, are merged into the core of the vital energy or simply brought to memory, then one experiences a balanced state of vibration of consciousness. This 

86 TANTRASĀRA 

is because the word,' that is, mantra, is free from conventional relations (samaya)[^69] and therefore is full in every respect. Even the words which depend on convention are also capable of con veying their respective meanings according to the imagination of one's mind. After one has experienced supreme consciousness (in this way] he should bring together the heart, the throat, the lips, and the two 'ends of the twelve' (dvādaśānta). Then, one should unify all of them in the core of consciousness' (hrdayam). This is the esoteric secret of this syllable (varṇa). Some explain that from the 'reflective consciousness'vibrating in the 'core of the heart emerge white- and yellow-colored syllables. It is by this medita tion that a yogin is able to realize consciousness 

By the vibrating consciousness in absence of any object to be denoted, and by restraining the movement of both moon (indu, that is, apāna) and sun (arka, that is, prāṇa), a person, because of entering into the realm of consciousness in a balanced way, becomes fully perfect in regard to cit, bīja, and pindamantras. 

This is the brief summary in verse of the topics discussed in this section of Chapter Five. Here ends the elucidation of the way of the 'syllabic sound' (varṇa). Karaṇa will be explained in the mudrā section. 

To some, discursive thought (vikalpa) attains fullness without resorting to any means, and to some it is puri fied by taking recourse to means. The expediency in this system is manifold. It is in the intellect (buddhi), the vital energy (prāṇa) in the body, and in external objects as well. They have been explained as limited, but at the attainment of the result, how can there be any distinction?
