विमल-कला--ऽऽश्रयाभिनव-सृष्टि-महाजननी  
भरिततनुश् च पञ्च-मुख-गुप्त--रुचिर् जनकः ।  
तद् उभय-यामल-स्फुरित-भाव-विसर्ग-मयं  
हृदयम् अनुत्तरामृत-कुलं मम संस्फुरतात् ॥१॥

May my heart (hrdaya) pulsate in the form of emission (visarga) embodying the nectar of supreme transcendence by the close union of the pair: Śiva and Śakti (yāmala). One of the pair is Vimalakalā, the mother who has taken within herself a new creation (Abhinava) in the form of light, and the other is the father, Pañcamukha Simhagupta, who is the embodiment of perfection and is intent on expressing himself in the fivefold activity. 

Exposition: The above benedictory verse hints at a number of technical terms or concepts commonly used in the doctrine of Trika Saivism. In this context, the word heart (hrdaya) indicates universal bliss (jagadānanda), which unifies everything into an undivided singularity of consciousness. Its form is an ever-shining light, knowing neither rising nor setting. Restfulness is its very nature. The author aspires to attain and realize that heart of consciousness. 

Another technical term found in this verse is yāmala, which is described as the highest equilibrium, [a union] of both Siva and Sakti. This is a union in which Siva is neither Siva nor Śakti, and Śakti is neither Sakti nor Siva, but each is the combined union of both. This union is also known as coitus (saṁgatta). In the creative process, [expanding from] this union, all the principles, known as tattvas, emerge. Throughout this process of creation, the nondual nature of the absolute equilibrium remains tranquil, like a waveless ocean. This process of creation is the result of a slight impulse of creativity, an upsurge in the form of a vibrating agitation, causing the unity to break. This absolute union (yamala, saṁghaṭṭa) remains in its pristine state, even in the process of cre ation. During that process of creation, 'It' first shows itself as two [Siva and Sakti], expanding outward into three, and then many. 

The word kula ordinarily means 'body', but in this context it refers to the seventeenth kalā, the immortal phase of the moon. The word visarga is the 'emission of drops' emerging from perfect sexual union. The drops reflect the colors of [Siva and Sakti]: one is white and the other red. It tends to move outside (into the manifested universe) and creates the bodies of all living beings. In the Tantric doctrine, visarga is stated to be hārdhakalā, one-half of the sound 'ha.' The mother is none but the autonomous energy of Siva, with whom she remains inseparably united. The nature of this autonomous energy, which is beyond all limitations, is ‘reflective awareness' (vimarśa). This verse also indicates that Vimalakalā was the name of Abhinava's mother. The father is the five faced Siva [with each face represented by one of the five śaktis: consciousness, bliss, will, knowledge, and action]. They are the five outlets through which everything becomes manifest, or in the luminous imagery Abhinavagupta often employs, through which the entire universe shines. Each of Śiva’s ‘faces' is ever-engaged in performing one of his five functions through these śaktis. These five functions are: creation, maintenance, dissolution, veiling, and bestowing grace.

According to this system, knowledge is the cause of libera tion (moksa), because it opposes or contradicts ignorance, which 

54 TANTRASĀRA 

is the cause of bondage. Ignorance is twofold. One abides in the intellect (buddhigata), and the other lies in the self (pauruṣa). The one which abides in the intellect is ignorance of the nature of real ity (aniscayasvabhāvam) and an erroneous conception of the Self as non-self (viparitaniscaya). On the other hand, the ignorance lying in the self (pauruṣa) is of the nature of thought-constructs (vikalpa), characterized by a limited form of the light of con sciousness. This type of ignorance is the root cause of worldly existence. This topic will be discussed in the section dealing with the nature of impurity (mala). The ignorance abiding in the self (pauruṣa) can be removed by means of initiation and other similar procedures. However, even initiation in the presence of the igno rance characterized by indeterminacy (anadhyavasāya) remains ineffective. This is because initiation is preceded by a determinate conviction as to what is to be accepted and what is to be rejected, and is followed by the purification of the principles (tattvas) and unification with Siva. Thus, the attainment of that determinative knowledge steadily abiding in the plane of the intellect is the prin cipal factor. Indeed, this practice uproots the ignorance abiding in the self (pauruṣa), because when consciousness in the form of vikalpa is practiced, it ultimately terminates in consciousness free from vikalpa2 

The Self (ātmā) is the light of consciousness (prakāśa) free from the limitation of thought-constructs (vikalpa), and is the very nature of Siva. Therefore, the attainment of the 'right knowledge of a determinate nature' (samyanniscayātmakam jñānam) regard ing all objects in every respect is desirable. The attainment of this knowledge is preceded by study of the holy texts (sāstras). The holy texts are authoritative, as they are revealed by the highest Lord (Parameśvara). The subject matter as enunciated by other scrip tures is accepted as distinct, not directly related to the totality of knowledge, and is proved by arguments not directly related to that subject matter. Therefore, the knowledge taught in other holy texts (āgamas) is said to grant liberation only up to a certain extent, but 

TANTRASĀRA 55 

not from all bondage. On the other hand, the holy texts revealed by the Lord Parameśvara bestow release from all sorts of bondage. The holy texts (taught by Parameśvara) come in a fivefold stream and are divided into groups of ten, eighteen, and sixty-four. The most perfect among them are the texts named Trika, the quintes sence of which is the Mālinīvijaya tantra. The subject matter con tained therein is difficult to gather and properly elucidate. Without the proper ascertainment of the essence of reality, this knowledge neither possesses the property of liberation nor is instrumental in 

granting it. It is only unblemished knowledge that possesses such 

• a nature. The highest human end has its root in knowledge, which should be practiced in one's own being. It is for the attainment of .... this type of knowledge that I begin writing this text. 

अज्ञानं किल बन्धहेतुरुदितः शास्त्रे मलं तत्स्मृतं .. पूर्णज्ञानकलोदये तदखिलं निर्मूलतां गच्छति । 

ध्वस्ताशेषमलात्मसंविदुदये मोक्षश्च तेनामुना 

शास्त्रेण प्रकटीकरोमि निखिलं यज्ज्ञेयतत्त्वं भवेत् ।। The lack of right knowledge (ajñāna) is explained in the holy texts to be the cause of bondage. It is known as impurity (mala). At the rise of perfect knowledge it is uprooted in its entirety. Upon the emergence of Self-consciousness, at the time when all impurities are destroyed, release (mokṣa) is attained. For this reason, I shall, with the help of this text, reveal the real nature of that which is to be known.

Introduction 

In this world, 'innate nature' (svabhāva) is the highest aim to be attained. This innate nature belonging to all entities is of the nature of 'light' (prakāśa), as that which is not light cannot be proved to be this innate nature. Furthermore, that light is only one [literally translated: ‘it is not more than one'], for there is an absence of existence of any other innate nature in that light which is different from it. This is because of the non-existence of dif ferentiation in that light. Time and space cannot bring or cause differentiation in it, for they possess that light as their innermost nature. Therefore, the light is indeed only one, and that light alone is consciousness. The nature of consciousness is to bring illumina tion [manifestation] to all objects. In this regard there is no differ ence of opinion among scholars. 

This shining of that light is not dependent on anything outside of itself. The state of being illuminated by another light should certainly be called dependence, as the state of being illuminated 

TANTRASĀRA 57 

depends on others for its illumination. However, in the absence of any other light, there is only this single and 'autonomous' (svatan tra) light. It is precisely because of this independence that this light is not limited by time, space, or form. Therefore, it is all pervasive, eternal, and it has characteristics of being omniform, and at the same time it is devoid of any definite or specific form.6 The freedom belonging to that light is its energy of bliss (ānanda), its relish of delight (camatkāra) is its energy of will, its illumina tion is its energy of consciousness, its cognizance is its energy of knowledge, and its association with all forms is its energy of activity. In this way, although associated with the above principal energies, this unlimited light of the nature of Siva remains resting in its own bliss. Being of this nature, he, in the process of unfold ing or manifesting, takes on a limited form because of his freedom. Therefore, he is designated as atomic (anu). Then, he manifests himself as autonomous so that he again shines as that unlimited light of the nature of Siva.? In this process, he manifests his own Self by the force of his own power of freedom either with or with out 'means' (upāya). If he manifests himself with means, then the icchā, jñāna, and kriyāśaktis are used as the means. In this way, the means appear to be threefold and the [state of] absorption (samāveśa) is then divided into śāmbhava, śākta, and āṇava. In this text, the salient features of the fourfold means (upāya)' are gradually going to be explained.10 

आत्मा प्रकाशवपुरेष शिवः स्वतन्त्रः 

स्वातन्त्र्यनर्मरभसेन निजं स्वरूपम्। संच्छाद्य यत्पुनरपि प्रथयेत पूर्ण 

तच्च क्रमाक्रमवशादथवा त्रिभेदात् ।।५।। The Self with the body of light is Śiva, [who is] free. He, by the delightful sport of his power of autonomy, veils his innate nature and opens up his perfect form again, either with sequence or without it, or by three distinct means.
