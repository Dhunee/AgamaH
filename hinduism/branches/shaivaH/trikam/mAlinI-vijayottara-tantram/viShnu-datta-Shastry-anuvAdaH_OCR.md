### PREFACE. 

It is needless to say that contributions of : 

Kashmir to Sanskrit literature are remarkable. 

Apart' 

from the other branches of literature, wonderful discover ies of the Kashmirian Soholars and saints in the sphere or the Advaita salva philosophy of India are no doubt, worth noting. The recent publications, bearing the title of Kashmir Series of texts and studies by the State Government throw light on the philosophical and spiritual lives of the scholars the country has produced. All their philosophic and religious teachings, known as Kashmir Saivism rather Trika Sasana of Kashmir give us the correct estimate of the spiritual fervour and the 

literary zeal of the age. As a matter of fact the 

trika dargana of Kashmir comprises its various aspects 

in itselr and represents the unity of the three principles which are elaborately discussed in their proper place.. The present work, Malini Vejayottara Tantra, is chiefly 

connected with the Trika School and Abhinava Gupta, a 

great scholar and sage of the 10th century A.D., has regarded it as an authority on it. 

From the beginning of my literary career, I' was influenced by the Saiva and Sakta oult of Kashmir 

not because it belongs to my native place but because it presents the Saiva mataphysics in its true perspective. I made up my mind to study this Philosophy and, therefore, consulted Shri J.C.Chatterj1, the late Superintendent of the Government Research Library, Srinagar. He suggested 

to me the present work, Malini Vejayottara Tantra as 

11. 

thesis for the degree of Ph.D. 

The study of the Kashmir Saiva School cannot be complete unless the teachings of Malini vijayottara Tantra are brought into light. The work is primarily associated with the Trika School and contains all its externals and fundamentals in it in brief. 

I have divided the work into three parts: first contains the theoritical and practical teachings of Malini, the second deals with the summaries of the text. Chapterwise, English translation and elucidation of some dootrinal points and the third contains appendices and Index. 

The work, 18 obviously difficult due to its occult teachings and obscure technical terms, used for 

the formation of mantras. 

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooo 

I may mention that one of the difficulties that 

stood in my way in connection with this thesis is the 

paucity of authoritative work on the school in general and on Malini literature in particular, 

How far I have succeeded in my present attempt : 

of the elucidation of the Malini intricacies may be judged by the students in future. 

I am very grateful to Pt. Laksmana Ju, a great scholar and saint of Kashmir, and Mahamahopadhyaya Pt. Gopi Nath Ji Kaviraj, M.A. or Banaras, a learned scholar of the Indian philosophies in general and an authority on the Kashmir Saivism in particular who helped me to comprehend the georets of the Saiva oult. I am very thankful to Dr. Surya Kanta Ji.M.A., D.Litt., Head of th Sanskrit Department, Hindu University, Banaras, whoruided me in my thesis. Lastly I offer my hearty thanks to my colleague Professor P.N.Qazi, of the Government . College for Women, Srinagar, who helped me in my doctrinal and linguistio difficulties.

### Part I. (Introduction) 

I. Title Description and Historical background of the work. 

................ 

(a) The term, Malini', is used in a technical sense and chiefly means Sakti, an inherent nature or śiva. The name of the work is based on it. In the 1st. adhi. of Mā., the author has stated it as 'Maya' and asori bed' all the qualities of the Absolute to it. In the 3rd. adhi., 1t is said to be loonā, from which the phenomenal multi plicity emanates. The further developments of Iccha Sakti are jáana and Kriya Saktig. Th18 Sakti, in its transcendent atate, is one with Siya and has no its distinctive character. This supreme will or ŝakti or siva, in the state of mani festation, assumes various titlog. For example, in connec tion with the origin of letters, the Sakti is named as Malini or Matrka in the 3rd. adhi. of the work. 

1 

The two terms, 'Matrka' and 'Malini', are firstly applied as synonyms and represent the Vaikhari state in which words (sabda) and tñeir meanings (artha) emerge out separately in the form of Vacaka and Vacya. But later on, the two new terms, A bh innayoni Malini' (whose Yoni or consonants are not impregnated by the vowels) and bh innayoni (whose Yoni is impregnated by vowels) are applied to Matrka And Malini, which have basically separated them. Now, by the Matrkā or Abhinnayoni Malini we mean that Sakti from which all letters spring up in the form of vowels and congo nants. Similarly the Malini or bhinayoni Malini signifies the order of apphabet in whioh the vowels and consonants are 00-mingled. The alphabetical order of the Malini school begins from 'na' and ends in pha' and hence sometimes it 

LM 

18 salled "Nad 1 Phanta' Malini. This co-mingling of the vowels and oonsonants in the alphabetical order implios the extreme type of monism (perema-advaita) which was a grevable to its exponents. 

Both, Malini (bhinnayoni malini) and Matrka abhinnayoni malin1), regarded as two Śaktig, represent 

Kashmir Salvism. . They strictly follow the fundamental 

principles of the Trika School and represent themselves as 

alphabetioal order. The Matrka Sohocl admits two classes of letters, vowels and consonants, technically called vija and yoni.. These two classes are again divided into nine groups in the following: - 

1. Avarga (sixteen vowels), 2. Kavarga, 3. Cavarga, 4. Tevarga, 5. Tavarga, 6. Pavarga, 7. Yavarga, 8. Savarga, 9. Kșa (Ma., III, 9-11). 

The Malini School has co-mingled vowels and 'conso nants and its alphabetical order is as under: 

Na, I, r, Ir, lr, tha, oa, dha, 1, na, u, u, ba, ka, kha, ga, gha, na, 1, a, va, bha, ya, da, dha, tha, jha, ja, ra, te, pa, cha, la, a, sa, ah, ha, sa, kbe, ma, sa, am, ta, e, ai, o, ai, da, pha. 

This ourious alphabetical order was in vogue in the 10th century A.D. when Abhinava Gupta, the founder of Matrkā school, rlour ished. He respected Malini vijayottara tantra in whioh the Malin i sakti (bhinnayon 1 Malini) is glorified. . As a matter of fact, his chief work , Fantra loke, is just like a commentary on the Malini School. The 

school died out in his time. No later writer of Trika has written anything a bout it. 

Abhinava Gupta mentions this Malini as a Primary form of Sakti. It brings all Siddhis when it is worshipped in its united form of vowels and consonants (or. Malini hi bhagavat í mukhyam saktam rupam vījayonigamghattena Samasta Kandughan, T.9.). 

The literal meanings of the term "Malini' are - "Mala asyaasti iti Malini. (that Sakti which contains all 1ts letters in the form or a garland). This sense is also stressed by the following text of T.A. 

*Anvartham Caltann ama rudra Sakti malabhiryukta, 

eto. T.A. page 135. 

Utpala Dova mentions Malini Sakti as an essence of the phenomenal universe and regards it as a great power. and Goddess that sustains life of the animate and inanimate world (cr. Yat Saramasya Jagatah Sa Devi Malini Para. Maha Satta Mahadevi Vigyajivana Muoyate. I.Pr.7.1.5.14). 

The author of Ma. has stated phones as chier, characteristio of Malini, by which words are formed (or. vãoo varnatmika yasmad varnarupā ni Malini, Ma. 21st, 8). 

From the Tantrika point of view, all letters of Malini School are ta bulated in the form of a garland in the following: 

One more feature that distinguishes them from each other is the origin of the different categories from their letters. 

According to the Matrka School, the origin of the thirty-five principles 18 agoribed to the consonants and the vowels. The letters of the Matrka, from which different tattvas spring up, are tabulated below in an aso end ing order (aroha brana):

The origin of the thirty-five tattvas from the letters of the Malini school in the ascending order is dirferent from that of the above mentioned Matrka. The main cause of this differentiation is their different 

alphabetioal orders. Acoording to the Malini, the origin of the principles from its letters is given below:

(b) The work represents itself as a class or the Agana Sastra, the authorship of which is attributed to Siva himself. It cannot be denied that it is understood as an e authority on the Trika form of Kashmir Saivism (or. Trika saram malinimatam, T.A., I.). The work, as its contents point out, mentions various types of the Saiva Sadhana.' The striking feature of the work, which distinguishes it from the other trika literature, 18 its equal emphasis on the dootrine (jnana) and practice (Kriya). Due to this special characteristio, we can emphatically declare that the work discloses its psycho-physical nature. 

The fundamental objeotive of the work is Siva Yoga, Sivadvaita or Sankara Yoga (1dentity of the limited self with the supreme self). In the very beginning or the 

Inspired by Sakti, come to Kartikeya, son 'or Sankara and Una, who is the killer of Taraka, the demon, with a view to learn Siva-Yoga. The system lays much stress on the initiation (diksa), without which the 3 iva-Yoga, the desti nation or human striving, cannot be achieved. The system has obviously stated that those, who, according to the salva tenets, are unified with siva, the Infinite, never become animals again (of. Na bhuyah pasutameti suddhe sva tmani tisthati, Ma. I, 47). 

The chief theme of the work is removal of the paau-bhava (an inal state) and the attainment of the Siva hood. For the achievement of this end, the author of the work has followed the popular schools, the School of Know ledge (jnana-marga), expounded by the Upanis ads and the advaita Vedanta and the School of Yoga, founded by Patanjali, and represented them in a synthesized form. The Vedanta believes that the mental discipline is a means to self 

realisation. By means of the higher centre, we can over come the lower one. "The Yoga School of Patanjali stress es the physical d 1go ipline by which the higher centre can be subdued. The Malini sohool represents itself as a part of the Tantras and Salvagamas and therefore holds both the methods respectfully and equally. According to it, full balance between the body and the mind is needful. Either of them cannot sufrice for self-knowledge. 

Malini Vijaya has divided the two methods, mentioned above, into three classes, viz., anavopaya, Saktopaya and Sambhavopaya. The first and the third olass correspond to the Yoga and the Jnana or the Patan jala and the Vedantia School respectively. As regards. the nature or Saktopaya, it is the combination or both, Yoga and Jnana. It is needless to say that the three 

Yoga, the bhakti-yoga and the Jnana-Yoga. 

In the whole work, the forta of the author is how one can rise froń the gross to the subtle. The detailed explanation of the Şadadhvan (81xfold path), various dharanas (concentrations) and the pancadasi, eto., oonfirm the fact (mā, III, XII-XIII and II). Besides, : 

the author has thrown light on the very interesting topios of the Tantrika Sadhana. 

var 

The work, as we learn from the words or Uma (Ma. I, 8), 18 a part of sidahayogisvarī tantra (not avallable). From the text, it is also clear that the work oonsists of two parts, called Purva Malini and Uttara Malini. Unfortunately, the first part of the work is not available. The second part, Uttara Malini or malini Vijayottara tantra, is mainly a blend of Jnana (philosophy) 

and Kriya (practice), which are the fundamental themes of the siddha and Namaka tantra, regarded as two sections of the 3 iddha Yogišvarí. 

By the close study of the Saiva literature or Kashmir, we conclude that the Malini School has not en Joyed a long life due to its rigorous methods of Sadhara. on account of the loss of its preliminary section, Purya Malini, we are not in a position to lay any remark on its significant points. It is Abhinava Gupta, a soholar and spiritualist or the 10th Century AD, that regards Malini as a principal treatise on the Trika, formulated by Vasu Gupta in his inspirational work, the Siva Sutras, and pays high esteem to it. It is also a fact that the tradition of the Malini gystem could not continue after Abhinava Gupta. No later writer of the Kashmir Saivism has supplemented the School of Malini.II. A brief survey of its contents and its place in the 

Tantrika literature in general and the Trika literature in partioular. 

(a) As regards the brief account of the funda mantals of the system, they are arranged in the twenty three chapters oalled "adhikaraa". Some of the adhikaras point out the subjeot they explain. At the very outset, the author has divided his philosophical scheme into two groups, viz., acceptable (upadeya) and avoidable (heya). 

The group of the six, 1.e. siva, Sakti, Mantra manośvara, Mantresvara, Mantra and anu (vijnanākala), belongs to the upadeya olags. Three impurities, called änava, kamna and maya mala, are mentioned as heya. 

The authorities on the School have conceived Siva, the Supreme Reality, as Sakala (immanent) and niskala (trangaendent). The first epithet implies Sakti, the free will of the lord, while the second refers to oit or consciousness. Thus Siva or Parama Siva, regarded as the Absolute in the Saive system, is a united whole of Jnana and kriya. The doctrine of the anava mala la conneoted with these two characters. 

process 

The process of creation (Srstikrana) mentioned by the school is also curious. The pure world of the pure principles (Siva, sakti, Sadasiva, etc.) is created by Siva himself. The oreation or the impure universe is attributed to the eight lords, ananta, eto. or aghora, par ama ghora, ato. (Nã. I, 19, of. Suddhe dhvani Sivan karta prokto 'nanto sito pra bh uh, T.A.). . 

Sakti or freedom of Siva holds an important place in the Salva thought. This principle is responsible 

No Sadhaka is 

for the manifestation of the universe. liberated less Sakti helps him. . 

The system also lays down the fact that Siva, the infinite prino iple, is rinitised und ass unes various grades and stages of his unlimited being. The power, by which the womeasured is measured, the undirferentiated is. 

dirferentiated and the inr inita 19 compressed in the finite, is fakti. 

The present sygt en mentiono innumerable Saktis or siva, among which only three, apara, paraparā and para are primary. 

The dootrine of competency and the significance or Guru cannot be negleoted in connection with the contents of the work. Like the Vedio Sadhena, the Tantrika way or Sadhana is not restricted and reduced to only a superior 

class of nen. Any man of any caste and creed, whether male or female, is equally admitted to the spiritual realisation of the Tantrika type, provided he or she proves himself or herself competent for the job before the reli gious preceptor (Guru) according to the dootrine of compe tenoy (adhikaritva) mentioned in Mā. IV, 8. 

According to the Malini system, in the scheme of spiritual realisation, Guru is highly stressed and he has a wonderful rolo to play. Though he is a human being, he should be regarded as an image of siva (Mā. II, 10, VI, 29). He ought to initiate his disciple and equip him with the necessary materials for the difficult spiritual journey. Carelessness in the orrioa of Guru surely leads aspirants to degradation and fall. 

For the attaiment of the final goal, the 

11. 

formules, mentioned in the Salva scriptures, are of very little use. They can not lead him towards the true path which can be shown by a Guru, A Sadhaka is advised to seek a preceptor of good type. 

The theory of seven pramatęs, mentioned in Ma.II, ig reference to the various grades or stages of Sadhakas. 

The mention of the panoadasa, trayodasa and 

ekadasa vidhis throwa 11.ght on the wonderful method of the Sadhana and distinguishes the school from the Trika typo or Sa ivism. It also refers to the method of sublimation, well-known in the Tantrika literature of India. 

Tho dootrino of the three upayas, referred to in the 2nd. adhi. of Ma, corresponds to the theory of the bhavas (nature), expounded by Sarvanenda in his work, . S.U.T. 

The explanation of the five states, viz., jāgrat, svapna, susupta, tury, and turyatita, points out the five Śaktis of siva, due to which he is regarded as a doer of the five actions (panoay idhakrtyakarī). 

Dootrine of sixfold path or şadadhvan is another chief content of the work. The path is arranged in two groups, vacakadhvan and vaohyadhvan. The constituent parts of the first division in an ascending order aro mantra, pada and varna. The latter consists of bhuvana, tatta and kala. 

Arrangenent of the Şadadhvan in the four andas, called parthiva, prakrta, mayiya and 'sakta, is another peculiarity of the school. 

The description of iccha, jñena and kriya saktis 

12. 

is specially related to the ideal monism and throws light 

ou psychology. 

Conception of Matrka and Malini, referred to in Ma. III indicates the origin of lettery. 

References to jnana and kriya a 1ksa in Ma. I . point out that the school has synthesized two sadhanas or the Vejanta and the Patanjala School respectively. The synthesis of the two methods also implies that the Saive system of Kashmir holds mental as well as physical d 18 oipline as a means to spiritual knowledge in an equal .. 

position. 

In conn motion with purification (bhuta--suddhi), the mention of the threefold anganyasa, that is, a para, paraper and para vidhi, is a remarkable character of the work. The three kinds of the anganyasa are specially meant for three olasses of Sadhakas, viz., dvaitavad in, dvaitadvaita vad in and advaitavad in (hia. VI and notes on it.)

Sadhaka-d Ikea and avarya-d 1ksa are significant topios of the work. No body 19 admitted into the class of a Sadhaka unless he proves himself a man of charaoter before the Guru. As regards the nature of the acarya diksa, it transformg a sadhaka to the gtatus of a Guru.' 

The abhişoka (sprindling of wator on head) rite 1s associated with the dikşas, mentioned above. No 

Sadhaka or acarya has any rigat to act as a sadhaka or as an acarga unless powers are delegated to him through the 

a bhişoka ceremony. 

Concentrations (aharanās) on the gross elements, panoatanmatras, mana, buddhi, ahankara and ten senses (indriyaa) expose the peculiarity of the Sadhana the school lays down. It also discloses the fact that macrocosm and niorocosm are equally important to a spiritual seeker (Ma. XII-XVI). 

TF kinds of Sadhana, laksvabheda and cittabheda, 

referred to in Ma.XII, are remarkable. 

The work does not fail to mention the method of pranayana (breath-oontrol) with its other variations as a 

e means to self-control. As a matter of fact, the system does not attach much importance to it. 

On reading much account of the Sakti principle and its different groupings in the work, its readers may not take the system as a sivadvaita, qualified by Śakti' 

(s akti-visista), the author has strongly deolared the wor ship of the self (of. Yajeda dhyatmikam lingam yatra linam caracaram (Ma. XVIII, 3) and named the philosophy as a high type of non-dualism (paramadirveita).

By a brier review of the contents, we cannot hesitate to remark that the work contains philosophy and religion and its importance as a philosophio and religious work cannot be underestimated. 

(b) The tantras are an epitome or the different forms of Sadhana because they are influenced by the varied religious cults and the divergent branches or Indian philosophy. Like the Vedas, they also claim great antiquity. The students of Tantras can not miss the 

monotheistio philosophy of the Upanisads and the absolute 

15. 

monism or Sankara in them. Some of them are character igea by polytheism and pantheism of the Vedio period. In spite of all these various contents of them, they strongly stress 11beration as the summum bonum or human life. They have adopted different methods to meet this end. 

The chief contents of them are description or the Şadadhvan, oono option of Matrka for the origin of letters, explanation of the thirty-six prino iples and their wonderful sidanis. In view of these characters, we do say that the nature of the Ma. system is Tantrika. :: 

In spite of the features that reduce it to the Tantrika level, the system is, to some extent, a bit different from it. The essential character that differen tlates it from Tantras is its peouliar conoeption of the Absoluto, Both, the Mā. system of Kashmir Saivism and the Tantrika Sohool, regard Siva as absolute and transcendent. 

The two terms, 'absolute' and 'transcendent' mean beyond relation'. But the term, 'beyond', according to the Saiva School of the Ma., means - 'exceed ing' or 'wider than the relation'. In the Tantrika School of Saivism, the same term, 'beyond', 18 explained in the sense - 'having no relation at alll. The Ma. School does not deny or exclude relation. In other words, it mentiong that the absolute is related to the world but has a wider sphere tban that of the relation. Aocording to this view, the absolute has relative universe in it. It is not denied. It exists in the absolute Reality but the latter is beyond it. The second view is acoepted by the Tantrika monism. It says that the absolute has no relation. The Vedanta also follows this view. The relative world 18 a play of Maya or a mere 11lā. To this view the world is umreal. 

. 

.! 

16. 

For the further olar irigation of the term, absolute', diagrams (based on M.M.) are quoted in the following: - 

TRI 

17. 

I - 'A', the absolute, has excluded the B, a symbol of the relative world and, at the same time, is fuller than it. From the Chart, it is clear that the former (A) contains the latter (B) in it. The relative world is not excluded from it (the absolute). The Malini School of Kashmir Saivism holds this view. The system has pointed out this idea by two terms, "Sakala' and 'Niskala' (mā. I, 18), meaning 'visvanaya' (immanent) and 'visvo ttirna' (transcendent). Both, immanency and transcendency or tho Reality, are agreeable to the Ma. School. 

II - 'A', the absolute, is quite separate from the 'B', the relative world. The Tantrism and the Vedanta 

explain the absolute in this senge. The supreme 1s irrelative and remains aloof from the relativity. 

As regards the nature of the supreme, the view of the Trika 19 similar to that of the Melini. It also regards the Reality as visvamaya and visvottirna. The basis of this dual character of the supreme is its twofold aspeot. The School has conceived Siva, the Reality, as a united whole or two aspects dynamic and statio. The firat character implies sakti or vimarga-rupa sakti, an essential nature of siva. As regards the second aspect, 

1t refers to its prakaga (universal 11ght) or oit tattva. 

(oonsciousness). The Reality is immanent due to its 

dynamio character. The basis of its transgendence is its statio feature. In a plainer language, we can say that the Absolute, according to the school, is balanoed state or' . Kriya (dynami9m) and jnana (static) or vimarsa and prakasa. 

To distinguish the Malini from the Tantrike School 

in conneotion with the nature of the Supreme Reality, it is entirely essential to quote the words of Pr. Hr. in the following: - 

19. 

"Vigyottirnamatmatattvariti tantrilcah. Visvamayam.......... visvottirnan visvamayam ca iti trikad idarsanavidah". - Pr. Hr. Sv. 8, Comm, 

Trom the statement, it is obvious that all of the three schools, viz. the Tantrika, the Kaula and the Trika, hold Siva as the Supreme Reality but as regards its essen tial nature, they differ from one another. The Reality, according to the Tantrikas, is transcendent. The Kaulas lay emphasis on its imanence. The Trika, on which the Malini is an authority, stresses the dual character of the Reality. It is both, immanent as well as transcendent. 

As regards the nature of the Absolute, the view. of the Malini as well as the Trika School in comparison with that of the Tantrika and the advaita Vedantio system 1s illustrated by the two diagrams, cited above. They, as a matter of fact, are not sufficient to make out the correot position of the Ma. and the Trika Sohool in con nection with the supreme. I deem 1t fit to present the basic views of the schools by other diagrams, which, in fast, will enable the students of the Kaghmir Saivism to understand it in its true perspective. They will also disclose the stages of its manifestation. They with their partioulars are given as under:19. 

· I. A B, the symbols of the absolute and tha rolutive universe or Sakti, are in an equalised state. It is a united whole of the dynamic and the statio aspects. The state points out the siva-sakti-Sanarasya or Samya avasthā (homogenious stato). 

II. A - absolute contains the B, the relative universe or sakti in it. Hetrogeniety begins in this state but it is not explicit. 

III. A - absolute and B-Sakti or the relativo world appear linked in their separate entities. The state 1s technically called 'yamala' or twin. 

IV. A, B and o refer to the absolute, the Sakti and the individual (the product of the A and B) rospective ly. The 'd' in the table points out the phenomenal universe that proceeds from the O, the limited solr. 

To estimate the position of the Ma School correot ly, the brief review of the Trika literature, divided into three parts, Agama, Spánda and Pratya bhijñā sastra, is 

necessary. 

The first and the foremost work, belonging to Agama olass, 18 siva sutras, which, as the Kashmirian tradition mentions, are revealed through Vagu Gupta. The work, as it seems from K.S. lays down the elementary prin oiples of the Trika system for the first time. The work represents itself as a type of idealistio moniam. The ultimate Prino 1ple, admitted by the School, 18 Siva, the Absolute, The system regards it, as immanent and trans oondent. The character of the work is theoretical.. 

The Spanda branch or saivism lays down the main 

prino iples of the system in a more detailed form than the 

20. 

Siva Sutra, without, or hardly, ontering into philosophical 

I susonings fu their support. 

The principal work belonging to this class 13 Spanda Karika by Kallata. The theme of the work is based on the Siva Sutras. It seems as a commentary on them. 

The author of it, no doubt, admits siva as the supreme, 

but signiricance attached to the Spanda (vibration) Sakti cannot be denied. The theoretical feature of the work can not enable us to distinguish 1t from the Siva Sutras. 

The Pratya bhijna (recognition) Sohool may be regarded as the Manana or vicara Sastra (philosophy) or the Trika. The School is founded by Siddha Somananda, most probably a pup 11 of Vasu Gupta. 

The first work which has laid the foundation of the School is Siva drsti by Somananda who deals rationally with the doctrines, tries to support them by reasonings and 

refutes the views of the opponents. 

The second chier work of the School is Isvara pratyabhijna by Utpala dova. The treatise on the School deals with the fundamental prinoiplas of the Trika ex 

haustively and, to some extent, has superseded the Siva. drati or Somanenda. 

From the brief account of the principal works on the Trika philosophy, it is cleur that they strengthen the philosophical aspect of it. As regards the practical side 

• 

of it, they gey vory little. 

The main character that 

distinguishes the Malini School from the works, cited above, 

1s its practical Yoga. It equally stresses jnana and Kriya or theory and practica. 

The other distinctive marks or the Ma. system 

21. 

that separete it from the other uvailablo wolks, such as, Svecchandatantra, vijnana Bhairava, Batanga, Mrgendra and Netra tantra of unknown authorship, are its dootrines of Punadašu and trayodusa vidhi, etc. (Mū.II). Similarly, the doctrine of the threorold anganyasa is also a pecu liarity of the system. The apara anganyesa is presoribed for the Sadhakus of the dvaita class. According to it, the body of a Sadhaka, from feet to forehead, is supposed to be 84 fingers. In this measurement, all the tattvas are to be realised. The parapara vidhi is meant for the dual plus non-dual olags of Sadhakas. The body, from feet to brahmarandhra, is considered to be 96 fingers. All the principles are realised in this space. The para method 

of the anganyaga 19 specified for the Sadhakas of the 

advaita class. The body of a Sadhaka, from feet to brahma randhra, is supposed to be 98 fingers. Twelve fingers are to be added to this measurement. In the space of 108 ringers, Sadhakas are directed to realise all the categories 

(Ma. 6th, text and notes).

III. Outline of the Trika Culture (Philosophy and religion) 

- with a brief review or its history. 

(a) -- 1. The triple thought, specially known as Trika Sasana or Sastra, is a chief branch of Kashmir Saiviam and upholds, as its name indicates, three oategories, viz., (1) Siva, all-doing and all-knowins, (2) Sakti, personal nature of the ultimate Prino iple and (3) anu, the individual 

selr under the bondage of three impurities or 1 imitations. 

The three principles, mentioned above, represent basic unity, due to which, the school is called non-dual (advaita). As a matter of fact, the one fundamental unity, by means of its freedom or Svantantrya Sakti, mani rests itself in the three forms in the state or creation. The Supreme Reality, in its solr-division, does not lose its essential nature and remains the absolute one. 

From the psychological point of view, the three prinoiples of the triune thought, Siva, Sakti and nara; correspond to consciousness, sub-conscious and unconscious - negs respectively and refer to the three phases of Indian. philosophy, viz., unity (abheda) unity in diversity (bheda - bheda) and diversity (bheda). 

From the 3 akta point of view, the trichotomy or 

the system is understood as combination of three Saktis, para, paraparā and aparā or lochā, jneng and kriya, which algo indicate abheda bhed a bheda and bheda. 

From another (tantrika) point of view, the Sohool represents three short vowels, a, 1 and u and 18 technioally oalled Sadardhakramasastre (T.3.IX) or Şadard hakr ana vijnana (T.A.I). As a matter of fact, the six vowels, a, a, i, i, u, u, are recognised as forma 

33. 

of Anuthara (šiva or oit-sakti) Ānanda (ananda sakt 1) Iccha, Igena, Unmesa and Urmi respectively in the tantrika school. The three vowelg, a, i, u, are taken out of the six, already mentioned. The name of the school is based on them and they are regarded as forms of oit (Anuttara), Iocha and Unmesa (Jnana Sakti). The long vowels a, i, u are représentatives of ananda Sakti, isana (condensed form of locha) and Urmi (condensed form of jnana). 

In connection with the meanings of the term, Trika', the Tantrika view, which stresses the three short vowels as a true form of the Trika, seems most agreeable to the Ma. of all those, already mentioned. From the text or the Ma., it is obvious that it has arranged the six vowels, mentioned above, in three groups, called Satka, Trika and ake, which represent a ā 1 uü, ai u and a respectively (cf. Tatra S ampujayet gatkam trika vapyekareva va, Ma. VIII, 109). 

There is one point to be noted in this connection. The three short vowels are associated with the oit, Iocha and jnane, recognised as the principles of the purs universe. The Kriya Sakti is intentionally eliminated from this aroup as it is related to the waya, a tattva or the impure world. The relation of the three vowels to the sacred universe implies their purity that Tantrikas and the Ma. School have kept in view. Besides, their place in the Tantrika Sadhana is no less important. 

A brief account of the three principleg is as 

under. 

I. Siva. 

The supreme Reality, Siva, is conceived as a 

United whole of the two attributes, consciousness (jnana) 

24. 

and Kriya (freedom). The characteristics are regarded as tyre espects of one Reality. The first aspect, called Toit' (oonsciousness), represents itselr as (Prakasă! (111umination). The second aspect, regarded as 'freedon or 'Kriya' represents vinarsa' or the illumined. The idea of the two aspects or siva is referred to by Ma. I, 

in other way. 

The perfect balance or the Static end dynamic aspects of sive 18 experienosd by 'I' which represents Perananta (full egoity). The I-ness of this state is symbol of perfect unity and is free from all differentiat ions. The sense of this-ness (Idam) is fully merged in the I-ness. It is the State of supreme consciousness (Para Samy it) in which subconsciousness and unconsoiousness are also latent in their unmanifested forms. 

II. Sakti. 

In the State of Menifestation, the equ1libriu or bodha (consciousness) and Kriya (freedom) is lost. The Vimarsa aspect renresenting free will of the supreme Reality 19 disegsociated from the balanced state of Jnana and Kriya. Sakti Tattve, 98 a matter of faot, is not an independent unit. It is the freedom of Siva, manifested in the form or Sakti. Due to this separation of freedom, developed as 

gakti', limitation begins in the essential nature of Siva, who was regarded as free agent, all-door, (omniscient and Omnipotent). In the Sakti State, the aense of diversity begins to emerge. mhe definite nature of this dirferen tietion 13 yet not known. Sakti, no doubt, 19 a seed of limitation, which hsg not been externalised. The State is also experienced by the 'I'. The I-ness of the Sakti 

State is different from that of the Siva State. 

The .I! 

25. 

or the latter is emlar than thet of the former. The 'I' or the Šekt 1 ig bent tovards this-ness (Idanta). At any rate, we cannot establish salti, as a geperate entity, apart from siva, It is his instrument by which he delimits Fimself. 

. From psychological point of view, Sakti is sub conso lous state of the perfectly conscious Siva. It falls between two roles, 1.6. consciousness and unconsciousness. Sakti is neither perfectly congcious nor totally uncona cious. It is means that transforms the absolutely oonscious into the totally unconscious. It helps the Infinite to make Itself finite. 

III. Nara (Limited Self). 

Nero, technically called "anu", represents limited form of sive, who has abscurated His essential nature by His own free w111. It is a bound state (Buddha-avastha) of the Roality, created by Its sakti. The equilibrium or bodha and Kriya, which represents Siva state is totally lost in the Anu State. The Kriya aspect appears as Sakti, which again divides the bodha aspect and manifests it ag Anu. As a matter of fact, Nara and Siva are not distinct from each other (of. Jīvaḥ,Sivah Sivo Jivah Sa Jivah Kevalah Sivah. kui ?. Cha. IX-42). 

Thus the one whole (Purna), appearing itself in the three forms, does not lose its essential characteristio. The one remaing one. Siva 18 like universal artist. His Sakti is just like a brush. The anu is a picture which the Artist draws by His brush, the Sakti. The instrument and the product corresponding to sakti and Nara aro not. dirrerent from siva, the Universal artist. The pioture, drawn by His free will, is the universe of phenomena. 

28. 

The three principles, nar'a, sakti and siva are teonnically termed as 'Sthula' (gross), Sukşma (Subtle) and Para (Beyond subtle), respectively. The trichotomy of the system is applicable to all the tattvas (elements ) and fundamentals, conneoted with the Saiva School (of.. Sthulam suksmem param viduh (T.A.).

2. Before we explain Spanda and Pratya bhijna in relation to the Trika, it is proper to say a word or two a bout the siddhanta and the Pasupate Schools or sa ivism, which, in spite of their agreement with the Trika in their externals, basically differ from it in fundamentals. 

· Siddhanta Selva School is a duelist in the sense that it believes in the existenoe of the three basio prin ciples, viz., Siva, Sakti and Vindu. Siva is said to be pure and absolute conscious. It is imrautable in character and is regarded as Cidrupa. As regards the sakti principle, it is also conceived to be cidrupa but it is not statio like siva. Phenomenal expansions and contractions or movements are assigned to its dynamic nature. Both, siva and Sakti are immaterial. Vindu, in its pure and impure form, is matter aria is the material basis of the created 

universe. 

. 

. 

Man, as such, is of the nature of siva though this nature may remain clouded or obscured until it is finally restored to its divino status. 

According to the Pasupata School, Pati (Lord), Pasu (animal) and Paga (bonds or fetters) are the three ultimate principles. Pati or more correctly Pasupati (Siva) is divine. Pagu is also conceived divine by nature and is under the bondage of matter called Paga. When this bond 19 snapped it regains its diyine character but not the status of Mehesvaratva or Lordship. 

The chief characteristic of the school is its conception or Mukti (11beration). It admits a lower form of mukti, called Kaivalya (freedom). This is callad. duhkhenta or Kairalya mukti when the pasu is freed from the chaing of the world and from all the miser les incidental 

30. 

to the worldly life. The pasu-nature still continues. Suoh a pasu is called niranjana, as opposed to sanjana, but it is not divine. 

In the Trika system, siva and Nara (individual 

self) are one. When siva is under limitations, it becomes pasu or animal. When fetters are removed, it is again Śiva (or. Pasabaddho bhavej fivah pasamuktah sadasivah, vi. Bhai). It is the fakti of siva, oalled roddhri, that veils his essential nature and he appears as a pasu. when he rsa ing his essential character through his own Sakti, called vikas ini in this case, he becomes Siva. Thus, sakti in this school is most important tattva. Both, pasu-bhava and Siva-bhava are dependent upon it. The School is styled as an idealistic monist. The one appears in three forms oraated by its own freedom. In spite of the triple form, the one is still one.

3. The Term, 'Spanda' (Lit., Inown as movement), 

O 

Ocurg O 

Eng 

represents itself as an aspect of the Trika and exposes the secrets which are latent in the Sakti or śiva. The word "Spanda" occurs once in Ma. 18th, 5 in the sense of a vibration situated in the human heart. A Sadhaka 1g . directed to meditata on this movement, which according to Ma. seems to mean The Supreme Prino iple. 

Abhinava Gupta has also explained the term (Spanda) in the sense of Parama Siva or Suprene conscious negg, which manifests Itself in the three forms, called Siva, Sakti ond Nara, correspond ing to the avyakta (non dual) vyaktavyakta (dual plus non-dual) and vyakta or dual (ot. Ekasya Spandanasya iga tridha bheda vyavasthitih. T.A. 5th.). Similarly the Spandana is also used in the sense of Anuttara #meaning the Supreme Self or Siva". 

31. 

The Euthor of 9.1.9. in the 1st. Ka., has used 

the Spanda in the sense or flutter or movement. According to this text, Siva Tattya is the first flutter of Parema siva. 

It enables us to say that the Spanda is freedom (svatantrya Sakti), regarded as an aspect of Parama siva. The advocates of this free will have raised it to a high status and explained the same as a separate, Spanda sakti by writing treatises on it. As a matter of fact, its value 18 as an aspect in the Trika and not a separate school. 

Like the Spanda the Pratyabhijna (recognition) 19 not a separate school and is connected with the aspect #consciousness' of Perama Siva. The supreme self and the individual self are identical in the state or liberation. This identity is forgotten in the creative State due to ita own freed om. The recognition of the lost identity is' oall ed Pratyabhiina. 

The foundership of the Spanda is attributed to Kellata, a pupil of Vasu Gupta. The principal work oon taining the tenets of the aspect is spanda Karikago by Kallata. It is a controversial point that Spanda Karikas 

are not an independent work. They represent the theme of the Siva Sutras which are said to have been revealed to Vasu Gupta by Sivá. As tradition mentions, they were inscribed on a rock on the Mahadeva hill, four miles far from the Nishada carden in Srinagar in Kashmir. He taught them to his pupil, Kallata, who composed the Spanda Karika on them for the instruotion of his own pupils. 

The followers of the Spanda system hold that Siva 

as a supreme Reality is neither an erficient nor a material 

gaus e. 

According to them, God is independent and he 

32. 

greates the world merely by the force of his will. This Torce or Şakti, regarded as responsible for the projection, maintenance and the destruation of the universe, is called Spanda. This sakti is a nain raotor that bringe an imal state as well as liberated state to $iva. A sadhaka realising this spanda tattva can know his real natura (S.N.N1. Com. Ist Ka Ibid. III N1.Ka 16). 

The authorship of the Pratya bh1jna (recognition) is ascribed to Somanande, whose main work is 'Siva Drst1'. The other principal treatise on it is Isvara Pratya bhijna by Utpaladeva, the commentator or which is Abhinava Gupta. The votaries of the aspoot hold that Siva is the fundamental Reality, which appsars as a phenomenel universe. They lay eruphasis on the Abhasa (Evolution) Vada, according to which, the world of multiplicity is evolved b ra, which was ideal -ly existent in the Reality. 

The main topic of the Fratya Bhijna aspect 19 

en identity of the individual sell and the material worla vith SiV9. Like the Trika thought, which mentiong the 

unity of the three Tattvas, the aspect also admits the unity of the limited self, the sakti and the universal self. The doctrine of the crention of the World and the relation 

betreen the individual soul and the supreme soul are the 

same in this aspect as they are held by the Trika School. All diversity proceeds from unity and to reach the latter one should begin from diversity. To approach this unity is the primary the system deals with. But its approach is dirferent. The limited self and the supreme soul are 

indentical. 

The nature of the former is not separate from 

that of the latter. The former has totally forgotten his essential nature, owing to the three taints, 1.8., anava, Karma and Maya Mala. The system mentions that the lost 

N) 

identity is recognised. 

The Anu, when it recognises its 

identity with Siva, is no more animel. 

It becomes Siva. 

The Sohool, like the Vedanta, does not mention that the phenomenal universe is an illusion. According to 1t, the material world is a reality. The mundane world is, in reality, Lpsychical life of the all-soul (Śiva), projected outwardly. The uppeurenco (Srsti) and dissolution (Pralaya) 

are said to be urmesa (opening) and 'Nimesa' (closing or $1va). Be awakens, the world, potentially latent within Fim, comes into being, when He 13 in the waking State, the world of phenomene exists. When he goes to sleep the world 

withdrewn into Him and disappears. He is asleep and the world rests with Him As a potential magnitude till the now day of waking comes. Thus the world is not dirferent from the objectified or materialised conseiousness or Siva. siva, according to the philosophy, is simultaneously both cause and effect. He is quiescent and is always in perfoot repose. It is the doctrine of the Svantantrya or sovereign ty of God's will that imparts an impetus to the wordly process. . Thus the sakti of siva is algo prim un datum in this school. 

The principle of the Prayabhijna school, in short, 

1s that the individual golf in man is 3 iva. This identity of the limited self with the universal self is forgotten owing to the nascience and delusion. When this innowa 

identity is brought or recognised, it is Pratyabhijna (I.P.A.). For example a King knows a man. Owing to some reasons, he forgets him. The minister of the king, 

presenting the man before him, says - This is the man whom you already know'. The knowledge or the man to the king is recognition. When the three taints of the limited.self disappear, it becomes aware of its siva state like the 

prince who was taken away by a cowherd und was brought up in his association. He forgot his roal mature but when he 

recognised his princely state, he was no more a cowhera. 

According to the Vedanta philosophy, the whole universe is Brahman. The appearance of the phenomenal universe is Maya, or an 11lusion. The individualselt (livatman) does not realise itselr that it is Brahman. It is deluded by Maya. Sometimes a man mistakes a ropo for a snake owing to darknes's. Similarly the world ig Bratman but due to Maya it is not perceived correctly in its true perspective. The rope cannot be a snake. It is darkness that presents the reality in other form. When this misleadice element 18 ronioved, the reality appears as it is. The Vedanta reaches the Reality by negation. It denies the world, which, according to it, is a false show. Frou the Saiva point of view, the world is reality. It cannot be denied. The universe is siva. The limitedselr 1s algo Śiva. It has forrotten its true nature that He is 3iva. To misunderstand a rope as a snake is not due to the darkness. According to the Salva Philosophy, it is forget fulness that works out and presents the rope in the form or a snake. When the reality is recognised, there is snake. It is the rope, which, for the time being, was forgotten and was misunderstood as a snake. 

To sum up the fundamentals and dogmatics of the three, Trika, Spanda and Pratyabbijna, it would not be out of place to mention here that the Trika Philosophy is a blend of the three ways of God-realisation. The Spanda mentions the energy of the Lord Siva ag all in all. For 

the realisation of this energy, an aspirant is ordered to 

oontinue his meditation on the object till the vision or that supreme Bhairara comes. It is a Dhyana Yoga". By 

35. 

this method all the impurities are oloered away and the en 

med itator attains to eternal Bliss in the end. 

The Pratyabhijña method is different. It does not mention any control of breath (Franayama eto.) for the attainment of the supreme vision of Sive. It maintains that the r6penition of oneself a9 3its is the way to obtain 11 beration. This method is philosophical and J.C. Chatterjee aalls it a "Manang" or "yichera" Šāstra (K.$.). 

The Trika does not emphasise any one method. It equally mentions Kriya-yoga (anavopeya) inolud ing dyana yoga, saktopaye (Kriya frena) and Samonavopaya jnana). The system represents itself as a compendium of the various 

methods for spiritual Sadhana. 

4.From the Vedic age, it appears that Sabd ad or Mantras were regarded as a chief means to self-realisation. The spiritual efforts of the Vedic seers for God-realisation were absolutely based on them. They, therefore, from the earliest times, we find, have a close correspondence between the two aspects of Brahman, 1.0. Sabda brahman and Para brahman. Sabda brahman, represented by a Vedio Mantra, wag considered to be realisation of Para brahman. This method of Yoga, later on, came to be known as "Vagyoga (Lit. unification of speech, techa, realisation of God. through speech or Sabda). We find it stated in the traditional literature of Vafyakaranes (Cremmar leng) or whom Bhartr Hari was best representative. He has clarified the position of Sabda and restored it to the divine status (or. Anad inidhanam brahma gabda tattvam pracakșate. Vivar titi 'rthabhävena prakriyā jago yatah, Va. p.). Parallel to the Vedic line, we come to know the same truth in the Tantrika line of oulture. Here we find a very close analysis of the structure of Sabda and the science or the 

e 

36. 

Ame 

Matrka that came to be developed in the Tentrika School in course of time. So called letters of the alphabet are und erstood, in reality, es ultimate units of vocal speech. Great Yogins applied their enervy to an investigation or all these principles, which constituts Mantras, and formu lated their views in their own ways. From the study of 

history, we find that there were at least two methods or 

arrangement of letters in the alphabet current in tho . anoient times. One method follows the genetic order or letters. According to this method, from the five princip centres of the articulato speech, from larynx to the lips, there arose five successive orders of both, vowels and consonants (cf. Akniha viser janiyanam kathah, etc.). This is the normal order, specially based on the I U laryngeal system, in vogue today. But there appears to have been another gecret order, in which, the alphabet begins with 'naand ends with pha'. This peculiar arrangement is favoured by so called Ma. School, such as, distinguished from the other Matrka School. It seems that it is a very great spiritual significance. 

The Ved 10 method of Sadhana, as we see, is in timately related to the Mantras, formed by tha units of syllables. This line of Sadhana is still continuing in the Tantrika Cult. Besides, the great spiritualists or the Tantrika period have found out the other method of Sadhana, called Varnayoga, as distinguished from the Mantra yoga. They have proved the fact by their personal exper. ience. Meditation or concentration on a certain phone yields the fruit, similar to that of the Mantra-Yoga. The recitation of an individual letter (Varna) is no less important than that of the Mantras. The ultimate goal, 

according to both, Varna-yoga and Mantra-yoga, is equal. 

The Tantrika approach to the unity through the .Varnas is 

37. 

shorter than that of the Vedio School through the Mantres 

but both are logically and psychologically based on sound prino iples. The former, in comparison with the latter, is simple and does not require the rich materials the latter needs. Moreover, the 'Tantrika way of self-reali sation through this method has no restriction. Any man or any class is admitted to the Sadhana of this culturo. 

In this respect, the reis of the Tantrika oult are more broad-minded and generous than those belonging to the Vedio School. The Vedio Sadhana, in short, is meant for 

men of a special class. 

Mantras, as we learn from the Vedas are arranged in groups. The seers have assigned them to particular deities. Likewise, the scholars of the Tantrika system 

have arranged the letters of the alphabet into two groups, 

vowels and consonants, technically called "Vija" and 

Yonin which represent one doity, Siva, in his two aspects, viz., sive und Sakti. This monistic trend," as opposed to that of polytheism, found in the early history of the Vedas, is a peoullarity of the Tantrika School. 

Ascreption of the two-fold letter to Siva and Sakti has affected the saiva and the sakta cult, which, in this respect, are mutually related to each other. The Siva principle is oldrupa and static. The sakti is regarded as dynamio and is said to be part and parcel or siva. The equalised state or the statio and the dynamic 

aspect makes Parama Siva, understood as tattvatita or 

beyond name and form. From the point of view of the Varna Yoga, both, vowels and consonants, are representations or the 'Siva and Sakti prino ipleg. Varna-Yoga and Vyanjana Yoga, 18, in fact, a symbol of Saiva Yoga in its two ag peats, siva and Sakti. Šaive Yoga, itself with its 

38. 

. 

symbolio form, is the inain theme of the Saiva and Salcta 

Tantras in general. 

From the historical point of view, the progrerg ive development or the Šalva and the sakta cult is briealy mentioned. As regards the development of Kashmir Saivom It seems a fact that it has added one more principle, called "jiva" or "anu" to the twin (siva and sakti), already developed in the Tantrika culture of India and named it as "Trikam. The third principle, "anu', is understood as a joint product of Siva and Sakti, regarded as father and mother, in the form of a son. The three principles of the system, as a matter of fact, represent basic unity and refer to the doctrine of oneness (cf. Ekoham vahuh syam) of the Vedio oulture. The system speoially points the doctrine of evolution and explains it how one becomes many (or. Ekam vagtu dvidhā bhutam eto. P.T.). The first work, containing the elementary princi ples of the system is siva Sutra, revealed to Vasu Gupta, a Kashn Irian saga, through stva a Siddha. The time of Vagu Gupta's flourish, stated by R.G.Bhandarakara and Dr. Sudhendu Kunar Das in their works, HV.S.M.R." and 3 rospectively, is the oth contury A.D. The non-dual natur of the systen, mentioned in the work, reduces the phono menal universe to the fundamental unity which is character. 1ged as "Caitanyamatma", s. 3ec., ist. Sec. The occasion references to the letters, representing Siva and Sakti are 

also founâ in the work. 

Its value as a representation of 

the Trika tenets in brief, 18, no doubt, remarkable. 

Kallata and Somananda, two pupils or Vasu Gupte, oont inued the tradition of the Trika system by their two respeo tive works, Spandakarika and Siva drsti. The linet 

work, as we have already mentioned, is reproduction of the39. 

game theme we find in the Siva Sutras. 

The second work, 

as its name signifies, deals with the Saiva philosophy. 

Throughout the work, the author stresses the idealistic 

monism of the school. The author favoirs the thoory or evolution (abhagavada) and explains hov: moultiplicity begins from unity (cf. Yogivu nirupai anamartha jatam prokasayat s. dr.). The work, airsotly or ind ireotly, is related to the Trika School and lays down the foundation of the Pratya bhijñā. 

The contributions of Utpaludeva, the disciple of Somananda, to the triple thought are very great. He 

adopted the game three principles and explained them on the besis of pratyabhijna (recognition). He lays much emphasis on the forgetfulnose or siva that puts him under 1 imitations. The recognition of this state is, according to him, liberation which can be achieved by means or jñana (philosophy). 

Another chief contributions to the syster are the works of Abhinava Gupta. Tantraloka in 32 chapters, called ahnika, entirely deals with Saivism of Kashmir. The work itself is a commentary on 2!al ini. The author of T.A., though eocepts the views of his predece 380rs but his pre 

ference is to that of via. which he calls 'Briplerva Sastra'. 

He seems to explain the fundamentals of the latrka School 

but in support of his views, he orten quotes Malini. 

The method of the Varna-Yoga, as we have seen it, is ohiefly related to tho latters of two types, vovels and oongonants. The order of the alphabet, in which vowels 

and consonants are comingled, is also associated with the Varna-Yoga and has its own significance. This order is favoured by the Ma. Sohool and it refers to the perfect unity. The system does not accept the two-Told division 

of letters and their assignment to give and Sakti. 

The 

O 

Matrka system reaohes the baslo unity through duality. But the system Approaches the unity through unity. As Siva and Sakti are basioally one, similarly their ropre 

sentatives, vowels and consonants are also one. 

The exponents of the Malin i system have gone to the extreme. They are not prepared to accept difference between vowels and consonants, representing Siva and Sakti, and therefore they have commingled them in support or their 

view. 

This is a new approach to the Supreme Unity. For the first time, we have seen it in the system. All letters are equal and refer to the Malini Sakti behind when the transcendent siva exists. 

Apart from this distinctive feature of the Na. 

School, the other characteristio of the system is its prac tical Yome. The Malini cultura has understood theory and praotice or philosophy and religion as two aspeots of one thing. Theory without inner experience can not live long. Religion without the theoretioel support is lamo. In the system, both, jnana und practice, go side by side. 

In the process of spiritualisation, according to 

the Tantrika Sadhana, there are three states, viz., puri 

ricatory, illuminant and unifying, rslated to tho three bodies of an agpirant, vayic, Sakta and vaindava. "The first state implieg the bhuta suddhi which results in the removal of the Mayio body. The second state points out the nanodaya (the state of 11lumination or sthiti). 15 is not possible unless the sakte body is formed. The tert stresses the utility or the bhinna yoni Malini for 

the formation of this deha (Ma. III, 36 ) which is trans 

-rorine 

into the Vrindava body. 

As regards the literature of the Ma. system, we have got only three works, Maliniy ijayottara tantra, Tantraloka and Malinivijaya vartika by Abhinava Gupta. T.A. mainly deals with the Matrka School but occasional references to the Malini are not missing. The third 'work 1s e commentary on Malini, Vi. and seems incompleto. It has dealt with a few fundamentals of the system in a very dirrioult language. The only source that enables us to expose the nature of the system 13 the text of the Malini Vi. 

To say anything on the correct position of the School is very difficult. The system is intimately re 

lated to Purva Malini (preliminary section of the work), 

Siddhayogisvari, siddha and Namaka tantra, which are not available at present.

-- 

1It is the spontaneous and innate tendency or 

human mind that it attempts to find out the solution or the mystery of the universe after the task of meeting tho 

immediate necessities of life. We must regard this inward maroh of human mind as the origin or philosophy. Tho human understanding, in its solitude, wants to find an explanation of the phenomenal multiplicity and variety. It desires to 

know whether this visible plurality can be traced to the 

original unity and whether this seeming variety is unreal. 

It tries to ponder over the cause of the present disordu 

and disconnectedness behind which the porrect harmony exists. This search or human reason for some common ground or fundamental unity, whero all diversities return and where all wbys are stopped, is a true aim of philosophy. The nature of this common ground, as Sastras describo, 18 

eternal and whence tall 18 never possible (cr. Yad gatva na nivartante tadhana par aman mama. Bha. 61.) Whon a man reaches the Absolute Unity, he feels that all his faculties have attained their richest fruition. In this perfect state, nothing remains unknown to him. By the knowledge of the Infinitude everything becomes known to him (cr. Yasmin vijnate Sarvamidam vijñatam bhavati, cha. U. Chap. VI). It is a state of the perfect Homogeniety where no hetrogeniety remains. The Bhagvat Gita has explained this 

state as follows: 

"Yam Labd hva caparam labham manyate nadhikan tatah, VI, 22 (Attaining which nothing in this universe seems to be better). 

It is the funotion or philosophy that it dis oloses the inner vision of a man and brings the direct! 

experience of the Absolute which pervades his whole system with the unspeakable joy. It is the intuitivo experience 

of the Absolute that we are enabled to have a correct estimate of philosophy. All human reasonings should continue until'the final goal, the perfect synthesis is reached. The real value of philosophy lies in the attain inent of the absolutely homogenious Reality. 

There is a considerable difference between the conception of philosophy as it is understood by the Indian systems of philosophy on the one hand and as it is taken to be by the Western Philosophers on the other. Although we noto important points of similarity between the philosophi oal discussions of the Westera thinkers and the Indian systems of philosophy st111 we cannot ignore the fundamental digt inotion between them. Philosophy, in the West, 12 tha words of Dr. Nalini Kanta Brahma in his work P.H.S., is the 

Thinking consideration of things. It is the rational 

explanation of the universe as a whole. Thus, in the West, Philosophy is somathing purely intellectual. It is lilo the other subjects of study and bears no special importance. The transcendent mer it and the indepenient character of philosophy which the six schools of the Indian philosophical systems emphasise are not recognised in the Weat. In the East, Philosophy is taken as summum bonum of life. It is understood as be-all and end-all or life in India. It 19 hardly anything more than an intelleotual pastime in the West. In this connection the words of 3 ir Radha Krishnan are remarkable - "In many other countries of the world, reflection on the nature of existence 19 a luxury of life. The serious moments are given to action, while the pursuit or philosophy comes up as parenthesis. In the West, even 

in the hey-day of its youth as in the tinies of Plato and Aristotle, it leaned for support on some other study as 

Politics or Ethics - - In India, philosophy stood on its 

own legs, and all other studies looked to it for inspiration and support. I.P. Vol.I. 

The Indian mind has regarded philosophy as ons of 

TOOI 

the chief egt means that solve the richest problem of sal vation considered as the ultimate good of human liro. It relieves men of the miseries of life and bestows on hin the indescribabla bliss. A man, seeking emancipation from the fearful bondage, occupies himself with the study of philoso phy. The intellectual discussions available in the Indian Philosophy are not merely intended to supply the needs or intellect. They are meant to serve the ultimate and funda mental need of human life, viz., The nsed of liberation. 

In India, philosophy originates when a man feels a need or erano ipation, when he desires something nore than the objects of the ordinary interest. Thus the Hindu philosophy acog 

not find its origin in the love of wisdom cr in the desiro 

to know something (Jinaga). 

It comes into being wiona 

man desires for proteotion from the wordly bonds. In the Wegt, philosophy means to achieve vision for its own saks. and not for any praotial purpose. The theoritical charac ter of philosophy has got much eraphasis and its practical aspect has been throw behind there. The case, in India, is different. The theory has been subordinated to the practice. It is the praotical aspeot of philosophy that inatters much in India. Practice has a full domination over theory. Thus theory and practice, or philosophy and re ligion have kept pace with each other. In most cases re ligion has preceded philosophy. In India, as a matter or fact, philosophy is founded on religion, faith and intuitivo experience. Indian thinkers neither advocate actless W12 dom nor support wisdonless acts. They are equally attaohod to aotion and contemplation. They are active first and then! contemplative. Individual rəis first of all, have got vision of the Absolute by their intuitive experienco. Later on, the same oxperience is philosophically ligoussed and its value 13 determined for the ordinary people. In India, the philosophies which are not based on the intuitive experience or taith, have got no long life. We should also beer the fact in mind that in some cases, religious exper ience comes after ratiocination (Vicara) which is supposed to be the function of philosophy. In the Vedanta, for example, we find that intuition (dargana) is supposed to come after meditation (Nididhyasana) which again follows ratiooination (Manana.). It does not matter much whether religious experience or intuition comes first and ratio 

oination takes place after it, or meditation falls rirst and intuition 19 its fruition. The fact, which we have to emphasise in this connection, is the interrelation or 

religion and philosophy. 

In India, theory and practice 

are Interwoven in every schoci or philosophy. 

They aro 

nover a Ivorced from each other in the six systems of the 

Indian Philosophy. 

As a matter of fact, reason and intuition are not two separate things. They are regarded as two aspects or one attempt or approach. The ultimate goal of these two criteria is one, viz., Salvation. From this point or view, the aim of the Nyaya and Vaisegika, of the Sankhya and the 

Yoza, of the Vedanta and Mimaasa, of the Buddhist and the Jain, is the game, 1.9., the attainment of the Highest and and complete emancipation from all miseries. It is very dirfioult to state that the Vedanta and the Sankhya are philosophies aná not religions. In reality, theory and practice are mixed in the six system of philosophy. Un doubtedly, in India, philoşophy and religion are but theori tioal and practical aspects or one attempt at realising the final end of life. Thus reason and faith or philosophy and religion should be regarded as two oriteria or the Righest truth. 

2. According to Abhinava Gupta, philosophy or jnana is that by which the knowledge or the fundamental Unity or absolute whole (Purna Prathatnaka) is obtained. This jnana is said to be or two kinds, that is, baudaha (related to budahi or intellect) and paurusa (related to Purusa or spirit). Both intellectual and spiritual jnana 

are required for the supreme goal in the saiya philosophy. 

Tither of them will not autrice. 

Similarly the Ajnana (Ignorance) has also two kinds paurusa ajñana and baud üha ajnana. By the paur uşa ajnana, we moun anava mala, which is intimately associated with Anu or individual solr. For its destruotion, Saiva philosophy stresses Diksa. Suppose this afnana is 

destroyed by Diksa and the anu 10 purified but Bauddha' ajnene remeins in its active state, shall we get liberation? This question is answered by T.A. in the 1st.A. Tho des-, truotion of Paurusa Ajnane certainly brings freedom (inolaa) after the fall of this physical body. In life-time wo can not experience the state of liberation, because the bauddha a jngna exists and stands in the way or the true self realisation. Intellectually we do not know whether we are spiritualised or not. Thus for the attainment of livan 

Mukti, the removal of the bauddha ajnana is indispensable, 

As the disappearance of bauddha ajnana 1s 63822 

tial for the realisation of Jlvan Mukti, similarly the doli verance from paurusa Ajnana is highly essential for the attainment of supreme liberation according to Saiva school or thought. Suppose, we are elevated intellectually and spiritualised by the study of holy soriptures but our paurusa mala or anava taint remains in its active state, 

shall we have supreme state as it is acceptable to the Saiva School? Acoording to the school or the Vedanta, liberation 19 based on bauddha jnana on which it lays muoh 

emphasis. From the Tantrika point of view, it is a mere freedom or vijnana kaivalya and not supreme state which can be obtained after the destruction or paurusa ajunans. 

From whatever is stated above, it has to be noted : 

that pa urusa jnana and bauddha jnana are interrelatod. 

A 

mere removal of paurusa ajnana by paurusa jnana will not 

bring jivan mukti. Similarly the destruction of bauddha ajnana by bauddha jnana cannot achieve gupreme state. 

3. The system equally stresses jnane (philosophy) and kriya (prnotice) as means to self-realisation. About the meanings of the term onena', we are sure that 10 moang ratiocination (vioara) or meditation (manaca). But the 

47. 

terra kriya 13 perplexing and is understood differently. 

The tarin, according to the Gita, meens desirelegs acts. 

The Mimansa school of Jairini, by Kriya, takos sacrilicia) actions (yajña). The yoga school of Patanjali explaing the tarm in the songe of physical and physiological acti 

vities of human body. 

The founder of the school hag ohier 

ly applied the term in the sense of the inner or spiritual experience which is intimately related to the Kriya diksa or paurusa diksa (spiritual initiation). From the occasional references to the physical yoga, it is wanirego that the school also favours the yogio method of Sadhana. 

From the vurious doctrines mentionod in the following pages, we are sure to believe that they are not mere formulas. Their deep spiritual eignificance cannot be ignored. The philosophical illustrations of the system are entirely related to the inner experience. 

(I) Philosophy of seven promatrs mainly points out seven grades of Sadhakas according to their spiritual capacity. These stages, viz., Sakala, pralayakala, vijnanakale, mantra, mantresvara, mentrar ahegvara and Siva, as a matter of fact, are direct references to tho gradual spiritualisation of aspirants. 

mentre 

ASV 

Of these seven Praratrs, the 3akala is the lowest 

experienoer which represents et symbol or completo materia 

lity and diversity. 

The Pranata of this class regains in 

volved in tha three ripur itios, 1.e., angve, karma and mayiya. It is the stage of unboundei diversity. 

The Pralayakala Prematr has the same qualities, 

which are found in the Sakala, except one Karmamala. This experiencer also has no possibility of deliveranoo und 11 the 

diesolution takes place. 

48. 

The vijnanakala 13 the third state in the ascent to the supreme Pramatr, sive, into which for the first time, the idea of the subjective unity begins to peep and which is far superior to the states, already mentioned. Only anava Mala (innate ignorance) dominates it, while the other two taints come to an end. As a matter of fact, it is an intermediate state of duality and non-duality (dvaita-dvaita.), The Pramatr 1s gaid to be between the two tattvas, i.o., pure and impure (Mayordhvam suddha vidyadhah). 

... The Mantra Pramatr is a bit better than tho Vijnanakala. The tendency of this Pramatr is more inward than that available in the preceding Pramatr. The anava mala, which a bounds in the Vijnanakala, begins to proceed towards destruotion. The idea of perfect unity appears in its wavering state, that is, sometimes, it appears whilo at others it disappears. The full balanced tranco (Hirvi kpaka Samadhi) of Yoga, which is experienced in the next higher Pramata is yet very far. 

In the Mantresvara state, the derilement anava is in the position of being destroyed (ahzansamana). The Sad haka of this state begins to realise the subjectivo unity whioh pervades the whole universe including him. But perfect onenegg has not yet got hold of his inner 

being. His mind is more bent on the subject than that in the Mantra state. 

In the Mantramehegyara state, the Anava Mala 13 

destroyed (Dhvasta). It is a perfect state of the mental balance from which all thoughts or dirferentiation begin to disappear. The Sadhaka at this stage does not find any divergence between his self and the sell of tho universo. It is a high Yogio trance from which a fall is rarely expected. We can technically term it as a "Turiya state. 

*49. 

No doubt there is a oneness of the subject and object in it but the supreme oneness or the idea of the impergonal God which has been described as beyond all human approaches und which has been designated as "pure' or 'Turiyatita" is yot to be obtainable. 

The siva state is the last one in which the ascend - 

ing effort of the lower Prametrs stops. 

On the one hand, 

it is a starting point and on the other, it is a destination also. The supreme prino iple begins his downward march and 

the phenomenal universe 19 manifested. 

It 19 called 

Sangara or jagat. When the same High Reality begins to agoend, the manifested World is withdrawn into it. It is 

called dissolution or Pralaya. For Its independent desa cent and agcent, the Svatantrya Sakti or free will or It is responsible. No foreign element or stimulus is needed for this twofold process as it happens by its own free will. Thus this w111 or Iocha sakti of the Lord is an instrument in the evolution of the universe of Phenomena in the scrip ture Samud radi jagat krtsnam parivarta yatiochaya”. 

The Siva state is really ever-existent and over blessed, and supreme oneness prevails in it. It is a puro Advaita or 'Paramadvaita'. According to this state tho separate experiences of 'you' and 'I' disappear. There 13 no more the idea of siva, Sakti and Nara. The only on perience that emerges from this State ig "I am alls. The name and form owing to which the ever-blessed one experian des itself as many are removed. The only thought that revives in this state is 'I am Siva and I exist everywhere. 'Myself 19 Śiva'. Saiva philosophers call it Ātma-Liiga or Saiya-linga which is said to be worshipped. It must bo stated in this connection that the Phallus workship prova 

lent among the Hindus at present is a mere symbol or this 

50. 

supreme Saive State. 

Dr. K.C.Pandey has mentioned eight pranatrs in his work "A.H.P.S." page 164-5. According to la., tho 

pramatrs are seven and the doctrina OL pancadasa vidhi 19 

based on them. 

(II) It is not out of place to mention tha three popular Lingas specially referred to by the advocates or the Kashmir saivism to be worshipped for the self reall sation. 

The first Linga called 'Apara Linga! or "Vyalta Linga' is a symbol of an exoterio Sadhana (Bahiranga Sadhana) in which external objects are emphasised to be worshipped. This linga is meant for the Sadhakas who are beginners. It is an elementary stage acoording to whioh, emphasis has been laid on the object-factor. The process of this Vyalta Linga, prescribed for beginners, correspond to the well known anavapaya, one of the three means mentioned for the realisation of the self in saivism. The worship of the 'Apara Linsa' implies the duality which has got hold of spiritual seekers. In this stege subject and object aro understood as two separate entities. 

2. The gecond Linga is termed as "Vyaktavyakta' or 'Parapara Linga' and corresponds to the Sakt opaya prescribed' for the saühakas or Sakti State. The state refers to tho unity-in-diversity. The distinctions between the subjeot and object begin to disappear. This Liriga is superior to the previous one. From this state, the esoteric (Antaranga) 

Sadhana, which is specially associated with the spiritual 

realisation, begins. 

3. The third linga designated as 'avyakta. Or 

"Para Linga' is condentsi with the Sambhavopaya', mentioned 

51. 

for the highest apirants. In this state all diversities 

come to an end. The subjootive unity emerges out. It is the state or perfect harmony where suprene Reality pro dominates. 

(III) So far as the philosophy for the work in 

concerned., seven ways (Vidhi), connected with the above 

mentioned geven classes of the experiencers, aro siven a special inportance in order to approach the hichest Reality. The first and the lowest way, 1.0., Panoudaga Viahl, is prescribed for the Sakala Pramatr who is totally involved in the three impurities and who represents the worst possible form of the Pr'amatr. According to the Pancadasa Vidhi, geven Pranatrs with their saven Skatis bogin their practice on the object, whion is technically called a Sya rupa or form. This dharana or Pancadasa Vidhi is meant 

for materiolistio type, full of Sadhakas or the three 

Males and revolving round matter. 

The second way, Trayodaga Vidhi is said to be useful for the Pralayakalas, who with the other rive Pramatrs and their Saktis begin to meditate on the object, which, in this case, is 3 akala Prumatr with his Šalti. After the Pancadasa vidhi, the Sakala Pramatr with his Sakti losos his personal entity as a Promatr and assumos the form of an object or Svarupa in the Trayodagavidhi. The name of this way is the thirteontold method or trayo dasa Vidhi as it consists of six experiencers, viz., Iron Pralayankala to siva in ascending order with their sis $aktis and one object. 

The third way, called the Ekadasavidhi', nouns 

the rive measurers with their five Saktis and one Svarupa (Pralayakala with his Sakti) and represents the formation of the elevenfold method. 

52. 

In Navuvidhi the vijnanakala with h19 Sakti bo. 

comes a Svarupa and the other four Pramatrs with the 11 Saktis 

rema in as experiencers. 

All the four Pranatrs or this 

olags belong to the pure creation of the fivo pura prinda ples, 1.e., Suddha Vidya Isvara Sada śiva, Śakti aná ģive. 

According to the Saptavidhi, Mantra Pramatr with his Sakti becomes e Svarupa. The remaining throo Pramatrs 

with their Saktis appear as experienoers. 

In the Pancavidhi Mantramahesvara and Siva with 

their respective Saktig are experiencers and tho Mantra 

svara with his Sakti remains a Svarupa. 

In the trividhi Siva, with his Sakti is experiencer 

The Mantramanešvara with his Sakti become3 Svarupe. 

The 

framing of these seven doctrines is reasonable because thoy 

are useful for men of various temporamonts. 

(IV) The philosophy or the five states, asoribed to the supreme Reality, is not less important. These states are also connected with the rive faces and the livs functions or the Lord Siva. As a matter or fact, siva in 

his essential character, is unity and represents supramo 

consciousness. 

The five states are the variations of the 

Reality and represent its five Saktis owing to which tho former appears as many in its Sangaridasa (creation). To should remember that the fundamental principle of the system is basically one and remains so in all its states which are mere aspects or grades of the same. The individual golves, anus or pudgalas, as they are stylcd by the exponents of the Philosophy, are not different from civa, who is bounded by his own mysterious Maya Sakti. It is a Sansari Stato Or 

Siva, philosophically termed as Jagrat avastha or waking state. All the limited selves or the creation are in tho 

55. 

waking gtete. • Objector-factor predominates hero (Cr. Moya-- 

bhumiriyem mukhya, T.A.). 

The second state 19 Svapne avastha or dreaming 

gtat 3. 

Practically it is the same state which a man 

experiences in a drear. 

The idea oe the object which 

prinar lly. pravall3 in the woling state begins to come. to en and. The Sadhaka, in this state, experiences the subjective idea, but its appearance is just as a dream. 

In all respects the state is a bit better than the preceding one. It is a reprssentation of manabhumi (State or noaeuro).. 

The third state is Susupta Avastha or dreamless sleep. The Sadhaka, in the state, is disconneoted from the impure creation or materiality though at the same tine the pure realm is still out of his reech. The approach 

The 

towurds self-roalisation starts from this state. vision of the inner spirituelity begins to dawa. 

The 

state is technically called prematrbouri. 

the fourth state or turiya-avastha represents the pure creation. The objective plurality a igappears. The 

subiective domination is a distinctive characteristio OP the state. T.A. calls it prama bhumi. 

The fifth is termed as Turiyatite' in whion the 

supreme consciousness or transcendent (Nisprapanca) Siva 

is experionced. Malini has named it "Sarvutita* or the state beyond all, the knowledge of which is said to be the os use of liberation (Bervatitah Sivojneyo Yam Viaitva Vimucyata). These five states are named variously and el barotately mentioned in the Ma. Adhi. II. 

(7) The Trika system lays much emphasis on tho 'Atman!. According to the followers of the Saiva though, all that is found in the macrocosm, should be realis od 1 

the microcom. 

For the realization of the sixtold road 

($adadhvand the founders of the school have framed three ways 'Aparı', 'Parapara' and 'Para' which represent three olasses or Sadhakas (dvaita, dva itadvaita, advaita) respoo tively. 

Accoriing to the Apara method, the body or the 

Sadhaka, from his feet to the forehead, is supposed to be 

eighty-four fingers and all the tattvag of the sixtold road 

are said to be realised in the space above mentionsd. 

The 

method is meant for the Dvaitists. 

In the Parapara method, which is applied to the followers or Dvaltadvaita, the human body, from the root to Brahma Randhra is thought to be of 96 fingers and all the tattvas are deemed to be existing in that space. 

The Para method is the best type of monisia. 

Tho 

himan Microscam, according to it, from feet to Bramma Rand hrs., should be supposed to be or 98 fingers upto Branda Randhra, and beyond it twelve fingers more should be added to this measure and thus the whole measurement is 108 fingers. The method signifies that the supreme Roality is equally preveding the microcosm and macrocoSI (For 

deta11 see notes on the 8th adhi.). 

(VI) The mention of the various abaranas (concon-- 

trations) on the phenomenal objects provos that tho Saiva philosophy does not nezleot even the meanest thing or the universe. The followers of the School regari everything an a form of Sive and therefore they prescribe cherana sven on the Phallus (Lina) ideally whioh is by no means a guesablo to the civilised olasg of thinkers. According to popular belief, everything of the World, whether it is conscious or unconscious, 18 identical with Siva. They deny nothing. 

55. 

they have deified all the objects of the world. 

This idea 

of the deittention 13 a dominant factor in the mention or 

the various dharenas. 

(VII) The Anavopaya (Lit. related to anu or in dividualsal) emphasizes the physical efforts to be made by tine Frematrg of the Sakalavastha or materialised state for anlvation). 

The Saktopaya is a combination pr physical as well as mental efforts and represents dvaitndvaita state. 

The Sambhayopaya consists of the mental efforts 

and 1s exclusively meant for those who are spiritually 

awakened by their preceptors and think the universo to ba Śivamaya (full' or Śiva). 

(VIII). As regards thə projection of physical universe, the frika School holds that the universal con ciousness (cit) 1n the sole independent cause of it. The qualities, inch as, Sarvakrttva' (all-doer ship) Sarva jnatya (all knoworship) -eto. are attributed to all pervading principle. It is a unique and singular characteristic or Indian Philosophy that it has reduoed the whole phenomenal show of the material world into one ultimate Reality, which 18 all consciousness (cit). The view of the modern philo 

sophers that the universe is a creation of the mind is not 

accepted by the founders of the Trila system. According to them, the mind is not different from oonsciousness (Cic) which has descended from its essential nature (citanapada) and has passed into a stage of limitation. This universal consoiousness has two aspects, Prakasa and Vimarsa. This "Prakasa' aspect in its gradual manifestation from its . essential nature, comes down and appears as pasu who in his gradual agcent is transformar to sivahood. The doctrine of seven Pramatrs is based on this gradual ascent, 

56. 

(IX). The will or Siva is regarded as "Svētantrya Sakti' or free will, to which, the causality of the apparent phenomena is asoribed. According to the Tantrika theory or creation, the projection (srsti), stability (sthit 1) and destruotion (Samhara) of the universe rely on this trao will of the All-controlling - Reality. The supreme Reality, of which the world is a mere sport, has been admitted absolute and transo endent. It is the divine will that 

creates a desire for enjoyment in the limited sell (vijnana. Kevala), who is not different from Siva Himself. Thus the World is a round created by Him through His free will or 

sportive nature. 

In this connection, a similar statement of Dr. Radhakrishnan who does not accept Karman and Pralrt1 as. 

prompting cause and material cause respectively and supports the will of the Lord for the creation of the Universe, is quoted below: 

"The existence of a prompt ing cause, liko Karman, or material eause like Prakrti, for the creation of the World is not admitted. Nor is Maya tha principle which creates illusory forms. God 13 absolutely independent and creates all that exists by the mere foros or His W111". I.P. Vol.II. 

(x) The philosophio point, on which Veasnt in and Saiva philosophers equally lay much stress, is the doctrine of Sakt ipata or divine grace. In this connection tho Upanisads, which are the monuments of Indian philosophia thinking have the following estimate of the same. 

Nayamatma Pravacanena labhyo na medhaya na 

vahunam Srutena yameva isa vrnute tena La inyo Yasm9 l vivrute Svam Tanum. 

57. 

All efforts of an aspirant for the sall reall sation are useleag unless Sakti descenas end delivers hin from his earthly life. The intuitive vision, whion has a tremendous Importance in the sonool, is the ohior rector.or apiritual uplift. Tantraloka has olagsfried it under theo heads, viz. Manda, Tivra and Tivratara. Malini has also mentioned that the Sadhaka under tivratara Sakti Peta a los atonco and becomes siva. Besides, Malini ordinarily mentions the marks of those who are united with the Rudra Sakti. 

(XI) The conception of the absoluto, admitt så by the Trika School, basically differs from that of the advaita Vedanta. From the Trika point of view, it is a united whole of two aspeots, called static and dynamic... The latter chiefly represents freedom or Svatantrya Sakt 1 of the absolute. The absolute or the Vedanta consists or static aspect, totally free from dynamism, This freedom ghould not be regarded as a separato sub stanoe from the absolute. This dynamiem 18 inseparable, in its quiescent state, from the absolute. Most of the Saiva Scholurg, on this basis, have attributed to it tho qualities, similar to those of the absolute. The dynami of the absolute evolves itself in five cruies, called five Saktis, viz., cit, ananda, iocha, jnana and kriya. Tho dootrine or the five funotions, 1.6., projection, stable 11ty, destruction, grace and concealment, is intimately associated with the rive Saltis, due to which siva in held as Pancavidha Krtyakarin. The amanic theory or the five faces, assignsit to Siva, is deonly conneotod with the dynamism of the absolute, which evolves itself in the five states in its creative movement. 

One more wonderful charsoteristio that dij 

58. 

-tinguishes it from the Vedantio absoluto 1s its suprono ezoity (Paruhanta). It is also based on the theory 01 movement or dynami3m. In the Vedanta, partect woity (parahenta), in any caso, is not attributed to the Supremo Reality, the Brahman because the dynamism is not accepted by the system. 

(XII) The theory of becoming or the dootzino or Manifestation, recognised by the Trike, is oonnected with the two modes, being and becoming, or the Supreme Reality, Parana şiva. The manifestation or the phenomenal universe, from the Trika point of view, is but en expression of tho 18848, or more oorrectly, the experience, or Parana siva, a united whole of being and becoming, toohnically under.. stood as prakasa (11luminating aspect) and vimarsa (che 11lumined). The apparent multiplicity or the phenomenal universe is a developed form of the becoming aspect (v imarsa), intrinsically related to the absoluto, Parana : 3 iva. This process of manifestation is technically callod A bìaga (Lit. Shining out), as opposed to the Vivarto (Lit. whirling) of the advaita Vedanta. In other words, the term (vivarta) means mappearing in diversa fore". This only difference between the two may be stated as follows: 

According to the founders of the Vivuite, tha 

appearances are mere names and forma (Nem rupamatre). and 

can under no olroumstances be regarded as real. From tho Vedantio point of view, they are quite different from the Supreme Brahma, rogurded as conso iousness. They are the produotion of Maya or illusion, recognised a8 ingorutablo in the School. Moreover, the position of maya in tho. School is peculiar. It is neither existent nor non existent. The School of the advaita Vedanta regards $8 

as Sadagadanirvadaniya. 

It is hela as a more adjunog52. 

(upadhi).. 

It is both, unconscious and unreal bcouuso 1. 

has no relation to the Brahman, regarded as conscious (cit svarupa) and real. The world of names and forma, produced by maye, from the Vedantic point of view, is false and uno ons o ious (Sada). 

The position of the parinamavad in algo dirtex's from the Vedanta. The Sankhya Sohool holds that tho world 

is real because it is the oreution or prakrti, regarded eternul. But as regards the nature of prakrti, 1t 10. said to be material (jada). From the point or viow or Surkhya, the world is simultaneously real and aoic (sada). 

From the Trika point of view, the world is both real as well as conscious (cit). It is the creation or Sakti, regarded congoious and real. Besides, the justi. fication of the a bha se vadin is that the world was alroady. existent in Siva in its embryonio form. (0r. Vartamana vabhaganem bhavan anava bhaganam. Antah sthituvutaneve 

ghatate vohirotmana, I. Pr. 32). The view or PT. HT 1s algo similar to that mentioned above in conneotion with the a bhagavada. The author of the work has used the term unmilena' for a bhaga or shining out. Tho common 

tator has explained the term as under: 

Unmilanam avasthita syaiva prakatikaranam. 

(XIII). The conception of the şudadhvan OP 01 - 

told road, from the Tantrike point of view, is regardca an obstruction to self-knowled me (adhva vand hasya keranan). Ag refards its nature, it consists or two parts, called, vaonka (Sabda) and vacya (artha), mutually connected with each other. There are three stages or the ovolution or the vacaka (sabda) and they correspond to tho throo COOH 

in the evolution or the vaoya (artha). 

The clrce wtago 

80. 

on the side or vuuaka, viz. varna, mentre and pudo correo - pond to the three stages, kala, tuttva and binuvana, or tho Vaaya reypeotively. As a rosult of their analysis wat 

we find may be expressed in the following tarmu: - 

1. Varna is a minimus divisible, unit or Sabia 

and it is entirely associated with the Kala, a minimus divisible unit of artha. On a study of the parallel lino 

or evolution, we find an internal relation existing beton 

mantras and padas on one hand and with tho tattved and bhuvanas on the other. A br ist account and the nua bax, or varnas, mantras and padas as well as of the Kal08 tattvad and bhuvanas are given below: 

1. Varnes, regerded as Sektis, aro, Prom tho. Tantrika point of view, firty. Their individual oign picance is much emphasised in the Tantras and they are tachnioally understood as matrka. In connootion with the origin or latrkus or varna, we must rører to the Para Sakti or the Logos, regarded as Pars Vak, whit getininally contains all Sastrag and words in it. It is supremo state wherein all words are lantent in their wdirroren tiated form. It is an inherent nature or Sive and in this supremo state it oannot be distinguishod trou ta' ultimato source. From the evolutionary point or risk its second state is Pasyanti won words (Saba) tid thoir meaninge (artha) are separated intornully. The statue 

in comparison with the previous one, ls, no doubt it diererentiated because sabda and arths aro separated in the form or Sabda and Artha but their this qual formation in at111 implioit. They have not st111 &seta sd the design nation of væoaka and vaoya. In short, thone se dau of dirrerontiation in this etato. P.T. has cleri 

ho position or Pasyanti in the words - bhedanaesyaturunan. 

61. 

The state is said to be just like the muterial, existing in the age of a peacock, whion in its ex br yonio form is not dirrerentiated (cr. Mayurandurasopama). 

The third state of the Para vak 1. madhyama when separate units or sabda ana artba are formed. In this state, they appear in the form or vacanta and vaaya separately. P.T. has defined the stato by one tern, 

bhedava bhasa', whioh literally means the appearance of duality. Sabda and artha are, a bit, externalised but they have not yet assumed the position of perfect sepa ration. They are still linked by ono uniting thread. In this stat., they are internally spoken and they oonvoy their meanings also. Physical ears can not hear them., 1.1. defines the stato as under : 

antah suin jalparüpa tu na srotramupasarpati. 

The words or P.T. (or. Madhyamapade atmu iva samsrnoti naparah) in connection with tho madhyama ar. ro markable. All our sastras remain stored in this state and are revealed through some med i um. State is specially associated with the yogins or high status. 

In the Vaikhari Vak, regarded as the fourth state of the supremo spoooh, Sabdas and arthas outwardly appear and become known as vãoaka and vaaya. The state corres ponds to the Matrka or Varna stege and P.T. states it as tri ed asphutata (full appearance of differentiation). 

2. Mantras, from the evolutionary point of view, are a developed form of varna. An approach to self roalisation through there is a bit grosser than that through the former. Ordinar lly, nantras ar. innumerabi. but from the tantrika point of view, their number is oloyon. As ; 

C 

a matter or fact, thes3 eleven kinds refer to their gradual 

stazes through which a Jadha ku has to pass to achieve the ultimate goal of humau lire. 

Tantrika oulture is intimately $9900iated with the cultivation of mantras (saored fornulas) on the one 

hand and Yantras (diagrams) on the other. Mantras repre sent the combined form of spiritual nature and yantras stand for moohanism and moohanioul devices through which those roroes can be asserted and made to fimotion on the physioul plune. A yantre is, thorororo like a maohina whereas the mantra is a motive power which gives it motion. Mantras are composite foroes expreguoj through sounds or phonetio symbols and consist of certain primal energies emanating from the Absolute. These onargius manirust i themselves on the highest plano us spiritual wound which 18 a poouliar oharsoter, pertaining to each aound. What usually recognised as Mantras, in roality, aro som. dir feront combination of those primal sounds. Every Mantra 18, therefore, an inherent power and capable or fulrilling itself. But the Mantras of which we are aware in our da 1ly Sadhana ura devoid of life as they represent the combination of letters which emanato from the material sky or bhautika Akasa and aro not quiokoasd by Nade. The proosus whion donverts letters or sounds into Nada 1. identioal with th. process which givos lire to the Mantra and makes them potent. Ultimately the Nada which begins to runotion in Madhyama vak beoomes intensified in the higher state or Pasyanti and becomes one with its object. As a result or this method or pur irioutlon every mantra baoomes sublimatod Into the basio state and the Sadhaka or Yogi is converted 11kewise lato the state of Mantrodvera, Mantra Mabesvara or even siva. It is Mantra yoga, 1r it is practised in a regular manner and under . proper guidance, it will surely 

transform an ordinary man into the divine status of siva and lead him to suprena Reality. 

3. Padas. The third form of vioakadhvan is padas, regard od as grossost development of the varnas, from which no further evolution 18 possible. Like varnas and mantras, they are also intimately related to the con caption of Kaladhran or time. Their number, generally accepted by the Tantrika Sohool, 18 eight yone. A seoker of the truth, according to the Tantrika Sadhana, has to start from pades, whion closely correspond to the anayopaya, ordinarily a lowest means, pregoribed for a Sadhake or materialised type. 

. 

PD 

As alreudy mentioned, vaayadhvan consists of Kala, tattvas and bhuvanas. The oreation of these principles is groggar then the former. A brief account of the principles belonging to this group is as under: 

: 1. Kala is said to be an energy of siva. The Sakala or immanent state of Purama Siva is due to this energy. When it transcends or is beyond this tattva, it is oelled niskala or transcendent. The number the Kala is five. The first kala from the point of view of desoont, 18, avakasada and 18 related to Siva tattya. The supreme stute of this tattva 18 Paralla $iva, regarded as niskala. 

The second kala, called santa, is directly related to Sarti prinoiple. Bodhini, pratestha and nirvrtti kalas are connected with the maya, prakrti and chara respeotively. The nirrtti kala is the last develop ment from which no further development is possible. , 

8. Further development of Kala is tattvas,... related to mantras. As regards their number, they are 

84. 

thirty-six and are arranged in three croups, called, juddh, yuddhasudha und asuddha. Tuo division is ohiorly con nected with the domination or oit-tattra. 

The Supreme Principle, to which the origin of various tattyus 18 ascribed, has been called Purama siya. It is one but becomes nany by its own freedom (avatantrya hetutan, Tr1. R. jna. Khu. 58). As a matter of fact, the supreme is rexarded as a united whole of static (conscious noss) and dynamio aspects (free w111). The nature or tho second agroct 18 threefold, oit sakti, maya sakti and jada sakti. The first state is transcendent, regarded as nirvikalpaka. The second state represents vikalpa bh liaukhya dasa. The third state, oallod jada bakti, is referred to by various numea, such as, avidyo, mulavidya or tumus (darkangs). It oniorly represents vikalpadeda and the origin of different oatogories owes to it. 

. 1. Siva tattva. First limitation inthe subjec tive nature or Parama Śiva results 1o śiva prinoiple. ga. T. Sam, oalls it rirst flutter in the quiesc ant nature or the Infinito (prathanah spandan iva tattva muoyato). According to tri. Ra., it is limited abhāsa (shining out). Supreme egoity (Parahanta lor the Infinite 18 replaced by simple ahanta (egoity). Though consciousn833 dominates the Siva state but the equilibrium of the statio and the 

16 € 

dynamio aspects, which we call Parama siya, doas not exist 

here. 

2. Sakti. As we know, the suprane unity, existing in Paruma siva, is lost in the sive state and results as unity whion aga in dovolops into two form, unity and diversity in the sakti state. In short, it is the state of bhad a bhoda (unity in diversity) and the remark or Abhinava Gupta, bhed a bhf.6 bi faktita confirms this 

65. 

foot. The sakti tettva 18 algo experlenced by I-033 lehenta). Eut this 'I' or jakt i state is pred loated and appears o's "I AM". No doubt, the predio'ution 13 t'ena ing towards ditrerentiation but in this stage, it does not arfoot the pre-ominenco or th. I-ness of the Siva state. 

3. Sateliva. Ir the sakti atate, the fundamantal unity, euwe rind, 13 proceeding toward2 differentiation but it is not orternalised there. In the Sadasiva state, diversity becomes apparunt. The normal experionce or I em or the sakti stato becomes "I am this" in the Sadasiva state. This-ness, & symbol or divergity, is not a new ortation in this state. It was germinally oristing in the Siva stato also. In the Śakti state, 1t developed a bit more and in Seda Siva stato it appeared outwardly. Its appearance does not affect the primary position of the subjeot 'I'. The position of tho this is also secondary here bocause it is not as emphatio as the subjective I' is. It remains here in a supreme form. 

4. 18.ru tattra. The identa or 'this' element of the ideal experience "In this", formulated in the previous state, which was lingering in the back ground becomes prominent in the Isvara atate. The objeot domi Dates the subject. The changed form of the thought is *this am In. In this state, the this-nosa holds an important position. The salt is supressed and the non selr (40 it) comes to the forefront. 

E. su-vidya. The sonde of differentiation, which began to be significant in the Isvara state, becomes ohooked in the su-vidya state. There is no further supp ression of the subject. The pro inono., shifted from the "I' to the objootive this could not stay permanently in the 

66. 

Su, vidya state. Il results in a new state or equalisation. Both the factors, I-nes, and this-0088 appear in a balano ed state. Both ara emphatio in their own places. " 

In the normal. erperion. "I am this" or the su. 

vi. stato, both, I' and 'this! tuotors are mutually re lated to each other. The this-ness is in the possession of the I-ness, & unity, similarly, the this-1085, a diver sity, belongs to I-ness, a diversity, belongs to I-ness. It is a double possession on other side. Firstly, the diversity (thig-noss) appears in the unity (I-ness) sooondly, the thig-1888 belongs to the unity. Their this alliano e results in bheda bhoda or parapara dasā but both are equal. 

6. Maya. It is a limiting ad Junot and covers the essential nature of the unity. It iu the sakti of Siva and forms an integral part of his nature. Due to this maya, the equalis od position of the unity and tho.. diversity oan not be stable. The state or equalisation 1s lost and the unity appears in the diversity whiob 1s more prominent than the former, 

. 

Maya and Sakti are not different. The former, in its quioso ent state, 18 Sakti and roi a ins one with Sivu What when it is disturbed (Kuo bhun a danna) it prod uoss the 

limited universe in all its parts as the oublio myraphalan (amalaki), being for ofully struok with a start yields , its fruits. 

Maya obsoures tho nature of Siva and presents him as a limited being. In this respoot, the etymological moanings of naya have great importance. The term in derived from na to measure out and means that by whiob something is measured. It, therefore, 19 « power of 

voluntary self-limitation. 

Origin or rivo prinoiples, Kala, anu. vidya ato. - The primary runotion of maya in the process or the ani restation of the ideal un 1veres 1. to obsoure the rive fundamental aspects, viz., Sarvajaatva, Sarvakartrtva eto., through its progeny, called Kela azu. vi. ato. 

. 7. Kala. Due to limitation in the first chief characteristio (all-doership), Siva bacomes limited door in the place or all-door. Kala represents him as a limited door. 

8. Asu. vi. Duo to limitation in the second feature, 1.2., all-knoworship, the subject becomes limited doer. 

. 'Raga. Limitation in tho all-completoness or 31va (purnatya) prosents him as he is attached to something and not to all. 

10. Kala. Limitation in starnity (nityatva) changes the everlasting nuture of the subjoot and presents 1t as a thing or limited duration. 

11. Niyati. Limitation in the characteristio (Sarva-vyapakatra) converts the subject into a limited pervader instoad of all-pervador. 

18. Puruga. Purnan or wou is not dirrorent from Parama Siva whose supremo natur. is contracted by the Kanoukas (Shoatha) and who is presented as an animal by the mystirioation of maya. 

I have given a brief mooount of twelve principles, vii., five pure tattras, from sive to Su. vi., six princi ples of Suddhanuddha state, from maya to niyatl and purusa principle of the impure univers. In the foregoing pages. The remaining twenty four categories are intentionally

(II). Every monistio school of India has tried its best to explain the complicated problóm or the one-way 

in its own way. The method adopted by the non-dual school 

of the Kashmir Saivism 18 unique and 86 Eng logically quits 

sound. The supreme consciousness in the sense or Purata Siva is a byolutely free from time (Kala) and spaoo (desu). This samy it is regarded as a back ground of the. It is natural that the self-expression or the one as many is not possible unless the para Sanvit or the statio condo loudness is invested with Spapda (flutter or vibration) and appears as prana. The future creation of it in all its multi plioation 18, therefore, an inoident, truly speaking, in 

71. 

prana rather in Samvit although every manifestation has, 

for its basic background, samvit itself. The prana Sakti is divine power primarily or the nature of Kriya Sakti. The appearance of the body ay conscious footuna) 

is not because consciousness pervadeg it but Locauso It 

is permeated with prana which is the manifestation or the 

Supreme Power as Kriya Sakti. 

We have already mentioned that the Supreme Prinoiple is statio in its basio character. It is free from conceptions of time and space. Krama or Buooession is the chief characteristic of Kriya Sakti, developed from the Supreme Principle in the form or Para Samvit. Now it is easily explicable how both, tine and space or Kala and desa are associated with Friya Sakti and not with any other Sakti. Krama or succession as property of Kriya Sakti is 

twofold, viz., abstract and concrete. The existonos or Krama or suo 0 ession as units of abstract motion or ideas explain our notion of time. But the existence or the same succession as concrete units, co-existing and forming varie ties in body-consoience, accounts for the conception of space. The two lines of evolution as a bytract and oonorate, are parallel and interelated in every way. In wr the order of Kala or time, we find IRMX Varna, mantra and pada, for these all are connected with the uoohara (11t. pronunoiation) which implies an utterance of sounds and refers to the succession of events in time. But the principles or Kala, tattva and bhuvana, which correspond to varna, mantra and pada respectively, belong to the order of space and not to the order of time. Thus all our ideas, abstraot and con orete, are unified in a single experience dominated by tine and space. 

From what has been said above, it is evident 

that every finite experience is ultimately based upon the conception or time and spece from which the Suprema Expor ience is only exempt. 

4. In the foregoing paties orrorts are made to expose the doctrinal points the work has dealt with. They are not mere theories and intellectual digoussions, which we usually rind in the ph1losophioul treatises, but 

they have their practical essence also. 

The work, as we 

have studied, mainly represents the tantrika roligion, generally consisting of the four fundamental principles, viz., jnan (philosophy), yoga, kriya and carya. They colloctively and individually help us to achieve the ultimate goal of life. 

As regards the function of philosophy, it surfices to say that it, acoordina to the Eastern thinkers, 1s not a thing of intellect only as the Western philoso phers take it. India never admits that it, apart from its intellectual equipment, does not serve any purpose of life. It is understood as an essence or life. We oun emphatically say that philosophy is one of the essential principles of hunan life. It analyses life and enables to know what we are. By philosophy, we can discover the gecrets lying in the supreme solr. It diutinguishes the self from non-self and teaches man that he is, as a matter or fact, intrinsically related to the universal solr. 

The term, yoga, in the tantras, is generally understood as a soience or unirioation. Ma. has also stressed this sense (or, yogamekatvamioohanti vastuonyana vastuna, ma. IV, 4.). It teaches us various methods or identification. The present work has laid down tho : principles of twofold d 1ksa by which an aspirant can be 

identified with the Supreme Principle. 

The third principle, according to the Tantrika Sadhane, for self-realisation is Kriya. The doctrina of Kriya points out how a spirituul seeker should not for 

the attainment or the suprema unity. Iractioa or mantra 

and vamayoga and celebration or ritual ceremonies are entirely recognised a9 parts of this section. 

The carya part of the tantrika 'Sadhana chiefly 

dealt with the convential practices (Samaya) which the 

seekers of Truth have to observe during the period or their 

meditation. The dootrine of carya teaches Sadhakas how to live in the course of their spiritual training. 

(o) The Ma. Sohool is regarded as monistic and therefore every approach to it is to be considerad from the same point of view. The supreme aim or hunan being 19 attainment or perfection and the perfection 13 nothing but self-realisation or man of supreme stute which is absolutely divine. Ma. and gayertha, the commentator or T.A. have referred to this state by their two respective terms, 3varupasthiti (or. Suidhe avatmani tisthati, Mu. I 

47) and Svarupaprathana (cf. Mokso hi nama raivunyuh 

svarupaprathanam hi san. Svarupam catmanah say it .... 1.A. I, 31, Com). It is believed that God or Parama Siva has assumed the role of a man after self-11m 1tation and the object of man's life is to do away with the 1 in itations and return to his real status as Parama Siva. To remove the 

bonds, the individual efforts alone on the part of man are 

not sufficient unless they are affected by divine grace 

(Sakti-pata). Sometimes, but in rare oages, Sakti functions almost exclusively to spiritualise Sadhakas. In most cases, this divine grace affects spiritual efforts in accordance with the varying capacity of the individual 

concerned. 

It 19 a fot that una ided efforts or a man are 

ne no avall in this field because the removal of self induced obstruction 19 possible through will and the 

aotivities of the ultimate source alone. 

As a matter 

or fact, the basis of this divine intervention is freedoin, 

conceived as a svatantrya sakti or free will or the lord 

Siva in the system. 

Both, self-contration and self 

expansion, are, in all cases, affected by divine hand. 

Besides, in connection with liberation, as it is already mentioner, one has to bear in mind the theory of twofold jnana (spiritual and intelleotual) and twofold ignorance (paurusa and bauddha). The removal or paurusa 

a jnana or innate impurity, called anavamala, is not possible by any effort on the part of man though the removal of the intellectual ignorance may be alrected by hunan efforts, as penance, physioal exercises, pranayama etc., and mahavakya-jnana (knowlodge given by a Guru), mentioned in the Yosa School of Patanjali and the advaita 

Vedanta of Sankara respectively. The rise of bauddha 

jnana, which d is pels the intellectual ignorance, is, in fact, an absurdity unless it is preceded by the elimination of the spiritual a jnana, helped by divine grace through a Guru. The destruction of the spiritual ignorance is more important, from the Tantrika point of view, than the des truction of the intellectual ajnana. As we experience, without the latter, Sivetva or divinity is ags uned after the end of the present body. The lack of the intellectual Jnana is only an impediment in the way of realisation or fivarmukti (liberation in life). 

The conception of liberation (mukti), from the Saiva point of view, is briefly nentioned. This oonoeption is absolutely different from that of the advaita Vedanta, 

75. 

The supreme state, achieved through the intellectual jnane (baud dha nena) according to the Vedanta, 18 not agreeablu to the advaite Saive philosophers. They call it atmia or spiritual state, free from all impuritios. This counci pation from the level of tattvas iu a pure knowledge or Suddha vijnana kaivelya. Saive scripturas describe it as under:- "givo Tai ka ivalastatra atina jnana - kriyanvitan. 

Bandhanasesanirmuktah. Sattamatragvarupakah. Safastadhva 

palatitah suddha vijnana kaivalah. Grhnati vaparan bhavam 

na param ca pivatmekam. 

S.T. 4th. P.388-9. 

3 imilarly, the state of puro oreation, from Su vidya to Sakti, 13 not fuvoured by the Sohool as a supreme status. The state does not imply the perfect unity between the inale and kriya, which the sohool calls the Bupreme state. There is an experienes of both, jnana and 

kriye separately in this Su. vi. state, 

Even the Siva state is not recognised by the Sohool, as the Supreme state. In the Siva state, both, 

consciousness and freedom are experienoed a bit separately. The State, no doubt, points out the domination of the oit tettva, the static aspect of Perena Siva and apparently seems superior to those already mentioned but it is no 

perfect unity between the Jnan and kriya, which the Sohool 

has conceived as the Supreme state. The highest stata held by the Ma., is full equilibriun between the jnana and kriya (static and dynamic aspaots). The state represonts perfect balance or 31va and Sakti and is technioally called as Parama Siva or Siva-Sakti-Samarasya. 

The author of s.r. mentions it as a state, beyond the approach of mind and sensas (Sarvandriya mano tita). The chier characteristio of this supreme unity 1s 'a bhava'. The commentator of the work, with th13 view 

that readers may not take the term in the sense of sunya or void, has clariried its meanings. The term refers to the state where all ideas or jnana or snaya totally cease (or. Na vidyante vod yad irupa bhava yatru, 3.T. 4th, 277, 0.3.). The text has also olariried the sense or "abhava. lot. Abhayah so samudd isto yatrs bhavah ksayan gatah, 3',T. 4th., 282). The state ohiefly means where all distinctions, Buch as, pranieya, pramana eto. disappear (Na vidyate preme yodi prapanco yatra). The system has named it as sarvatita 

or tatt vatita gtute (cr. sarvatituh 31vo jneyo yan vid 1tva 

vimuoyate, Ms.). 

As rerurds the process of the attainment of the ultimate poel, the advaita school of Suivism generally 

believes in the Iadual ascent, which, 28 matter of fact, 

starts from the atma state and ends in the Parama Siva state 

but the instances of a sudden spiritualisation are also 

found. 

To have a correot estimate or the liberated state 

according to the Saiva School, we must take the doutrine of supreme osoity (parahantu) into consideration. The Saiva system admits that the supreme state is charaoteris ed 

by supreme aharta, regarded as a united whole of two i ulements, consciousness and freedom. The Vedanta dos 

not hold freedom as a chief characteristic of Brahman. is a result of this the supr eine status of this gohool is a mere statio state with no supreme egoity, which is sbsolutely associated with the dynamic character. The experience of perfeot ego ity in the supreme state in the 

Kashmir Salva School of philosophy 19 positive due to 

dynamism, admitted ag an aspect of the Supreme Reality. 

Association of jnana and Karma as Saktis is a 

77. 

peculiarity of the triple thought. Bondage and freedorn are based on these two prinoipla3. Like the muyavada of Sankara there is no foreign element for the creation of bondage. Both liberation and bondage, are self-made. The conception of mukti or supreme state, according to the Trika School, is balance of consciousness and freedom, regarded as jnana Sakti and kriya Sakti. In the state or oreation, their balange is lost. The disappearance of the Supreme unity results in anava mala due to which the Para Pramatr, becomes pasu or bo und. The disturbance. between the jnana and the Karma occurs in two ways. Consciousness, devoid of Kriya Sakti, is according to the School, conceived as bondage. Kriya without knowledge is also bondage. Abhinava Gupta is right when he mentions the twofold nature of anava mela, viz., bodhatriya kriya and Kriyatriva bodha. 

From the above, it is obvious that the equilibrium or gnana and kriya is moksa and its break gives rise to atrolka obscuration (anava) due to which the Inrinite be comes finite. The basis of this bondage and liberation, or self contraction and self-expansion, as matter of fact, 

is freedom. 

For the attainment of the supreme goal, mentioned above, the different schools of Sadhana and philosophy have adopted different ways. The schools of Sadhana in the West lay stress on meditation through whioh the true self is realised. According to the Bhakti school of Vaisnavas, supreme self is realised by means of love. Realisation by meditation and love means that something 

is realised by something. This realisation implies that subjeot and objeot are different entities. This view or duality is not accepted by the non-dualistic schools. 

78. 

The Yora school of Patanjali has laid emphasis on. the physical means which help a spiritual Sadhaka to reach the Highest goal. The means adopted by Patanjali result in Samprafnata (objectful) and as amprafnata (objeotless tranoo) Samadhi. In any case, the object consoiousness does not disappear from an aspirant even in the two states of Samadhi, mentioned above. The Advaita school does not re cornise the method adopted by Patanjali. The sense of dualism which the school implies can not be denied. 

The way for self-realisation according to the dual school of Sankhya is different. It does not depend on the physical means which the exponent of the yoga school recognises. From the Sankhya point of view, supreme realisation is obtainable through discrimination between 

Prakrti and Purusa. 

For this distinotiva knowledge of 

Prakrti and Purusa, one has to rely upon higher specu lation. 

The Nyaya school of Philosophy recommends argu mentation and Analytic knowledge of substances (Padarthas) to realise supreme self. 

The founder of the Mimansa school has advocated the good deeds and Vedio terts as a chief means for selr 

knowledge. 

The author of the Gita has mentioned various 

devices for self-realisation. 

Various methods adopted by different forms of Sadhana for God-realisation imply that subjeot and object are separate. They worship God as an object though the underlying reality of whioh 18 oit, an all pervading psychio prino iple. It is also a worship or cit in disguise. The method of the Advaita Vedanta is70. 

quite dirferent from those already mentioned. 

It does 

not proceed to worship God as an object. Its way for self-realisation begins with Cit direotly and realises 1t pure and naked. The Vedanta has conceive by God as Absolute spirit or Pure Cit. The School does not admit that God should be realised as an object. In that cuse He would be Jada or Nonself because all objets are non-gelf. The Vedanta believes in the worship of the Higher self by the lower selr (Jivataman). According to 

the monistic School of Sankara the Atman 1s all-pervading principle. It should be worshipped by the puriried mind. The school prescribes the worship of the Cit by the Cit. Thus the Vedantic method of self-realisation is not attainment or something that was not or that is foreign to the self but 18 only the unfolding or the latunt in rinitude of the apparently finite. It is the working or Maya that the Absolute appears as the relative. The Infinite manifests itselr as the rinite and the Omnigoient seems in the disguise of the ignorant. It must be borne in mind that the finite can never be deduced from the Infinite and the rinite can never reach the Infinite. The Vedanta accepts that the Inrinite, which is distorted by Maya and which appears as the finite, realises its own infinitude in the state or liberation. For this self 

realisation, the Vedanta has adopted various methods, viz.," 

knowledge or Sastras, divine grace, Manana and Nididhya Sana of the Yoga school and Mahavakya jnana (knowledge given by Quru). 

The Salva as well as the Tantrika way or sell realisation 18 absolutely dirferent from those mentioned a bove. Both admit that the Infinitudo 19 rinitised by its own Sakti. In the liberated state the Inrinitude realises ita iririnitud: malo realisation is obtainable 

80. 

through various methods, such as, Sakti-pata, three upayas, concentrations eto. The votaries of the diksa school or 9.1. attaoh preference to the dikaa method. The Ma. . school also lays much emphasis on diksa and mentions that no aspirant 19 competent to be admitted into the Bankara Yoga unless he is initiated for the purpose (ot. Navadhi karita d1ksa vina yoge sti Sankare, Ma.). The method of diksa as a means to self-realisation, accepted by the Salva School is logically quite sound and based on the cono option of the Supreme Reality. 

As regards the nature of dikga,a statement or 

Javaratha, the commentator of T.A., explaining the whom etymological meaning of the term 'Diksa' has stressed its dual function. The initiation outwardly and inwardly makes a Sadhaka quite fit for the spiritual journey. It imparts him sell-knowledge and destroys its inner-impuri ties (or. Diyete Jnanasad bhavah Ks iyante Pasuvasanah. Dana Ksapa gamyukta Diksa Tenaha Kirtita. Corom. T.A. lst. A. 43). 

Another statement of the same commentator, similar to that mentioned above, asigns utmost iraportance to this ritual of Diksa which relieves a Sadhaka or the aixfold road (9 ad ahvan) and leads him to the status of Siva-Bhava (or. Tasmat Pravitated Bandhat Parasthana 

Nirodha kat. Dikgaiva Mocayatyurdhvam Saivam Dhama, Nayatyapi. Comm. T.A. lst, A. 43). 

The conception of the sixtold road in the Saiva thought is curious. It includes all parts of wateriality and 18 considered as bondage. A spiritual seeker oannot be identified with the supreme selr unless he has freed himselr from this bond. 

81. 

From the close study or the statement oited in the previous Paragraph, we cannot hesitate to say that the function of Diksa is twofold, viz., Negative and positive. As rewards its negative function, it purifies the whole being of a Sadhake and enables him for spiritual reali sation. According to the canons of the Salva Philosophy, a Sadhaka must be purified by removing the various bonds (paga) which often stand in the way of spiritual uplift. This negative Diksa in the words or Svacenanda Tantra is called purifying initiation (Sodhan1 Diksa). 

After the purifioatory Diksa which negates all the contents of the sixfold road as bonds (Pass), a Guru should begin the positive Diksa (called Yojani Diksa to unify the selr' or a Sadhaka with the supreme Reality, Siva. At the very outset or Yojani Diksa, a Guru should make his pupil under his real, golf whioh is non-11cferent from Siva. In this rite, he ought to divert his attent ion from the Puryastaka which he has misunderstood as a seat of Parahenta or highest egoity. Similarly the mind which is understood as a centre or supreme Reality, must be negated. After crossing Puryastaka and the mind the third stage 18 'void' (Sunya) which 18 gone times mistaken as realm of Siva State. We cannot deny its supremacy over the Puryastaka and the mind but it is not a final desti. nation. The Sastre calls it a state of Sada siva. The unification or a Sadhaka with this state can result in a fall for. Sivasyordhe sivo Jneyo Yatra Yuktana Jayate. S.T.P. 4th. 197). 

The two kinds, that is, Jnana and Kriya Diksa, mentioned by Ma in the 4th Adhi. are based on sound principles. They are assooiated with the conception or Anava Mala (innate def 11 ement). According to the Saiva 

82. 

thought, the balanced state of consciousnos8 (Jnana) and freedom (svatantrya Sakti) is regarded as 'Purema Siva' state. In the state of creation (Sansara Dasa) this bulance is lost and appears in two dirferent ways. Wa call the consciousness (Jnana) dis associated from freedom (Friya) Anava Mala. Similarly freedoin without Jnana is also hnava Mala which arrects us in two ways. When in tellectually we fail to realise our trusself, it 18. bauddha Ajnana (related to intellect). When spiritually we do not understand our real nature, it is Paurusa (related to our inner spirit) Ajnana. 

The Jnana Diksa removes our intelleotual impuri ties while the Kriya Diksa helps us to destroy the taints connected with our spirit. (Purusu Mala). Both of the initiation are interrelated. A mere knowledge or something has no use unless it is actualised by Practice. To prad 

tise a thins without its proper knowledge has no value at ali. It is a l'act that wisdom and action never divorce 

from each other in the Şaiva Sohool or Thought. 

(d) Both, the Saiya School of Kashmir and 

Sankara's system do not seem different from each other 

in their externals. We cannot deny the fact that they, both, represent idealistio monism. But the monisi or the Kashmir School is distinguished from Sankara's system in a most remarkable way. Sankara believes in the perfect unity of the Supreme Principle but he cannot, at the game time, do without the principle of maya without which the origin of Jiva and the world becomes inexplicable. Though the system is the monistio and therefore it implies the existence of one ultimate prinoiple. It is, no doubt, a fact that maya, in the system, doos not have a separata existence. The School of the advaita Vedanta doos not! 

recogn130 it as an independent prinoiple. In thet ouse, the doctrine or nonian would surely sufrer. Consoquently Sankara holds maye to be inexplicabla baing neithor true nor false. This is the significance of the doctrine of fulsity which inherents in nayavada. The Kashmir Sohool on the other hand, is more extremist and steers clear of the dootrine or insorutability (anivaoaniyata) which outs at the root or nonion. As far as the question or mere 1s concerned, the Saiva School of Kashmir &inits one maya as a category of pura and in pure group. This maya 18 totally different from that or Sankara. This oute-. gorical maya comes under the thirty-six prinoiples and therefore it holds no ground to compete the maya or Bankera. Apart from this maya, the system does not hold anything except the Supreme Principle. It is, therefore, hailed that there is nothing outside the Absolute principle not aven Kaya, which in the system, is no longer i principle of inexplicability but is cons olousness as port ect Systentrya or freedom and one with. the absolute. As a result of this, the idealistio moniam of Kashmir is, more consistent than that of Sankara. The natur, or maya, ecoording to Bankara, in non-sentient or material. He holds the empirioul reality suohit (non conso ious) because it is the creation of maya, regarded as Jada. The ohief characteristio or the Valantie Brahman 18 its indetermination. All determinations are waye -- mado or aupadhika. But maya the existence and the powe" or maya ag Sakti in the salva Sóhool cannot be denied by the saints of Kashmir. It is well-expression mu powor or the absolute itself and is as real as the abæolute is. Ma. has imparted the status, aimilar to that or Parama Siva, to it (cr. Anadyanta Sivesani vyahira oa kathyate, M.A. I, 28). It is all-pervasive, transcendent and the 

84. 

store housu or the world. The world which appears out of it is neither unreal nor material (acetana) as it is be lieved in Sankara's system. The universe, thus, 18 an expression or the Supreme Sakti whioh is conscious itselt and is one with the basic Reality. 

. In other systems, the dyn ann 10 prinoiple 18 posited outside the Absolute directly or indirectly. In Sankara's system, it is maya, regarded as totally dirrerent from Brahman, and therefore it cannot touch the Reality as suob. It functions from without. Its existence or non existence does not affect the principle of the Ultimate Reality. In the idealistio moniam of the Buddhists the dynamic prinoiple consists of avidya (ignoranoo) and is more or less similar to that or 3ankara's Bohool. It d 18 appears on the origin or perfeot knowledge and persists so long as the kriowl sige has not appeared. It is also in consistent with the true knowledge. It flourishes in limbo or the o bacure baokground. It, as the gohool adnits, exists best not in association with the Reality. In short, according to the Vedanta and the Buddhism, the principle of a ynas 1sm is quite aloof from the Absolute. 

8000 

In the Kashmir Saivism, however, dynamism does not lose side of the Reality itsole in both, rest and motion. Contradictory aspects, statio and dynamiem, involved in human knowladge, have their place in the Reality itself. As Sakti, it is dynamism and as Siva ft 

is statio. It is, at simultaneous embrace, both, motion less and motion. It is always itselr without action being a silent witness or the natura of pure conso iousness and yet it is always moving in the state of action. It acts in infinite ways. In the process or aotions, it is @volving itself into Lany forms and many grades. Besides, 

Sen 

it is a silent witness. It observes and controls all its aotivities. The moniem of the abeolute in the Kashmir School is so perfect that apperent contradictions between the static and the dynamigni do not hold a grounå to rely upon. This is the importance of freedom or 3vantantrya which is the natural deduotion of the metaphysical back ground of the Kanhi ir Saiva system. In the Vaianta, the ground of the unity 18 jnana without acts which are ascribed to maya, regarded as juatorial and an element of the foreign agency. The sources of consoiousness and acts are different in the non-dual sohool of the Vedanta. But in the trika system, it is the same ground whioh in volves will as well as acts within itself. In other words, the Vedanta recognisas Siva as real but it is always free from Sakti. Bu the Trika believes in the same siva witn its essential nature, oalled Sakti. It is eternally oonjoined with it. In the Vedanta the self-luminous character of Brahman is eternal but not experienced. There is no special feature of the self-luminosity of the - Vedantio Brahmen. . But' in the trika, the existence of the vimarsa (Sakti) is an essential property or the solr 

luminous Siva. 

The Prakasa or the suprome illumination 

or the divine Being 18 1ts eternally solr-luminous 

character and experienced at all times. Thus the self luminosity of Siva is more positive than that of Brahman. 

Inspite of the importance or Sakti in the work one cannot oonolude that Saiva philosophy of Kashmir is Siva-daya ita qualified by Sakti (Sakti visista). The . elaborato aluo idation of the concept 'Sakti' available 

in the various Salva literature of Kashmir is a more 

Indication of the fact, how supreme Reality, Siva, being one fundamental unity, manifests itself ag various forms of Sakti in its oreative state. The author of Malini has 

816, 

styled it as 'Parama advsita' (Ma. 18.4.) so that its read ers may not call it Jakt 1-V 1sista slvadvaita due to the varisd development or Sakti. The evolution or Sakti, stroese by the writers of 3aiva Philosophy should not be taken as a justification for designating this philosophy as & Sive-dvaita qualiried by Sakti. Wo cannot deny the descent or the sakti as a principle. It existe as an agent of Siva in His Creative state. It also exists and appears as a Sakti in the least quantity, in the state or dogtruotion (Samhura-avastha). Thus we way should not for get the fact that the relation of Sakti to Siva oxigts only 

in the two states, that 19, Sansara-avastha and Samhara avastha. But in the final resort when the individual spirits are liberated, Sakti fully merges with Siva from Saiva ph 110sophers call Parama siva. It is a transcending state in whioh the absolute oneness of Siva predominates. Technically it is called 'unity of Siva and Sakti or Samarsya of Siva and Sakti.. It is a state or full mergence or Sakti with Siva and it points out the same oneness which we experience between the salt and water when the former molts into the latter and loses its separata individuality. It is the state where in the distinction or Siva and Sakti 

and Sri Kantha, who are exponents of visistadvaita Vada school or qualified monism, we should not call this philo sophy visistadvaite. 

Visistadvaita school of Ramanuja holds that in dividual selves and the objeots of the inanimato world are not mere appearances as the great Sankara states them. They are real and form the part of Brahman. They appear as body and attributes of Brahma. Apart from it, they have no separate individuality. The founder of the school 

87. 

has admitted the unity of individual souls, inanimato phenomna end Frahman. According to him, the 1 united selves and the phenonnel objects are autordinate elements which have yigesya or attributed (predominating el groent), 

Brahman. One of them cannot exist geparately. The complex whole (V 18 ista) which they included is conceived a3 unity. In this conneotion, we should note that Ramanuja has formulated a relation or inseparability betwson the attributed (vigesya) and the attributing (Visegana). The relation, inseparability or Aprthak Siddhi is imaginary. So far as attributing capao ity of individual selves and the phenomenal objects 1s concerned, we have no objection. They are subordinate elements and qualify the predominating elevent which is Brahman. We cannot deny the fundamental fact that the relation or the attributive and the attri buted is otornul. This relation ay continuo in the precos3 or manifestation but in the final state when " individual selves are liberated, it has to cease. Aga matter of faot, both of them Visegana and Visosya will not continue in the state of liberation. Either or them will have to disappear. In that case, we will have no digtination or Vigoyana and Visegya. The qualifying element will fully merge with the qualified slowent. It 

is the state of absolute oneness where in the sense of 

duality disappears forevor. 

Like Ramanuja who formulated the Visigtadvaita Vadu school in the moniatio philosophids or Madlasval 

India, Sri Kantha also holds Visistadvaita Vada in Salvigna. He has rajooted the Dvaitadvaita sohool expounded by Bimborkasarya, on the basis that multiplicity and unity 

being opposed to each other in nature, cannot co-axist on the gubatance. In conneotion with the bhed a bheda sohool, he holds that the difference between the ultimato Raality 

88. 

OOO 

and phongmonal multiplicity is not suoh as we experienos botween a far and a piece of oloth nor they are perfectly identical as mother of peerl (3akt 1) and silver for which the former is mistaken. Sri Yaatha is the only man who has founded visistadyuita oohool in the monist lo 981vism. He admits the relation between Siva and Sakt 

nomenal)multiplioity) to be a imilar to that which exists between a boly and soul or botween substanca and quality. 49oording to him, the non-dirror anos or tham 19 similar to that of a olay, and a jar or of quality and substance. So far as Siva and Sakti are concerned, they both being cause and ofreot or subatanos and quality do not exist in isolation from each other.IV - FUNDAMENTAI. CHARACTER OF THE WORK WITH 113 9P90IAL 

RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE. I 

Tene 

It is believed that all 34 iva Atanas recognise siva or Perana 3iva as o suprerne Principle of perfect egoity. It is understood as a united whole or the two" significant features, walled jnana and Kriya or prakusa and vimorsa. In a plain language, both of the aspects correspond to Slva and Sakti reapeotively, on which the philosophioal edir 100 of the Saiva Sastras 13 baaad. They, though apparently seem distinct from eaoh other in their creative state, are interrelated and become one in the supreme state. It is an adulttad faot that one without the other cannot exist. Slva is understood as a symbol of consoiousness while Bakti uopeut is represen tative of dynaniam. Thay, both, in their natura, ara equal. To some extent, thay goom emphatia in their own position and are placed on equal footing. As we rind from the cloue study of the Salva Agamay, the status of Sakti principle, in most casss, is a bit higher than that ot give. This o bylous supremacy or Sukt i over siva ig due to the varied aotivities which are assigned to the former. As a result of this superiority of the Bakti, as we find, Sakta Sohool 1g originatai. As a matter or fact, Saive and sakta Schools are interrelated and general ly do not seem different in their fundamentals. 

The Trika school or tho Kashmir gaivism is chiar 

ly inrluonoad by the Saiva Aganas and, therefore, it, in fact, represents the theory as well as the practice or the former in a new shape. The gohool or the Kaahir saiviam, as we study, chiefly follows the Agamio oult and philoso 

90. 

-phical views of the Balvaguas, The School is absolutely non-dual and believes in the Supreme Unity of one Principle which evolves itselr into many forms through its own free will. Inspite of the fact that Supreme Prinoiple is Salva, the School does not fail to mention the importanco or Sakti, due to which, the former establishes its existence. Hence the place or Sakti in the Trika literature of Kashmir, is no less important than that in the Salvagamas. All the expounders of the Kashmir Saivism have paid tribute to the Sakti, to element and restored it to the rank or Siva. The nature of Sakti, to which all the funotionings of creation are assigned, is variously explained by the different exponents of the Sohool. In spite or so pro found and significance of this tattva, the trika thought 18 regarded as a Saive School and not a Sakta one. The obvious reason is that the founders or the school have not mentioned it as a separate principle. It is regarded as 

an essential nature of the Absolute. For the justirioation or their statements, they have pointed out the various relation of Sakti, such as, Sanavaya, tadatmya, abheda, etc., to Siva. In short, Sakti exists but not apart from the Supreme Reality. 

The position or the sakti principle in the Malini Sohool, whion, in many respeots, is understood as an essence of the Trika system, absolutely differs from that in the latter. The prino iple or Sakti has got a prominent place in the Sohool. Though it is an innost nature of the Supreme Reality, but it 18 regarded as all 

in all. 

The work, as the very name, Nalini vijayottara tantra, points out, is chiefly connected with the Malin'i Sakti, which from the sakta point or view, rerers to the 

91. 

Para Sakti or Para Vak. 

The gohools, related to the 

tantrika culture, balieva that all phones, in their un 

manifested form, remain latent in the Para Vak, supposed to be in a form of a garland. We admit that the Lalini School is monistio like the Trika School and recognises one Supreme Principle, Siva. It is also a fact that Sakti, apart from the essential nature or Siva, does not erist. The founder of the Sohool is aware of the taot that Siva or the statio naturo is, without Sakti, motion less and Sakti without the former is non-sentient. Their mutual support to each other is entirely needful. The Trika School stresses the interrelation of Siva and Sakti Both are equal in their nature and character. The view of the Ma. School about the 3 akti concept is a bit different form that of the trike system. The founder or the Sohool has gone a step higher. He is not satisfied with the mutual relation of siva and Sakti. To him, Sakti as a principle of action is mora favourable than sive as a statio prinoiple. He prefers Kriya to fnena. 

He pays much tribute to Sakti and awards a very high 

position to it. The various manifestations of Sakti enable us to form our opinion that the work, though monist1o, chiefly ropresenta Sakta charactor. 

As soon as we read that Siva is explaining the 

e 

contents of Siddhayokisvari tantre, in which halini 18 also included, to his consort, Parvati, we see the author of the work, elaborately eluo id ing the term "upadaya", which literally means 'acooptable'.. He attaohes the greatest importanoe to the Supreme Prinoiple and wentions it as All-doing, all-pervading and trangendent. The point worth noting is that Sakti does not lovu hiu sight. It has also got Siva's primary position (or. Sakalo niskalo nantah Sakti rapyasya tadvidha, Ma. I, 18). By this first 

92. 

nention of Sakti with 3iva, we can rorm an idea that both, Siva and Sakti, have equal importanco. Later on, it appears as a desire of siva (nijoooha) and become a tool by which the Lord Isnicest Hindelr es many. This pr 12 ciple, in its inotruinentalises state, 15 torud us ways (ot. jagad utpadayanesa maya-Mavisya saktibhih, ma. I 25). 

The term "paya' nay not confusa readers, I wish 

to make it olear. Tha meya of Sankara's syatea is not accepted in this school. The place or that maya is taken by Sakti which is absolutely different from the torner. The fundamental distinction betwesa the two is that the maya or 'Sankara' School is non-sentient and therefore it has no relation consoious Brehman. But the Sakti or the Saiva School is conscious naturo of Siva and it 10 nover dirferent from hin. The word, maya in the verse, mention ed above, is used in twofold sense. Firstly it is unior stood as.Sukti, non-distinot from Siva. Secondly, it is not that maya or which Sankara is swaro. It is tattva rupa maya from which Kela eto., tattvas are originated. 

This Sakti, even in its manifestation as maya, continues to taka pra-erdinent position and the author has regarded it as beginningless, endless and all-pervading (ua. I, 28). A most important quality, attributed to it, 18 

Jagato nidaih" which literally means a atore house or the phenomenal universe. This epithet, used to show tho signirioano. of Sakti, also points out a bhasayada. We read from the text that out of this maya, those appear other prinoiples, such as, Xala, meu. vidya eto. 

In this conneotion, it is a noticeable point that the Supreme Reality, to whioh thiu sakti belongo, in thrown into a hollow back ground and its profound position ag 

baon awarded to Sakti. 

The opithets, such as, siva, 

93. 

Igani and Eka' refer to the signirioant position or this prinoiple. Inspite of its absolute onuness, which is 

denoted by the terza "k" it bud om au many and Quusds tho 

outegorical universu (cr. Asuta sa kala tattva 19. yad yogada bhavat puman, ma. I 27). Tha Ultimate Reality or the system has become a mere abstract idea or a pura exporience and it has been replaced, as the text says, by Sakti, which has been gradually brought to the forefront. 

INOM 

In connection with the utmost importance of Sakti, an add uoeable point is that the school layo much stress on the maya from which various categories spring up, though the process of oreation, viz., Siva, Sakti, Sedasiva etc., mentioned in the trika literature, is also agrseable to the School of Malini. 

In the foregoing paragraphs, I have pointed the twofold development of the Supreme will of siva a Sukis and maya. We must note now the third manifestation or this Sakti. This evolution or Sakti is tripartite, isoha, jnana and Kriya. The author, nentioning the proper nature of these Sakt is, has regarded this will as a oraation or the whole universo (jugaddhati1). The term undoubtedly, refers to the origin of natter and letters. In conneation with the oreation of various phonga, tho tounder or ths Wa. School has mentioned this Sakti as Mutrka and Walini, The further evolution of the Matrka into rirty lottore, called Saktis, is another remarkable point that refers to the significance of salti. 

In adaition to the manifestation or Sakti, un entioned above, there is another further tripartito development of Sakti, viz., Para, Parapara and Apara. This olassirioation is absolutuly based on the functions of Sakti. Ao we losrn from the text that the "Sakti of 

Siva is endless. It is due to its functions that it is olassified under three heads. The name 'para' stands for those benign Saktis which are Supreme like Siva and lead worldly creatures to the supreme status (of. Sivadhama phlapradah Ma. III, 33). By MParapara", we mean those Saltis which bear the progress or the limited selves (anus) towards the final goal by bringing about their attachment to the mixed fruits of their actions (Ma. III, 32). Last ly the 'Apara' is styled as 'Ghorataie' and it implies those Saktis which closely embrace the individual souls and draw them more and more downward by attaching them to the objeots of the senses (Ma. III, 31). 

From the direct or indirect references to Saktis 

in this book, it is not difficult for a reader to conolude the high position which this concept has got throughout the whole school of Malini. For example, let us examine 

the importance the exponent of the school has imparted to 

thig Sakti, 

At the very outset the word, "maric1" implies Sakti which is regarded as related to the moon of wisdom (oon soious Siva) in the benedictory vorge of this work. It is mentioned here as dominating the whole universe like the rays of the moon. 

Let us adduoe another instance which also con fers that the main character of the work is Sakta (rolated to gekti). It is Sakti that inspires the sages, Narada, Agastya, eto. for the study of Siva-Yoga and consequently they go to Kartikeya (Ma. I. 3). 

By a olose study of the contents or the work, wa oan form our opinion that the work breathes out the sakta 

spirit and represents a Sakta Vedanta. 

As soon as Karti 

-keya begins to relate the Yoga, heard from 3iva ani ! Parvati, to the gapos, we find that the Goddess tha, the divine consort of siva, is plaod on an equal footing with her Lord. Later on this equal position of Sakti becomes prominent. The suprome Principle, Siva, retires and his essent al nature oorog to the forefront with all the attri butes or her Lord. Wo see that Siva becomes a principle of pure experience and his Sakti reigns suprane over all the processes of the cosmic evolution, 

From the prominent position, awarded to Sakti, we can say that the founder of the Ma. Sohool has correotly estimated this principle and rogarded it as a world energy. : Its devotees are asked to concentrate themselves on it in the form of a woman. The worship of the womanly aspeot of God cannot be ignored as a vague idea of the Indian mind. The female character or God is highly respected by the Indiang. It is connected with the Sakta School or philosophy. 

It is an admiftod fact that the condopt "Sakti" 

occupies very important place rather uniquo ite oharactor in the history of the tantrika philosophy. Even the Saiva systems, which hold 31va as a Supreme Prino ipla, have not failed to recognise the importance of Sakti. It 19 believed that even Siva as suoh, without any reference to Sakti, is as good as non-existent. This means éven the state of existenie to be apprehended, as such implies the functions or Sakti without which we can not say that a thing is or that it is not. Even puro Boing to be realised ag pure being presupposes Sakti. Hence not merely ror the dynamic purpose but for the very existence of a thing, Sakti is highly noodful. Without Sakti, so it arrirod, being ax or non-being, light or derkness, manifestation or 

non-manifestation has absolutely no tomaniacs. This specifio value or sukti l'opresont 3 its waique oharaotar. 

On the other hand, the system or Bankuta, es usually understood, has its attitudo toward Erakaan as free from every form of Sakti. It says that puro exis tence or awareness or golr-bliss constituta tho vary nature of Brahman whioh ie solr-luminous. The advooates of Sakti analyse the concept of Bi'ahman and find even here Sukti is already implied. No doubt, it is cit sakti and It is this which accounts for the soir-lwinous nature of the Fare Bralman. In this conngotion, I may be allowed 

to put down the remarkablo verso or Bhartr Hari, a great Granarien and philosophor of his times, whor ain tha in 

portance or sukti is clarified. (cr. Vasrupata codutloanek ava bod hasya sa svati. Na prakasah prakagata sa hi pratyaya marsoni). This shows that even solr-luminosity (Svayam prakasatva) or Braliman implies the sll ont action or Sakti which is ong with it. 

One thing renains to be pointed out in conneotion with the Sakta spirit of the work. It is already pointed out that the tantrika Sadhana ror solr-realisation is ologe 

ly associated with the letters of two kinds, regarded as representatives or Siva and Sakti. Tha Ma. Sohool also follows this method or varna 3adhana very strictly in its owa remarkable way. It has ouus inglad vowels and aonso nants and named it as "nad iphanta" order. It indicates that the subordinate position or the consonants rosogaised by the Matrka School is not agreeable to the 1a. gyetem Congonants, as Grammarians also hold, are developed forms or vowel, but this school does not take thew in that light. It stresses that both, vovels and consonants, ex oplote (purna) in their nature and do not require mutual support 

. 

to exist. 

The author of T.A. also mentions that comingling of vowels and consonants inplias the equul position of Sive and Sakti (T.A. 15th., 133). The conuncntutor or T.A, hag olarified the idea that though the nad i phanta order 

breathes out the spirit or equality betwen siva und 

Sakti, but the character of the la. School is chiefly related to Sakti (of. Kintoo walinyangaktaaya ovubhavasya udreko yenoktum-parmarthatab S& sakti tanuh, T.A. 15th. A. Comm.). 

From T.A., it is uigo learned that there were other alphabet loal orders at vogue among the 3 a iva pecto as kulaputtalike tantra mentions but the Nad 1 phanta order was muoh used. Hence this order was adoptes by the la. 

sohool. 

'Tho work, in its nature, is relazio-philosophical and due to thig character, it is distinguishod from the 

triple thought. As ter as the question or do guatios is concarnud, both, the Ma. ani thu Trika Soho024 rayu ble euoh. Both admit ona Suprexua Prinoiplo, siva, una repra sent idealistio monimn. The pouition or sakti principio 18 not as primary in the Trika Sohool as it is in the Ma. system. Due to the domination or sakti to rozari tha Sohool aa sakta is, by no means, improper. The most distinguishing faatura that separate it from the triune 

system is its religious oulmination. The spooirio atti tude of the work is towards the praotloal Yoga. The work lays much emphasis on intuition. No@piritual wealor 18 transformed to the status of Divinity unlogg hiv intuitivo faculty is awakened by various tantrika ritua. Tho dootrine of the seven dharanad is an instanow or tho Taot. It teaches Sadhakas, how to idontify themselves with the 

08. 

supreme. First they ought to identify thoma elvag with the gross elements from which they start their sudhana. After transcending theao lowor lovels they should identiry themselves with the Inrinito. The montion of various dharanas is a proor or this eralual acont the work favours. Due to this religious forvour of the work, Abhinava Gupta hag regarded it as an authority and authentioity on the Trika (or. trikasaran malinimatain, T.A.). 

In religio-philosophical literature or the Agenio oulture, Malini vijayottara tantra occupies a very important place. Being arfiliated to the Salvagamas or Kaa hinir, it inherits all the wealth and grand aur of the Saiva mate physics and descipline. But in certain respecto, it geems to go beyond the recognised concepts of the Trika. There is no doubt that the Sohool was very anoiont and its 

teachings oame down in an unbroken succession through a line of teachers from times ium ouorial. Even in the age or Abhinava Gupta, who was one or the best exponents of the School, the line or the teaching or this school was already on decline. As a result or this, its progress was arrested and many of its so0rst teaohings becue a dead letter oven to the best initiative of the us.

### Summary 
#### ०१
FIRST ADHIKARA. 

SUMMARY. 

In the benedictory verse, the author has rerarred to the importanou of the universal congoiousness (01t Sakti) which prova 11. everywhere in the world. 

The author has brought Kartikeya, the son of Mahe vara and Uma, on the scene to relate the Siva-Yoga to the sagos, Narada oto., who approach him to learn tho 

game. 

He begins to tell them the story of Sankara Yoga as he has learnt it from Siva, whon ha was relating the same to Parvati. She, keeping in view the well being or ran kind, requested Maheevara to relate the there or siddh'a Yogisvari Tantra in its abbreviated for as the same in detail cannot be grasped by men or low intelligenoa. 

Sankar has mentioned the portion or th: Siddha Yogisvari Tantra, the name of which 18 Walini vijayotra Tantra and which He has got from Aghora (Anabhya Siva). The work mentions two olasses or the phenomenal objects. The first group, which contains Siva, Sakti, Mantra, Mantresvara, Mantramehesvara and Vijnanakala, is accept able. The name of the other group is avoidable, which inoludes the thro, impurities, viz., anava Mala, tho Karna Mala and Maya Mala. The two kupects, viz., imenoutal 

2. 

(Sakala) and transcendental. (Niskala) or ultimate Reality (3 iva) aro mentioned. Similarly Sakti, whion is not dirferent from him, has also two aspouts, dynamic (uutivo) and static Siva, desiring to oreate the world, first of all, greated eight kinds or vijnanakala (Pudsals) and awakened them to rise to the status of the Vantra, Mantre vara and mantramahusvara. 

The laportance of the independent Will of tho 

Lord (9iva), whio, oroates the universe by 1t, 13 mentioned.. 

The rirat limiting adjunot, which brings I iritation to hin, 18 his own free will, called Maya. 

The Maya Tattva oroatos Kala fron whioh the Asuddha Vidya is mainirested. Similarly the creation of the other tattvas. 18 pointed out. The three taints, ! 

strengthen the animal state of Siva and bring 1. imitation 

to His qualities, guoh as, all-knowarship eto. 

The Lord has created three and a hal sroras or 

Mantras, which liberated the Anus and went back to eter nity. Thus in course of time, the Anu,, when it is consi 

dered as capable of Katting liberation, is unified with 

the divine power. In this philosophy, lovation or fall of the individualgelr (Anu) 10 dependent on the Sakti. When the salvation of the limitodaclr is, intended, this Sakti in unified with the Anu and it is divide into thras 

classes. 

The unirloation with the Sakti in ltg acuto form cannot be realised by the aspirant in his physical boing. After getting this Sakti-Pata, tho Sadhaka aies at ongo and bacones 31va. The second Lind is reallued in thio body. The Sadhaka enjoys tho World and after death attaina Siva-3tate. In the third kind, tho aspirant is 

inspired and encouraged to go to 

toucher in order to 

1 earn Siva-Yoca. 

Eraphesis is laid on the Curu for the spiritual riso. The entire satisfaction of the Quru is highly 69sential for tha Sadhaka, who is said to be or four kinds, Samayi, Sedhaka, Putraka and Acarya along the four kinds of initiation. The Sivayoga cannot be completo unless one learns to distinguish betwoon the mooaptable and avoidable 

groups.

SECOND ADHIKARA 

SUMMARY 

3. Diversity begins from unity. To reach unity one must start from diversity. This is the fund arontal prinoi ple or the Tantrika philosophy. This adhikara, to illuo. trate dax&* this prino iple, msntions soven nothods or 

dharapa, by which a Sadhaka can oross tho oocan or the 

various principles to attain the supreme Reality. 

The 

names or these 'dharanas are as followi 

1. Panoedase Vidhi 2. Trayodasav idhi. 3. Ekada sayidhi. 

4. Nava Vidhi. 5. Suptavidhi. 8. Panoavidhi. 

7. Trividhi. 

The Panoad asa vidhi is applied to the Tuttvad, beginning from the earth to Prakrti Tattva. Siva in His activa State 18 different from Sakti. Again Siya who 13 

the chief pramatr assumes seven grades termed 'Saptu Pramati 

Bhunikas! in His wordly state (Sansari-dasa). 

The nanos 

of these soven measurers in descendius order ars as kun 

below: 

1. Siva Pramatr. 2. Mantrangbesvara. 3. Mantraovara. . 

4. Mantra. 5. Vignanakala. 8. Pralayakala. : 

7. Sakala. 

* 

Siva 1s not without nia Sakti.. Therefors thosa 

geven Pranatrs have also their sovun Saktis. 

Thus the whole number is fourtean. The foru or the thing on whion th. Pramatr Med itatos is called 'Svarupa'. This Svarupa in the Panoadasa Vidhi, in the case of the earth, is dulln688 (gadatvadi). The whole number 19 fifteen, 1.6., ono objeot of the meditation (Svarupa or Sakalantara) and seven Pramatrs with their soven Saktis. 

This is the lowest dharana, from whioh a Sadhaka has to start. After completing this cours of the lowost dharana and getting mastery over the olass of the twentytour categories, a Sadhaka enters into a bit higher teat, ballad *Trayodasa Vidhi'. 

In this higher dharana, Sakala Pruwatr with his Sakti becomes an object of meditation (Svarupa) and tho remaining gir pramutrs with their sakt18 nad itato. This method is applied to the six categories, 1.0., from Purusa to Kala (one Purusa Tattva and rive its aspects - kala, Raga, eto.). "This group, though inferior, is a bit super ior to that already mentioned. The next stop, whion an aspirant has to take, is elovenrola (Eladasvidhi) wethod which is applied to the Pralaya Kavali Praratrs as well as to the Maya-Tattva, both of which are superior to tho aforo said tattvas. 

The ninafold othod (Nava viali) 15 suquired for the vijnanakala Pramatrs who aro superior to tlu Pralaya kalau and who stand betwoon the Waya Tattva and Sudha. 

- 

promat 

Vidhya (Mayordhve Suddhavidyadhah, T.A.). In thig dharana, the object or meditation is Vignanakala with his Sakti on which the four pramatrs, from Mantra to Siva with their four Saktis, meditate. In this Dharana Vijnanakala with his Sakti is an objeot of meditation and the other four Pramatrs beginning from Mantra to Siva with their respect 

lva Saktis, are med itators. 

Nert dharana is Sapta Vidhi (sevenfold method) in which Mantra Pramatr with his Sakti is held an object with the other three measurers along their faktis. Tho Mantra Pranata is far superior to the measurers already mentioned as it has only one taint in the stata or baing destroyed. 

In the fivefold dharana, Mantrosvara is a form of 

an object (Svarupa) and the other two measurers with their gaktis are med 1tators who conoantrate on the objeot. 

Next to this dharana is the threefold method (trividhi) which has, from the Trika po int of view, con tains the significance of the triple Mantramaheevara Pramatr with hia Sakti as an object on which Siva with His Sakti 

moditates. 

The whole system mentioned in these seven dharanas ahows how an aspirant can rise from a grozd Stata to the supreme reality. The Trika dootrine does not dony tho objects of the world. Its chier mark is this that as gross objects are evolved from the subtlo prinoiplo vo an approach should be made to the subtle through the gross. 

The method of the seven weditations can be applied to the number of the one hundred and the eighteen worlds 

also. 

The Sadhaka practising thesa dharanak, soust inos 

la uniried with tho Sakti or Siva. The ran unified with the Bakti has perfoot devotion to Siva, success in the Mantras, control over tho ardaturty of the world and the accomplishment or his task. This Rudru-Jakti Sanavese 19 olags1ried into five divisionu, 1.., Phuta, Tattva, Atma, Mantra and 3 akti which again ure divided into riv®, thirty, three, ton and two kindg respaotively. The whole number of these Sanavojas is tirty. 

A great orphasis is laid on the three Sanavesas, 

viz. anava, Sakta and Sambhava, whion have their speoial 

signirioance in the plans of the spiritualisation or Sadhaka. The anava mentions physioal approach to tho fundamental Reality and inolud as all the means or tha Yoga method. In this Samavogs, the idea of duality prodca inates and a Sadhaka reaches his destination through duality. The Sakta Samavosa refers to & Sadhake or bheda bliada olags : realises the subjectivo units temporarily. He is not mentally balonood. Sakta is ohiorly related to the two fold effort, physical and mental. The third, Samavoua, Sambhava is, free rrom all the physical us well as mental efforts. In this state everything of the world seems consciousness. The whole univorse is full of siva (Siva maya). The cause or this arekening is a preceptor, who plays a very important part in the spiritual #phero' or Sa ivism. It should not be thought that the various Samavesas yield various fruits. They are dirferent means for self-realisation. I 

Tive states of the Infinito Siva point out his 

rivo Saktis due to which he is called panoa vidha ktya

As a matter of faot, a Sadhaka, in this stato, layu stress 

on the Pranaya in whion hs supor-inposes the supramo unity. 

. 2. Svapne-avathu - tho droaming ututo. In this state the Sadhaka a 120ards the masurablo' ground and rises a bit high. Consequently he stresses the higher-level and stabilised himself on the measure (Pramana). 

3. Susupta-avastha-dreamless sleep stato. In this position, the Sadhaka negateg the previous two levels and fixos himself on the level or the Pranatr. Ho 1o try ing to ascend higher but the ultimate goal is utill out of his reaon. 

4. Turiya-avastho-the fourth stato. Tho Stato refers to 3 uddha Vidya. The balano ed state or juana and kriya is not experienoed here.

the quiescent state or Siva when He Himsoll remains and all

3. For the practice of the Pranayama, Yogins. should know the following five kinds, viz., Puraka (Lit. 

filling up), un bheka (stopping breath), Reohaka (mission 

of breath) apakarsaka (Red uotion of breath) and utkarsaka (Elevation of breath). 

4. The Puraka, as it fills the nostril with the wind, is said to be of two kinds and six kinde. Ono kind 1s sva bhava Puraka as it naturally r1113 the nostril with the wind and the other kind 18 virocya that emitg out the 

wind with which the nostril was already 1111ed. 

5. In accordance with the holes or the nosa, the mouth and the upper palate, this Puraka is divided into six kinds which again become many. 

6. 7. Kumbhaka is or rive kinds, that arter the Puraka, it is called Vidhrta (withhola); the other kind 1.8 after the reooka. Two kinds are in the end or the Kua bhaka and apakarsaka. The firth Icind is Sva bhavastha (Natural). It is also of many kinds in accordance with different pices. 

143. 

8. 9. 10. Rooaka, as it is already mentioned, divided into two kinds, should be of six kinds. Utkarse is that when some portion or the wind obstruotei in a pla is carried to another place: When again some portion or this wind (which has been carried to another place) is carried away, it is aparkarsaka. These two kinds are of many kinds. A yogin, sitting in the Padma posture should praotise these pranayamas. 

11. 12. The wind stopped in Kumbhaka for ten seconds that is four matras, ia lower. The wind stopped for twenty seconds, that is, for eight Matras, is midaling 

and brings Suomess. 

The game wind, ir it is stopped for 

thirty seconds, that is, for twolve matras, is the best or all. Nine flappings of two fingers (thumb and midnost fingar) which cover the knee for three times, make twolvo matras which oorrespond to the thirty seconds of the modern time limit. A Yorin should not praotiso the second dharan till he suoceeds in the first dharana in which the time 1 im it is found as four matras, in order to remove the daroots arising from the wind. 

13, 14. A Sadhaks should not restrain the wind in the eyes as it sustaing every limb of the body. V dharanas of the wind , neming Sikhi, ambu, Isa and Awita should be known respectively in accordance with the mani festation of it in the navel, the heart, tho palato and the throat. The thing on which a Yogin concentrates his mind, should be meditated upon as pervading all the dharanes. 

15. In 1sani dharana, a Sadhaka bhould woditate on the form oonsisting or vindu (sakti) and Nada (8iva). Ip Amrta dharena, ho should concentrato hig wind on the 

moon with the same method as it is said to ba in the Kela 

tyaca (averting death). 

144. 

18. A Yogin who praotises these dherenas in his Yog io tranoe, after leaving asido tha uvoidablo croup,, goes to the abode which is the boot or all. 

17. The number or the dharanas: is twolvo hundred and forty-three by placing the words, mentioned in tho verse, in the reverse order, viz., Indu (Moon) moans one (1) the dvi means two (2) Veda means four (4) and tri moans three (3) In this reverse order, the figuras are written below: 1243 

By these dharanas, a Sadhaka obtains tha bost fruit mentioned in the following: - 

18., Dharanas and Tarka (Lopio) are equally parts of Yoga, or them logio is the better as it oritioises the avoidablo group. Therefore orrorts in this dirsotion 

deserys appreciation. 

. 19. If the mind or a Sadhaka is stab111yed in the way which is avoid a ble with a view to enjoy it, no uhould ooatinue to check it till he obtains the plado 100 Tram 

diseases and worries. 

20. A dharana is that when the mind is fully devoted to the thing, it wants to get. It is paid to bo the best Jnana (knowledge) full or meditation. 

21. A Sadhaka, practising dharana for a moment, gets costasy (Samadhi). If it is a complished he obbaing the fruit he desires. 

22. Whatever object a Yogia sono entrato 110 wind 

on does not change. Ho is fully absorbed into 16 and afterwards he loses his personal cristonos and assues the 

form of the objeot he meditatos on. 

145. 

23. The Yogin who pleases the group of the femalo attendants on Siva and who appears as it is a dead body oannot be shaken from his costatio state even by the sharp objects such as sound, scent and foeling... 

84. A Yogin, having drawn his mind from the objeots ot the universe again and again in aocordance with the way (above mentioned), should do Pranayana for tho auodegs in Yoga. 

25. Or, a Yog in, thinking the entiro enjoyments of the universe as unnatural (Virupaka), on leaving his body, goes to the eternal place. 

26. He should do the Nyaga which has lusturo k like that or Kalanala already mentioned in the reveros order that is from feet to forehead two times (dviyugnata). 

27. He, having done the fiery Dharana which pains vital parts of the body, should fill his body, from tho thumb of his feet to the forehead, with the wind. 

28. He, who knows Yoga, on drawing orr the wind from the thumb, should carry it to tho aperturo or the crown or the head (Brahmarandhra) and then he should out all the vital parts of the body by the following mantra. 

29. The word (giva' means 'Sa', 'Aaidvija' means "Ka which is again acoompanied by "Nawhich denotes the head. Again two words "Ka" and "gao guoooed to tho words mentioned above. Thus the whole Mantra is ab unders 

Men

34. The same wind is worshipped by the people in the forms or Mantras. O worshipped by the gods, this, the best knowable Jneya Sad bhava is explained to you. 

35. Even to Kartikeya who is not dovotee, this 

Mantra, should not be spoken by me. Having filled the bally with the wind till it reaches the aperturo or the crown of the head, it should be sent baok till it comes to the heart and yields the desire of Yogins. 

37. A Yogin should continue this praction for seven days till the wind pervadas the Navel. 

38. 39. From that day, a Yogin can draw oven gods by dint of k its practice. A Yogin can have tho best knowledge that has been practised by the other Yogins. There is no need of other low philosophies (Kuudra Sagana). First of all, there is a great Ghurni (a certain costadio movement) and then Kampe (trembling). After it, o deyi, a limited soul (Anu) seems as ir it is burning.147.

The word "Mukha means the Sakti or giva (cf. Saivi mukhamehooyate, V.Bhai). 

The Jagadananda® in the text befers to the ultimate Reality, T.A. 1st. A. Oom. 1st, verse. Besides, It also refers to the one and last of the six stages or pleasure, viz., N1Jananda, Parananda, Brahmand, Mahananda, oidananda, and Jacadananda. The stage is totally free from all dirrerentiations and it represents the state of 

Parahanta. 

The conception "Cit" or "Olt Saktin in Indian Philosophy is unique. The Western thinkers havo rodunod the phenomenal appearance into W111, Idea, Intention or Imagination. But it is Indian Philosophy whioh has reduo ad the whole creation into the concept or "010" (congoiousness) which pervadeg all the universo in the form or consciousness sub-consciousness and unconso iousness. Thus the visible world in its root as well as in ito manifestation 19 1 consoiousnesa. This idea is referred to by the worát "Marioayah" (Rays) in the text, whloh belons to Siva, who 18 said to be "the moon of knowledgo" (Jnana Candra). As 

the rays of the moon are not dirferent from hor. aimilarly 

186. 

Sakti or power of Siva is not different from the powerholder (Sakt iman). Thus Sive the male principle, in its quiesoont state is whole and absolute, but in its manifested State, it becomes Sakti, which is part and parool of its nature. The whole, though Sakti as a part is separated from it, st111 rema ing whole or full (Purna). Its fullness nover ceases. The one becomes many in its active state but at the aene time it holds its oneness and porreotion. The como idea 19 explained in Saktayosya Jagatsarvam". 

Verse 3. Siva Sakti ummukhi Karana - to bo Inspired by Sakti holds an important place in the Trika Philosophy of Kashmir. The other Philosophical scholars of India also stress on this inspiration and call it "Divine krace which is not dirrerent from the Sanskrit words"Anugraha" and "Anukampa". For the spiritual reall-, sation, divino grace is highly essential. Saiva and Salta philosophers of India call it "Sakt 1° which assumes many forms and produces diversirication of the unity or Lord Siya. It is this Sakti that lies united with siya in Hig repose in its latent form and is inactive. In its potont. form, it acts and manifests the whole universo. Tho Salti as a power or energy is everywhere. This Sakti ohining in us 18 intuition that it inspires man to understand the highest goal and makes him realise the truth of truthz. This intuition 18 different from reason which belongs to the World of senses. It has no hold over superhuman objects. When reason is ulumined by Sakti or by the 1 grace of God, it becomes intuition and is denoted by many terms such as Saksatkara, dardana and Anubhava oto. Tho Upanisads call it "Agrya Buddhi" in tho vorso "Drsyato Tvagrya Buddhya Suksmaya Sukomaadarsibh ih" (The universal selt is perceived through their penetrating and subtle in telleot by the men or subtle perception). Srimad Bhagavat187. 

Gita names it Euddhiyoga in the tenth verge of tho Book x "Dadar 1 buddhiyogam tam Yena Uam upayanti te". (I 81vo may devotees tha Yoca of wisdom through which they coke to me). 

This divine inspiration, in its highest form, is regarded as "Rudra Sakti S amavesa" (Uniricntion with the Sakti of Rudra or Siva) or simply ngakt ipata" (For the detailed information T.A. 13th A and Ma Vijayottara Tantra ist. adhi. 42, 43 and 44). 

Verse 7. Sa ivism and Saktian equally lay stress on the doctrine or enjoyment-Salvation (Bhuktl-Muktivada). The manifested universe, which is produced by Maya according to the philosophy of Vedanta, 19 trensitory and ephemeral. The Salves and Saktas do not deny it. It is the manires tation of the Sakti, whioh belong to Sive and therefore, it 13 real. As waves of water, flames or the firé and rays of the sun are not different from water, fire and tho gun respectively, similarly the diversified universo la not dirferent from the Bhairava". V.Bhai, 110. All the objects of the senses and enjoyments of the world, we seo, are enlightened by Siva. He is everywhere, hence his product is also real and enjoyable. The liberation, accord ing to Saiva philosopher, is not other than the expansion of consciousness (cit Sakti) of Siva. The enjoyment or vordly things does not stand in the way of spiritual zoalization. Therefore, the Saiva Philosophy treats enjoyment and 11 bera tion alike. 

The enjoyer (Bhoktr) has changed himsolr into the form of the enjoyable things (Bhogya). Thus tho enjoyment of the sensuous things oannot produce any obstruotion in tho way of the mataphysical reality as the enjoyer and the en joyable are one and the same. (T.A, 9th. A., Co. pago 

172). 

188. 

Thero 18 nothing inpure in this world which is the finit isation of the infinite. The world is real and enjoy. able. (T.A., 4th. A., pace 268). 

Verge 13 and 14. The term 'Aghora from whioh Siva learns the contents or Siddhayogiavari Tantra means Supreme Reality free from space and time. It is the state or transcendency and represents as united whole or 31va and Sakti (s iva-3 akti-Samarasya). It also implies the Supreme State of Sabda (sound) or und istinguished form. As a matt of fact, the Sabda, in its unman ifested form, la consoious 

ness. 

The Mr. T. 1st. Ve.lst. P.22, has explained Aghora in the sense of Mahesvara (Niskala or transoendent Siva) wio 18 said to be oongo iousness (ava boahe Rupa) and from whom all words (Sabias) evolve. 

From the Tantrika point of view, this state of subtle Sabda 13 oalled "Para Val" "The Vaiyakaranas roga 

it as Sphota or subtle unit of Sabda, from which all arti. culate sounds prooaed. Ordinarily we can call it Sabda Brahman. In all respects, its infinitude cannot be questioned. 

Verse 15. The meanings of the word "Anu" in ti • text are not clear as it is included in the group or acce: C a ble principles. Undoubtedly everywhere, anu implies ro lation with Mala (impurity) which belongs to the other group (avoidabla), viz., Sakala and pralayakala. Therer it should be noted that the term "Any" likely ütands for the vijnakala due to ita inclusion in the acceptable tatt Besides, the Vijnakala pranata 18 superior to Sakala and pralaya kala prametrs which are bound by two and three ta respectively, while the former has only ono Nala (anavame 

189. 

Verse 16. In the verse, three impurities Anava, Tarms and Mayiya Mala, which veil the real nature of give, are mentioned. The Anava Mala is most important or all the 

three because the whole process or creation depends on it. 

The nature of the Anava mala its regarded as obsduration of the essential characteristics of Siva, which are consciousness and freedom. Veiling of the nature of 3iva , is caused by his own will, T.Sa. mentions that the Aneva mala is not different from the will of Siva, which oonoeals his chief feature, (or. Soyan Malah Paramoavarasya 3vatna Pracohadanecohato Nanyat Yincidasti, T.Sa. Sth. A.). 

The mala is or two kinds. The first kind is that when the conscious nature of Siva 1080g its freedom (Sva tantrya). The Vijnakala pramata represents this kind because it is conso iousness devoid from freedom (ci. Vina nain Bod hatmakam Rupam Kovalam (Svatantrya Rahitamasya asti iti vijnanakovali (T.A. 9th. A Comm 02). 

The second kind of the Mala is that wisen froedom free from consciousness remains. 

Ir the rirst kind Jnana predominates but it has no freedom. In the second kind, there is freedom but consciousness d 18 appears. 

The second Mala is Karma (related to Karma) Mala | which appears in the form of the enjoyment of the bad deeds. 

This Mala is mainly said to be the cause of the world and degrades Anus till the next dissolution takes placo. 

The third Mala is Maya Mala, which appears as body 

and the world. The illuţion of the wordly things deludes the anus and they get themselves attached to the showy world 

or innumerable oontur 168. T.A. 1st A. Com. 24. 

um 

190. 

The dontrine of the three impurities is specially connected with the seven Prametrs, Sekala, Pralayakala, Tijnanakala, Mantra, Martresvara, Mantramahesvara, and Siva. To understand the proper function of the Malas in the gradual ascent of a spiritual seeker, a brief desori ption of the seven Pranatrs (experiencers) in ascending order is necessary. 

Sakal Pranata (The worst form of the individual self) possesses all the three Malas already oited and thinka 

that the objects of this universe are the only aim of life. 

He is at a loss to distinguish between the subjeative and the objective aim of the life. The subjective stage is far from his approach. He m1gunderstands his objeоtive life as eubjective one. He 19 fully involved in the tattvas pron the earth to the Fale tattva. This Pramata wanders in the tattvas and thinks them as a subjective Reality oving to the taints which hav entangled him into the tattvas, Siva, the highest measurer, in the form of a lower Pramata, that 

19 Sakala Premata, forgets His real state and remains in 

volved in the Mundane objeots for centuries. 

The Pranata 

cannot rige high unless the wonderful Sakti-Pata takes place 

and elevates him. 

In short, the Sakala Pranata repres onts the materialistic state and regards the nonself as self (Anat 

meni Atina bhava). 

Prajayakala Pramata has two Malas, Karma and Maya mala and represents a bit higher state than that or the Sakala. The Pramata is totally free from all the tattvas except Maya wherein it remains involved until the new oreation takes place. The transformation or the Prematr into the status of the vijnanakala is not possible unless the Karma mala, the duration of which is upto båya tattva, 

191. 

is removed. 

3. 11e 11126-artie ?: :& ad fom Yana and Maya Kale and has only one mala, anava. As regards its association with the various tattvas, it is free from all the impure principles. The status assigned to this state 1s intermediary because its territory is beyond the Maya-- tattava and below the Su. Vidye state (cr. Mayorihvam Suddhavidyadhah. T.A. 9th A). 

The vijnanakala Stage 1. just like a midaling stair-093e, from which the spiritual journey la said to be easily acoessible. The Pranata knows the conscious natura of Siva temporarily. The cause of this waving state is anave due to which, the Pranata cannot attain perfection in its self-realisation. 

The Vignanakala Pranata is auperior to those already mentioned, in two respeots. Firstly it has only one mala and secondly this Mala is also d'esirous to be destroyed (Didhvans iau). 

4. Mantra Pranata is a higher stage. It is free from all taints except the Anava Mala which is also boing destroyed (Dhvamgamana). In Vignanakala Pranata, Anava Mala is desirous of being destroyed but here it is under the power of being actually destroyed.. 

The two qualities or aspects, 1.0, Prakasa, (Manifesting aspects) and Vimaraa (the manifestod aspadt) are balanoed in this Pramata and this is the stato or Puro Path, i.e. Suddha Vidya in which Io (Aham) and Thig. (Idam are equally balanced. In other words, the aubicotive and the objeot ivo tendency of the Premata are squal. The state is technically called Samadhrtatulaputa Nyaya wiloh moans balance or the pans of the soalo. Tho exterior vyuthana 

192. 

and intorior (Samadhi) tendenoy of the measurer is in a perfectly balanced state. The inrinite state is still out of his approach. The Pranata somat imea reols porturbed owing to the Vyutthana and at other he is quito calm on account of the Samadhi state. His wavering state has not disappeared totally as the two States (Vikalpa and Samadhi) have their separability and aotivity. 

5. The Mantresvara Pranata is a higher state than that of the Mantra state. The Anava Mala is destroyed (Dhvasta). The objeotive tendency of the Premata is more active than the subjective one. The stress lles on "This (Idam) and not on 'I' (Ahem). The state corresponds to Isvara tattva which the diversity dominates for the timo being. The idea or "This or That" (Idam Bhava) has not yet totally disappeared. This universal conoclouenoss 18 more bent towards the objective worla then to the subjective ons. The Premata obtains the capaoity of doing good and harm (Sapanugrahakaryegu Saltata) (T.A. 13th A.. 185), but the state or Siva Pramata is at 111 d 13tant. 

6. Mantramahesvara is the last but one, 1.0., 

Siva. 

In this stage the least differentiation of tho 

univerge or in other wordg the idea of the separation or the world from himself which was more active in the Mantre svara state, a bit fades away. Though tho 1dea of 1-1038 (Anambhava) prevails more rapidly and actively, tho idea of *This' (Idam Bhava) has not yet died out absolutely. There is emphasis on the 'I' out or the two terms I" (Aham) and "This" (Idam). Oneness of Siva is yet to be realised. 

7. Siva Pramata is the last and final state, which has been said to be the ultimato Reality in this philosophy. All sorts of differences, es neqsurable (Pransya) and 

measurer (Pranata) disappear. 

The stato of tho Pramaya

The Pramata reallaos his real nature, that is, the universal consciousness. The free will (Santantrya Sakti) or Lord Siva, which has con tracted fis qualities and reduced Him into Manifoldness (Anekata) expands and brings Ħim into oneness. The aspi rant cannot feel this state or Sivahood in the physical frame of his body. So he has to part with his physical being, before he attained the supreme realization.

his consciousness. 

His Sakti, in its unmanifestad form, 

has also the same attributes, 

Verse 19. In the verse the process or creation is mentioned. The transcendent Siva, by his free will, creates eight Vidyesvaras aghora, parama hora etc. In the place or this group, Mr.1.1.4 mentions Ananta, Sukama, Sivottama, Ekanatra, Eka rudra eto, T.A. 8th A algo follows this order. 

As a matter of fact, this group or oight lords are said to be creators of the impuro road (Asuddhavadhvan) wh 110 Siva is a ruler of the puro path (ci. Sudalva Dhvani 

195. 

Siyah Karta Prokto nanto Sito Prabhuh T.A. ath.). The group of the eight Mantramahesvarao 13 eocompanied by tho nine Saktis Vama eto. and the Seven Karores or the lantras. 

This first creation or Sive, though has the characteristios, consciousness (Jnana) and Salti (freedom) which are found in Siva himaalf, but it oarnot dosorve to have the status of its Lord due to the ignoranca (Agu Vidya) which is also found in it. 

As regards the naturo or thesa Vidyesvaras, Mr. T. olearly mentions that they are a bit below tho position or Paramesvara and are said to be servants (Niyojya) of Siva 

(cf. adhikara Mala Vasegat Kinoit Ana vaptaparangavaraganya it yasyaite preryah Mr. I 4, 4, Conx). 

As Mantra-mahesvaras are servants or Sive, s41 larly mantras are also serventa (Niyoye) of apara Mantros 

varas which are under the Parawantrosvarag. 

We should note that this state of a xulcr and tho 

ruled (Preraka prerya bheva) continues in the process of 

creation. 

Verge 21. The number of seven drors mantrag la divided into two parts. The first half of the mantras is sent to universe to be used by Sadhakes for their doll realisation. 

The remaining hall is reserved by Siva to be utilized by his own will at any time. 

Verge 22. The mention of two Prematus, that is, vijnanakala and Pralayakala, points out that tho Sakald Pramatr has no place in the spiritual roalisation according to the Saiva faith. The position of tho Vignanakala 19 

superior to that of Pralayakala bocause the foror has only 

1 96. 

one Mala oalled Anava and the latter contains two. 

Verse 26, 27. The process of creation, according to Ma, is mentioned here. As it is already gtatod that: Paramesa, first of all, creates Ananta, Sivottama oto.. eight lords. They, through Maya create Yala tron which three classes of Tattvas proceed. In the following chart the process of the categorical development is given:

Verse 37. The form or the Yantra-ahosvaras is. desoribed just like the thumb (Angusthomatra) which relora to the Kala (Sakti). 

Mr. T. mentions the number or the Mantranahesvara one hundred and eighteen and their body is mado of Mala (Cr. Kaladyarabdha Dohanami Karotyastadasadhikan, lir. T. I 4, 9). It is the aparamantrosvara olays that has abt the197. 

body mado or Kala. 

Verse 42, 43. The author has referred to the doctrine of Sakti-pate or divino race in the verses. T.A. has mentioned nine kinda or Sakt 1-Pate but here only threo 

are stated, 

The first kind of Sakti-Pata" tiyra tivra" cannot 

be experienoed by a physical being. Ag soon as this Sakti comes, the Sadhaka breathes his last and is identified with Siva. In the end kind nadhyat ivra, the Sadhaka enjoys tho world ::: efter is, he deces cae viet te surans Reality. Accordin, to the third kind, called Vand ativa, the Sadhaka 

13 inspired to obtain this Yoza and consequently is taken to a good preceptor to have a spiritual inspiration from him. 

In the Saiva Tantras, the divine crac. is ompha. tically declared as a meens to spiritualisa Sadhakas. Direct or indireot intervention of Sakti is entirely need ful to a geeker of truth. Diksa, a religious rito, hola as "Significant by the Saiva system is a Pundamental l'actor that helps to create Sakti in the body of Sadhakas. The success or a Sadhake in his spiritual plano is absolutely dependent on the quantity and the quality of tho Salti. Pata that appears directly or indirectly (T.A, 150. A). 

Verge 48. The term 'Yoga-Diksa* means a rito which has its own importance in the Saive school. The e matter of fact, Diksa (initiation) is divided into two kinds, Jnanad iksa and Kriya Diksa (Yogad iksa). The first kind is conneoted with the intellect of an aspirant. It 

intellectually pur iries and properly equipe him for the second a iksa which is also classified au "godhonand "Yojan1". The funotion of the former is negativo as 10 purges the phys loal being, full of impurities. Tho gogona

SECOND ADHIKARA. 

Ν Ο Τ 

Ε 8. 

Verges 2-7. In the verges, various Dharanas (ooncentrations), regarded as essential parts of the Tan trika Sadhana, are elaborately mentioned. The author has pointed out the process of the gradual asoent for aelr realisation. The basis of this Sadhana is the oven grades (Sapta Pramatr Bhumikas) or Sive. The names of the grades (Sakala, Pralayakala sto.) are already explained in the notes on the 16th verge or the First Ashikara. 

It is the state or oreation and a Prematr never remains without his Salt 1. Thus in connection with thoso. Dharanas, seven Saktis with their soven Pramatrs should also be taken into consideration. 

Form (Svarupa) is also intimately associated with the Dharanas. It is the form on which a Prematr meditates. By form, we must take the essential nature or a thing. Everything, apart from its surfacial form (svarupa) has its real nature which the philosophers of the Saiva sohool call consciousness (citi). Every object or universe, though, outwardly it may appear in various forms duo to names and appearances (nama Rupa), is, in its essence, consciousness (Cidrupa). For example, man, apart from his physical forn, 18 cit Svarupa. Similarly the earth (Prthivi) apart from its nature of dullness (Jadatva) 18 Sivasvarupa in ita essential form. 

To take the real forn or an object in the process of Dharana is a significant element of the tantrika Sadhana 

implied by the seven methods nantioned in the above alokas. 

The whole nina bor or tko Panoada sariaw1 1s.fiftoon,

The founders of the school, keeping the tricho tomy in view, have reduced one pramatr with his sakti iuto svarupa gradually in ascending order and reached the final Dharana oalled trividhi in wh oh mantraaghegvera Panats is 

understood as Svarupa and Siva with big Sakti 46 Sesarded 

as Premata. 

All these seven methods refer to differentiation regarded as the state of Matr-liana-@ya. By Pranatr, Hana and Meya, we mean Sive, Sakti and Nara respeotively. 

The Saiva school or thought follows the mothod of the Tantrika Sadhana wh loh lays wuah caphasiu on the groue materials to reach the subtle or supreme Reality. It finds out the Infinite through the finito. 

To comprehend the whole poheme or tho sevou methods, it is helpful to arrange the various tattves in four groups laid dowa in descending order: 

First group - 1. Sive, 2. Sakti, 3. Sada viva 4. Isvaratattva, s. Sudaha Vidya. This group or the five tattveg is termed as Suddha Varga. In this claus, Siva ohiefly prevails. It is also tarnaça as a puro path (Suddha ad bra) in which Siva is all in all second group. 8-Maya, from this tattva onward the impuxo road begins A bit superior to this principle is Maanaya, who has intentionally been eliminated from tho sobou tho tativas by the Malini Sobool as it plays so imporüant. 2010 11 the g'ame. This group is mentioned as pure and nigus (zuhaha

(sud aha). 

Third Group. 7 Purusa, 8 Kala, 9 Raga, 10 avidya 11 Kala, 12 Niyati. Out of this group of the six oato gories, Purusa is an independent principle and the other five are his aspects. This group of the five tattvas including the Maya Tattua 18 daid to be six sheaths (Sat Kanouka). This group 18 also impure but not as impure as the other earth ato. are. 

Fourth group. 13 Prakrti, 12 mind (Hanap), 15 intellect (Budhi), 16 Ahankara, 21 five knowledge senses. 28 Five action senses. 31 Five subtle elements (Tan 36 Flve gross elements. 

5 en 

The first and the lowest method from whioh tho Sadhaka has to start, is the firteenfold method, in which the seven measurerg, their soven Saktis and the one object on which the measures with their Saktis meditate are in clad ed. For example, the earth or any other prino iple from the earth to the Prakrti is an object of meditation, which has technically been termed form (Svarupa). It is on this Svarupa that the seven Prematrs and the seven their Sakt is meditate. Thus the components of this Dharana are fifteen in number. This method is the lowest and is applied to the 4th group or beginning from the carth to the Prakrti (the whole number of the principles is twenty Pour) in ascending order. 

In the thirteenfold method which is applicable to the third group beginning from the Kala tattva to the Purusa, there is one Svarupa or Prameya. The six Pranatrs with their Sakt is are merged in the object or Pranoya. Hence the whole number is thirteen. In this Vidhi Pralaya kala Pranata predominates and the Sakala measuror who was mainly predominating in the Pancadaca vidhi assumes the 

201. 

It 

form of Meya (measurable) and his Sakti follows him. 1s trayodana vidhi. 

In the elevenfold method the Pralayakala who was measurer in the trayod esa vidhi becomes an objpot or the med 1tation (Meya) and the vijnana Kala oocupi the form of the main Pramatr. Besides, this method is also appii cable to the Maya Tattva when it is measurable. The merger of the Pralayakala Pramata along with Sakti whiobis mana (measure) should also be understood in this viani. : * 

Ninerold science holds the Mantra as a Main meagurer, whose Svarupa is vijnanakala with bis Sakti. Thug Vignanakala and his Sakti become one. The merging of the Vijnanakala along his sakti into Svarupa makes this Dharana, consisting of the four Pramatrs, four their Saktis and one object . 

• Sevenfold method has one Svarupa, one Pramatr who is, mantresvara, as a chief pramatr with his Sakti. The other superior measurers also continue to follow him.. 

In the fivefold method, the Mantresvara in Svarupa or Prameya, Mantramahesvara with his Sakti and Siva with His Sakti are measurers. Thus the whole number is fiva. 

It would not be out of place to mention here that the three methods from seven to three Vidhi, that is seven fold method, fivefold method and threefold method are pure methods as they conoern the pure 'group and therefore svarupa or Prameya in them is also pure. The measurers have to meditate on the pura Prameya (measurablo). 

In the threefold soience, Mantramabesvara is Prameya and Siva' with his Sakti is Pramatr. The signi floanoe of the triple Philosophy 11es in his last method 

202 

which shows the three Tettvas, 1.o., Mantra Mahesvara (Prameya, Sakti (mana and Siva all of which are the symbols of the ind ividual self (Nara) Sakti and s'iva respectively. (Nara Sakti 8ivatmakam Trikan). 

Thus the diversification beging from Siva and reaches upto earth in descend ing order. The Sadhaka : begins his Sadhana from the lowest prinoiple, 1.6., earth and attains Siva state gradually in the long run in the agcending order. All the methods above mentioned are

Verse 10. 

The position of a Guru is very impor 

tant in the Saiva School of thought. 

In most cases, he is 

regarded as 3lve. A Sadhaka cannot attain the status of Parama Siva in the Supreme state, unless he is uiried with the Sakti. The latter cannot be united with the former if a preooptor does not help him. For the process of libera tion, Guru, Dixga and Salt 1-Pata aro indispendable. These threo faotors are interrelated. 

The significance of the Quru lies in the fact that ho purifies the physical being of an aspirant by Sadhani Diksa, In the pure selr or the Sadhaka, Sakti enters and helps the preceptor to transform the Sadheka into suprema 

204. 

ieality by means of Yojani diksa. 

In some cases, without the help of the human guru a Sadhaka is directly transformed to the state of Supreme Reality. Due to these rere cases, we should not under 

egtimate the high status of Guru. This sort or spiritua lisation of a Sadhaka must be taken as preceded by the divine Guru that is siva. In any case, the high position of the Guru cannot be denied. 

Verse 17. The term 'Rudra Sakt 1gamavesa implies the well-know doctrine of Sakti-pata understood as essen tial key for self-realisation throughout the school of Saiva Sadhana. According to Sa iva canons, one Siva appears as many by means of his own free will. 

omes 

Ag inrinito Siva is rinitised by his own freedom, similarly He becomes infinite from his finite forms by his own Sakti. According to the Salva canons, the freedom or 

Svantantrya Sakti of Siva plays a double role. In both 

cases, one Sakti is called by two different names. When it abgourates the essential nature of siva, and makes him & Pasu (animal) it 18 Roddhri Sakti. The other Sakti is termed vikesini or Santa, due to which the Pasu or the bound (Baddha) is transformed to the state of Supreme 

Reality. 

In accordance with the Saiva Scheme of Liberation, nc Sadhaka is enabled to attain the status or Siva State, 

unless the Sakti intervenes and helps him in his spiritua 11sation. 

This intervening of Sakti or Sakt 1-Pata oan appear in a Sadhaka of an impuro and puro state. Ma., for the appearance of Sakti, has collectively mentioned five states or a su. and Su-Adhva. A Sad hala of the state of Panou 

205 

Mahabhuta, tattvas, atman, mantra and Sakti can be unified with the Balti oalled *Santa' and hence the Sastra has classified the Rudra Sakti Samavesa into 'Tive kinds, which aga in are arranged into Subdivisions. 

18. 19. 20. In the verse previous to this 18th verse, the entrance (Samavesa) or the Siva-Sakti is describ ed as it has five kindg. The five kinds are also mentioned there. Objections is raiged that the separate mention or , the Sakti Samavesa serves no purpose, because, all the Tattvas Bhuta etc. fall under the categories, therefore, only one Samavesa 1.6., Tattva Samavesa will surrice. In the word tattva' all these separately mentioned tattvas are included. The objection is removed. By the separate mention of these tattvas, the author means to lay emphasis on the principles and show their primary importance in the 

Samavesa. 

Bes 10 as, the other point of objeotion is the mention of the thirty kinds of the tattya Şamavosa as the Tattvas are thirty. In the philosophy of Trika, thirty six tattvas are mentioned everywhere. The mention of the thirty tattvas 1g curious when the number of the prino iples in this philosophy is thirtysir. Malini is 81lent on this objection. The Matrka school of Abiinava Gupta has dis cussed this question in the 13th A or T.A. To know the essence of the thirty categories, all of them are arranged in the three groups viz. Pure group from Siva to Suddha Vidya, pure and impure group, Mayatattva only and the third 

impure group from Kala to earth. In the first group, there are five tattvas, 1... Siva Sakti Sadasiva, lavara. Tattva and Buddha-Vidya which are the five aspects of one ultimate principle, Siva, who has been regarded as full of five Saktis (Penoa Sakti Sun ir bhara T.A. 9th A, 49) siva 

208. 

is divided as fivefold by keeping His rive funotions in view. These five functions oorrespond to the tive prin oiples, 1.e. 31va, Sakt 1, sto. T.A. 9th A.V.50. Thus thi. division is dependent on the primary nature of the functions of Siva who in reality, is one, full of Saktis and beyond the tattvas (tattvatita). 

The second group is Maya, which has been mentioned 28 Maya Sakti of siva and 1s identical with Him (Tadavya tirekini). It is the part and parcel of Siva and is oited as all-pervasive indivisible (Niskala) the cause of the universe and everlasting (Ma. 1st. Adh.). 26. Thus this Maya tattva does not have individual entity and hence it has been included in the Sakti of siva (Siva-Sakt yavina Bhavat) T.A. 9th A.152. . 

Maya Tattve has also two aspects, 1.. its baleno ed state (Samavestha) and un balanced state (Vigamat'agtha) Meya in its un balanced state, i.e. when it is disturbed (Ego bhama panna) creates the universe (T.A. 9th A.V. 158). Maya is also not counted as Tattva on the basis of its : balanced state, which is part and parcel of the nature of 

Siya, 

The third group, in which the thirty tattvas, from Kala to Prthivi are included, as a matter of fact, is the real number of the principles. The author has, kept this idea in view and therefore, he has mentioned as the thirty kinds or the tattva Samavesa. 

Verse 21, 22, 23. In the Saiva sohool of Philosophy the three means or upayas, viz. Anava. (Anava & amavęsa) Sakti (s aktasamavosa) and Sambhava (Sambhava Samavesa) upayas aro prosoribed for the three classes of the Sadhakas. The Upayas aro entirely based on the three207. 

states of Sadhana. The lowest state, called Anava, totally oonnooted with the puryestaka. In the State, Sadhaka stabilisee himself on the objects of materiality. He takes senses, body and other physioal things as congo ious 

In Anava state, these objects are understood as cittųttva'. Psychophysical complex or hiva (arirendriya) is supreme Reality. In short the ampir 10al experiene. predominates in the State. 

The basis of the Sakta State is mind regarded as the ground of doubts or Vikalpas (Cinta Avastha). It is a state of mind and totally dirfers from the previous one where in body and senses are primary. The Sadhaka of the state tries to rise from this mental plane but doubte 

(Vikalpas) oocupy him and he remains in the wavering position. The state, preceding to it, was entirely objective. It is the balanced state of subject and object. Neither subjective unity nor objective plurality stays' 

permanently. 

Sen bhava olaas implies the state, free from all dounts, (Cinta Suya avastha). It is the stato of subjce tive Reality, to some extent, it resembles the objectless tranca (nirvikalpa Samadhi). 

In short, the bases of the anava Salta and Sambhava Upaya ara body, mind and moul (Atna). 

For self-realisation, a Sadhaka or an objective state should adopt the anavo paya in which all the physical meang suon as Vegara, Karane, Dhyana, Varna and sthana'are primarily included. 

Uooara - tho toria Innown aq pranocoara in the 5th A of T.A. is apecially connooted with the Pranayana 

(breath control) syatan elaborately oxplained in th 

208 

Patanjala school of Yoga. Sva, T. also has stregsed the 

pranasamcara method as means for self-knowledge and stated 1ts process in connection with Diksa. 

By Vocara, we mean to have control over the various movements or the five winds (Vayu) called "Prana, apana, samana, Udana' and 'Vyana' which 'exist in the human miorocosm. A Sadhaka of an objeotive state should try to lead his prana Vayu upwards and check the downward tendenoy of the Apanavayu. After controlling conflicting movements of prana anda pana, the Sadhaka has to stay on the Samana Vayu, a symbol of balance. From this normal state onwards simultaneously twofold erfort is needful. The Sadhaka should continue his labour upwardly and Inwardly till he reaches from 'udana to vayana, a mark of the all pervasivo and subjeotive Reality. 

Besides, one has to bear in mind the conception of Kaladhvan with which vacakadhvan (varna-mantra-padas) 

is closely associated. The torm, uocara, also prints out that a Sadhaka of the anava olass should start hia Sadhana from pada mantra and varna gradually to achieve a supreme goal of life. 

Karana. The second term included in the anavo paya is Karana, which simply and literally means a medium, a device or a Sadhana to obtain something. Abhinaval Gupta has teohnically explained the term and olassiried it 

into seven kinds (or. Grabya-grabakacidvyapti tyagakse panivesanaih. Karnam Saptadha Prahuh eto. T.A. V A. 29. 

1. Grahya: Grahya and neya (measurable) are synonyms and refer to the objective state. All objeots or the empirical universe should be regarded as conscious - ness (oit). In other words the gross things pr materia 11ty should be taken as evolutions of one omnipresenti 

209 

subject. 

2. Qrahaka: By the term, the subjectivo I' or experienoer is taken. It exists everywhere and does not differ from the congo lousness (oit). 

3. Cit. The senge of consciousness should be trans -ferred to the emperienoer and not to the experienoed. It should be regarded as an only substance that experiences the whole moveable and imoveable universe in it and holds a pre-eminent position. 

4. Vyanti. 

It means the pervasion of the three 

energios of Siva, called technically, Para, Parapara and apark or Iccha, Jnana and Kriya. They, in their creative state, sustains all universe and, in the time of digsolut 1on, return to Siva and remain there as part and parool or 

his nature. 

5. Tyaga. 

The term, as a matter of faot, liter 

ally means to give or to sacrirloe. 

But here it is used 

in the senge of the threefold creation viz. Para-visarga, Paraperavisarga and apara visarga of oongo iousness re presented by the epithet 'I' or 'Ahem. Acoording to the 

Tryaca', all sounds should be understood as merged in the all-pervading conso iousness. The letter a' in the epithet is representative of Para Visarga and implies the universal self, Siva. It 18, according to the Trika Sohool, ma in source of all letters of alphabet. 

The joint position of the term 'Ah' representa Para-para Tisarga because both separately symbolise them selves as para and apara visarga correspond ing to Siva and Sakti respectively. It is a state of subjeоtivity plus objectivity. 

The apara visarga points out the impure class

6. Aksepa. The torm impliou that the Citi (Congoiousness) holding all the tattvas in ltuelt should be realised in human body (T.A. 25th A. 172). 

7. Sannivesa is to roaligo consciousness in the dirferent parts of body by the special postures of limbs (pudras). 

The term 'Karana' is taken in the senso or Vudra (a special posture of body) in Siva Sutra Vimarsini.. 

Dhyana. By the term, the author neang Intelli genoo which should be free from all sorts of objoots.

The term implies the various dalras

In the dreaming state (Svapna) the mental trend of the Sad haka is not towards the material objects. He does not hold them as real (Bahyabh imata Bhavanem Ayagra hanam, T.A. 10th. A com. 254). In this stato Pramana (Measura) stands pre-eminently and various mental tendenoios begin to come to an end. The state or non-differentiation rises and the Yogi proceeds towards the balance of mind 

The other names of the state ar Padastha and Vyapti. This state has algo four kinds, viz. gatagata (Lit. going and con ing) somet Inos nental balance goes away and sometime comes baok.

fourth kind 18 susamahita (Lit. perfeotly balanced) which has been named as a Svpne-Turya". 

In the dreamless sleep state (Susupta) the Pramatr (measurer) sees the exterior obfoots indifferently. There is no total ond or these as it is in the fourth state (Turya) (Natu Turya Dasayamiva Sarvatovigalan am (T.A.loth A Com. 262). The Prameya (measurable) and Pramana arol: thrown into a background and measures occupies the Primary

position (Bukhya Matradasa Seyam) T.A.loth. 260). The other two names of this state are Rupastha and Mahavyapti.

Thor, is the total disappearance of all dis-appo intments. The state can be said to be as Sakti. Samavega' (T.A.l0th 265). 

All the differentiations of Meya, Mans and pra matr disappear and hence it is called quito calm but not as calm as the Turiyatita is (T.A. 10th. 871). The other names or this state are Pradaya (Lit. Gathering, 1.0., the whole universe seems united and hence heterogeniety goes : away) and Rupatita (Lit. beyond the form, 1.0., the state of Paragakti). Unlike the other states, 1t is divided into three kinds, viz., Manomanam (Lit. when mind leaves aside its main action) and wanders to and fro which 1s neationed as "Turya Jagrat'. In Ananta, there 18 the want or stability in mind attached to so many places and objeots. It is technically called as "Turya Svapne and the third kind is Sarvarth (all the world stands as the form of Sakti) as "Turya Susupta'. - The fourth kind, such as Turya-Turya cannot be possible in this state because the Samvit 

214.. 

(Consciousness) is not knowable (Vedya). It stands in the form of a knower and shines independently (T.A.l0th 275). 

Thefifth state, i.e., Turyatita (Beyond the fourth) 1s perfoot, independent and full or bliss. It is

Keeping in view, the comon man', the Yogi and Jaanin, the author has mentioned the other names or the four states but this state has only two names, Turyat ita, commonly used, and Maha Prabaya used by Jnanis.

THIRD ADHIKARA. 

NOT 38. 

Ve. 8-15. In the verses, from the Tantrika point or view, origin of letters 1s mentioned. It is 

221. 

already stated that the froe will of Siva is regarded as a source of all creation. The author has named it as looha' and it is said to be an und ifferentiated form of the universe of phenomena and lotters. This Iooha represent ing unity, assumes its two forms called 'Inana and Kr'lya' gaktis, in the state or creation. Both, Jnana and Kriya are evolutions of fooha. The former represents the interior state of differentiation while the latter is externalised form of looha. These three states correspond to Para Sakti, Mahamaya or Su-Vidya and Maya. From the other point of view, the states also represent Para Nada, Nada and Matrka. In faot; 1t 1s Matrka or Maya from which letters are originated. 

In this conneotion we should also take the Mantra to whom Siva has entrusted the work or creation, into consideration. The Ananta creates all letters a ho hears in the Nada Stato (Tatsamangrutin varnan Tatsanichya nasrjat prabhuh, M.III. 27). 

As Icoha has two forms, similarly Matrka algo consists of two forms, viz., vowels and consonants corres pond ing to Vija and Yoni respectively. 

Both Vija and Yoni represent "Avikirna Avastha" (State of non-radiation. It is the state or radiation when Vija and Yoni develop into sixteen vowela a, a, 1, i eto. and Kavarga cavarga eto., groupinga, respeotively. 

The following chart will clarify the idea of Matrká as a source of the gross (Sthfila) letters: 

228. 

(Und irferontiatod atate). Para Sakti. Para vak or Para Nada 

II (Stato of dirferontiation not externalised) 

Nada, Mahamaya Orgu-Vidya. 

III (stato or differentiation sthula avastha)

Yoni (Vyanjana). Won-radiated State. 

a, a, 11 uur rir lr e aio 

ou agn ah Radiated state. 

Kavarga Cavarga Tavarga Tavarga Pavarga Yavarga Savarga. Radiated stato. 

From the Tantrika point of view, all letters mentioned above are classiried into nine groupa viz. Vowel group (1) Kavarga (2) Ca - (3) Tav (4) Tav (5) Pay (6) Yav (7) Sav (8) Ksavarga (9) 

The ninth group 18 oalled 'Cakresvare" (of. Caku svaragahityena Navavargah (T.8.). 

Along these nino groups -nino Saktis Mahesi ota. 

are mentioned in the text. 

Acoord ing to the Tantrika school or philosophy, origin of sound algo implies the creation of the categorical universe which is mentioned, in brier, below: 

Sabda - 

- Akage 

Sparsa 

Vayu 

Rupa 

-- Jala 

Rasa 

- 

Jala 

Gandhaa 

---'Prthivi. 

Por detail, let us mention that all the Mantrag laro made of the vowels and consonants regarded as repro Bentative of the seed (Vija) and Yoni or Siva and Sakti respeotivaly. Accord ing to the Matrka school, a11 letters reprosent themselves as Sakti from which thirtysix 

tattvas spring up. 

. The twentyfive tattvas from Prthivi (earth) to Purusa owe their origin to the twentytive consonants from Ka to Ma, i.e., to say, the five Mahabhutas (material or gross elements), viz., barth, water, light, air and other, are the results of creation from Ka to Ma. The five tanmatras (substances or @gsenosa), viz., sound, contact colour, savour and odour spring respectively from oa to na. The creation of the five Karmondriyac (organ or action), viz., voice, hands, feet and the organs or the exoret ion and generation, is due to the five consonants from ta' to 'na' respectively. The five consonants from 'ta' to 'na' 'give rise to the five Buddhindriyas (organs of peroeption), 1.9., the car, the skin, tho eyes the tongue and the noro Tho flvo principles 1... Manas (mind) Ahankara (self-arrogation) Buddhi (intellect) Prakrti and Purusa (selr) como out of tho rive letters from Pa to Me respeotively. The four tattvas 1.0. Paga (limitation in ragard to interest lit. attachment) Vidya (limited Imowledge) the kala (the power of imited creation) and Maya (the generally limiting power) proceed from the consonants, Ya, ra, la and va. The five letters viz., Sa, Sa, Sa, and Ha rexpresent the five tattvas 1.. Mahamaya (graat 1llusion). Suddha vidya (truo or puro knowledge) Isvara tattva (Lit. Lordi iness) Sadasiva and Sakti, respectively. Thus Siva is not considered as oategory. Some of the Saivas include Siva also in the oategory and arop down the Maha Naya as a tattva. 

224. 

The oreat lon of the univeras, consisting of the Tattvas above mentioned, is based on the Matrkas from 

a to na and rinds its source in a which is all transcend ing Parama Siva of the nature or bliss and all complete in Finsolr. This a' is the Parama slve, who is technically termed as Anuttara' in the 3 aiva literature 

or Kashmir.. 

Philosophically and gramatically vowels are in dependent sounds and have their primary importance in the formation of nearly all the consonants. For instance, the consonants of the Ka, on, pa, ta and ta series boing serially the developed forms of " "1" " 

u r ! and Ir and like them gutturals palatals, labials, oerebrals and and dental respootively. Similarly 'ya' and 8a are but developed forms or 'ca'Ra and Sa or Ta Le and Sa or Ta; va of ta and pa combined, and "ha' is the developed form or visarga. In short, the miverso is an aggregate of the Matrkas from 'a' to 'hall and may be traced 'a' ag its source. In tantraloka sistosun Rudras are mentioned as the representatives of the sixteon vowels but among them 'a', whion is. Parara Sival! or Anuttara as it 18 termed, has been laid stress on. It is this anuttara or 'a' in which all the other lotters have their source. Thus the wholo material universo or the Matrkas begins from the a' which is 'a symbol of transcend ing 3iva and the universo created by this 'a' represents the sakti aspeot or imanental aspeot of the game all-pervading prinoiple. In the end the mystery of Siva and Sakti is found in the lotter "ka, which is but a combination of 'kall the developed form or 'a' or the Anuttara and 'sa' tho dovoloped form or Visarga or Sakti. It can be concluded in other words that it brings to light inueparability or onenes of 

28. 

Siva Sakti. 

Verse io. Sixtoon Rudras are mentioned hero and they represent sixteen vowels from whioh all consonants gpring up. 

Vorge 84. Thirty rour rudras and thoir Saktis represent thirtyfour letters from * to Ks. 

Varse 27. The Ananta, the first puro eroation of Sive is awakened first of all. In ma, this Ananta is said to be Aghora with whom the other seren lords are created. The lord hears all mounds in the Nada state and creates them in the state of Katrka. 

Verga 80. Sakt18 or Siva aro innumerable.. 18 their funotion due to which they are classified into three divisions, viz., apara, parapara ana para. The first kind degrades the anus and represents itself as a symbol of diversity. The second is a bit better than the previous one. It obstruote the fresdon (lukt inarga nirodhini) or the finite self and implios the Bhsda bheda (unity in diversity) state. 

The para sakti leads the limited sell to the status or suprema Reality and is understood as a symbol Or unity (Abheda). 

Verse 36. The formation of Sakta body mentioned in the verae ind inates the sense of purity which an aspirant has to infuse into his physical being. According to the Tundamental principle Servan Sarvatmaken Calvar every object of universo has its two points of view, objectiva and subjective. The hwan body from the objective point of view 1impure though from the latter point of view, 

is pure. The Tantriloa Sadhana lays much' onghasis on the 

226. 

subjective state, which cannot be entirely removed. For the transformation of the objective body into the subject ive one, the cultivation of Sakti in the former le necessity The formation of Sakta body and infusion of Sakti into 1t serve twofold purpose. Firstly it purifies the objeo tive body and secondly it enablos a Sadhaka to realise his true sell as suprešao Reality. 

FOURTH ADHIKARA. 

NOTES. 

Verse 4. 

The term 'Yoga' is used in its literal 

TE 

sense and meang unirication of something with the other. 

Verse 7. Simply Dikaa or initiation is a Tantrika rite, which purges a Sadhaka of his taints, imparts purification to his self and equips him for self realisation. Sometimes this self-purification (Atna Sanskara) comes from Sive who by his own free will, infuses Sakti into a Sadhaka and brings hin to the status of Supreme Reality 

Guru is an important factor in diksa. It is Guru who initiates his pupil and imparts hin Sakti. By the awakening or Sakti the Sadhaka gets himself liberated. 

Thus both, Guru and Sakt 1-Pata, are specially assooiated with the Diksa rito. 

Diksa is divided into two divisions. Jnana and Kriya diksa. The former is conneoted with budahi ot intellect and purges a Sadhake of his bauddha ajuana (intelleotual taints). The latter is assooiated with spirit or salt and removes the Paurusa afnana or the ignoranoo related to spirit. According to the Saiva!. Aganas, 1t is a fact that no Sadhaka la identaried with the227. 

Inrinito zelf by fnana-dikde-unless him innata impurity, ballo anuva mala, is destroyed by tho Kriya-aika. For the state or Para Mukti or perfect liboration, the purga tion of Anava Mala le entirely needful. In this respect the position or riya Dikra is superior to that or the Jnana a 1ksa. 

The Iriya i. Olassified into two kinds, Sodhand (purificatory) and Yojani (unifying). The function or the former is negative while that or latter is positive. 

Verse 10. 11. The two torms Adh innayonl' and Bhinneyoni' are very ambiguous and are used to denoto two gohools Matrka and Malini. Both are regarded a Baktig. They are conoeived on the basis of the two different alpha bet1oal orders at vague in the early part of the oth aen tury A.D. 

The alphabetical order of abhinneyoni Malini or Matrka rentions towels and consonants separately. 

The order of the alphabet, aooord ing to the Bhinnayoni Malini, is dirferent. The alphabetical order or this school is ourious and representa the comingling or vowels and consonants. In this ordor, vowolo Improg nate consonants. This order begins from na and ends in pha.

kinds or Yoga and Jnana in the end of the Chaptor, has proferred Jnana to Yoga. 

Verse 28. The three kinds or Jnana, Sruta, Cintamaya and bhavanamaya, in fact, correspond to Bheda , Bhed a bheda and a bhoda phases of philosophy. By Sruta Jnana, the author means to say that the knowledge which a Sadhaka has from the Sastras. It. 19 said to be interior to the Pratibha or natural Jnana (intuition).

By the bhavanamaya Jnana, we mean the pure, state of self (Atman) absolutely free from doubts or Vikalpas. This Jnana is connected with inner experience or intuition and represents as a nirvikalpaka state or obscotless trance. 

Summing up the three Jnanas, we can unhesitatingly say that the Sruta implios objcotivo. As regards the nature of Cintamaya, it is the state or subject and object and corresponds to the Savikalpaka Samadhi or Yoga sohool. The bhavanamaya 1a ropresentative or objetloss tranco.

Verse 33. The term 'Yoga' means physical Yoga and refers to the Yoga school of Patanjali. It is divided into four classes, praptopad esa, Ghatamana, 8 iddha and Susiddha or Sida hatama. 

Praptopad oga is an @lerontary state or a Yogin who learns various methods of Yoga from a good precoptor, and practises thom. 

The Chatamana refers to that olass of Yogin who controls the tendenoies of his astraying mind. It is en un balanced state of mind. 

Siddhayoga means a balanced stato or a yogin, who 18 absolutely stable in the objest or his meditation (Samadhi). 

Susiddha is the symbol or objeotless tranco (Nirvikalpaka Samadhi) and represents perfect stability of mind. Disturbance of any kind cannot betray his kontal equilibrium.

IIYTH ADHIKARA 

NOTES 

Bhuvanas are a part of sixtola road technically called 'Sadad hran' whion is a ivided into two heads viz. Vacakadhvan and Vapyadhvan. Every one of thean from the Trika point of view, is olassified into three divisions 1.6. Sthula, Suksam and Pera (Cross, subtlo and beyond subtle). As regards the Vadakad bvan, it' consists or Varna, Mantra and pada, symbolised as Moya Mana and Matr, corresponds from the Trika point of view, to siva, Bakti end nara. Similarly the Vaayadhvan also consists of Kala tattva and bhuvana, understood as three different ways for self-realisation, and corresponds to the para, sukama and 

sthula. 

One hundred and eighteen Bhuvanas mentioned in the 5th Adhikara aro distributed among the four andas referred to in the socond Adhi, of Me. To every one of four andas, Parthiva, Prakrta, Maya and Sakta, tour Kalas, called Nivrtti, Prat istha, Vidya and Santa are allottod, respootively. To Siva Tattya, regarded as andatita, santatita Zalo is attribute. Like the four masters of 

838. 

the four andas (andadhistata) called Brahma, Vienu, Rudra and Isvara, masters or Bhuvanag (Bhuvanesa) are specially referred to in T.A. 

As regards the differezo0 between the masters of andas (Andadhistata) and the masters of the Bhuvanas (Bhuvanesa), the former are inferior to the lattor. The class or bhuvanegas has twofold body called Mayio (made or maya) and va indava (a body consisting or maya as voll as or Su-Vidya) doha. It is the latter quality due to which Bhuvanesas have divya Jnana (divino lowledgo). By this Jnana, they can initiate their servants (Prerya) and can work as Guru but this capao ity leoks in the masters of the andas (andadhistatr) because they are not above the level or Maya. Their body is also Haya-made. They are totally devoid of the contact or su-Vidya Whioh is a main faotor to bring the Bhuvanesas to the status or superiority. 

For the detailed pervasion or the Bhevanas, see diagram in the sixth Adhikara notes. 

SIXTH ADHIKARA. 

NOTES. 

In the wholm adhikara, anganyasa, a religious rite, is treated in detail. In general, it is connected with all the religious ceremonies of India and in partit cular it is understood as most important part or the Saiva rites. The first neosssary stops which a spiritual socker has to take aro Bhuta-Sudahi obtainablo through anganyasa. In fact it helps d 1ksa to transform the Mayiodeha (body made of Maya) to kundalinidohe whioh is again conneoted into the Saktadaha. 

Keeping three classes or mon, viz. dvaitavad in 

238. 

dvaitadvaita Vaaln and advaitavadin, in view, the author has divided it into three divisions, called apara viani, Paraparavidbi, and paraviahi. The cxplanation of-there | anganyagas with their demonstbativo charts 1o givon in 

Ita proper place. How 16 sufrloos to pay that no Sadhalaa without a proper anganyasa can be admitted into a Baiva initiation, 

Verga 8-B.. When a Sadhaka has to redoivo the in it iation of knowledge, he is advised to consider all the prinoiples in his own body (niorocoam) for the purpose. The Sadhaka und er initiation is ordered to perfor various Anganyasas which have been mentioned according to the threefold method, vis., Apara V1021. Parapara viani and Para Vidhi wh loh point out thro. Philosophies of Dualien, dualisms non-dualism and non-dualiw, respectively. As already mentioned all Tantrik Sadhanas begin from obvious and gross substances and co up to subtlo ones. The Sadhaka has to nod itate on thirty six tattvas in his own body which has the measure of eightyfour fingers, from feet to rore. head. Thus he begins his Ange Myaga from Dhara Tattva in feet to Sadasiva tattva in the forehead. Thus the remain ing two prinoiples that is Sakti and Siva aro supposed as porvading the whole body and are eliminated from the thirtysix principles. All those tattvas are sllustratea Oin tho Sadtr insat tattva Nyasa Vidhi in the following: - 

23. 

The body of a Sadhaka fron fest to forehead 16 84 ringers. The four fingera space tron the soles of the roat upto ankle (@alpha), 1 govazed by the opthao Phara tattva. The fortysix ingorge space from the fingers *4' to '48" in the chart, la soversa by the following prino iples Tala (wator), 2-Agai, V-Vayu, A-Akach, P.T. Panoataamatras, D.I. Dasa Indriyas (tan senses) indy Aha-Ahankara, Bu-Buddhi Tattve and Pre-Prakrti. Every one or the tattvas bas only two fingers space. The eightoen fingers' space from the fingers 48 to 18 de covered by the categories - Pa-Purusa, Ra.Rage, Asu V Aauddha Vidya, Ka-Kala, N1-Niyati and Kala. Eyaryone of then has thres fingerer spaoo. Tho space of sixta a fingers from 18 to 18' 18 covered by the M-Kaya-Su-- Suddha Vidya, I-Isvaratattva and Bada Sive. the remaining two prino iples Sakti and Siva pervade the wholo body as they are all-pervad ing. 

9-10, 11-18. Au in Seatr insat Tattva Wyasa, & in ilarly in Panoa Khandadhvanyaga and Trikhanda Tattya Nyayasa, the body of Sudhaka should be supposed to be at 84 ringers, because all those methodo ars inoluded in Apara bidhi' which 1s symbol of dualica. 

Panoa Tattva Nyasa moans that live Tattvas, 1.0., Panoa-Mahabhuta (rive xoss elements which ran the body or. the Sadhaka). 

Panoa Khandadhvanyase desoribes the pervasion of the five pure tattvas 1.0. Maya-Suddha Vidya, Isvara, Sadasiva and Salt 1. Out of these rivo puro principles, only four tattvas from Maya to Sadesiva porvad. eightyfour ringers' measure of the body. Tho Sakti principle in this case is said to be all pervading. 

similarly trikhandatattva Viani mentions only 

235, 

three tattvas v1z. 'Atma Tattva. Vidya Tattva and Siva Tattva. It is the chief obaracteristio of the trika philosophy that it orr and on, hints at the triple thought which is the fundamental charaoter of Kashmir Saiviou. According to the Tantrika philosophy, it is an approach to the supraphysioal Reality-through the physioal universe, a Journey from gross materialism to tho subtle principle" : and a graap of subjectivism, through objectivisa Trikha ndatattva consisting of the three Tattves 1.8'Atma Vidya and Siva Tattva is a symbol of the thres pr ino iples - Nara" Sakti and 'Siva' of the trika science, respectively.

Likewise Bhuvanadhvanyasabidhi degoribes 118 worlds which are supposed to be in the bod 11y mansion of the Sadhaka. In this case also various corporal organs which have collectively been moasured as oightyfour fingers, are regarded as possessing suoh and such worlds. 

The oharts of the above mentioned Nyabae are given below with their full desor iption: 

. In the Pancakhandadhvanyaba, the frayure Maya Tattva ocoupies four fingers space, from feet to ankle. Suddha Vidya Tattva hag fortysix fingore space whion begins from 4' to '48.

Para Viani is a purely non-dual and os supraphysical axivo 

to the transcendent. The uteguro of the body accord lag to this method, is one hundred and olgut. Tho Baahaka has to consider all the thirtywiz prizo iples in this measure or the body. The mention of the Triplo method 18 a proof that the Trika thought is a blend of threo, philosophies and lays equal stress on 'eli or them. 

Sat Trinsat Tattvanyaga, according to Perapara Vidhi, is given, in a chart, below:

1. Gross (sthula). 2. Sukena (Subtle) 3. Para (Beyond the subtlo). 

These three terns can be expressed as universe individual and infinito respectively. 

Votaries or Trika philosophy desoribe the trinity as 'Nara, Sakti and Siva which aro symbolised as 98thula, Sukama and Para". 

Sixfold path lo firstly olassified into two kinds 

243. 

viz. 'Vacukadhvan. Again everyone or thou haa vacakadhvan and vacyadhyan. The first contains Varna, maxtra and pada. The second consists or Kala tattva and bhuvana. 

The following verso or T.A., in connectionx with this threorold division, 19 remarkablo:

SEVENTH ADHIKARA. 

1. special movements or postures of tho body are called Nudras. Keeping these movements in view, they are classified into four divisions 1.e. the postures dono by the body, hands, Bpoooh and wind. Various lsudrad montioned in the Tantra Sastras and Ma. V13. ought to be done by these a bova oited limba T.A.33 1.9. 

Their importanoo as a part or initiation is very high because they train an aspirant to keep his body 11t and under propor alaoiplino for tho spiritual Realisation. In this respoot they destroy the Potters or tho univorse (Panas). 1.1 berato Sadhakas from all bondages and lead ther to the supreme goal. The otymological meaning of the Mudras nentioned by Abhinava Gupta in T.A. lo alco siunilar (T.A. 38 A.49).

Viratly thoy quo not highly required for the spiritual Badhakes. They are primary for only those who have kept fruito in viow. In this roapeot, thoir primery posit10n can not be denied. T.A. $2 A. According to T.A. they have only a secondary position. Conolud ing reaark on the position of the Mudrey in the 67th verse of T.A. SR, proves the very important as they help spiritual Realisation and brings to the spiritual aoskars into coramunion with the Supra@ Baing. They help Sadhakas to remove so many doubts and obatruota ions whiloh stand in the way of their destination. The special ut 111ty of the Mudras, which is strecked ty Abhinava Gupta is a mastery over the circle of the Mantra. T.A, 58 A. 67. 

As a matter of fact, Ma. vll the Mutsae tho energies of siva (siva-sakti). From this point of view performanoe of Mudras is very important. In this respost, they also help to tranefer a Badkaka from the layio local to Sakta State from which the supremo state le casily attained

LICHTE ADHIKARA. 

The Chapter contains all tho particuları or a Sadha aiksa with whion the dootrine or prata or wahaprota is olosely associated. The conooption pf this doctrino can be explained in two ways. Firstly, the Saiva Sohool or Thought resoen ises everything as real because 16 18 tho dovelopment or 010 Sakti, understood as an eagontial nature of the Suprono Reality. Take any object of the 

universe and it is accord lng to the system, an evolution of Sakti. Ir 1t is devoid or Sakti, the School will certainly regard it as a corpse (3ava). From the Salta point or view, everything is Sakti. Ir it is without, it, it is as good as a dead body is . 

The second implication or tho doctrina is that a seeker of truth, in his gradual 230ent, should trans oend overy thing and roach tho Supzone Reality. According to this process, as the system mentions, after the Suddha Vidye, the realm of the siva State bogins, ordinarily. this state is divided into thrse divisions, Isvara, sada Siva and Siva. A spiritual Sadhete, for the attainment or tho Siva State, which is regarded as a pormanent seat or cit Sakti, should transcend the Ievará and the Sadasiva. In view of tho 9 lva state, both, Isvara and Sadan iva atatou are said to be dead or prata and nahaprota zospa ivoly, as they have no olt Sakti 12 them. The point vosth noting is that the syetem doon not believe in these two atatoe as the Supreme State. Both of them, from the Satta yoint or view, have been rogarded as a coryse because they are devoid or Sakti. The votaries or Bakti do not hesitate to regard von Siva ea doad 11 36 19 dovoia of Sakt.

VIII - Appendix. 

1. Origin of Tantras - Tantras are mainly derived from the Aramas which have been understood, 11ka the Vedas, revelations. They are orally handed down from teachers to pupils. The traditional account of their origin, aocording to the Saiva School of Kashmir, is that all the Sastras, in their unmanifested state rema in latent in the All-transcending Para Vak or Supreme Logos, which, in fact, is a supreme will of Siva. It iu tho suprome state of oneness wheroin no differentiation: or any kind is experienced. As soon as the manifestation or universe begins, the undifferentiated state of the Para Vek is a isturbed. As result of this the second state 'or the supreme atato or pasyanti in whiob for the first time, seeds of differentiation appear. The third stato of the Para Sakti is inadhyama wh loh refers to the inner develop nent of differentiation, All our sastras remain stored in this state. Through sone mediu, they appear in the Vaikhari Vak. In the madhyama state, only atma (wolf). of man can know them. The state is out of the human approach. All Sastras partioularly Saiva Sastras as the tradition mentions, owe their origin to the Madhyama stato which flows out as Vaikhari Vak in tivo streams (panon: grotas), regarded as rive faces of Siva. The rivo facen, 

viz. Isana, Tatpurusa, Sadyo jata, Aghora and Vama, ropre pont rive aspects, ait, Ananda, Iooha, Juana and Iriya, 

which are deeply 8800 iatad with the rive functions, viz., emanation (8rst1), maintenance (sthiti), destruction (Samhara), sono salment (vilaya) and dispensation of grao 

(anugraha), or Siva. AB T.A. mentione, all the Sastres that stream forth from the five races are sixty four and Tapresent various aspects of philosophy. As soon as the Kali are approaches Saiva Sastras begin gradually to dis 

uppear with the gradual disappearance of the sages taught them. Due to the disappearance of the Sastras 

the whole world is engrossed in spiritual darkness. Siva, on seeing these natural consequences of the dis appearance of Sastras, takes pity on men and appears on Kailasa mountain in the form of Srikantha. Ho commanded the sage Durvagas to propagate the knowledge of the Salva Sestras in the world again. The sage, thus commanded, created, by the power or his mind, three sons, Tryambaka, Amardaka and șrinatha. He oharged them with the mission of establishing spiritual order and or teaohing man again the ancient Saiva faith and the Trika dootring in its : three aspects of unity (Abheda), diversity (Bhedat and University-in-diversity (Bhedabhoda). It 16 Txy au baka who was first taught to spread a bheda (unity) dootrine among then. The second dootrina of bheda (diversity) was entrusted to the second son, Amardake. The third son Srinatha was appointed for the propagation of the tenets of Bhad a bheda (unity-in-diversity). 

The orthodox account mont loned above is based on 'Kashmir Shalvimm.. by 1.0.Chatterjee, who has followed Abhinava Gupta, the author of Tantraloka. As a matter or faot, Jayaratha, the commentator of Tantraloka, com anting on the following verse, has elaborately wluoidated the origin of the saiya Tantras from the riro races of the 

Lord: 

Dasastadasavasvasta bhinna Yaoohasanam Filhoh. tatsaram Trikadastram hi Tatsaran Malipimaton 

T.A.I.A. 76.18. 

.. Tantrika conooption of Sadhana - The aim of human striving, according to tantrag and Vedas, 1s the attainment of the Suprema State where all diversitesi come to an end. But their approach to this destination, is dirferont. The obvious reason of this difference is their conception. The conception or Tantras is totally dirrerent from that of the Vedas, The Vedio culture believes in the Mantra-3 adhana as a means to self-roali: gation. In this respect, the attitude or the Tantrika cult is different. It has gone a pace forward. The analyy is or letters is a pooullarity of the Tantrika culture and it lays strags on them as devices for the achievement of self-knowledge. 

.: Tantrika approach to the Supreme Reality is absolutely dirferent from that of the Vedas and the Vedanta. It is chiefly based on the conception of the Supreme. Tantrikas believe in the immanenoe and the transcendence of the Roality. Their sadhana begins from the gross objets understood as symbolle forms of the Supreme Principle. A Sadhaka, first, has to identify himselr with the objeot he is meditating on. After ti Gending this gross object, he has to unify his self with the universal self. Accord ing to the Tantrika Sohool, the Supreme Reality is both, visvamaye (immanent) and visvottirna (transcendent). The advaita Vedantie con coption of the Supreme Selr is transcendent. To this system, the empirical reality has no meanings. In the Vadas, there is no set conception of tho 'supree. The tantrika oonception is based on - sivo bhutva Bivam yajet. 

1. 

Tantras bellevo in the sakti Prinoiple and there fore their Sadhana is secret as distinguished from the 

Vedio Sadhana wh 10h is quite open.The theory of motion (Karman) has great impor tance in the tantrika cult. After tho Identification or the limited self with the universal Boul, actions do not cease. The conception of the Supreme Self, according to Tantras, is balanced state of jnana and kriya. In the supreme state this kriya Sakti in the form of cit sakti 

remains xotivo. 

The congeption of the Supreme Reality, according to the Vedic and the poet Vedio thought, is conso iousness. After the attainment of the supreme state, all aotions cease because that stato represents the domination of 

supreme consciousness. 

Arter the self-assimilation of the rinite with tho infinite, all upasanas (worshipe) on the part of the former come to an end accord ing to the school of Vedanta. But the case in the Tantrika system is different. Even after the self-assimilation or the individual with the supreme self, the upasanas (worships) on the part of the former continue, in the form of Suprema Sakti. 

3. Iraportance of Tantras - At the very outset, 

the study of Tantras reaiinds us of tho uno 1v1lis ed agos. or India. Critios do not hesitate to regard them as a olaas of literature, having 'little sense in much nonsense' All this is due to the Western languages in which they are translated and interpreted. A language in whioh the work is not originally written cannot convey the true sense of the work. Th18 'underestimate of the Tantrik philosophy has been continuing for a long time and the study of the Tantrag has been throw out of the literary oirala. It 18 on account of the fruitful orrorts of Sir Johan Wood roore and Atalvihary Chona who are loading figures of the "Agama Anu-Sandhana Samiti" that the Tantras have come to 

5. 

bo considered as an important part of literature. Now they are regarded as a storehouse of Indian-aoultism.. The oocult side of the Tantras is soientifio and resembles, hypnotiam and fascination, whion are considered NOW 'Thought". 

Tho Brahma anical literature of India dan bo divided into Srut 1 smrti, Purana and Agama. The Tantras are main] derived from Agama Sastra but some of them, in part ar. also based on the Puranas. They are useful in present state or flux prevailing in the Kali age. The Vedio ritual does not suit the present age. Man or to-day has no longer oupacity, longevity and moral strength to carry out the Ved 10 Karma Kanda. Thus the Tantra Sastra presents the Vedio truth, in a wodelled form suitable to the infirmities and the charaoteristics of this age. 

Like the Srutis, Tantras have two ends or human life to rulr11, viz., Abhyudaya (progress) and Nih Sreyas' (Liberation). Their mothods and ways vary accord ing to the human taatos, environments, needs and 1n011 nations. In fundamentals and methods, they airtor from the six schools of India but in essence, they resouble tham and raprosent their monistio philosophy. 

1. Some fundamental dootrines of tantras. 

(a) Hinduism is a combination of various olasses or men and accommodatea mon or different temperaments in its fold. On this basia, five olassos or Tantras, Salva, Sakti, Vaisnaya, Saura (related to the worship or Surya) and Canapatya (related to anapati) are formed in the Hindu gor iptures and they prasoribe different forms of practice. It is a singular distinotion of the Brahmapioal literature that it recognises the fact that all men sannot 

reach that ultimate goal by one method. On the ground that men vary in temperaments and various other ways, they aro classiried under thrsa hoads, viz., men of divine disposition (Divya Bhava) heroio disposition (vira Bhava (and animal disposition (Pasubhava). These forma (Bhuvas) are important factors in the process or Sadhana and on them the competency of an aspirant for any particular kind of practio. depends. All classes of Sadhakas, first of all, have to subdue six enemies - lust, anger, greed, pride 11lusion and envy. These three dispositions (Bhavas) mentioned in other Tantras corres pond to the three Upayas (errorts) 1.6. Sambhava Upaya, Saktopaya and Anava Upayas or T.A. and Ma. II. 

In connection with the dootrine of 'Bhaya(Natura and disposition) referred to above, we should not forget the view of Sarvananda, a celebrated writer of sarrollasa tantra published by Sri Raja Mohan Chalcravarti. The special forte or the author in his Tantra, 1s laid on threefold Bhava and the corresponding Acara. No doubt, the dootrine or Bhava is one of the knotty problem of the 

The author has la 10 nuob' emphasis on the oxplanation or the term 'Bhava' in the 7th Ullas and mentioned it as one supremo existence which multiplios 

itself in various forms (of. Eka sva nahan bhavo nanatyam bhajat ipriye, 8.U.T. 6th u). As a matter of fact the supreme congoiousness appears in the three torns, 1.0., Pagu bhava, Vira bhara and Divya bhaya, which, in a simple language, are the three states of the payahia: principle in the universo. Accord ing to Sarvananda, the ritual, prescribed for the lowest state (animal) is or... also three kinds 1.6. Pagu-acara, Vaisnavacara and Saivacara. Similarly, the author of this Tantra has also mentioned the suba ivisions of thre. chieftates 

1n his work. The remarkable point is that the hero lo state or vira bhava is refleoted in the three sucoegaive cults called daksinasara, vamaoara and sidhantacara. In both olasses of devotees, that is daksiuacara and vamacara, dualism reigns supreme. The third olags is absolutely 

identical with Siva himself and points out monisi. 

. The dootrine or bhava mentioned in the 8th Ullas is speo ially related to the three olasses of men, Pasu Vira and Divya, who are to be admitted into tho spiritual realisation according to the Tantrika Sadhana.. The lowest olass of men whom Tantras doolare to be Pagu' has been advised to regpeot all female olars as mother. Though this lowest olass in form, is man but in nature it is Pasu (animal). Sometimes it 18 also regarded as a child. because it, like a ohild, does not understand its naturo whloh, au a matter of fact, is not different from the nature of supreme reality. For this sort of a Sądhaka, Tantras preach Vatrka Upasana (nother worship). He should regard all prakrti, specially all women as mother. Only those peraons who have infused the idea of motherhood into : all classes of women, are admitted as spiritual aspirants asoord ing to the Tantrika way of realisation. We must remember that almost all Tantras lay much emphasis on this point and respect women as a mother. Sha, in any case is never thought as a thing of animal gratification. 'sho is a mother and she should be regarded as mother till the Sadhaka passes from the lowest stage or Pasubhava from which the Tantrika Sadhana bagian. Thus those persons, who desire to rise spiritually, should obey the regulations or the Tantrika philosophy and work accordingly. In ahort, in the Pasubhava a Sadhaka, who is beginnar, should cultivate the idea of motherhood or Prakrti, Maya and Sakti in his mind. He is just like a child in the hand 

of a mother. 

Sad hakas or heroio state are superior to those of animal state. They are no more children in the hands of a mother. They have subdued the Prakrti, Maya and Sakti and have got a full control over all sorts or nature. They can lead ft to whatever side thay desire. 

The nature becomas submissive to this class or 3adhakas. The feature of this olass and the class vention ed above is that both precoh the idea of airference and hence they are regarded as dualistio'. 

The third olass, 1.6., Divya bhava, is that when the nature is fully identified with the Sadhaka, The 100g as Prakarti, Maya and Sakti totally disappears. It is a supreme State and is hardly distinguished from the "Kaula Avastha' mentioned in Tantraloka. The gradual attainment or this state is the aim of Tantram and they lay nuoh stresa on this point but sometimes this gradual asoont. is not compulsory. An aspirant or Pasu bhava class can obtain the position of a ivya bhava by the high quantity of Sakti pata. Thus a gradual as well as a sudden rise. depends on the quantity of Sakt 1-Pata, which, accord ing to Salva school, intervenøs in the acts of spiritualisation. Besides one central point, which has been laid straga upon by all Advaita Indian philosophies, 18 self-roall nation. The way of sell realisation mentioned by sarvolla -9atantra is fuller than that of the Sankara Vedanta. The knowledge of the sair oannot be complete unless the com prehensive knowledge of the nature (Prakrti) 15 fully obtained (or. Ajnstva Prakrtim devin Brahma-Jaane Karoti Yah Vrtha Jaanam Bhavatta ya Klivasyalinganan Yatha 3,0.1.0.62). We have no ground to doubt the words of Sarvananda, because the crent Sankaradarya benato awarce. 

or the fut 111ty or his Brahma jnana and turned a worshipper or Sakti which appears in the three forms, viz., Sukuma, Jyoti and 8thula or Para, Parapara and Apara, aduota ing to Sarvollagatantra and Tantraloka or Abhinava Gupta respectively. This representation of Sakti in the three forms reminds us of women in various colours to whom the Tantrika 'Sadhakas pay great respeot as mothers. The obvious reason of this esteen paid to Sakti sono option is that the Tantrika philosophy has been found ed on it. The importano a of this principle by which the Tantrika Philosophers can solve the knotty problem of the world creation, cannot be denied. There 18 a perfect barmony in the three forms of Sakti which the Tantrika saints of dirrerent temperaments praotise. 

The discovery of a secret universe in our own body is remarkable in the philosophy of Tantray and vo must regard it as a great achievement of the Tantrika seot of India. The elaborate mention or the physioal Yoga in the Tantra-Sastras represents, as a matter of fact, the inner ritual and has been followed by all the religious sects of to-day in India. Varying ways or initiation teach the Tantrika Sadhaka the spirit of solt-surrender and enable them to realis. the union of siva and Bakti. It is the Tantrika sago who comes to know whatovar is, within him also exists without him. The inner and the outor universes ar, not two separate things for the Tan trika Sadhakas. They are one. It is the external worla by whioh the Tantrika gaints oan comprehend the soorsts lying in the inner universe. It is the peouliarity of the Tantrika sadhana that it tries to meet the supreme Reality by the physioal means. The laner Kowledge cannot be complete unless it is obtained through the physioal means (or. Vyakte Jhapan Finn biedrs gupta Joana na Isyato: 

S.U.T.U. 58). 

(b) Likewisa olosely connected with thes. Bhavas (a isposition) thoro are seven Acaras (Rules of conduot): Veda, Vaisnava, Salya, Dakgina, Vama, sida hanta and Kaula. (Ku. 1. Cha. II). An aspirant should rise to the highest reality gradually through these soven stages of the conduct. In the first atago, ho ought to oultivate physical and mental olganlines.' This purifloation of body as well as of mind is essential to all sorts of religious and spiri tual olevation. Eo should learn the art of devotion, which is an essence of Vaisnayacara in the second stage. In the third stage, he must acquire the knowledge of the universal self and individual self whion 19 a chief symbol of Salvadare. In the fourth stage the three prooed 186 conducts acquired by the Sadhaka, should be strongthened. The fifth Acara 13 a stage of perfaat renunciation and it does not mean that Vama (woman) should be ut 111sed in the religious rite. The Sadhaka has nothing to do with a woman in his rite of 11beration, which is absolutely for bis owa purpose. The Vamaoara is the reverse or Dakaina and should not be misunderstood. It she is aasoo lated with an in his path or renunciation, she helps him there in h1, re ligious performance. In any casa, she is not meant for his animal gratification. A woman is an object of great veneration in all the Tantras. She is considered as a divine mother. The motherly aspect of God 1. tanderer than the ratherly one. Hono. in all the Tantras, God without His Sakti has no plac.. One of the Tantras lays great emphasis (str in an Padatalan Drstve Guruvat bhavayat sada, N1.1.) on the position of a woman. She 13 a great power through whioh the transcendental god manifesta Hingalr. 

The sixth stage is siddhanta in whion an aspirent 

conoludos artor a deliberate consideration and soras hi opinion about the 'mar its or the path or enjoyment (Bhukti. vada) and that of renunciation (Mukt ivada). Thus 'ho pur sues the latter path and reaches the final stage of Kaula whion means a plage without name and form aqoording to the commentator Jayaratha 'Fulam Padamanamakhyaa! T. A. lst. Vell. It should be borne in mind in this ganaoation that it is not a 'void' (Sunya) stage of the nibusstie school which negates all the universal manifestations. It us the stage of a perfeot quiegoence where all limitations dis appear and supreme, oongo lous noss dominates. 

SAM 

The above mentioned seven rulos ot qonduet s roughly correspond to the sot an philosophios Voda, Salya, Vama, Daksa, Kula, Mata and trika. Hvery suga od 188 oam of them is superior to the preceding one 'Vedat Safran tatovamam tatod aksam tatah kulan. Teto Matam, Tatasoapi, 

Sartotta Mam Param.' Comm. T.A. lat, A. T., 18.. The Trika thought in the best of all.

(c) The doctrine of six physical and 999 Centres or Oakras also forms a most essential part of Trika philosophy and has been understood as aoaneqtedt Kundalini-yoga, which, according to the Tantragastras, 15 a ohier means to realisa Suprame Reality. All thoso Cabral are normally connected with the human notivities wnioh stand in the way of the Supreme Realisation. 3 Tory Cabra resting in the human nierosos represents than IYORIGA of Kalas, Bhuvanas and various lotters of the marker Maya state, called 'Mental oondoptator T apas rive lower Contros from Muladhara to Tiguda ha darr (Muladhara 8vadhistana, Manipura, anuhata and Tisu Cakra) in ascending order are related to the physiaal principles, vis., earth, waters 

12. 

The Sadhaka or this path should begin his Sadhana from the lowest and the grosgost aantre called muladhara and try to awaken tho Kundalini Sakti or oneey chiørly called Male Maya or Suddha Vidya in Tantras, waloh rena Ins 11 every human body in the state or dornanoy or sleep. The sixth Centre called Ajna Cakra is specially related to mind or Manas whion has been also said to be a land or Vikalpas, where all those Cakras ar. tranzoended. It is possible for a Badhaka to attain a pure and tranaparent light of knowledge free from all mental construotions or Vikalpas. The Tantras 'say that montal concepts or Vikalpas are originated from the action of the a lfferent varnas (letters) or Matrkas existing in the centres mentioned a bove. Thos. Matrkas account for all sort of montal sono opts which stand in the way of the realisation of the pure light. Accord ing to the Tantrike philosophy, human body is the storo-house of puro alvino energy in the torn of cit Sakti or Vieuddha Sabda Sakti umderstood as " Kundalalini but as it is usually in dormant oona ition, it has to be roused in activity through a Yogic process. When it is awakened this power serving the mind and Prana or a Sadhaka begins to function in the sonoral form of purging of human body? In this process svory Cakra is alreatly arrested and is absolutely puririca. 

In conneotion with the theory of Calras, it has to be noted that a Cakra 19 e yn bolised as a closed area of an activity ocnsisting of the three aspeots called outer most, intermediary and imost. The outermost espect la usually diploted as Dalaor Petal in a Cakra. The intermediary aspect is reprosented by a radiation within the Dala and the Centre. The Imost aspeot 19 symbol god by the Centre and the Vindu itself. The entiro Calra is a store-house or Vikalpas whioh generate forth Vikalpas 

15. 

every moment. When the awakened Kundalini enters into the region of Matrkas oulled Varnay, they are all desolved and lose their identity in Mada from whioh thoy emanate. As a result of this process, Wada is also desolved Into Vindu or Para Nada ana this Vindu nargos into Unity. By this graded process we shall have the nanifestation of puro knowledge which reveals itself and is never dominated by: any outer influenoo. Thus the transcending of the six Cakras is a main souroe for tho attainment of divino know 

ledro or Divya Jnana which cannot be possible in the system 

or Samkya and Vedanta, because both of them do not accept the prino ipl. or centres or Walras. In the two system, the ideal and the method or attaining it'aro styled dirferently.. 

(a) The votaries or Tantras call suprone-Being as Hansa whion is the revarsa or 'Sohan (I am that God Aspiration and inspiration of breathing system are vila tions of the 'Hansa' whioh is seatsd in our mioroaoem.; Our individual self is automatically uttering the sacredotal formula "Hansa' daily without efforts. (cf. Hakarona, Vabiryati Sakarena Viset Punah Hanseti Paramara Mantran Jivojapati Sarvada, N1.T. Cha. IV.). . 

8. Two methods for self-realisation, Noti Noti method and method of sublimation - Phenomenal appearances of the universe are not a irrerent from Siva ox Brahman mo the Vedantio school calls it, which is under a vol rar. the sake of its illusion, pley or Vaya. Similarly due dividual selves are Siva. They have lost and forgotten their idontity with Siva owing to ignorance which limits the reallsation of this identity. The lost laentity with Biva can be rearfirmed by the two meth or Maya Veda of Vedanta and the method or pubi ination,mentioned in Tantras. The first method moane elimination or negation. It negates the visible world as wreal or Asat. Thus by reduotion of the busk or sheath (Upadhi) into Zero, one can reaffirm the close, contact of the Atman or un Ivarse with the Braban or Siva. This method, accord. ing to which physical appearances are reduced to zoro oan not be ad'o opted by the exponents of the Tantraa, who hold that all phenomana are glimpses or the suprahumaa Raality. They do not deny the multiform universo and therefore, they welcome the method of sublimation according to whion all : the visible objects of the world are said to bo dovieda through which one can approach the Invisible Tho mention or the various Dharanas (ental concentrationa) or tho a iver -gent tattvas described in the 18th to the 15th Adhikara of Ma 18 proof of the fact that the Tantrik 'nature of the book includes the method of sublimation, well-known in the Tantrik literature of India. 

ES 

If we minutely sramine this method of oublination, oited above, it will be found fully based on the two pola rities 1.e. subject and object correspond ing to two epithots - Anam' and 'Idan'. Aham refors to thọ subject whioh se all pervading, und ifferentiated, unmeasured and Infinite. * Idam' (this) points out the objects of the universe, which are not different from the subject whioh 18 under deter minants (Pasas, fettes) and which has forgotten Its duo existence. To approach the subjeot, aspirent should pay his attention to the objeot, 1.9., ignoranog and rettesby which the unlimited (@ubject la delimited), 10 ts the onier characteristics of the Tantrik philosophy that 012 Sadhanas shoula be started from 1. imited objece, ignorance and 111us ions, which, in reality, are seir manifestations or the transcendent aubjact and through whloh 14, gan east 2 be approached. It is said "By that one must pigo by 

15. 

which one falls'. The very poison that k111. bedonos the elixir of life when used by the wisa (0.11.I. Yo.II). Thus the lost 10 entity or individual vol with tho un lvorval selt must be regained by the same factor which has lost it. Various methods, (v 18h1.) such as Panca dasa Vidhi, Panoa vidhi and Triviani mentioned in the second adhikara or the text, are proors of the method of sublimation. It is to be able to ago and from grossness by stages to aubt 111zed sub foot. As a matter of faot purity is hidden in impurity and that must be found in it. Thus it is an approaoh Trosa. diversity to unity, from Bheda to Abheda, fron many to one and from heterogeniety to homogeniety. 

\# By dootrine or sublimation, which I hava 111us trated by the two @pithets 10 am and paham and specially connected with the seven nothods mentioned above as panca daga vidhi ato. 18 meant twofold rise, that is, rige by 

1 rise which depend on the quantity of Sakti -pata. A Sadhaka of the lowest stage (Sakala) 12 tho quan tity of Sakti-Pata 1$ slow, will gradually rlao to Mantra stage passing through the stages of Pralaya Kala and Vijnana kala, corresponding to Suddha vidya from whion he will be gublimated to the position of the supreme prino Iple (siva) and will be one with It. It is the gradual riso. 

The mothod of sudden ris@ 13 differente Any Sadhaka of any low class Sakala, Pralayakala or Vijaana Kala will be roused to the State of Mantra (Suidha vidya)? by the high quantity of Sakti Pata and then from that.. Stato, he would be sublimated to the status or the pupD SÉRO Reality.
