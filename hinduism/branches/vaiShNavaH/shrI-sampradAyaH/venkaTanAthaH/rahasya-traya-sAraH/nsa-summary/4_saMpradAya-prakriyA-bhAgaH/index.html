<p>CHAPTER - XXX</p>
<p>Acharya Kritya Adhikara After expounding the meanings of the three eminent rahasyas in the section &lsquo;Pada-Vakya-Yojana&rsquo;, Desika describes the process of handing over this eminent knowledge from teacher to pupil in the traditional way. First of all, the role of an Acharya, in preserving and transmitting this supreme wisdom to worthy disciples, is described. The characteristics of the Acharya, are also referred to, here. In the duties of the Acharya, the main factor happens to be the propagation and preservation of the &lsquo;satsampradaya&rsquo; or well-established tradition.</p>
<p>The introductory verse points out the main functions of the Acharya, or spiritual preceptor:</p>
<p>&lsquo;अधिजिगमिषुराद्यम् धाम दिव्यं त्रिधाम्नः श्रुतविविधपरीक्षाशोधिते क्वापि पात्रे । अनघगुणदशायां आहितस्नेहमायः प्रदिशति निरपायं संप्रदायप्रदीपम्&rsquo;।</p>
<p>Desirous of attaining the primeval Supreme Abode of the Lord, the Acharya hands over the eternal lamp of tradition to a worthy disciple, who is tested by different tests, and when he is predominantly satvik, showering his affection on him. In this verse, the Acharya is enjoined to hand over the supreme knowledge of the atman to the deserving disciple before casting away his body. It is verily said – &lsquo;पात्रस्थमात्मज्ञानं कृत्वा पिण्डं समुत्सृजेत् &lsquo;।</p>
<p>The disciple should be tested and only after that, instruction is to be given, if he deserves that knowledge:</p>
<p>संवत्सरं तदर्थं वा मासत्रयमथापि वा । परीक्ष्य विविधोपायैः कृपया निःस्पृहो वदेत् ।।</p>
<p>&ldquo;By testing the disciple for an year or half of it or three months in different ways, the teacher should impart instruction out of compassion, without desiring anything in retum.&rdquo; The teacher should make sure that the mind of the disciple is pure and firmly devoted to that knowledge. This instruction should not be given for the mere asking of it, without due consideration of the merits and demerits of the people. This instruction is to be given while one is in a satvik state. It is enjoined that the preceptor should give an instruction out of mere compassion and affection. This &lsquo;smapradaya&rsquo; has been handed over from preceptor to disciple without any break in the middle, beginning with the Supreme Paramatman. This lamp of knowledge of the form of tattva, hita and purushartha, which dispels the darkness of ignorance, should be placed in the hands of a deserving disciple, for being preserved and propagated amongst his worthy disciples,</p>
<p>While explaining the duties of an Acharya, Desika points out that a preceptor, who has gained this knowledge from the line of his Acharyas, and which knowledge is not known to others, should guard it from unworthy persons and should hand it over to the deserving disciples. Lord Krishna exhorts in the Gita that the &lsquo;Gita Shastra&rsquo; should not be taught to a person, who has not a virtuous conduct,</p>
<p>Acharya Kritya Adhikara</p>
<p>377</p>
<p>to one who has no devotion towards the teacher as well as the Supreme Paramatman, to one who is not eager to listen to those truths and never to one who sees faults only in the virtues of the Lord and his devotees. Desika quotes this and applies this inter-alia in the case of instruction of these profound truths of the three rahasyas. He who imparts this secret teachings to the devotees of the Lord, will gain supremc devotion towards the Lord, and attain Him alone undoubtedly. It is pointed out in the Mahabharata, in the context of a dialogue between Vashista and Karala that the supreme knowledge of tattva, hita and purusharta should not be taught to the following persons:</p>
<p>&lsquo;नावेदनिष्ठस्य जनस्य राजन् प्रदेयमेतत् परमं त्वया भवेत् । विवित्समानस्य विबोधकारकं प्रबोधहेतोः प्रणतस्य शासनम् ॥ न देयमेतच्च तथानृतात्मने शठाय क्लीबाय न जिम्हबुद्धये । न पण्डितज्ञाय परोपतापिने&quot; ||</p>
<p>&ldquo;This profound knowledge of the shastra, which is the cause of enlightenment, should not be taught to one who is not steadfast in the teachings of the Veda, to one who is untrue in his mind, to one who is a deceiver, to one who is a napumsaka, to one who is crooked-minded, to one who thinks of himself as a scholar, and to one who causes offences to others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is pointed out here that this supreme knowledge should be taught to a person, who has the following qualities:</p>
<p>&lsquo;श्रद्धान्वितायाथ गुणान्विताय परापवादाद्विरताय नित्यम् । विशुद्धयोगाय बुधाय चैव क्रियावतेऽथ क्षमिणे हिताय&rsquo; ।378</p>
<p>Esscnoc of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>विविक्तशीलाय विधिप्रियाय विवादभीताय बहुश्रुताय । विजानते चैवहितं क्षमादमाय नित्यात्मसमाय देहिनाम् ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;A person who is feeling an urge and urgency to listen to the secret truths; a person who has the qualities of &lsquo;shama&rsquo; and dama&rsquo;; a person who has pure devotion towards the Lord; a person who never indulges in speaking ill of others; a person who is quick in grasping the truths caught; a person who is capable of practising the ordained dutics; a person who wishes the good of all; a person who is fond of being far from the crowd, a person who likes to follow the code of conduct; a person who has widely listened to the teachings of the masters and on account of which who knows what is good, a person who is endowed with compassion and forbearance and who has the understanding that the eternal atman in all is of the same nature - is qualified for receiving instruction from the teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great Shandilya ordains that even at times of great crisis this unique knowledge should not be imparted to unworthy people. It is better, he says, even to die without teaching others than teaching the unworthy people.</p>
<p>Desika points out that there are great hazards during the present period of &lsquo;Kali-Yuga&rsquo; and one should be highly guarded from the temptation of instructing others into the secret teachings of these rahasyas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;गोपयन्नाचरेद्धम नापृष्टः किञ्चिदुच्चरेत् । पृष्टोऽपि न वदेदर्थं गुह्यं सिद्धान्तमेव च ॥</p>
<p>आश्रितायातिभक्ताय शास्त्रश्रद्धापराय च । न्यायेन पृच्छते सर्वं वक्तव्यं शौचयोगिने&rsquo; ।।</p>
<p>Acharya Kritya Adhikara</p>
<p>379</p>
<p>&lsquo;One should practise dharma without showing what he is practising; one should not teach anything by himself, unless he is asked; even when asked, the inner meanings should not be said at once.&rsquo; Then, to whom, should one impart this instruction?</p>
<p>To one who approaches the master as ordained in the shastras and who requests for an instruction and to one who is pure in his thoughts, words and action, to one who is having faith in the shastras and who has devotion towards the Lord and his teacher, this Supreme Truth should be taught.</p>
<p>It is ordained that a preceptor should not teach a disciple for gaining name or wealth or respect or for show or for gaining his livelihood. At any rate, if it is taught to one who is unworthy of it, the teacher himself will be falling from the right mode of life.</p>
<p>आत्मपूजार्थं अर्थार्थं डम्भार्थं अपि खिन्नधीः । अयोग्येषु वदन् शास्त्रं सन्मार्गात्प्रच्युतो भवेत् ॥</p>
<p>Desika quotes a number of authorities to establish the fact that a role of an Acharya is very arduous and that the responsibilities that he carries with him are of immense importance. He has to judge carefully the ability and worthiness of a disciple, and teach him the supreme mantras and truths. Only in that case, it will lead to the good of the world. He should not hold it away from the worthy disciple.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ऋजवे गुरुभक्ताय वैष्णवाय विशेषतः ।</p>
<p>सर्वप्राण्यनुकूलाय दातव्यो देशिकेन तु &lsquo;॥ &ldquo;A preceptor should impart this secret teaching to a disciple who is straight forward, who is devoted to his teacher, who is a devotee of Vishnu and who is agreeable in his behaviour to all living beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When it is taught, it should be taught in strict privacy to the disciple.</p>
<p>The preceptor considers the ability and aspiration of the disciples and gives them instruction elaborately or briefly, according to their needs. The gist of the teaching of the preceptors will be like this -</p>
<p>प्रत्येयस्तु विलक्षणः प्रकृतितस्त्राता पतिस्तत्परः तस्मिनात्मभरार्पणं हिततमं तच्छेषवृत्तिः फलम् । इत्थं तत्त्वहिते पुमर्थ इति नस्त्रेधा विभक्तं धनं दायत्वेन दयाधनाः स्वयमदुः दत्तात्मनां देशिकाः ॥</p>
<p>There is an eternal atman who is different and distinct from the body, sense organs, the mind the vital airs. The Supreme Paramatman is the inner-self of both the sentient and the non-sentient entities that are different and distinct from Him. That Supreme Paramatinan, is the redeemer of all humanity and no one else can be the protector of this atman other than Him. &ldquo;From beginningless time, I have been migrating from birth to birth in this world and I pray unto you to save me from the afflictions of re-birth and to protect me by taking me unto your feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Praying thus, one should surrender unto the Lord and cntrust Him with the burden of his protection and the protection of all that is taken as his. While surrendering thus, he has to mcditate upon the feet of the revered Acharyas, on</p>
<p>Acharya Kritya Adhikara</p>
<p>381</p>
<p>account of whose grace, he gained this wisdom and the way of his emancipation. After having surrendered, one should have the firm faith that the Lord would not let him down and as long as he is placed in this world, he must be engaged in agreeable service to the Lord, avoiding all kinds of offences.</p>
<p>Thus, the revered Acharyas will enlighten the disciples about the Supreme Truth and the way of spiritual realisation and duties that are to be performed after surrendering oneself unto the Lord. The same truths are expounded claborately by the masters to such disciples who are eager to study in great detail, with all their specifications,</p>
<p>Vedanta Desika has mentioned in conclusion of this chapter that all these truths were taught to him by his revcrcd preceptor, Kidambi Appullar, and that he has faithfully presented them in this treatises.</p>
<p>Shishyakrityadhikara</p>
<p>383</p>
<p>CHAPTER - XXXI</p>
<p>Shishyakrityadhikara</p>
<p>In this section, the duties and behaviour of a disciple are outlined. This is an important instruction that is to be practised by all disciples for achieving fruitful success in their enquiry after knowledge.</p>
<p>It is ordained that the disciple should be devoted to the teacher as he is devoted to God. He must be ever grateful to the preceptor for endowing him with the lamp of knowledge. Devotion towards the preceptor is the root cause of all good that happens to one. It is ordained that it should be firm. He must always recount the holy names and qualities of his preceptor with great regard. He must have great regard towards the possessions of the preceptor such as his residence or the deities or the holy texts and others. The disciple would serve that master in an eminent way if he hands over the knowledge gained from his preceptor to those of his disciples who are virtuous. He is enjoined to guard that wisdom from the unworthy. The disciple should be ever grateful to his master who has out of compassion endowed him with precious knowledge. The disciple will practise the dictates of the shastras as ordained by his preceptor. What wealth does he not gain, if he is endowed with this kind of behaviour? The wealth suggested here, is the attainment of the Supreme Paramatman, to whom he would be offering loving service for all time to come. This is pointed out in the introductory verse to this chapter: अशिथिलगुरुभक्तिः तत्प्रशंसादिशीलः । प्रचुरबहुमतिः तद्वस्तु वास्त्वदिकेषु । गुणवति विनियोक्तुं गोपयन्संप्रदायं कृतविदनघवृत्तिः किं न विन्देनिधानम् ॥</p>
<p>A disciple will be grateful to his preceptor, not in the sense of pratyupakara&rsquo; or doing some good in return but for not violating the dictates of the shastras that ordain that such people who are ungrateful are great sinners, severly punishable.</p>
<p>सर्वस्वं वा तदर्धं वा तदर्धादर्धमेव वा । गुरवे दक्षिणां दद्यात् यथाशक्त्यपि वा पुनः ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;He should offer every possession of his, or half of it, or half of that half as &lsquo;dakshina&rsquo; to the preceptor, or he should offer &lsquo;dakshina&rsquo; according to his ability. This statement only ordains a duty of the disciple as pointed out in &lsquo;तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया&rsquo; and it is not a favour done to the preceptor. The preceptor teaches without any desire for anything in return, out of compassion and he does not need any &lsquo;prayojana&rsquo;. So, it must be understood by the disciple that he is not doing a &lsquo;pratyupakara&rsquo; to the teacher by offering a &lsquo;dakshina&rsquo;. The great sages like Shandilya and Apastamba, have prescribed the duties of the disciple that a disciple should treat the Acharya, as an equal to God himself &lsquo;न प्रमाद्येत् गुरौ शिष्यो वामनःकायकर्मभिः&rsquo;। अविभज्यात्मनाचार्य वर्तेतास्मिन् यथाच्युते ॥ &lsquo;देवमिवाचार्यमुपासीत&rsquo; There cannot be any &lsquo;pratyupakara&rsquo; for a preceptor who teaches him the knowledge of Brahman -</p>
<p>Shishyakrityadhikara</p>
<p>385</p>
<p>&lsquo;ब्रह्मविद्याप्रदानस्य देवैरपि न शक्यते । प्रतिप्रदानमपि वा दद्यात् शक्तित आदरात्&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not possible even for the Gods to pay the &lsquo;dakshina&rsquo; to an Acharya, that befits the instruction of Brahma-Vidya. One should give according to one&rsquo;s ability the &lsquo;Guru-Dakshina&rsquo; with great regard.&rdquo; The disciple should never think that he is helping the preceptor in return to his invaluable instruction. The disciple is exhorted to make good use of the supreme knowledge that is taught to him by his teacher. It should cause in him dispassion; it should result in righteous conduct and it should be made use of for gaining perfect calmness of mind. The disciple is warned against making misuse of the knowledge he gained from the preceptors. He must guard the supreme knowledge from people who are only fault finders. He should ever be grateful to the teacher for the great benefaction he has done to him, and remember him day-in and day-out with great reverence.</p>
<p>When he hands over that knowledge to his tested disciples, he must pay obeisance to the line of his teachers and he must teach his disciples in a way that the greatness of the Acharyas and the truths are well pointed out. He must acknowledge with all humility his indebtedness to his great masters, when he gives instructions in the supreme secrets to his disciples. Though one has great scholarship and ability to understand the profound truths from the texts, it is absolutely necessary for one to gain knowledge through the Acharyas and only then, it will have the efficasy, as it comes from tradition.</p>
<p>When one enlightens his disciples, if one does not proclaim one&rsquo;s own preceptor&rsquo;s greatness and compassion, the truths that one imparts will be without any basis and one will be committing an offence of not proclaiming one&rsquo;s teachers while instructing one&rsquo;s students:- It is mentioned as one of the thirty two offences.</p>
<p>&lsquo;स्वगुरूणां स्वशिष्येभ्यः ख्यापनं चाकृतं तथा&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>Similarly, if one teaches something opposed to the instructions given by his teachers, he will be a deceiver and he will be going against the shastras. In the same way, if he fails to instruct a deserving disciple at the appropriate time, he will be committing the fault of transgressing the Divine Command. It is declared in the following verse, as follows:</p>
<p>&lsquo;पात्रस्थं आत्मज्ञानं कृत्वा पिण्डं समुत्सृजेत् । नान्तर्धाय स्वयं याति जगद्विजमबीजकृत् ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Before the fall of his body, a person should hand over the knowledge he possesses the shastra) to a virtuous and worthy disciple. The Acharya should so behave that, without enlightening - through instruction - the Veda Shastras</p>
<p>MEIT), he should not give up his body. Such a person will be called &lsquo;lubdha&rsquo; (gay). Even when he gains some knowledge through his insight, by the grace of the Lord, he must realise that he has gained that knowledge by the grace of his Acharyas.</p>
<p>An Acharya will have attained his object of life by gaining such a worthy disciple, and the disciple will be gratified hereafter by gaining such a preceptor, who instructs one the direct means of liberation -</p>
<p>&lsquo;साक्षान्मुक्तेरुपायान्यः विद्याभेदानुपादिशत् । कथ्यते मोक्षशास्त्रेषु स तु श्रेष्ठतमो गुरुः ।</p>
<p>Shishyakrityadhikara</p>
<p>387</p>
<p>आचार्यवत्तया मोक्षमामनन्ति स्मरन्ति च । इहामुत्र च तत्पादौ शरणं देशिका विदुः ॥</p>
<p>In the moksha-shastras, it is ordained that he, who teaches the different modes of &lsquo;upasanas&rsquo; that are direct means to moksha, is the most celebrated of all teachers.</p>
<p>The shrutis and smrithis expound that moksha is possible only through an Acharya. The ancient masters like Alavandar and others, have declared that the Holy Feet of the Acharyas are the object of attainment here, that is prior to moksha, and elsewhere, that is in the state of attainment of moksha. The sacred feet of the Acharya alone are our refuge, as evidenced in the prayer of Alavandar as -</p>
<p>&lsquo;नाथाय नाथमुनयेत परत्र चापि नित्यं यदीयचरणौ शरणं मदीयं ॥</p>
<p>In the concluding verse of this chapter, Desika expounds that the disciple or the &lsquo;shishya&rsquo; will not consider any higher deity than the Acharya. This shows the supreme devotion which a shishya or disciple should have towards the preceptor -</p>
<p>&lsquo;अध्यासीनतुरंगवत्रविलसज्जिह्वाग्रसिंहासनात्</p>
<p>आचार्यादिह देवतां समधिकामन्यां न मन्यामहे । यस्यासौ भजते कदाचिदजहद्भूमा स्वयं भूमिका मग्नानां भविनां भवार्णवसमुत्ताराय नारायणः&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>We never consider any other deity as greater than our Acharya, on the tip of the tongue of whom - which is verily the throne - where the Supreme Lord &lsquo;Hayagreeval is adoming. The role of the Acharya is so great that sometimes, the Supreme Paramatman - Narayana - who is the God of all gods - himself assumes the form of an Acharya for lifting up the transmigracing souls, who are drowning in the ocean of &lsquo;samsara&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Thus, in this chapter, the dutics of a &lsquo;shishya&rsquo; are expounded by the celebrated author.Nigamanadhikara</p>
<p>389</p>
<p>CHAPTER - XXXII</p>
<p>Nigamanadhikara</p>
<p>In this section, there is a recapitulation of all the truths taught earlier in the thirtyone chapters. Before summarising the truths of the thirtyone chapters, the mcanings expounded in the four-parts are mentioned in the opening verse</p>
<p>&lsquo;करबदरितविश्वः कश्चिदाचार्यदृष्ट्या मुषितनिखिलमोहः मूलमन्त्रादिभोगः । सगुणविषयसिद्धौ संप्रदायं प्रयच्छन् सुचरितसिलहारी सूरिबृन्दाभिवन्द्यः&rsquo; ॥</p>
<p>A fortunate person, who has to his credit, the performance of some &lsquo;vyaja&rsquo;, will become the object of the kind glances of the Acharya and will realise very clearly all the truths such as the doctrine of the sentient, non-sentient and Ishvara, the means of spiritual realisation and the doctrine of the Highest Object of attainment, like a &lsquo;badari&rsquo; fruit in the palm, getting rid of all kinds of delusions and he will reflect with delight, upon the meanings of the three great mantras viz., Mulamantra, Dvaya and Charamasloka, and will initiate these truths to a worthy and virtuous disciple and leading a pious life will attain the assembly of the &lsquo;Nitya-suris&rsquo; in the end, going through &lsquo;Archiradi&rsquo;. By the term &lsquo;Flaskala:&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Arthanushasana&rsquo; portion is signified. Elaffem4a: points out &lsquo;Sthirikarana-bagha&rsquo;. The phrase acum.&rsquo; signifies the &lsquo;Padavakya-yojana bhaga&rsquo;. Aufsitat indicates the &lsquo;Shishya-krityadhikara&rsquo;. HASR 1049597 signifies the &lsquo;Acharyakrityadhikara&rsquo; which is a part of &lsquo;Sampradaya-Prakriya-Bhaga&rsquo;.</p>
<p>After suggesting the meanings of the four parts of this work thus, Desika summarises the meanings of the several chapters in the same order and integrates the meanings of those chapters into a connected and whole statement - a Mahavakya.</p>
<p>The jivatman, who is qualified to enjoy the bliss of communion with Paramatman along with the Nitya-Suris&rsquo;, by his essential nature, being deprived of it from beginningless time, wakes up at sometime and gaining the grace of the &lsquo;Guru&rsquo; endeavours to gain the knowledge of the tattva, hita and purushartha (the meaning of Upodghatha Adhikara). He realises that the Rahasya-Traya are the &lsquo;sarathama&rsquo; among the &lsquo;pramanas&rsquo; that teach the ultimate truth of tattva, hita and purushartha (the meaning of Saara - Nishkarsha - Adhikara). He will realise that the relationship of body-soul, as the most important and unique truth that is to be known from these &lsquo;pramanas&rsquo; (the meaning of Pradhana-Prathitantra-Adhikara). He will know how the three &lsquo;Rahasyas&rsquo; expound the knowledge of the &lsquo;Artha Panchaka&rsquo; (the meaning of Artha-Panchaka-Adhikara), and will make an enquiry into the nature of the three &lsquo;tattvas&rsquo; that are included in the &lsquo;Artha-Panchaka&rsquo; (the meaning of Tattva-Traya-Adhikara), and decides that the one who is propounded as Ishvara is Sriman Narayana (the meaning of Paradevatha-Paramartha- Adhikara), and having known all these truths, he will become an aspirant after liberation (meaning of Mumukshutva Adhikara). He will gain knowledge about the different qualifications of the different</p>
<p>Nigamanadhikara</p>
<p>391</p>
<p>kinds of &lsquo;mokshopaya-adhikarins&rsquo; (meaning of Adhikari</p>
<p>Vibhaga-Adhikara) and he will study about the various &lsquo;upayas&rsquo; that are agrecable to different &lsquo;adhikarins&rsquo; (meaning of Upaya-Vibhaga-Adhikara) and will ascertain the necessary qualifications of a &lsquo;svatantra-prapatti-nishta&rsquo; (meaning of Prapatti-Yogya-Adhikara) and will equip himself with all the accessories ordained for Prapatti (meaning of Parikarana Vibhaga-Adhikara) and actually surrenders the burden of his protection along with his &lsquo;svarupa&rsquo; and &lsquo;phala&rsquo; thereof unto the Lord as ordained (meaning of Sangaprapadana Adhikara). Then, he becomes a &lsquo;kruta-krutya&rsquo; (meaning of krucakrutya-Adhikara). Having surrendered unto the Lord, he will introspect and by the marks in his behaviour, he will realise that he is steadfast in his true nature (meaning of Swanishtabhijnana-Adhikara). He will devote himself to the service of the Lord so long as he is placed in this world after his &lsquo;prapatti&rsquo;, (meaning of Uttarakrutya Adhikara) and he will realise that the utmost limit of service to the Lord, is service unto the devotees of the Lord (meaning of Purushartha-Kashta-Adhikara), and that he has to render all service only according to the dicates of the shastra (meaning of Shastritya-Niyamana-Adhikara). He has to be very careful in doing service unto the Lord, avoiding all offences, and if they happen, he has to repent and pray for forgiveness (meaning of Aparadha-Pariharana-Adhikara). Such a prapanna will reside in a Holy place, where Bhagavatas&rsquo; take resort (meaning of Sthana-Vishesha-Adhikara). Having lived the life destined here, he will depart from the body according to the will of the Lord (meaning of Niryana-Adhikara) and being led by the path of &lsquo;Archiradi&rsquo; (meaning of Gati Chintana Adhikara) he attains the Supreme Abode of Sriman Narayana and will be blessed with the bliss of Divinc SO1</p>
<p>Communion culminating in loving service to the Lord for all time to come meaning of Paripurna-Brahmanubhava Adhikara).</p>
<p>In the succeeding four sections, the doubts that may arise about the &lsquo;Siddhopaya&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Sadhyopaya&rsquo; and the &lsquo;prabhava&rsquo; or the eminence of the Prapanna have been cleared. The exposition of the meanings of the words and constructions of the three eminent &lsquo;Rahasyas&rsquo;, that are the sources of all the above truchs, is undertaken in the three further chapters.</p>
<p>The mode of propagating this &lsquo;sampradaya&rsquo; according to the shastras, has been outlined in the Acharya-Kritya Adhikara&rsquo;. In the &lsquo;Shishya-Kritya-Adhikara&rsquo;, the duties of a disciple are ordained.</p>
<p>Thus, in these thrityone chapters, all these significant truths have been taught.</p>
<p>Desika points out in conclusion that all these truths were taught by him in accordance with the shrutis, smrithis and the traditions supported by valid means of right knowledge giving no room for doubt or wrong understanding. He says &lsquo;we have expounded these truths, just as we heard from our masters, and as we felt in our heart&rsquo;. These truths should be obtained from a rarfsadacharya&rsquo; rooted in this tradition, by one, by approaching him in the proper manner as a disciple. He should also follow the &lsquo;sadachara&rsquo; of the teachers of yore and tread on the path illumined by these three rahasyas.</p>
<p>This treatise bestows all good and averts all undesirables. One who imbibes this wisdom, and surrenders</p>
<p>Nigamanadhikara</p>
<p>393</p>
<p>unto the Lord, will get rid of migration in this world and attains the Supreme Paramatman, rcaching that abode through the &lsquo;Archiradi&rsquo; path, led by the &lsquo;athivahikas&rsquo;. He will be blessed with the direct vision of Sriman Narayana who is adorning the Paramapada Paryanka. Here, Desika mentions the two glorious situations of the Lord adorning the golden throne in his &lsquo;avatara&rsquo; dasha. One relates to Sri Krishna and the other relates to Sri Rama.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna adorning the sovereign throne in &lsquo;Dwaraka&rsquo; shone resplendently -</p>
<p>ततो महति पर्यके मणिकांचनचित्रिते । ददर्श कृष्णमासीनं नीलं मेराविवांबुदम् ॥ जाज्वल्यमानं वपुषा दिव्याभरणभूषितम् । पीतकौशेयसंवीतं हेम्नीवोपचितं मणिम् । कौस्तुभेन घुरस्तेन मणिनाभिविराजितम् । उद्यतेवोदयं शौलम् सूर्येणाप्त किरीटिनम् ॥ नौपम्यं विद्यते तस्य त्रिषु लोकेषु किंचन ॥</p>
<p>Then he beheld Lord Krishna adorning the mighty golden throne decorated with gems; who was resplendent like a dark cloud resting upon the golden mountain Meru. He was shining with the brilliance of his beautiful form decorated with Divine omaments and yellow silken garment. He shone like a blue gem set in gold. He was shining with the decoration of the Kaustubha gem adorning his chest. The glorious crown he was wearing was shining brilliantly just like the Sun that has risen on the eastern mount. There is no comparison to him in all the three worlds.</p>
<p>394</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyacraya Saram</p>
<p>The second illustration relates to Sri Ramavatara, when Sumanthra approaches Him:</p>
<p>तं वैश्रवणसंकाशं उपविष्टं स्वलंकृतम् । ददर्श सूतः पर्यके सौवणेसौत्तरच्छदे ॥ वराहरुधिराभेण शुचिना च सुगन्धिना । अनुलिप्तं परयेन चन्दनेन परंतपम् । स्थितया पार्श्वतश्चापि वालव्यजनहस्तया । उपेतं सीतया भूयः चित्रया शशिनं यथा । तं तपन्तमिवादित्यं उपपन्नं स्वतेजसा । बवन्दे वरदं वन्दी विनयज्ञो विनीतवत् ॥</p>
<p>(अयोया - १६-८, ९, १०, ११) &ldquo;The charioteer, Sumantra beheld Sri Rama, who was like Kubera, resplendent with ornaments and who was adorning the golden throne which was covered with costly silk. He shone brilliantly with the precious sandal Paste smeared over his body. Sita was by his side holding a fan in her handi. Just as Chitra serving the moon. He was brilliant with his lustre just like the Sun, Sumantra who was modest bowed to Sri Rama, the granter of all boons&rdquo;?</p>
<p>These two glorious descriptions of the Lord in the incarnation, indicate the glorious situation of the Lord in &lsquo;paramapada&rsquo;. Those fortunate ones who have surrendered unto the Lord, or who have practised &lsquo;Bhaktiyoga&rsquo; reach the Supreme Abode of the Lord, being led by the guides on the way (athivaahikas) and they will attain all kinds of endearing service to the Lord at all times, in all places and in all states, getting their true nature manifested.</p>
<p>Nigamanadhikara</p>
<p>395</p>
<p>Thus, the Holy Feet of the Supreme Narayana alonc, the Lord of the Goddess &lsquo;Sri&rsquo;, arc to be propitiated and cherished both in the state of &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; and &lsquo;phala&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Desika praises the greatness of the sacred feet of the Lord in three verses in Tamil and concludes this Great Treatise as follows:</p>
<p>इति यतिराजमहानस परिमल परीवाह वासितां पिबत । विबुधपरिषन्निषेव्यां वेदान्तोदयन संप्रदायसुधाम् ॥</p>
<p>This treatise which has been described up to this stage, beginning with &lsquo;Guru-Paramparasara&rsquo; is the extension of the Supreme Grace of Bhagavad Ramanuja in respect of Sri Kidambi Acchayan, who was very dear to him. This nectar of the form of the essentials of the three rahasyas is to be enjoyed along with all people, who are yearning to get rid of the torments of &lsquo;samsara&rsquo;. This is the nectar of the tradition which was promulgated by the preceptor, Sri Pranathartihara, who was well known as &lsquo;Vedantodayana&rsquo;. The author invites all good natured people to enjoy the Supreme Truths of the Rahasya Traya.</p>
<p>If it is asked how this Great Work would fulfil its purpose, if some people - who are jealous - do not welcome and entertain it, Desika says that he is not in anyway worried about that.</p>
<p>कलकण्ठ गणास्वाद्ये कामस्यास्त्रे निजांकुरे। निंबवृत्तिभिरुतीर्णे न चूतः परितप्ते ॥</p>
<p>The mango sprout, which is a shaft of &lsquo;Manmatha&rsquo; and which is enjoyed by the cuckog, will not sorrow at any time, if it is spit by cows. Likewise, if unwise people do not show regard to this OC</p>
<p>work, the greatness of the work will not in anyway diminish. The merit of the work will not at any time be disturbed.</p>
<p>Desika points out here that he does not in anyway feel bad, if this eminent work is not received with regard, by some unwise people.</p>
<p>Offering his obeisance to his Great Master, Sri Ramanuja, Desika feels supreme satisfaction for having spent all his life in cnjoying the Great Works of Ramanuja with supreme love and devotion.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Desika declares that he would neither fecl joyful or sorrowful, if this work is well-received or otherwise. The renunciation of &lsquo;kartrurva&rsquo;, &lsquo;sambandha&rsquo; and &lsquo;phala&rsquo; is made in the concluding tamil verses. &ldquo;The Lord Hayagreeva, assuming the role of a preceptor of the form of Vadi Hamsambhuvaha blessed me with his supreme teaching and what supreme meanings he recorded on the sheet of my mind, I have put them in this form. This supreme work is the work of that Supreme Lord Himself. I am just like a writer, who writes what is dictated. What defect can be in this celebrated work! If people entertain this as something teaching the Supreme truths, or if people think that this is of little value and disregard it, my mind will neither rejoicc nor sorrow. I am in anyway not worried about that.&rdquo; Desika who was a &lsquo;sthitaprajna&rsquo;, has here expressed his equanimity of mind.</p>
<p>This supreme work was authored by the Supreme Hayagrceva Himself, and it is suggested that wise pcoplc should derive the benefit from it.</p>
<p>रहस्यत्रयसारोऽयं वेंकटेशविपश्चिता । शरण्यदंपतिविदां सम्मतः समगृह्यत ॥</p>
<p>Nigamanadhikara</p>
<p>397</p>
<p>&ldquo;This work - Srimad Rahasyatrayasara - is presented here by Lord Venkatesha Himself (by the all-knowing Venkatanatha), as it becomes agrecable to all those people who are the realisers of the Divine Couple, that are the resort of all those who have surrendered unto them&rdquo;.</p>
<p>कवितार्किकसिंहाय कल्याणगुणशालिने । श्रीमते वेंकटेशाय वेदान्तगुरवे नमः ॥ Nikshepa Raksha Nikshepa Raksha is one of the five Raksha granthas written by Desika. This treatise is written in defence of Prapatti. This is meant for cnlightening the followers of Ramanuja in the doctrine of Prapatti. This is not for generating faith in the followers of other schools regarding this doctrine. This doctrine of Prapatti is extolled as HRI यतीश्वर महानस संप्रदाय&rsquo; and Desika explains the significance of this doctrine according to the teachings of ancient masters like Sri Vishnuchitta, Sri Vatsya Varadacharya, Sri Atreya Ramanuja and others.</p>
<p>Desika states the prima facic view that &ldquo;Prapatti is not a distinct and different means of Moksha&rdquo; - at the very outset and raises nine objections against Prapatti as follows :</p>
<p>‘स्वरूपलक्ष्मानुष्ठान विध्यदृष्टेनिषेधतः ।। ऐक्यादशक्तेरख्यातेः सम्प्रदायविरोधतः ।।&rsquo;</p>
<p>The nine incompatibilities pointed out are : 1. The 31544fe or incompatibility regarding its essential nature of being different from Bhakti, 2. the अनुपपत्ति regarding लक्षण or definition 3. 348111894ft or the absence of its adoption for moksha, 4. the absence of any authority enjoining it, 5. the fact of negation of any means other than Bhakti for gaining Moksha, 6. the incompatibility of its non-difference from Bhakti as it is only an accessory to Bhakti, 7. the inability to perform Prapatti, 8. it is not prominently known from the Sastras and 9. it is contrary to tradition as it is not bequcathed by the line of teachers i.c. Guruparampara.</p>
<p>These Anupapatti&rsquo;s are described in detail one after the other in the former portion of this treatise that forms the Purvapaksha bhaga.Appendix</p>
<p>399</p>
<p>In the later part of this work these objections are refuted one after the other in the same order and the conclusion is established that Prapatti is a distinct and valid means for Mukti and that it is a sufficient substitute for Bhakti yoga or Upasana. It is a universal means that can be adopted by one and all for the attainment of their desired object inclusive of Moksha.</p>
<p>A brief summary of the objections and their refutations is given here under - 1. Svarupanupapatti</p>
<p>Objection : Prapatti is neither siddharupa nor Sadhyarupa. If it is Siddharupa it cannot be enjoined to be performed. If it is Sadhyarupa, it will not be of the form of Jnana, as it will be of the form of an action through speech or body. It will be just like stuti, an accessory to Bhakti yoga . &lsquo;ately 64Carl Fracaq 1-14 rathda&rsquo;etc. This results in the abandonment of the truth anda 1:&rsquo;</p>
<p>Answer : We admit that it is not &ldquo;Siddharupa&rdquo; and so the objection does not arise. It is sadhyarupa, but we do not admit that it is alfacila fah4164 I So there is no room for abandoning Jnana as the means of Moksha. Sharanagathi is admitted as मानसिका and it is शास्त्रजन्य ज्ञानादधिकविषया । It is of the form of fattugia and this objection does not arise.</p>
<p>Objection : Is prapatti having any accessories or not?</p>
<p>If you say it has, then it is opposed to your statement that it is a fully</p>
<p>Answer : The elaborate Karmas and others that are required for the three yogas such as Bhaktiyoga and others are not required for Prapatti - This is what is meant by निरपेक्षो। It does nor mean that Praparti is not having the unique and particular accessories that are established by Pramanas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;भक्तियोगादित्रयेतिकर्तव्यताभूत- गुरुतरकर्मनैरपेक्ष्यमात्रं हि अत्र विवक्षितं ।</p>
<p>Objection : Is Sarvadharma parityaga a vidhi ? or an anuvada ? It cannot be either.</p>
<p>Answer : It is not a vidhi. It does not mean that one should abandon all dharmas. Dharmalopa is not admissible for a prapanna. सर्वधर्मशब्देन प्रस्तुतमोक्षोपायान्तराणां विवक्षितत्वात्। It means that one gives up a desire to follow other means of liberation on account of his utter inability.</p>
<p>&lsquo;प्रपदनाङ्गभूत-आकिञ्चन्यपुरस्कार - विरुद्धोपायान्तराशाप्रहाणमेवात्र त्याग इति न विरोधः&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>Similar doubts that arise regarding the svarupa of Prapatti are all dispelled according to the authorities of जितन्ते स्तोत्र, लक्ष्मीतन्त्रम् and अहिर्बुध्यसंहिता ।</p>
<p>The Svarupanupatti is answered as follows : स्वनिर्भरत्वपर्यन्तरक्षकैकार्थ्य भावनम् । त्यक्तरक्षाफलस्वाम्यं रक्ष्यस्यात्मसमर्पणम्&quot; ।</p>
<p>प्रपदनमप्यत्र प्रार्थनापूर्विकं परस्यै देवतायै प्रत्यगात्मरूपहविषस्त्यागः। The svarupa of Prapatti, its accessories and the nature of Sarvadharma parityaga have been thus expounded by the great master in this work.</p>
<p>The Second objection raised against the definition of Prapatti is answered as follows : अत्र सौहार्द तु अव्याप्त्यादिरहितम्</p>
<p>Appendix</p>
<p>401</p>
<p>लक्षणं वदामः । अनन्यसाध्यस्वाभीष्ट साधनसमर्थवशीकरणं शरणागतिः</p>
<p>fa&rsquo; i There is no 3 over and above six factors mentioned. Of the six, ft is described as the main and the others are accessories. &ldquo;Prayer&rdquo; is described as Sharanagathi on account of the fact that it gets included in Sharanagathi and that it is</p>
<p>प्रधानभूताङ्ग | According to the Satyakitantra न्यास is described as the main or 311* in the primary sense in the statement. &lsquo;अनेनैव तु मन्त्रेण स्वात्मानं मयि निक्षिपेत्&rsquo; । It is thus established that Prapatti can be properly defined. 3. The objection that it is not seen among ancients that</p>
<p>anyone was liberated through Prapatti alone as evidenced in the scriptures is refuted as follows ::It cannot be said taht Prapatti was not at all observed. Nor can it be said that Prapatti was not performed for Moksha. Vibheeshana and others performed Prapatti as known from the ithihasas and Puranas. It is very well known that Kshatrabandhu, Muchukunda and others performed Prapatti as a direct means to Mukti : raha शरणं प्राप्य निस्तरन्ति मनीषिणः&rsquo; is a well known statement. The objection that there is no injunction enjoining Prapatti as &ldquo;One should perform Prapatti&rdquo; - is countered next as follows: It is established that mantras are all विधिपर | The scriptural authorities such as, मुमुक्षुर्वे PUTHE E&rsquo;, ' ACTICAR Twita' prescribe Prapatti for being saved. The sum and substance of Sri Rama Charama Shloka is - 3744xCHT HIETA', &lsquo;ATACH शरणं व्रज&rsquo; and याहि सर्वात्मभावेन' are all positively enjoining Prapatti. The satyakitantra says, &lsquo;T TRUT</p>
<p>402</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>his is cstablished by Sruti and others and so it cannot be said that it is not established. 5. If it is argued that any means other than Bhakti is</p>
<p>negated in the statement a fast 3449: ça hala, नान्यः पन्था अयनाय विद्यते&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>The answer is given that &lsquo;नान्यः&rsquo; means भक्ति wyffroufalit:' | The rule regarding the general and exception points out that the negation applies to that which is other than prescribed. Just as there are different modes of Upasana &ldquo;Nyasa Vidya&rdquo; also is one included in them. So this objection does not arise. 6. The next objection raised is that Prapatti is one with</p>
<p>Bhakti Yoga, being an accessory to it. The authorities that prescribe Prapatti do so as an &ldquo;anga&rdquo; or accessory to Bhakti yoga. So it is not an independent and direct means to Mukti,</p>
<p>The answer to this objection is as follows : Prapatti can be an &ldquo;anga&rdquo; or accessory or a direct means or &ldquo;angi&rdquo; according to the purpose required, as pointed out by the rule of falt a | Just like any mode of Upasana, Prapatti also can function as a direct means to Moksha. This is made clear by the following authorities :</p>
<p>Hraf fran: GT: HICHMOGE 1 नार्हन्ति शाणस्थस्य कलां कोटितमीमपि&quot;। &lsquo;यद्येन कामकामेन न साध्यं साधनान्तरैः । तेन तेनाप्येत तचन्यासेनैव महामुने&quot; ।</p>
<p>So it need not be doubted that Prapatti is one with Bhakti Yoga.</p>
<p>Appendix</p>
<p>403</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>The next objection relates to the impossibility of</li>
</ol>
<p>Prapatti being observed as Prapatti requires the cessation of all activities.</p>
<p>This objection is unfounded, as such a requirement is never accepted. A Prapanna is never seen to be totally actionless. Even the savants of the past have expounded &ldquo;the giving up of all activities that are opposed to the activities of the Lord&rdquo;. Nowhere is it said that Hauglafsfer is Prapatti. What is to be discarded is the idea that one can save oneself by one&rsquo;s own effort independent of the Lord. One should give up all efforts to seek protection from anyone other than the Lord. The involuntary functions like winking of the eyes, inhaling or exhaling and the performance of the ordained duties as devout worship of the Lord are not required to be given up. So this objection that Prapatti is impossible to be performed after giving up all activities does not stand. 8. The next objection is that Prapatti is not well-known as</p>
<p>a Henri | In all the eighteen Vidyasthanas, the four tantras or the Shilpasastra, Prapatti is nowhere mentioned as a distinct means for gaining Moksha. What is Prapatti is not clearly known. So it is an unknown means. Moreover Mahavisvasa cannot be actualised.</p>
<p>Answer : By the term 3teuild you cannot intend to say that the essential nature of Prapatti is not existent. This view is already refuted. You cannot even say that it is not a distinct and different means, because it is taught as a different and distinct means in Ahirbudhnya Samhita and others. The mere fact that it is not taught profusely cannot contradict its teaching in a few places. The testimony of other schools like Sankhya and others is of no avail to us as we do not follow them closely. The great masters of yore like Valmiki, Parasara, Vyasa, Shuka, Shounaka and others have glorified this doctrine in their great works and so the above objection is totally untenable. 9. The nineth and the final objection is that Prapatti is</p>
<p>opposed to the Sampradaya or tradition. The ancient acharyas have not traditionally taught or practised Prapatti as an independent and different means to Moksha. It is taught only as an &ldquo;agna&rdquo; or accessory in Sri Bhashya and Gita Bhashya. There might be references to Prapatti but they are also for Karma, Jnana or Bhakti. So Prapatti is not the means according to the tradition.</p>
<p>Answer : Tradition or Sampradaya is of three types, namely, 3462144KI, H181422427 and A E4&lt;442 | All these there are found in Prapatti. This is evidenced by the Srutis and Smrithis and these truths are also taught by the preceptors to their disciples.</p>
<p>The fact that Anga Prapatti is taught in the Sri Bhashya and others cannot contradict that Prapatti is an independent means as there is no statement like that anywhere. Sri Bhashyakara has practised and taught Prapatti as a direct and sufficient means to Moksha.</p>
<p>Conclusion : The fact that Prapatti is different and distinct from Upasana and that it is also a direct and independent means to Moksha becomes established as Prapatti is free from the incompatibilities like &ldquo;Svaroopa anupatatti&rdquo; and others. Thus this celebrated treatise has carefully examined the incompatibilities against Prapatti and has once for all refuted them. Sri Vedanta Desika has thus ably expounded and established the doctrine of Prapatti on unfallible valid grounds.</p>
