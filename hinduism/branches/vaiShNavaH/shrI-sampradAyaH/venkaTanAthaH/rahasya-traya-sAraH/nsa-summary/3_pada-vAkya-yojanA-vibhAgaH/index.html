<p>Having expounded the supreme truths that are to be imbibed by the genuine seekers of truth in the first twentyfour chapters of this treatise, Desika consolidated that teaching about the siddhopaya and sadhyopaya, and regulated the glory of Prapatti, in the second part of the work known as &lsquo;Sthirikarana Bhaga&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The third part of this work is known as Pada-Vakya Yojana - or explaining the significance of the terms and the several constructions of the terms as related to the three Rahasyas viz., the Mulamantra, Dvaya Mantra and the Charama Shloka. These three mantras illumine all the truths that have been expounded earlier in the twentysix chapters. These three chapters form in one way, the prime part or the main subject of this Great Work. The Mulamantra enlightens the essential nature of the jivatman, as being totally subservient to the Lord, and in that way develops a strong aspiration for attaining the Lord without delay. Thus, he will be having the &lsquo;adhikara&rsquo; or qualification for performing the means of salvation.</p>
<p>The Dvaya Mantra teaches vividly the way of performing the spiritual discipline of Prapatti, for attainment of the supreme benefit of life viz., attainment of godhead.</p>
<p>The Charama Shloka is significant, as it prescribes the particular means of surrender for attainment of the desired object. All these truths can be seen in each one of these three mantras; but yet, every mantra significantly expounds a particular aspect prominently.</p>
<p>In the Mulamantra, the first letter of the first word i.e., 37, signifies the Supreme Reality, who is the protector. The middle word and the third word viz., &lsquo;नमः and नारायणाय&rsquo; point out the upaya and upcya. All these three are made explicit in the Dvaya Mantra.</p>
<p>The particular qualification of the aspirant, suggested by the term &lsquo;prapadye&rsquo; and the non-dependence of this means on any other means and the termination of all obstructions are illuminated in the Charama Shloka. These three viz., Mulamantra, Dvaya Mantra and the Charama Shloka, are the causes of Jnana, Anushtana and Phala respectively, and are by means of that, the Dharaka, the Bhogya and the Poshaka respectively.</p>
<p>The Mulamantra which is adorning the tongue of the preceptor, is going to dispel the darkness of ignorance in the cave of the heart of the disciple, and it causes the gain of his &lsquo;satta&rsquo; or existence, by showing clearly the pure nature of the atman i.e., Para-sheshataika Rasa, or the essence of being of one nature of subservience unto the Lord. So, the Mulamantra is &lsquo;Dharaka&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Charama Shloka is the &lsquo;Poshaka&rsquo; because it is the cause of enhancing the particular knowledge that results in the performance of the final means of surrender and which is the culmination of the instruction into the spiritual means</p>
<p>fully.</p>
<p>The Dvaya Mantra is the &lsquo;Bhogya&rsquo; because it is the cause of the attainment of the supreme object of life, even when it</p>
<p>Mulamantradhikara</p>
<p>281</p>
<p>is uttered once. It makes one &lsquo;krithartha&rsquo; when it is reflected upon always.</p>
<p>In the Mulamantra Adhikara, Desika expounds the profound meanings related to the nature of the supreme, and the individual self and the significance of entrusting the burden of his protection to the Lord elaborately. The greatness of the Mulamantra is also expounded.</p>
<p>Before taking up the exposition of the great Mulamantra, Desika has offered obeisance to the deity of the Mantra and the teacher of that Mantra and the Mantra itself in three verses. These three verses are also of the form of obeisance and Mangalacharana. It is said that one should have devotion towards the Mantra, and the particular deity propounded in the Mantra and also towards the preceptor, who kindly teaches that Mantra</p>
<p>&lsquo;मन्त्रे तद्देवतायां च तथा मन्त्रप्रदे गुरौ । त्रिषु भक्तिः सदा कार्या साहि प्रथम साधनम् ॥</p>
<p>First of all, the Mantra-Devata is propitiated in the following verses:</p>
<p>&lsquo;तारं पूर्वं तदनुहृदयं तच्च नारायणाये त्याम्नायोक्तं पदमवयतां सार्थमाचार्यदत्तम् ।</p>
<p>अंगीकुर्वन् अलसमनसां आत्मरक्षाभरं नः क्षिप्रं देवः क्षिपतु निखिलान् किंकरैश्वर्य विघ्नान्&rsquo;।</p>
<p>&ldquo;May He accept the burden of our protection, which has been offered to Him by us, who are utterly helpless and who are ever reflecting upon the Holy Mantra, which is adorned with the &lsquo;Pranava&rsquo; first and the &lsquo;Namas&rsquo; next and</p>
<p>IL the term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; in the third place, as propounded in the shruti and which has been endowed to us by the compassionate Acharya. May the Lord Sriman Narayana set at rest all the obstructions such as kama, avidya, karma Vasana, etc., that are obstructions to our offering of loving service to the Lord without delay i.e., at the end of this body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Mantra is to be safeguarded at all costs, Sri Desika has used the word Tharam&rsquo; which signifies &lsquo;Om&rsquo;kara and &lsquo;Hridayam&rsquo; which signifies &lsquo;namas&rsquo; and then uses the word Narayana&rsquo; as propounded in the sruti HU U16 । नम इति पश्चात् । नारायणायेत्युपरिष्टात्' ।</p>
<p>Here a prayer is made for &lsquo;anishta- Nivritti&rsquo;, and through that a Mangalacharanam is also made. The term &lsquo;devah&rsquo; used in this verse, signifies Sriman Narayana as the Mantra Devata.</p>
<p>The next verse expounds the eminence of the preceptor of the Mantra, who is the well-wisher of all humanity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;कल्याणमावहतु कार्तयुगं स्वधर्म प्रख्यापयन् प्रणिहितेषु नरादिकेषु । आद्यं कमप्यधिगतो रथमष्टचक्रम् बन्धुस्सतां बदरिकाश्रमतापसो नः ।।</p>
<p>&ldquo;May that sage of Badrikashrama, Sriman Narayana, who taught vividly His-own Nivritti-Dharma of the Krita Yuga to those who were highly attentive, such as &lsquo;Nara&rsquo; and others, and who has mounted upon the primeval and supreme chariot of eight wheels, and who is the dear-relative of the virtuous, grant us all good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mulamantradhikara</p>
<p>283</p>
<p>The chariot mentioned here is the Mulamantra. The eight wheels are the eight letters. The person who has mounted upon that chariot is the supreme deity propounded in that Mantra. Sriman Narayana taught this supreme mantra to his own counterpart sage &lsquo;Nara&rsquo; and &lsquo;Narada&rsquo; and others. He is verily the Mantraprada or the Guru. He is prayed here to bestow all good to those who have surrendered themselves unto Him. It is suggested here that the Mantra was taught to those disciples, who fulfilled the qualifications of a disciple that is suggested by the word &lsquo;pranihiteshu&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the next verse, the greatness of the Mulamantra itself, is praised and a Mangalacharanam is made for the Mantra itself -</p>
<p>&lsquo;यदन्तस्थं अशेषेण वायम् वेदवैदिकम् । तस्मै व्यापकमुख्याय मन्त्राय महते नमः ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obeisance unto that Great Mantra, which is the most celebrated of all &lsquo;Vyapaka&rsquo; Mantras, and which is containing within itself totally, all expressions such as the Vedas, Smritis, Itihasas, Puranas and others.&rdquo; In this verse, the Mantra itself is praised. It is said</p>
<p>मन्तारं त्रायते यस्मात् मन्त्र इत्यभिधीयते । So, it is implied that this Mantra is capable of protecting all those who recite it with devotion. As all the objects of attainment or means of attainment that have been taught in the vast lore of Veda and the Smriti, Itihasa, Purana and others, are all included in this Mantra, this is said to be the &ldquo;Vyapaka Mukhya&rsquo; i.e., the foremost of the threc &lsquo;Vyapaka&rsquo; Mantras viz., the Ashtakshari, the Vasudeva Dvadashakshari and the Vishnu Shadakshari.284</p>
<ul>
<li>Having thus made the Mangalacharanam, Desika expounds the greatness of the Mulamantra, before explaining the profound meanings of the letters, words and sentences of this Great Mantra. A few of such statements may be quoted here:</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;मन्त्राणां परमो मन्त्रः&rsquo;, &lsquo;गुह्यानां गुह्यमुत्तमम्&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the most supreme of all mantras&rdquo;. &ldquo;This is to be highly guarded of all mantras to be guarded&rdquo;. This primeval Mantra, is most purifying of all purifying Mantras. This is the essence of all Vedas. This is capable of averting all undesirable things. This is the means of attainment of all purusharthas. This is helpful to all means. This is possible of being adopted by all varnas according to their competency in the Vedic or Tantric forms. It is enshrining in itself, all truths that are primary and secondary. It does not require any other Mantra, to make it powerful. It is common to all forms of the Lord. All Acharyas and Alwars have adopted this Holy Mantra commonly, and glorified it. The sages of yore have obtained realisation through this Mantra.</p>
<p>बहवो हि महात्मानः मुनयः सनकादयः ।</p>
<p>अष्टाक्षरं समाश्रित्य ते जग्मुः वैष्णवं पदम् ॥</p>
<p>Many of the Great Sages like Sanaka and others adopted this Mantra and attained the abode of Lord Vishnu.</p>
<p>यथा सर्वेषु देवेषु नास्तिनारायणात्परः । तथा सर्वेषु मन्त्रेषु नास्ति चाष्टाक्षरात्परः ।।</p>
<p>As there is no one higher than Narayana amongst the gods, there is no Mantra greater than this amongst all Mantras.</p>
<p>Mulamantradhikara</p>
<p>285</p>
<p>&lsquo;आसीना वा शयाना वा तिष्ठन्तो यत्र कुत्र वा । नमो नारायणायेति मन्त्रैकशरणा वयम् ॥</p>
<p>While sitting, sleeping or standing, or wherever we may be, we are taking resort in the one Supreme Mantra as Namo Narayanaya&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It is described that Pundarika was instructed into this Supreme Mantra by Narada, according to the command of the Lord, and that dharmatma, who was Narayana-Parayana, solely devoted to this Mantra, attained the supreme abode of the Lord. The glory of this Mantra can be known from</p>
<p>the fact that the Lord Himself taught this Mantra to Sri Tirumangai Alwar.</p>
<p>When this Mantra is adopted without &lsquo;Pranava&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;dative case&rsquo;, it becomes &lsquo;sarvadhikara&rsquo; or adoptable by all people without caste or colour.</p>
<p>There are a number of references in the Tamil Prabhandams, where &lsquo;pranava&rsquo; and &lsquo;dative case&rsquo; are not used. For people of the higher castes, it is to be adopted with &lsquo;pranava&rsquo; and &lsquo;dative case&rsquo;. When this Mantra is without &lsquo;pranava&rsquo;, it is called as Tantrika&rsquo; or Mantra prescribed in the Agamas. Even in such case, one may count the eight letters. All the meanings signified by the &lsquo;pranava&rsquo; are to be reflected in the letter &lsquo;3* which is used as a substitute to &lsquo;pranava&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The meanings that are enshrined in &lsquo;pranava&rsquo; are very many, and &lsquo;pranava&rsquo; is used for offering the atman unto the Paramatman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;हविर्गृहीत्वात्मरूपं वसुरण्येति मन्त्रतः । जुहुयात्प्रणवेनाग्नौ अच्युताख्ये सनातने&rsquo; ||</p>
<p>286</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>Holding up the oblation of the form of the atman, one should oblate that in the holy fire of the form of the primeval Achyuta, using &lsquo;pranava&rsquo; and &lsquo;vasuranya mantra&rsquo;. In this context, it may be seen that pranava is independently used for offering of the atman to the Lord. According to this, oven in the exposition of Mulamantra, pranava&rsquo; is interpreted as signifying &lsquo;samarpana&rsquo; or offering of the atman. Some masters explain this as expounding &lsquo;swarupa jnana&rsquo; or knowledge of the essential nature of the atman, and so, they teach that it is meant for gaining sheshatvanusandhana matra' or the reflection of the subservience of the atman to the Paramatman.</p>
<p>When &lsquo;pranava&rsquo; is used independently and when in itself becomes a mantra, then various meanings are known according to the variations of - 70647, feta, HE and सार्धतिमात्र ।</p>
<p>5043a' or Pranava of one syllable, signifies Paramatman having the Prithvi as his body (&lsquo;karya&rsquo;). The Pranava of two matras signifies Paramatman having the Antariksha as his body (the &lsquo;karya rupa&rsquo;) and the Pranava of three matras signifies Paramatman having the &lsquo;कार्यरूप स्व र्लोक ' as his body and &lsquo;TEHYUa&rsquo; signifies Paramatman of the causal state and those who meditate upon &lsquo;Pranava&rsquo; like this gain those respective worlds.</p>
<p>It may be said that &lsquo;sheshatvanusandhana&rsquo; is gained from &lsquo;pranava&rsquo; and it will be fulfilling the competence of the jivatman for becoming an aspirant -</p>
<p>क्षेत्रज्ञस्य ईश्वरज्ञानात् विशुद्धिः परमा मता । .</p>
<p>Mulamantradhikara</p>
<p>287</p>
<p>By the knowledge of Ishvara, it is opined that the jivatman or Kshetragna becomes supremely purified. If this pertains to mere Tattvajnana of the sheshin or Paramatman then it will result in termination of HESI or unfitness for upasana. If it signifies 34T4 T5 or different knowledge of the 34 it is related to Moksha. This is illustrated in the statement of orifs - ETT: 4CHITATU Mehl açar:/ तत्संबन्धानुसंधानं इति योगः प्रकीर्तितः॥</p>
<p>Now, we may try to understand the profound meanings of the terms of this Mulamantra, as propounded by the shastras.</p>
<p>The three letters of the &lsquo;Pranava&rsquo; are said to be the essence of the three Vedas. The first letter of the &lsquo;Pranava&rsquo;, which happens to be the first word of &lsquo;Ashtakshara Mantra&rsquo;, signifies Paramatman, who is the ground of everything other than Himself.</p>
<p>अकारेण अखिलाधारः परमात्माभिधीयते ।</p>
<p>3TR is the source of all speech and Brahman is the cause of all objects of this world. Naturally, the first letter of the Pranava, which is the cause of all words or &lsquo;Halala&rsquo; signifies Sriman Narayana, who is the cause of all objects &lsquo;वाच्यजातप्रकृति | This term is signifying the Supreme Paramatman who is the material and instrumental cause of this universe and who is characterised by the host of auspicious qualities such as Hasica, diretora and others.</p>
<p>&lsquo;अकारो विष्णुवाचकः&rsquo;, &lsquo;अ इति भगवतो नारायणस्य प्रथमाभिधानम्&rsquo; । This letter 37 is derived from &lsquo;372 74701&rsquo; and therefore signifies the Hot Third of Paramatman. Though many meanings are possible for the root ta&rsquo; the fact of &lsquo;Rakshakarva&rsquo; is desired to be reflected upon, as it is required here prominently. As there is no limitation to this rakshakatva, it is related to one and all. The modes of protection are very many according to the difference in the seekers of protection. Though rakshakarva is non-conditional (front ), in respect of those samsarins who have transgressed the Divine Command, the Supreme Lord expects some pretext to be done on the part of the jivas to be saved. Though the Lord&rsquo;s rakshakatva is natural to all, it is obstructed on account of the condition of punishment in respect of people who have committed transgression of Divine Command from beginningless time. To get rid of such displeasure of the Lord, the pretexts of Bhakti and Prapatti have been prescribed in the shastras. It is rightly said that &ldquo;it is appropriate that the Supreme Lord, who is the Master of all, is to be the saviour of mankind; Sharanagari and others are helping factors. The all independent-grace of the Lord, happens to be the prime cause of liberation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>त्राणे स्वामित्वमौचित्यं न्यासाद्याः सहकारिणः । प्रधानहेतुः स्वातन्त्र्यविशिष्टा करुणा विभोः ॥ According to the authorities like,</p>
<p>&lsquo;तदन्तर्भावात् त्वाम् न पृथगभिधत्ते श्रुतिरपि&rsquo;, लक्ष्म्या सह हृषीकेशः देव्या कारुण्यरूपया । रक्षकः सर्वसिद्धान्ते वेदान्तेषु च गीयते॥&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>The Lord is ever associated with the compassionate</p>
<p>Mulamantradhikara</p>
<p>289</p>
<p>Goddess Mahalakshmi, and He happens to be the protector along with Sri Mahalakshmi. So, in 37 of the &lsquo;Pranava&rsquo;, one should reflect Sriman Narayana, necessarily united with Sri Mahalakshmi. Similarly, even in the term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; in this Mulamantra, one should reflect upon the Lord, as associated with Mahalakshmi. In the first letter &lsquo;31&rsquo; of the &lsquo;Pranava&rsquo;, the dative case ending 3774' is dropped, because it signifies the person to whom the atman is verily offered. The construction that is taken by others that the first and the third letters of the &lsquo;Pranava&rsquo; that signify Parámatman and Jivatman respectively, are in the nominative case, and thus oneness is to be signified between them, is opposed to many authorities. This is very explicit in the Mantra of the Mundakopanishat, which expounds that one should have the pranava as the bow and the atman as the arrow and Brahman as the target. This establishes that the two are quite different and distinct.</p>
<p>The letter &lsquo;#&rsquo; signifies the jivatma who is ever subservient to the Lord. The middle letter &lsquo;3&rsquo; is taken to signify Goddess Lakshmi and in that case the jivatman is to be known as subscrvient or shesha to both of them. This atman is, therefore, described as subservient or &lsquo;sheshabhuta&rsquo; to both the Lord and His consort.</p>
<p>If the middle letter is taken in the sense of avadharana' or emphasis, it becomes significant that the jivatman is subscrvient to only Paramatman and not to any other person and as it has already been made clear, the jivatman is never subservient to other deities and devotees of other deities. This &lsquo;Bhagavat-Sheshatva&rsquo; extends upto the &lsquo;sheshatva&rsquo; of the &lsquo;Bhagavatas&rsquo;, as it is the desire of the Supreme Paramatman. III</p>
<p>The third letter ' signifies the jivatman and through him, all things that are subservient to the Lord. 4914 ans I' points out that &lsquo;Haire&rsquo; signifies the jivatman who is different and discinct from the non-sentient entities on the one hand and on the other hand the Supreme Paramatman, who happens to be the twentysixth entity and who is signified as the cause of everything else, and the redeemer of all by the first letter.</p>
<p>The Hait' and the term &lsquo;r&rsquo; in the Mulamantra signify only the visheshanas and not the Supreme Paramatman characterised by them by the &lsquo;Nishkarsha vivaksha&rsquo; or restricting the connotation. The jivatman is of the essential nature of consciousness, and has consciousness as his attribute also and he has also &lsquo;Ananda&rsquo; as his attribute. He is totally subservient to the Supreme Paramatman, and in his essential nature, he is supremely pure. As the jivatmans are infinite, the term ' in the Mulamantra, signifies the class (jati vachana). As he has to realise sheshatva jnanam, or awareness of subservience, and termination of &lsquo;svatantrabhimana&rsquo;, some masters take the term “3764 to be understood along with letter &lsquo;#&rsquo;. It is pointed out by some that the letter &lsquo;H&rsquo; itself signifies &lsquo;E&rsquo; also. As the third letter has to signify the oblation of the form of the &lsquo;pratyagatman&rsquo; - to be offered to the Lord – it is appropriate to take the term &lsquo;37&rsquo; as the sense of the letter &lsquo;H&rsquo;. Sri. Parashara Bhattar has, therefore, explained Hole' as oretta F946' I</p>
<p>The middle term of the Mula Mantra is &lsquo;Namas&rsquo;. This term &lsquo;Namas&rsquo; signifies surrender or &lsquo;Sharana-Varanam&rsquo;. As</p>
<p>Mulamantradhikara</p>
<p>291</p>
<p>prayer for protection and entrusting the essential nature and the fruit of protection go together, the cerms that prescribe surrender imply &lsquo;Atma Samarpana&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sharana-Varana&rsquo;. The usage of this term in Mahabharata - &lsquo;नमश्चक्नुः जनार्दन&rsquo; - for &lsquo;sharanagati&rsquo; makes this point clear. The fact that &lsquo;Namas&rsquo; signifies &lsquo;Atma-Samarpanam&rsquo; is evident in the statement &lsquo;नमस्कारात्मकं यस्मै विधायात्मनिवेदनम्&rsquo; i.e., surrendering oneself is of the form of &lsquo;namaskara&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the term &lsquo;Namas&rsquo;, the meanings such as - &lsquo;I am not the saviour of myself; all activities that are called mine, are not subscrvient to me; all these are subservient only to the Supreme Lord&rdquo; - are signified.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Ahirbudniya Samhitha&rsquo; expounds three significant meanings to this term &lsquo;Namaha&rsquo;. They are known as &lsquo;Sthula&rsquo;, Sukshma&rsquo; and &lsquo;Para&rsquo;. The &lsquo;sthulartha&rsquo; of &lsquo;Namas&rsquo; is performance of self-surrender, accompanied with the five accessories to the Lord:</p>
<p>भगवान् मे परो नित्यं अहं प्रत्यवरः सदा । sfa HTa 74: : 74H: HTUT : 11 नामयत्यपि वा देवं प्रह्वीभावयति ध्रुवम् । प्रह्वीभवति नीचे हि परो नैच्यं विलोकयन् ।। अतो वा नम उद्दिष्टं यत्तन्नामयति स्वयम् ।</p>
<p>The Supreme Paramatman is the &lsquo;seshin&rsquo; and I am ever the lowest of the low - the &lsquo;shesha-bhuta&rsquo;. The reflection of the &lsquo;Sesha-Seshi-Bhava&rsquo; is said to be &lsquo;Namas&rsquo;. This reflection of &lsquo;sheshatva&rsquo; is verily the cause of surrender. So, the reflection of the &lsquo;Sesha-Sheshi-Bhava&rsquo; is the meaning of the term &lsquo;Namas&rsquo;.</p>
<p>292</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This means makes the Lord condescend, or make him yield to one who is below. The most supreme &lsquo;Paramatman&rsquo; seeing the humility of the &lsquo;sesha&rsquo; - the jivatman - becomes well disposed towards the person who surrenders unto Him According to this interpretation, the meaning of the term is to be taken as &lsquo;sharanagati&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Ahirbudniya Samhita describes the various accessories of &lsquo;sharanagati&rsquo;, and expounds that the &lsquo;sthulartha&rsquo; of &lsquo;Namas&rsquo; is performance of surrender:</p>
<p>पूर्णमऊः उपाश्च नमनं ते प्रकीर्तितम् । स्थूलोऽयं नमसस्त्वर्थः सूक्ष्ममन्यन्निशामय ।।</p>
<p>The Atma-Nikshepa - or the surrender of the atman to be protected, with all the accessories prescribed for that - is the gross meaning of the term Namas'.</p>
<p>The subtle meaning - or sukshmarta of Namas' - is the abnegation of &lsquo;mamatha&rsquo; or the feeling of the &lsquo;T&rsquo; and '</p>
<p>Mine'. Here &lsquo;Mamyam&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mamakara&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ahankara&rsquo; are to be discarded. That is said to be the meaning of &lsquo;Namas&rsquo;:</p>
<p>&lsquo;चेतनस्य यदा मम्यं स्वस्मिन् स्वीये च वस्तुनि । मम इत्यक्षरद्वन्द्वम् तदा मम्यस्य वाचकम् ॥ अनादिवासनारूढमिथ्याज्ञाननिबन्धना । अत्मात्मीयपदार्थस्था या स्वातन्त्र्यस्वता मतिः ॥ मेनेत्येवं समीचीन बुद्ध्या सात्र निवार्यते । नाहं मम स्वतन्त्रोऽहं नास्मीत्यस्यार्थ उच्यते ॥ न मे देहादिकं वस्तु स शेषः परमात्मनः ।</p>
<p>Mulamantradhikara</p>
<p>293</p>
<p>नम इत्येतया वाचा नन्त्रा स्वस्मादपोह्यते । इति ते सूक्ष्म उद्दिष्टः परमन्यन्निशामय&rsquo; ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a chetana or jiva has &lsquo;mamakara&rsquo; and &lsquo;ahankara&rsquo; in him, and in things that belong to him, then the word &lsquo;mama&rsquo; of two letters, is indicating &lsquo;mamyam&rsquo;. This kind of thought in himself and in the objects that belong to him, is on account of wrong knowledge that is superimposed on him on account of beginningless &lsquo;vasana&rsquo; or reminiscent impressions. That wrong knowledge is terminated here by the right understanding such as &lsquo;they are not mine; I am not belonging to me; I am not independent; the body and others are not mine; they are all subservient to Paramatman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this understanding, all the perverse thoughts of the form of &lsquo;I and Mine&rsquo;, get terminated. This is the meaning of the term Namas&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The wrong knowledge of the form of independent existence and existence of one&rsquo;s own self, gets terminated, when one realises that all objects in this world are subservient to the Lord, as He happens to be &lsquo;inner-self in</p>
<p>all.</p>
<p>me</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;Namaha&rsquo; itself is going to dispel all kinds of misapprehensions of the form of &lsquo;mamakara&rsquo; and &lsquo;ahankara&rsquo; by means of its significant connotation. This is the subtle meaning of the term 4:&rsquo;!</p>
<p>This term &lsquo;Namaha&rsquo; has another meaning which is known as &lsquo;para&rsquo; or the most-supreme:</p>
<p>पन्था नकार उद्दिष्टो मः प्रधान उदीर्यते । विसर्गः परमेशस्तु तत्रार्थोऽयं निरुच्यते ॥</p>
<p>Wn &lsquo;अनादिः परमेशोऽयं शक्तिमान् पुरुषोत्तमः । तत्प्राप्तये प्रधानोऽयं पन्था नमननामवान् &lsquo;॥</p>
<p>The Na&rsquo;-kara signifies the &lsquo;path&rsquo;; &lsquo;mah&rsquo; means &lsquo;prime&rsquo;; the &lsquo;visarga&rsquo; signifies &lsquo;Paramatman&rsquo;. When all these are taken together, it amounts to this - The primeval Supreme Lord who is omnipotent and Purushothama, is the Prime Pathway to His attainment, and is so signified as Namah&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It may be asked why the term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; is to be repeated here, as it is declared that the &lsquo;Parama-Sheshin&rsquo; alone is to be sought as in Tel: 934: 3197 | Though it is quite evident, to enlighten that such a one is the &lsquo;Parama Sheshin&rsquo;, the term &lsquo;Narayanaya&rsquo; is used specifically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The glory of the name Narayana&rsquo; - this term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; clearly shows both the tattvas viz., the &lsquo;shesha&rsquo; and the &lsquo;sheshi&rsquo;. So it is establishing the name of the particular deity to be meditated upon in all Brahmavidyas as &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo;. The Narayana Anuvaka' of the Maha Narayana Upanishat, has declared that &lsquo;Brahma, Shiva and other such deities, are all the &lsquo;vibhuties&rsquo; of Narayana, as they are all included in the group of &lsquo;Naras&rsquo;. The statement - &ldquo;reciting the mere name Narayana&rsquo;, people get rid of all sorrows and gain happiness&rdquo; - signifies the celebrity of this name. The Alwars glorify this Holy Name of the Lord Narayana – in their compositions. Those people who merely utter this Holy Name Narayana', will be freed from disease, afflictions and sorrows and there is no doubt in this. The term Narayana itself, is counted as having eight letters - when the vowels and consonants are counted separately. The term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; is signifying the Supreme, who is of the form of all auspiciousness, divested of all that is defiling, and which is having &lsquo;ubhaya-lingarva&rsquo;</p>

<p>and &lsquo;ubhaya-vibhuti&rsquo; yogatva. &ldquo;Creating waters, I am residing in waters, and so, my name is known as Narayana&rdquo; -</p>
<p>&lsquo;सृष्ट्वा नारं तोयमन्तस्थितोऽहं येन स्यान्मे नाम नारायणेति ;</p>
<p>आपो नारा इति प्रोक्ताः आपो वै नरसूनवः । ता यदस्यायनं पूर्व तेन नारायणः स्मृतः ॥</p>
<p>Waters are called Nārāh&rsquo;, and it is the creation of the Lord. Those waters were the abode of this Lord before. So, He is called &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo;. This term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; signifies that Narayana is the primeval cause of this universe. &ldquo;Nārāni' means all entities are born of Nara' or Paramatman -</p>
<p>&lsquo;नराज्जातानि तत्त्वानि नाराणि इति ततो विदुः । तान्येव चायनं तस्य तेन नारायणः स्मृतः ॥</p>
<p>Those tattvas themselves are the abode of that Supreme and therefore, He is called &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; From this, it is understood that -</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Narayana is the cause of all entities in this universe, inclusive of Brahma, Shiva and others, and has pervaded all those entities from within and without.</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;Ayana&rsquo; signifies that He is all pervasive - (sarva-vyapaka and also Niratishaya-sukshma). As the term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; signifies that He is one goal of all humanity, He is also known as the one means of the attainment of Himself. The term &lsquo;Nāra&rsquo; signifies the multitudes of all beings. As this Lord is the &lsquo;gati&rsquo; - or the object of attainment - and &lsquo;alambana&rsquo; - or the means of attainment - He is well known as &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; - नारस्त्विति सर्वपुंसां समूहः परिकीर्तितः । गतिरालम्बनं तस्य तेन नारायणः स्मृतः ॥</p>
<p>Therefore, Narayana is declared by the Vedas, and the knowers of the Veda, as the near-relative (mother, father, preceptor, abode and refuge) of all beings in this universe.</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; signifies that He is having under his rule the essential nature, existence and functioning of all the three kinds of sentients and non-sentients,</p>
<p>The letter T signifies the non-sentient entity that is subjected to mutation. The letter T which is prefixed before &lsquo;T&rsquo; to form &lsquo;Nara&rsquo;, signifies the chetana, which is not subjected to change in his essential nature. The word &lsquo;R&rsquo; signifies the multitudes of Naras&rsquo; or sentient principles. The Lord is the &lsquo;Ayana&rsquo; to these multitudes of &lsquo;Naras&rsquo;. By this term &lsquo;ayana&rsquo;, the Supreme Lord, to whom the &lsquo;svarupa&rsquo;, &lsquo;sthithi&rsquo; and functioning of the three kinds of sentients and non-sentients are subordinated, and who is the cause of all these entities, and who happens to be the Supreme Object of attainment by virtue of His most blissful nature - is signified. This significs that the Lord is the ground or support of all the three worlds, as pointed out in &lsquo;BuaTER 2011 tara tetani Haffera&rsquo; | The word &lsquo;ayana&rsquo; points out - according to different derivations from the roots &lsquo;ईयते अनेन&rsquo;,</p>
<p>$ud ht' and ' A' that He is the &lsquo;upaya&rsquo;, &lsquo;upeya&rsquo; and &lsquo;adhara&rsquo; - the means of attainment, the goal and the support respectively. The supremacy and accessibility that are helpful for &lsquo;upeyatva&rsquo; and &lsquo;upayatva&rsquo; are to be understood here. By the derivation of the term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; through</p>
<p>Mulamantradhikara</p>
<p>297</p>
<p>&lsquo;बहुव्रीहि&rsquo; compound as &lsquo;नाराः अयनं यस्य सः, the &lsquo;antharvyapti&rsquo; or internal pervasion is known, whereas through &lsquo;तत्पुरुष&rsquo; compound as &lsquo;नाराणां अयन&rsquo;, &lsquo;bahir-vyapti&rsquo; or external pervasion is known. To pervade an entity wherever it is - so that it cannot be said that, it is not there - is internal pervasion. External pervasion is, to be even in all places, where an entity is not.</p>
<p>The letter &lsquo;अ&rsquo; in pranava, and the term &lsquo;Nara&rsquo; and &lsquo;ayana&rsquo; in the term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo;, serve different purposes of pointing out &lsquo;rakshakatva&rsquo;, &lsquo;karanarva&rsquo; and &lsquo;nityatva&rsquo; and &lsquo;netrutva&rsquo; and &lsquo;upayatva&rsquo; and upeyatva&rsquo; respectively. Though Paramatman is characterised by all other entities, and though He is all pervasive, He is not tainted with the defects of those entities on account of His essential nature of &lsquo;apahatapapmatva&rsquo; or being opposed to all that is defiling.</p>
<p>This Mantra, thus establishes that Paramatman is different and distinct from the other two entities on account of the fact of this pervasion, and His being the support and Master of every other entity.</p>
<p>न रिष्यति च सर्वत्र नरस्तस्मात्सनातनः । नरसम्बन्धिनस्सर्वे चेतनाचेतनात्मकाः ।। ईशितव्यतया नारा धार्यपोष्यतया तथा । नियाम्यत्वेन सृज्यत्व प्रवेशभरणैस्तथा ।</p>
<p>अयते निखिलान् नारान् व्याप्नोति क्रियया तथा । नाराश्चाप्यायनं तस्य तैस्तद्भावनिरूपणात् ॥ नाराणामयनं वासस्ते च तस्यायनं सदा । परमा च गतिस्तेषां नाराणामात्मनां सदा ।। As He is never decaying, the primeval Paramatan is designated as &lsquo;Narah&rsquo; (:). The sentients and non-sentients that are inseparably related to Nara', the Lord, are called &lsquo;Narah&rsquo; (ART:). The relationship between Him and the other entities is as follows -</p>
<p>They are ever subservient to Him depending upon Him for their very essential nature;</p>
<p>They are depending upon His will for their functions, being created by Him, being ensouled by Him, being ruled over by Him and being supported by Him.</p>
<p>The Paramatman rules over all others, pervades them through the acts of pervasion, controlling and supporting. The sentients and non-sentients are the means of jnana, because through the &lsquo;nārāh&rsquo;, the existence of Brahman is pointed out. He is the &lsquo;vasasthana&rsquo; or abode of the chetanas and achetanas. Those chetanas and achetanas are ever pervaded by Him. He is the &lsquo;gathi&rsquo; or the object of attainment for those naras or atmans.</p>
<p>Thus, by the term Narayana, the Supreme Paramatman, the internal ruler in all entities, the one who is related in all ways as the mother, father, teacher, brother and others, the most Supreme Ishvara is expounded. He is the one natural relative of all - a &lsquo;Nirupadhika-Bandhu&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The dative case in the term Narayana is declared by Desika as a prime part which is the cause of the attainment of the fruit, in the Mula Mantra. According to the various constructions of the &lsquo;phala-prarthana&rsquo; or prayer for the supreme object of attainment, happens to be in this dative casc. The &lsquo;sampradana&rsquo; or the dative signifies the master of</p>
<p>CIOUS</p>
<p>Mulamantradhikara</p>
<p>299</p>
<p>the object to whom that is being given - 3441-ref silera संप्रदानत्वमिष्यते' ।</p>
<p>Though in this context, the offering of the atman to the Lord, as an object to be saved by Him, is the meaning of the dative case, an object that is subservient to the Lord alone, is being offered to Him to be protected by Him alone. It is not something belonging to one, offered to another for protection. To whom this offering is made, if it is asked, it is said to the Great Lord, Maha Vishnu.</p>
<p>तत् कस्मा इत्यपेक्षायां विष्णवे स इतीर्यते ।</p>
<p>So, the meaning of the dative, is explained here. This is applicable to the dative case of the term Narayana', in the Mula Mantra also. The meanings of the seven letters in the Mula Mantra, beginning with Na-kara' have been explained</p>
<p>in the Mantra Smritis and Desika quotes them in this context.</p>
<p>Like this, from a detailed study of the derivation of the meanings of the term and letters of this Mula Mantra, it becomes established very clearly that the mirror of the form of the Mula Mantra, reflects clearly the essential nature of the Paramatman, as well as the jivatman, that are difficult to understand otherwise.</p>
<p>Desika has elaborately expounded the essential nature of the Paramatman, that is explicit and implicit in the Mula Mantra. He counts in all 108 auspicious qualities, and in the end summarises in one verse the supreme nature of Paramatman as follows:</p>
<p>इह संग्रहतः श्रीमान् गोप्ता शेषी समाधिकदरिद्रः । शरणं सर्वशरीरी प्राप्यस्सेव्यश्च साधुभिर्भाव्यः ॥ In this Mula Mantra, the protector who is associated with Goddess Maha Lakshmi (akārārcha - the meaning of 370) the Sheshi, who is not having anyone equal to Him and greater to Him (the meaning of the dative dropped in 31051), the protector of all the meaning of Namas), the one who has all other entities as his body (the meaning of Narayana), and who is the ultimate object of attainment and who is the one that is to be served by all the meaning of 3711), is to be reflected upon by all virtuous people.</p>
<p>Likewise, the characteristics of the jivatman as reflected in the Mula Mantra, have been counted and described as suggested in the Mula Mantra. Desika concludes this exposition, summing up the supreme significance of the Mula Mantra, in the following verse:</p>
<p>पदत्रयेऽत्र संक्षेपात् भाव्यानन्याहशेषता । अनन्योपायता स्वस्य तथानन्यपुमर्थता ॥</p>
<p>In the three words of this Mula Mantra, what are necessarily to be reflected upon are -</p>
<ol>
<li>subservience to Him alone and not to any other (the</li>
</ol>
<p>meaning of Pranava) 2. the means of attainment being the Lord alone and none</p>
<p>other (the meaning of Namah) and 3. the object of attainment being the Lord alone and none</p>
<p>else (the meaning of Narayanaya).</p>
<p>Thus, Desika has expounded the significance of the Mula Mantra as mentioned in the statement</p>
<p>अष्टाक्षरान्तस्थम्।</p>
<p>Mulamantradhikara</p>
<p>301</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>11</p>
<p>This supreme Mantra, establishes conclusively - the essential nature of the three entities – the sentient, the non-sentient and Ishvara distinctively, and establishes their differences from one another; the mutual difference and distinction between one jiva</p>
<p>and another jiva; 3. the natural difference between Ishvara and the jivatman</p>
<p>on account of the shesha-sheshi bhava; that the particular deity Sriman Narayana alone is the material cause and instrumental cause of this universe.</p>
<p>When one lives in the company of those people, who are reflecting over the supreme meanings of this eminent Mantra as stated above, no doubt arises about the nature of</p>
<p>the Supreme as well as the nature of the jivatman.</p>
<p>How are the three terms of this great Mantra, to be related with one another to form a whole sentence? Are the three terms suggesting a single sentence or are they forming two sentences or are they to be taken as three sentences?</p>
<p>Desika points out that they signify particular meanings when they are studied in these forms. While the three terms are taken to form one sentence, then the order of the meanings is as follows:</p>
<p>प्रणवप्रतिपाद्यस्वभावविशिष्टाय नारायणाय नमः</p>
<p>According to this, the pranava becomes another name of the Supreme Paramatman. This will be emphasising the &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; or the means of realisation (upaya-param). The other two viz., svarupa and purusharta, should be taken as included in &lsquo;upaya&rsquo;. This is taken to signify by some masters, as &lsquo;shesha-vritti-para&rsquo; i.e., the function of subservience by the body and speech, as pointed our in allsifoyai ke1 74 RA qilga'</p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Here the first part of folding the hands relates to body - &lsquo;kayaka-shesha-vritti&rsquo; - and the second part relates to &lsquo;vachika-shesha-vritti&rsquo;. This kind of service by virtue of subservience happens through the reflection of one&rsquo;s essential nature. For making explicit all these meanings of &lsquo;upayatva&rsquo; and &lsquo;shesha-vrittitva&rsquo;, this Mantra, is reflected as two sentences: 1. I am by nature subservient to Him, who is characterised</p>
<p>by 370R and the term Narayana and who is having the qualities of rakshakarva and sarvadhāratva</p>
<p>I am not for myself; I am not the natural master of anything; I am not by myself independent. It may be emphasised a follows:</p>
<p>I am subservient to Narayana alone, who is signified by 37061 From this, it becomes established that the one cause of all, is no other deity than Narayana.</p>
<p>For Mantras, the order of words or &lsquo;Pada-krama&rsquo; is decided according to tradition. But, according to the meanings, the relationship of the words may be explained. If two sentences are understood in this Mantra, then it will signify totally the svarupa. That is why, it is pointed out by the masters, that one is born in the Tirumantra. When one realises that he is subservient to none other, i.e., not dependent on any other person, he will surrender to Him alone, for atraining Him alone as the supreme object. Thus, he becomes established in the means and &lsquo;prayojana&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mulamantradhikara</p>
<p>303</p>
<p>It is explained by masters that the Mula Mantra is signifying self-surrender with all the accessories (सपरिकरात्मसमर्पणम्)</p>
<p>According to this interpretation, the HR in pranava, will have to be taken in the nominative case. The meaning will be like this:</p>
<p>This oblation of the atman which is by nature subservient to the Paramatman, is offered for being protected, to Narayana alone, who is the &lsquo;sheshin&rsquo; by nature and who is designated by the letter 370m. Then, the term 74: will sever the relationship with himself and means that the burden of protection is not for me. This is as prescribed in oblations performed with the mantra</p>
<p>G1414 7 &lsquo;. Here, it is ordained that it is related to Paramatman and one&rsquo;s own relationship is negated. (परसम्बन्धविधि, स्वसंबन्ध निषेध)</p>
<p>In this interpretation, both the sentences serve definite purposes. The burden of protection is not entrusted to any one different from Him and it is not a burden on me also.</p>
<p>This fact of Mula Mantra, signifying &lsquo;atma-nivedana&rsquo; is declared by Bhagavan Ramanuja, in his Nitya Grantha, as मूलमन्त्रेण स्वात्मानं देवाय निवेद्य । Even in Vaikuntha Gadya, Ramanuja says - &lsquo;than 1994-i Daftarefach परिचर्याकरणाय परिगृहीष्वेति याचमानः प्रणम्य आत्मानं भगवते निवेदयेत्&rsquo;।</p>
<p>If it is observed that there is no word for praying as such in the Mula Mantra, Desika points out that the verbEssence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Sararn</p>
<p>&lsquo;RI&rsquo; may be understood in respect of each of the two sentences. Then it will be - 3* FRI494 RTH&rsquo; 1 74: RITA'</p>
<p>This kind of interpretation will be similar to the interpretation of the second khanda or part of the Dvaya Mantra, where there is a prayer for &lsquo;ishta prapti&rsquo; and &lsquo;anishta nivritti&rsquo;. In this interpretation, the reflection upon one&rsquo;s svarupa is included.</p>
<p>When this Mula Mantra is interpreted as having three sentences, svarupa and purusharta will be explicit and the &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; will be understood. If two of the three viz., svarupa, upaya and purushartha, are taken as explicit, the other one will be implicit in it. The svarupa, upaya and purushartha are literally meant by the terms of the Mula Mantra. The &lsquo;pranava&rsquo; and &lsquo;namas&rsquo; expound svarupa. The third letter, and the dative case dropped in all of &lsquo;pranava&rsquo;, will be signifying the prayer for purushartha with the term &lsquo;RIH being understood. Even here, Narayana inseparably associated with Goddess Lakshmi is signified. The prayer that is submitted to the Lord here is &lsquo;Fra företai&rsquo; or loving service to the Divine for all time to come. This kind of divine service may be mentioned in terms of Ishvara as also in terms of the Prapanna. It may be mentioned like this</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should obtain kainkarya, which will delight you&rdquo;, or it may be said, &ldquo;you must delight by making me your kinkara&rdquo;,</p>
<p>The prayojana or benefit is clearly established for both here. This kind of &lsquo;kainkarya-prapti&rsquo; is the ultimate end of life. This &lsquo;kainkaryam&rsquo; or divine service is not in conflict with the equality the jiva gains in enjoyment of bliss and</p>
<p>Mulamantradhikara</p>
<p>305</p>
<p>attainment of knowledge with the supreme, in the state of liberation. Because, &lsquo;kainkaryam&rsquo; is the fruit of seshatva which is the essential nature of the jiva. The subservicnce to the Lord or inquira&rsquo; is declared in the pranava and is reflected in the namas, where utter dependence upon the Lord and the fact of existence only for the sake of the Lord, are suggested, will culminate in eternal service to the Supreme Paramatman mentioned as &lsquo;Narayanaya&rsquo;. This भगवत् कैंकर्य' extends further to भागवत कैंकर्य which is the culmination of the attainment of the object of life. This kind of &lsquo;kainkarya&rsquo; is the cause of the infinite bliss and not the cause of sorrow that results out of servitude to the ungodly oncs.</p>
<p>In this sacred Mantra, it is explained that the three terms themselves signify svarupa, upaya and purushartha. The pranava signifies the svarupa; the namas the upaya and the rest of the Mula Mantra, is expounding the prayer for purushartha. This interpretation is similar to the exposition of tartva, upaya and purusharta in Vedanta Sutras. The first two chapters of Vedanta Sutras deal with the Supreme Reality, and the subordinate realities. The third chapter expounds the upaya or the means of liberation, along with its accessories. The fourth chapter expounds the &lsquo;phala&rsquo; or the ultimate object of attainment. The essential nature of the higher reality and the lower reality expounded in the first two chapters and the &lsquo;phala-svarupa&rsquo; that is described in the fourth chapte, are equally applicable to a prapanna. The truths that are taught in the &lsquo;Vairagya-pada&rsquo; and &lsquo;ubhayalinga-pada&rsquo; of the third chapter, are necessarily to be known by a prapanna also. The description of the different types of &lsquo;upasana&rsquo;, exclusively relates to the relevant upasaka.</p>
<p>306</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyavaya Saram</p>
<p>For a Prapanna, the Prapatti that is performed by him awards the same result through the grace of the Lord.</p>
<p>The performance of the ordained duties of one&rsquo;s station in life (Varnashrama Dharmas) described in the fourth chapter of the Vedanta Sutras, happens to be an accessory to upasana; but, a Prapanna is obliged to observe all those duties, as carrying out the commands of the Lord, though not as an accessory to Prapasti. Thus, the truths expounded in the Vedanta Sutras are implicit in the Mula Mantra. On account of a clear comprehension of the truths taught by the Mula Mantra, one becomes unassailable by any other school of thought. He will not be disturbed by any kind of provocation or acclamation:</p>
<p>न प्रहृष्यति सम्माने नावमानेऽनुतप्यते । गंगा हद इवाक्षोभ्यः यस्स पण्डित उच्यते ।।</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not delight when honoured nor does he feel sad when dishonoured, like the deep waters of the Ganga, he will never be disturbed. Only such a person is a &lsquo;pandit&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In concluding this exposition of the great M</p>
<p>s exposition of the great Mantra, Desika glorifies the greatness of this Mantra in the following verses:</p>
<p>ऋचो यजूंषि सामानि तथैवाथर्वणानि च । सर्वमष्टाक्षरान्तस्थं यच्चान्यदपि वाङ्मयम् ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is taught by the Rik, the Yajus, the Samans and the Atharva - all that, is contained in this Great Mantra - Ashtakshara. Not only this much, what all else is found in speech, does exist in this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mulamantradhikara</p>
<p>307</p>
<p>By once reciting this Mantra with full faith, one gains at once what is gained by the study of all Vedas.</p>
<p>यस्य यावांश्च विश्वासः तस्य सिद्धिश्च तादृशी । एतावानिति नैतस्य प्रभावः परिमीयते ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greatness of this Mantra cannot be exactly measured as this much. The realisation will be that much, to one whose faith is that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A person who has supreme faith in this Mantra, will realise the infinitc greatness of this Mantra. Desika says in conclusion, cven the promulgator of this Mantra and the deity of this Mantra, who is by nature omniscient and seer of this Mantra, cannot know fully the greatness of this Mantra, as it is not specified that it is fully knowable by</p>
<p>such and such.</p>

<p>CHAPTER - XXVIII</p>
<p>Dvayadhikara</p>
<p>The Dvaya Mantra illumincs clearly the particular means of spiritual perfection that is prescribed in the middle term of the Mula Mantra, and also the particular object of attainment that is laid out in the third term of the Mula Mantra. This Holy Mantra is described by Desika as a &lsquo;Tantrika Mantra&rsquo; which is expounded in the shruti. &lsquo;सकृदुच्चारः संसारतारणं भवति&rsquo; - This signifies the greatness of this Mantra. The two sentences have been mentioned separately and it is ordained that it should be meditated upon with the Mantra- &lsquo;इदंपूर्णं अदं पूर्णम्&rsquo; - in the middle. In Sri Pancharathra Mahopanishat - in Tantra-Jnana-Pada - in the First Chapter, the meaning of &lsquo;Dvaya Mantra&rsquo; is described as follows:</p>
<p>&lsquo;लक्ष्मीनारायणमयं प्रणवार्थप्रकाशकम् । सत्यज्ञानानन्दरूपं श्रीकरं तं नमाम्यहम् ॥ जीवान्तर्यामिणं देवं सर्वान्तार्यामिणं प्रभुम् । अर्चावतारं सद्विष्णुं मकारं तं नमाम्यहम् ॥</p>
<p>Here, the order of &lsquo;varnas&rsquo; or letters is pointed out. After this, the glory of the &lsquo;Dvaya Mantra&rsquo; is expounded there as follows:</p>
<p>श्रीमन्नारायणस्यैव परस्य परमात्मनः । द्विजानां मुक्तिदं मन्त्रं द्वयम् तत् शुद्धसात्विकम् ॥</p>
<p>मन्त्ररत्नाख्यसंदर्भ पंचविंशति वर्णकम् ॥ पंचविंशति तत्त्वाढ्यं पंचोपनिषदात्मकम् ॥</p>
<p>गायत्र्या वेदविद्यादि अष्टाक्षरमयं तथा ।</p>
<p>The glory of the Dvaya Mantra, as a supreme mantra, is expounded here, thus very clearly.</p>
<p>In the introductory verse to this chapter, the unique significance of Dvaya Mantra, is expounded by Desika -</p>
<p>&lsquo;आकर्णितो वितनुते कृतकृत्यकक्ष्याम्</p>
<p>आमेडितो दिशति यश्च कृतार्थभावम् । प्रत्यूषतां भजति संसृतिकालरात्रेः । पद्मासहाय - शरणागतिमन्त्र एषः&rsquo; ॥</p>
<p>When this celebrated mantra, that is taught by the preceptor, is uttered as addressed to the Paramatman once, it will take him to a state of having done what ought to be done. By the nature of this mantra, this mantra itself causes that satisfaction of having done one&rsquo;s duty, even when the significant meanings of the mantra are not understood; but, this should be uttered once clearly, so that, the Lord becomes aware of it.</p>
<p>When it is repeated after the initial recitation addressed to the Lord, it gives one a feeling of &lsquo;kritartata&rsquo; epiceat that is the state of having atta&rsquo; ed the &lsquo;prayojana&rsquo; of that act. In the first utterance, the means of spiritual perfection is fulfilled, and in the later recitals - as it is &lsquo;Fala: yoran - it will endow one with the feeling of having attained the supreme benefit. This Dvaya Mantra, which is the mantra used for surrender of the self to the Lord, is verily the carly dawn, or the &lsquo;Arunodaya&rsquo; which dispels the dense darkness</p>
<p>Dvayadhikara</p>
<p>311</p>
<p>of the long night of &lsquo;samsara&rsquo; or migration from birth to birth. Unlike any other mantra, there is no need for reciting it again and again; but, it will be fruitful by actualizing complete &lsquo;Prapatti&rsquo; in course of time, even in that life time itself, by the utterance of this once.</p>
<p>Desika points out that this mantra is prescribed in the &lsquo;Kata-Valli&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Agamas&rsquo; particularly in Prasna Samhita and others. This mantra is called by the name &lsquo;Dvaya&rsquo;, because it expounds the two celebrated truths viz., the means (upaya) and the end (upeya). A person, who has distanced himself from ocher &lsquo;upayas&rsquo; than Paramatman, and who has distanced himself likewise from other &lsquo;upeyas&rsquo; or objects of attainment, is fully qualified for this mantra. Some masters describe that this mantra is called &lsquo;dvaya&rsquo;, as it is signifying &lsquo;varana&rsquo; or praying to the Lord for protection, and also &lsquo;samarpana&rsquo; or offering oneself solely to the service of the Lord. The rules that are ordained in respect of other mantras of &lsquo;Prapatti&rsquo; are equally applicable to this mantra also. So, one has to approach a preceptor, and propitiating the preceptor, should get this mantra taught by him. Eminence of this mantra</p>
<p>This '</p>
<p>Mantra-Raja&rsquo; or sovereign of mantras, should be obtained through initiation from an &lsquo;Acharya&rsquo;, who is the most celebrated and respected. Approaching such a preceptor with all humility and devotion and prostrating at his feet, this &lsquo;Mantra-Raja&rsquo; should be obtained from him, just as an indigent person aspiring wealth gains a great treasure. &ldquo;Having gained this mantra, he should surrender unto Me, with this mantra alone. He becomes a &lsquo;kritakritya&rsquo; or one who has donc his duty, the moment he surrenders unto Me&rdquo; - says the Lord. &lsquo;अनेनैव तु मन्त्रेण स्वात्मानं मयि निक्षिपेत् । मयि निक्षिप्तकर्तव्यो कृतकृत्यो भविष्यति&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>Seeking the grace of the preceptor and worshipping him with devotion, is common to all &lsquo;Prapatti&rsquo; mantras, but the unique feature of this mantra is that the mere utterance of this mantra once (Hang R41415) results in salvation.</p>
<p>The statement &lsquo;येन केनापि प्रकारेण द्वयवक्ता त्वम्&rsquo; - by whatsocyer manner one recites this dvaya mantra – points out, how this mantra is distinct from other mantras. It is declared that the recital of the Holy Names of the Lord, knowingly or unknowingly, is going to dispel all sins, in the following verses -</p>
<p>अवशेनापि यन्नाम्नि कीर्तिते सर्वपातकैः । पुमान् विमुच्यते सद्यः सिंहवस्तैः मृगैरिव ॥ नाम्नस्ते यावती शक्तिः पापनिर्हरणे हरे । श्वपचोऽपि नरः कर्तुं क्षमस्तावन्न किलिबम् ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Holy Names of the Lord are uttered even unintentionally, a person will be divested of all sins, even as deer are scared of a lion&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even an out-caste, is not capable of committing sins to such extent, as the Holy Names of Yours are capable of annihilating sins&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While the mere recital of the Holy Names of the Lord is having such eminence, what to say about the eminence of this dvaya-mantra, which fully illumines the redeemer (Sharanya), the surrender unto Him (Sharanagati) and the specific fruits of such a surrender (tatphala-vishesha).</p>

<p>The eminence of the recital of this mantra even once, can be known from the sruties. One should have implicit faith in the shastra, and one should not resort to reasoning in respect of truths that are to be guarded (Rahasyatamartha). It is pointed out in Mahabharata</p>
<p>&lsquo;देवगुह्येषु चान्येषु हेतुर्देवि निरर्थकः । बधिरान्धवदेवात्र वर्तितव्यं हितैषिणा&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is futile to reason out in secret truths and others that are not known to gods also. A person who is interested in his good as well as others should behave like a deaf and blind person in this behalf&rdquo;. Atma Samarpanam is inclusive of Bhara Samarpanam</p>
<p>The offering of the Atman - that is pure - is what is intended in this mantra, as pointed out in the verse:</p>
<p>&lsquo;सर्वोपाधिविनिर्मुक्त क्षेत्रमं ब्रह्मणि न्यसेत्&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Atman who is freed from all limiting adjuncts such as &lsquo;avidya&rsquo; or &lsquo;karma&rsquo; and others, should be placed in &lsquo;Brahman&rsquo;. This is &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; and the object of knowledge. Though it is expressive of &lsquo;svarupa-samarpanam&rsquo;, the offering of the burden of protection &lsquo;bhara-samarpana&rsquo;, is included in it because, without svarupa-samarpanam', there cannot be &lsquo;bhara-samarpanam&rsquo;. It is declared in Vyasa Smriti and others as follows:</p>
<p>&lsquo;निवेदयत स्वात्मानं विष्णावमलतेजसि । तदात्मा तन्मनाश्शान्तः तद्विष्णोरिति मन्त्रतः ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;Offer yourself unto the Lord Vishnu of pure effulgence with the mantra a count: etc&rdquo;. Thadatma&rsquo; mcans being His</p>

<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyarraya Saram</p>
<p>body i.e., being &lsquo;sheshabhuta&rsquo;. Tanmanāh' signifies that he should be attached to Him, who is the sole object of attainment. &lsquo;Shāntah&rsquo; means having no other benefit or &lsquo;prayojana&rsquo;. Thus, this mantra illumines vividly all the three viz., the &lsquo;sharanya&rsquo; or the refuge, the &lsquo;sharanagati&rsquo; or surrender unto Him and the &lsquo;prayojana&rsquo; or object of attainment.</p>
<p>The profound meanings of this mantra are explained in Sharanagati-Gadya by Ramanuja, according to the tradition handed over by the eminent Acharyas. The meaning of &lsquo;Shrimat&rsquo; is taught in the opening passage of the &lsquo;Gadya&rsquo; beginning with ‘भगवन्नारायणाभितमतानुरूप' etc. The portion in the &lsquo;Gadya&rsquo; describing the svarupa, rupa and guna of the Lord as &lsquo;fem44c4-ic. etc., explains the meaning of the term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo;. There is a reference to &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; again, while explaining the term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; for signifying Her role as a &lsquo;purushakara&rsquo; or a mediatrix. &lsquo;3RRRUISE&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Gadya&rsquo;, signifies the particular aspirant pointed out in &lsquo;prapadye&rsquo; of this mantra. The terms ant and &lsquo;rur as well as the verb of this mantra, are explained in the Gadyam by the term</p>
<p>Carnika- Use&rsquo; | After all this, there is a statement in the Gadya as &lsquo;Atra Dvayam&rsquo; which means that the dvaya-mantra is thus explained.</p>
<p>Further, the meaning of &lsquo;Namas&rsquo; signifying the termination of undesirables (anishta-nivritti) - is explained in detail. The prayer for &lsquo;Para-Bhakti&rsquo; and others, signifies the &lsquo;purushartha&rsquo; pointed out by the dative-case. So, it can be understood that all the truths expounded in the &lsquo;Sharanagati Gadya&rsquo; are the profound meanings of this greatDvayadhikara</p>
<p>315</p>
<p>mantra. The meanings of this mantra are expounded by the Alwars such as Nammalwar and others also in their hymns.</p>
<p>The meaning of &lsquo;SHARPIU&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Supreme Reality (Baratattva) that is the one Refuge of all (sarva-sharanya) is signified by this term. The unique characteristic of &lsquo;श्रियःपतित्व&rsquo; and the celebrated name &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo;, which is praised gloriously in the Narayana Anuvaka determine the Paradevaca-svarupa. Narayana characterised by Sri, is the protector. As the goddess &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; is inseparable from Narayana, we have to know Him only along with &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; -</p>
<p>&lsquo;आकारिणस्तु विज्ञानं आकारज्ञानपूर्वकम् । तेनाकारं श्रियं ज्ञात्वा ज्ञातव्यो भगवान् हरिः&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;The knowledge of a qualified object is possible only through the attribute. So, knowing first the &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; who is an &lsquo;Akāra&rsquo; or a &lsquo;visheshana&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Akāri&rsquo; or &lsquo;visheshya&rsquo; - the Lord is to be known&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; is the visheshana&rsquo; in the latter part (uttara-khanda), She is to be known as a &lsquo;visheshana&rsquo; even in the former part of this manthra (purva-khanda). This has been discussed and decided in the section on the examination of the &lsquo;Siddhopaya&rsquo; already. There will not be the eventuality of two &lsquo;upayas&rsquo;, as the only one &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; is qualified by the &lsquo;upaya-visheshanas&rsquo;. The term &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; is explained as having six derivations such as - sited (she is sought); d (she seeks the Lord for the protection of the souls); श्रृणोति (she listens); श्रावयति (she makes the Lord hear); श्रृणाति (she destroys the faults of the आश्रितःs) and श्रीणाति (she fills the world with her virtues). Purushakaratra of Goddess Sri -</p>
<p>She is sought by those who desire to gain spiritual perfection and she is resorting the Lord for saving those who have taken refuge with her. She pleads with the Lord for the protection of the sinners, as the mother arguing on behalf of the erring children. She is by nature the well-wisher of all, and softens the wrath of the Lord, who is by nature a just punishes, and cause His natural compassion to flow towards them to redeem them from &lsquo;samsara&rsquo;. So, here &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; plays the role of a purushakara' on account of her &lsquo;vatsalya&rsquo; natural to a mother.</p>
<p>A meditator or a purushakara is one whom we seek to help us to approach a person from whom we desire to gain some object, by influencing that person by virtue of his influence. In &lsquo;Nikshepa Raksha&rsquo;, Desika expounds the &lsquo;pramanas&rsquo; for the need of a purushakara, as follows:</p>
<p>अर्थस्वभावानुष्ठानलोकदृष्टिगुरूक्तिभिः ।</p>
<p>श्रुत्या स्मृत्या च संसिद्धं घटकार्थावलम्बनम् ॥ &lsquo;Artha-spabhava&rsquo; is as follows:</p>
<p>The Lord, like a father is not easily approachable. He becomes approachable if we approach him through the mother, who is full of affection towards us and who never gets angry on account of her overflowing compassion. As she is very dear' to the Lord, He will never turn down her intervention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anushtana&rsquo; can be known, from the fact that the Lord in His incarnation as Sri Nrisimha, became approachable to the gods like Brahma and others, when they went near Him having Goddess Mahalakshmi before them.</p>
<p>Dvayadhikara</p>
<p>317</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lokadristi&rsquo; can be seen in the instance of the king&rsquo;s pardoning (for the sake of the queen) the attendants in the royal harem, even though they have committed grave offences.</p>
<p>SUL</p>
<p>is the noble expressions of Alwars like Nammalwar and others, as well as Acharyas, who have surrendered to the Lord having the mother Mahalakshmi supporting them. The shrutis such as farfa fawujudkan and others are well known.</p>
<p>Smritis are the utterings of sages like Shounaka and others, that ordain that one should surrender first to the Goddess Sri, for being one&rsquo;s purushakara, when one prays the Lord for the good that cannot be described in words -</p>
<p>वाचः परं प्रार्थयता प्रपद्येन्नियतः श्रियम् ।</p>
<p>The role of a mediatrix or &lsquo;ghatakatva&rsquo; of &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; is thus established according to a number of pramanas, and so, it is appropriate to have &lsquo;Her&rsquo; as our purushakara. She is not only a purushakara but also a &lsquo;siddhopaya-visheshana&rsquo;. This is clearly expounded in the verse -</p>
<p>&lsquo;लक्ष्म्या सह हृषीकेशः देव्या कारुण्यरूपया । रक्षकः सर्वसिद्धान्ते वेदान्तेषु च गीयते&rsquo; ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all siddhantas like mantra, siddhanta and others, and in vedanta, the Lord with Goddess Mahalakshmi, is declared as the protector. For aspirants of spiritual perfection, Goddess &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; annihilates the sins, that are obstacles for the adoption of the means of those that seek refuge with Her, and She will bless them in such a way, that those people will attain all good culminating in the &lsquo;kainkarya&rsquo; to the Lord.</p>
<p>318</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyarraya Saram</p>
<p>The meaning of 4914 in the</p>
<p>The suffix l' has many meanings, but in this context, has the meaning of Nitya-Yoga' or eternal association. It cannot be said that &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; cxists independently, separated from the Lord at any time and that the Lord cxists any time withour &lsquo;Sri&rsquo;. They are ever united together. In the state of &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; as well as in the state of attainment, there is eternal association with &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; to the Lord. This fact of Sri being together with the Lord, enables the offenders to approach boldly the Lord, for protection, as they will be blessed with the purushakara always.</p>
<p>In the state of &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; in the purva-khanda, the particular auspicious qualities that are helpful for secking protection are to be reflected. So, it must be taken that</p>
<p>ft47' is a necessary attribute. In the uttara-khanda, Narayana characterised by every other object (sarva-visishta), is the object of attainment (prapya). The term &lsquo;sf4C&rsquo; is a necessary attribute there also. Meaning of the term Narayana</p>
<p>Though all the meanings that were expounded for this Holy Name in the Mula Mantra are equally applicable here also, it is appropriate to meditate upon such qualities that signify the protectorship of Narayana in the purva-khanda or former part. The qualities of vatsalya, swamitva, sousheelya, soulabhya, sarvajnatva, sarva-shaktitva, sathya sankalpatva, parama-karunikatva, krtajnatva, sthiratva, paripurnatva, parainodaratva and others, are the most prominent qualities that are to be meditated upon the term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; in the former part of this mantra. Vatsalya is a quality that emboldens one to approach the Lord for</p>
<p>Dvayadhikara</p>
<p>319</p>
<p>redemption. This quality of not seeing the faults of an aspirant is most helpful to accept Him for protection. Swamitva or mastery over every other entity, is the particular relationship of &lsquo;Shesha-Sheshi-Bhava&rsquo;, that is taught in the pranava. This will be helpful to an aspirant for gaining confidence when he reflects that the Lord would save him for his own benefit. Sousheelya or the quality of a supreme person mixing with the low freely, will help the aspirant not to go away from the Supreme Lord, thinking of his own inferiority. Soulabhya is the quality that makes the Lord accessible to one and all, inspite of His supreme nature. Sarvajnatva or omniscience, is the quality by which Lord knows everything everywhere, always directly. So, it fills the aspirant with confidence that there is nothing which He does not know, about the good He has to give and the impediments He has to clear in respect of those who take refuge in Him. Sarva-shaktitva or ability to work out even the impossible, is helpful for deciding that the Lord can take even migrating souls like us to His Eternal Abode according to His will. Satya-sankalpatva is having no opposition or obstruction to His will either by Himself or from others. This makes us strongly believe His declaration that He would release one from all sins, when he surrenders unto Him.</p>
<p>Parama-karunikatva or supreme compassion is a desire to dispel the sorrows of others without expecting any benefit for Himself. This makes us know that the Lord would redeem one on account of a mere pretext even when one has committed infinite sins.</p>
<p>Krutajnatva is the quality of not forgetting even a slight favourable action donc to Him, but remembering it as a 1</p>
<p>great benefaction done to Him. This will be filling us with supreme faith that He would not forsake us while He sees cven a trivial pretext in favour of Him.</p>
<p>Sthiratvam is to be steadfast in protecting those who have sought protection from Him.</p>
<p>Paripoornatva is the quality of having attained all objects of desire. This is indicative of the Lord, who does not expect anything other than supreme love towards Him.</p>
<p>Paramodaratva is a supreme quality of feeling that what He has granted is not enough for the devotion of the aspirant, even after granting the devotee everything at His disposal, not taking into account the &lsquo;upaya-laghava&rsquo; or smallness of the aspirant.</p>
<p>Like this, all qualities that are helpful for seeking refuge with the Lord, are to be reflected in this Holy Name.</p>
<p>In the state of realisation, that is pointed out in the latter part of the uttara-khanda, though the Lord is being experienced, being characterised by all auspicious qualities and vibhuthies समस्तगुणविभूतिविशिष्टः' it is to be noted that the prime qualities of &lsquo;sheshitva&rsquo; and &lsquo;nirathishaya-bhogyatva&rsquo; are prominent. So, in the term Narayana' in the uttara khanda, the qualities that are ensuing on account of the essential nature of the Lord and also the auspicious qualities that are related to &ldquo;kainkarya' are to be mainly meditated upon.</p>
<p>The meaning of Sriman Narayana Charanau</p>
<p>These terms are taken as a single compound word by somc masters. They can be taken as three terms separated also. There are usages like &lsquo;Kamala-Nayana Vasudeva Bhava</p>
<p>Dvayadhikara</p>
<p>321</p>
<p>Sharanam&rsquo;, Sriman, Narayana, Swamin', etc. It may be taken as two nominatives of address as &lsquo;Sriman&rsquo; and &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo;, and taking the word &lsquo;tava&rsquo; as understood, &lsquo;charanau&rsquo; is used along with that. It may be noted that the meanings do not change in cither way. This kind of usage is the same in the former part and the latter part of this mantra,</p>
<p>The cerm &lsquo;charanau&rsquo; indicates the eternal, auspicious, non-material form of the Lord. The two factors viz., the most supreme nature of the Lord of Sri and the non-material eternal form of the Lord, are the foremost of the objects to be known in the Dvaya Mantra. This is pointed out in the statement -</p>
<p>&lsquo;नित्यसिद्धे तदाकारे तत्परत्वेन पौष्कर । यस्यास्ति सत्ता हृदये तस्यासौ सन्निधिं व्रजेत् ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord shows Himself to a person whose mind is devoted to these two natures of the Lord; in whose heart the eternally realised auspicious form of the Lord and the knowledge of His utmost supremacy, are present&rdquo;. In the term &lsquo;Sriman Narayan&rsquo;, one should reflect upon the supremacy combined with accessibility of the Lord, and in the term &lsquo;charanau&rsquo; the fact of His possessing an eternal auspicious non-material body (Nitya Vigraha Yoga) is to be reflected.</p>
<p>Even for those people, who have not the knowledge of the auspicious qualities of the Lord, the auspicious divine form may be the object of meditation. As the form itself is more prominent than the auspicious qualities, Bhagavan Ramanuja describes the divine form the Lord, prior to the exposition of His auspicious qualities in his Gadyam. The Divine Form of the Lord is called &lsquo;Shubhashraya&rsquo;. &lsquo;परावरसुखग्राह्यं प्रेमबोधप्रसावकम् । स्वरूपात् स्वामिनो रूपं उपादेयतमं विदुः॥ &lsquo;चित्तालम्बन सौकर्यकृपोत्तम्भकतदिभिः । उपायत्वमिह स्वामिपादयोरनुसंहितम् ॥</p>
<p>The sacred feet of the Lord have the facility of being thought of by the mind and the compassion of the Lord will be aroused by one&rsquo;s devotion to His feet. So here, the fact of being our means of realisation is thought of, in the two feet of the Lord. The Alwars also have concentrated upon the Holy Feet of the Lord, as their means of salvation.</p>
<p>It is said by some that the mention of the term &lsquo;charanau&rsquo; in this Holy Mantra, is unfavourable to the view of the Lord, being characterised by &lsquo;Sri&rsquo;. This is not proper. The term in the dual number, excludes &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; as an &lsquo;upaya&rsquo;, it is argued. But, Desika says that it is not so. The Lord is the one and non-second who is characterised by &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; and other auspicious qualities. The &lsquo;visheshya&rsquo; happens to be the Lord only and the mention of the two feet of the Lord, cannot exclude &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; who is only a &lsquo;visheshana&rsquo; eternally united with Him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;शब्दस्वरसतः प्राप्तम् वैशिष्ट्यं प्रथमं श्रुतम् । विशेष्यचरणद्वित्वं न हि बाधितुमर्हति&rsquo;।</p>
<p>It may be asked in this context, that there is no need for a &lsquo;visheshana&rsquo; for that Almighty to become a means. If He also depends on something, He cannot be called a &lsquo;sarvashakta&rsquo; or omnipotent.</p>
<p>This question may be raised even in respect of Guna Vigraha-Yoga that is ordained by the term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; and</p>
<p>Dvayadhikara</p>
<p>323</p>
<p>the term charanau&rsquo;. If it is further said that they are &lsquo;visheshanas&rsquo; and that they serve particular purposes, and so, they are not opposed to his &lsquo;sarva-shaktirva, the same may be said in respect of &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; also, who is related to Him as His consort. If relying upon the mere term &lsquo;charanau&rsquo;, the association with &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; is taken as indicative (upa-lakshana), then the same has to be said in respect of the association of the auspicious qualities also. In this way, one need not take &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; even as purushakara, as it will be contrary to His sarva shaktitva. If it is pointed out that the Lord, who is an ordainer, and strict dispenser of results according to one&rsquo;s deeds, and so it would not be possible for a transgresser to approach Him straightway, and so the mediation of Goddess Lakshmi is necessary, and that She is permitted by the All Independent Lord to officiate as a mediatrix, then it may be taken in the same way that the Lord becomes a protector being united with His consort Sri Lakshmi by His own independent will. To accept so, will not be contrary to any pramana.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;Sharanam&rsquo; in this Holy Mantra, signifies the means -</p>
<p>भरन्यासबलादेव स्वयत्नविनिवृत्तये । अत्रोपायान्तरस्थाने रक्षको विनिवेशितः ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;By virtue of the surrender of the burden of one&rsquo;s protection and on account of the giving up of one&rsquo;s own effort further, the protector Himself is placed in the place of the other means&rdquo;. Is not the Lord, the means for all who worship Him through various modes of meditation? What is the speciality here? The answer to this question is as follows: A Bhakti-Yogi performs &lsquo;Prapatti&rsquo; as an accessory to his Bhakti-Yoga and then continues his Bhakti Yoga as &lsquo;mokshopaya&rsquo;, and obtains the fruit from the Lord. Here, a prapanna obtains the same fruit by his mere &lsquo;Prapatti&rsquo; without undertaking any further upaya, on account of the natural compassion and other noble qualities of the Lord. So, it amounts to say that the Lord stands in the place of another upaya.</p>
<p>An &lsquo;akinchana&rsquo; or a person - who is utterly helpless - prays to the Lord - &ldquo;without burdening me with the performance of any other means, and bearing all that burden on your own shoulders, you may - out of your compassion - gain me all the benefits that would have been obtained by following that means&rdquo;. This is determined as &lsquo;Atma Nikshepa&rsquo;. This culminates in the realisation of &lsquo;swa nirbharatva&rsquo; or being freed from one&rsquo;s own burden. The meaning of prapadye</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;prapadye&rsquo; signifies the particular kind of knowledge that is required in this context, as the root of this verb signifies knowledge also, though it is meaning action. The firm understanding of the form of &ldquo;The Lord certainly protects us&rdquo; is what is indicated in this verb. The preposition &lsquo;Pra&rsquo; points out the intensity of faith, which is known as &lsquo;maha-vishvasa&rsquo;. This faith originates when one reflects upon the inseparable association of purushakara relationship and the auspicious qualities that are indicated by the term f4c&rsquo; and the term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo;. By this faith, all kinds of doubts that would arise on account of one&rsquo;s profuse sinning and others will become divested. What is required is this kind of firm and unshakable faith alone. This is well known as pointed out in the following, verses:Dvayadhikara</p>
<p>325</p>
<p>&lsquo;व्यवसायाहृते ब्रह्म नासादयति तत्परम् । निस्संशयेषु सर्वेषु नित्यं वसति वै हरिः । ससंशयान् हेतुबलान् नाध्यावसति माधवः&rsquo; ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without &lsquo;maha-vishvasa&rsquo;, one does not attain that Supreme Brahman&rsquo;. &lsquo;That Supreme Hari becomes easily accessible to those who have no doubts. He does not show Himself to those who are full of doubts and who resort to mere logic.&rdquo; If this supreme faith happens to one, at no time will any doubt arise. Though this kind of faith is mild in the beginning, the Lord will make it completed by his compassion. Even &lsquo;manda-vishvasa&rsquo; or mild faith will become &lsquo;maha-vishvasa&rsquo;. When one recounts his supreme faith as &lsquo;T&rsquo; decide this as my spiritual means&rsquo;, the prayer to the Lord for becoming his upaya also, will be fulfilled. Seeking protection also, is included in this prayer for being his means. As a Prapanna is not praying for the means of the form of Bhakti Yoga, as the fruit of his &lsquo;prapatti&rsquo;, what is it that he prays here? Here, what is prayed is that he should accept the burden of one&rsquo;s protection, as the Lord himself grants the desired fruit by substituting himself in the place of any other upaya. The significance of the purva-khanda may be summed up like this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may stand in the place of any other means for me, the utterly helpless, for granting me the particular desired object, I am surrendering the burden of the protection of mine unto you&rdquo;. So, it will be entrusting the burden of one&rsquo;s protection associated with a particular prayer like this. The &lsquo;atma-samarpanam&rsquo; or entrusting the burden of the self also, is the meaning of the term &lsquo;adhyavasaya&rsquo; or supreme faith. The significance of prapatti is chus, surrendering the burden</p>
<p>326</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>of protection along with the accessories to Him. This kind of surrendering of the self is the prime part of prapatti. It is pointed out in the verse below:</p>
<p>&lsquo;अनेनैव तु मन्त्रेण स्वात्मानं मयि निक्षिपेत् । मयि निक्षिप्तकर्तव्यः कृतकृत्यो भविष्यति ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this mantra alone, one should entrust oneself unto me; having fulfilled the duty of surrendering unto me, he will become one who has done what ought to be done&rdquo;. The usage of this verb &lsquo;prapadye&rsquo; in present tense, relates to the time of actual performance of prapatti. What is uttered at the time of actual surrender, happens to be the upaya or means and what all is reflected later on as &lsquo;Hi va att&rsquo; etc., is not included in the upaya. Like this, in the purva-khanda (former part of this supreme mantra) the fact of Paramatman being the protector of all, (sarva-sharanyatva), the essential nature of prapatti (sharanagati svarupa), the accessories of prapatti (parikara) and the particularity of the aspirant qualified for prapatti &lsquo;fecift fat - all these are illumined. By this, the fact of having no other means (ananyopayatva) is realised. The meanings of the uttara-khanda</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; characterised by Goddess &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; shows the characteristics of the Paramatman, that are in accordance with the supreme object of attainment. &lsquo;Swamitva&rsquo; or overlordship, &lsquo;Ananta-Guna-Vibhuti-visishtatva or the fact of being characterised by infinite auspicious qualities and glorics, and &lsquo;niratishaya-bhogyatva&rsquo; or infinitely pleasing nature of the Lord, are prominently to be known in this term. Here, though the object of attainment (prapyam)</p>
<p>Dvayadhikara</p>
<p>327</p>
<p>ze</p>
<p>characterised by the two vibhuties (viz., Leela Vibhuti and Nitya Vibhuti) is signified, the prime object of attainment is the divine couple, who are the &lsquo;sheshins&rsquo; of all, and who are to be served with &lsquo;kainkarya&rsquo; or divine service, and who are the persons to whom the oblation of the form of the atman is offered. This is signified by the term 146 All the great masters and the Alwars have experienced the Paramatman along with &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; in the state of attainment as found in -</p>
<p>&lsquo;वैकुण्ठेतु परे लोके श्रिया सार्धं जगत्पतिः&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>&lsquo;तया सहासीनमनन्तभोगिनि आत्मानुरूपया श्रिया सहासीनम् ॥ and others</p>
<p>Though the term &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; has many significant meanings, here the meaning of &lsquo;service unto the mother&rsquo; (sevyarva) is prominently to be reflected upon. Being associated with such Goddess, who would generate particular kinds of affections for undertaking all kinds of divine services, the Supreme Paramatman is signified by the term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; for attainment of perfect experience of the Lord, along with all auspicious qualities and vibhuties.</p>
<p>The dative case in the term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo;, signifies &lsquo;kainkarya&rsquo; or divine service with the realisation of eternal subservience to the Lord. It does not signify only argerfor existence for His sake only. Through this realisation, all the services that are done to Him are signified by the dative case here. This is described as - ForGHET T rafa:&rsquo; i.c. devoting wholly to the subservience of the Lord with full realisation of one&rsquo;s eternal nature of &lsquo;seshatva&rsquo;. Here, as a prayer is offered to the Lord for attainment of this desire, a verb &lsquo;bhaveyam&rsquo; is to be understood. The desired object (ishta-prapoi) is first prayed and for the fulfilment of that, by the term &lsquo;namas&rsquo; the destruction of all undesirables (sarva anishta-nivritti) is prayed.</p>
<p>Even for this term &ldquo;Namah&rsquo;, a verb &lsquo;syam&rsquo; should be taken as understood. It will yield the meaning 7 24 RITA&rsquo; 544 RIC&rsquo; i.e., may not anything be attained by me. By this term Namah' not only all obstructions to the rcalisation of Paramatman - such as ignorance, karma, karmavasana, ruchi and prakriti-sambandha (association with matter) - are desired to be terminated, but in addition to it, independent doership and independent enjoyership -</p>
<p>Faretta orai, Fareft terra' doership for one&rsquo;s own benefit and enjoyership for one&rsquo;s own benefit - Falefantera Fareful pra - are also desired to be totally annihilated. As the aspirant realises that these are not traced in the service to the Lord, in the state of liberation, here a prayer is made for attainment of such service.</p>
<p>The fact of entrusting fully the burden of protection to the Lord and the state of being care free and free from the burden, is signified by the term &lsquo;TH:&rsquo;. This is mentioned as &lsquo;Nyrapekshya&rsquo;. ( 7) As all burdens of the sentient principles are entrusted to the care of Paramatman, the state of &lsquo;Nyrapekshya&rsquo; i.e., wanting of nothingness is signified by Namas' -</p>
<p>&lsquo;परमात्मनि नाराणां सर्वभारसमर्पणात् । संजातं नैरपेक्ष्यं तु नम इत्युच्चते बुधैः&rsquo; ॥</p>
<p>This &lsquo;Nyrapekshya&rsquo;, or absence of wanting something, is going to ensure the &lsquo;Nirbharatva&rsquo; or having no</p>
<p>Dvayadhikari</p>
<p>329</p>
<p>responsibility in one&rsquo;s own protection. In offering the oblation to the gods, it is offered with the statement STER4 744' &ldquo;This oblation is for God Indra; it is never more related to me&rdquo;. Likewise, when the burden of protection is offered to the Lord, it is offered with the statement &lsquo;376 ft Rrupy&rsquo; &ldquo;I am offered unto Narayana for his own purpose', and afterwards, it is appropriate to say</p>
<p>44'.</p>
<p>According to this interpretation, the purva-khanda signifies the five accessories of Prapatti, and the uttara khanda or the later part, signifies the main act of offering i.e., 37* ufauigen&rsquo;Here, this signifies as mentioned in the statements, C HEAT 3d &lsquo;that which is offered to be protected by you&rdquo;, ale fa ' &ldquo;I belong to thee alone to be protected by you&rsquo;. These statements signify that the burden of his protection as well as the fruit of protection belong to Him alone.</p>
<p>The terms of the Dvayamantra, illumine the following truths by virtue of the meanings of those terms. They are as follows:</p>
<p>The fact of having &lsquo;Purushakara&rsquo; (by the term &lsquo;Sri&rsquo;), the nityatva of Purushakara (by the suffix 460), the fact of &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; being characterised by &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; (34R4 214), the fact of the protector being characterised by all auspicious qualities (the meaning of the term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo;), the particular inseparable relationship between the protector and the souls (the meaning of 374-), the fact of having an auspicious divine form and the particular aspect where a devotee should take refuge (au paaief), the face of the feet of the Lord being the &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; (the meaning of pr44), the particular way of choosing Him as the &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; (the meaning of €), the accessories for that such as Maha Vishvasa' and others, the utter helplessness of the aspirant (suggested by the usage of the term in First Person viz., 79€), the fact of the object of attainment being characterised by Goddess Sri (the meaning of sted in the uttara-khanda), the fact of attaining Paramatman characterised by all auspicious gunas and vibhuties (the meaning of the term Narayana') the fact of signifying the supreme, to whom the divine service is to be offered (the meaning of the dative case 314), and praying for such divine service and attaining the same.</p>
<p>The termination of all undesirables obstructing such eternal service (the meaning of &lsquo;Namas&rsquo;) and likewise, the fact of this attainment being eternal and the fact of attaining docrship and enjoyership dependent upon the Lord and for the sake of the Lord alone - thus, all these truths are illumined by the two parts of the Dvayamantra.</p>
<p>According to our ancient masters, this Dvayamantra is prominently signifying the performance of surrender, the mcans for attainment of the &lsquo;phala&rsquo; of etemal divine service unto the Lord. Though, according to 91864 or the order of the terms, the &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; is first mentioned in the purva-khanda and the famigoarra' or the sentence describing the fruit is found later, it is pointed out by the ancient masters that, according to &lsquo;3721 ' or the sequence of meanings, the meanings of the uttara-khanda are to be reflected earlier. A person undertakes some means only after deciding the</p>
<p>Dvayadhikara</p>
<p>331</p>
<p>purusharta or the object of attainment first. This performance of Prapatti becomes possible only when he cherishes the supreme phala or fruit that is mentioned there. This Dvayamantra expounds prominently the उपायानुष्ठान ।</p>
<p>The purva-khanda and the terms in the dative case and the term &lsquo;namah&rsquo;, signify three separate sentences; but yet, it is being expounded as a single sentence, giving prominence to the performance of the &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; – Prapatti.</p>
<p>Desika gives the essence of this mantra in one maha vakya as follows:</p>
<p>For attaining &lsquo;Paripurna Kainkarya&rsquo; or total loving service, overcoming all kinds of obstructions for the attainment of all kinds of service appropriate to all states, all times and all places, which are according to one&rsquo;s essential nature, at the feet of Sriman Narayana, the overlord of all entities, who is infinitely enjoyable on account of His most auspicious qualities, who is inseparably associated with Goddess Sri, I am offering the burden of the protection of myself, along with the five accessories of surrender, being utterly helpless, so that there should be no responsibility in the burden of the protection of myself.</p>
<p>Desika declares in the conclusion of this section that these unique truths were gained from the instruction of great masters of yore</p>
<p>&lsquo;वैराग्यविजितस्वान्तः प्रपतिविजितेश्वरैः ।</p>
<p>अनुक्रोशैकविजितैः इत्युपादेशि देशिकैः&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;On account of their unique dispassion, they conquered the Lord by virtue of their surrender unto His feet; but, they were conquered by their compassion, and on account</p>
<p>unto His feet; but of this, our masters taught these truths to the worthy disciples&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Desika points out in this verse that these truths were all obtained on account of &lsquo;सत्संप्रदायसिद्ध सदाचार्योपदेश&rsquo; or the instructions obtained from noble masters who were established according to the continuous tradition. He analyses the Dvayamantra in different ways as follows:</p>
<p>When the words are separated from one another it constitutes eight words as -</p>
<p>श्रीमन्, नारायण, चरणौ, शरणं, प्रपद्ये श्रीमते, नारायणाय, नमः ।</p>
<p>When words are compounded, it will be a mantra of six words -</p>
<p>श्रीमन्नारायणचरणै, शरणं, प्रपद्ये</p>
<p>श्रीमते, नारायणाय, नमः and there are five terms in different cases and one verb. &lsquo;Prapadye&rsquo; is the verb and other words are in different cases.</p>
<p>The glory of Dvayamantra is expounded in the following verse:</p>
<p>‘एकं द्वयं त्र्यवयवम् सुखलभ्यतुर्थं व्यक्तार्थपञ्चकं उपात्तषडङ्ग योगम् । सप्तार्णवीमहिमवद्विवृताष्टवणं । रङ्गे सतामिह रसं नवमं प्रसूते &lsquo;1.</p>
<p>The Dvayamantra is of one sentence, and it is called by the name &lsquo;Dvaya&rsquo;. It has got three subsidiary sentences. By</p>
<p>1FM</p>
<p>Dvayadhikara</p>
<p>333</p>
<p>uttering once, the fourth &lsquo;purusharta&rsquo; viz. Moksha is easily obtained. It is generating the knowledge of the five truths and so, greatly celebrated, and through the fulfillment of Shadanga Yoga&rsquo;, it is a means of &lsquo;Moksha&rsquo; and its greatness is infinite, just like the vastness of seven great oceans taken together, and it is the explanation of the &lsquo;Ashtakshara Mantra&rsquo;. It is causing fre for those who are dwelling in Sri Ranga or who have surrendered unto Sri Ranganatha.</p>
<p>&lsquo;न वेदान्तात् शास्त्रं न मधुमथनादेवमधिकं न तद्भक्तातीर्थं न तदभिमतात्सत्विकपदम् । न सत्वादारोग्यं न बुधभजनात् बोधजनकं न मुक्तेः सौरव्यं न द्वयवचनतः क्षेमकरणम् ' ।</p>
<p>There is no shastra more celebrated than Vedanta; there is no deity, greater than Sriman Narayana, the destroyer of the demon Madhu. There is no one more purifying than the devotee of that Narayana; there is no dwelling place greater than the one that is desired by the devotee of the Lord; there is nothing greater than &lsquo;satvic food&rsquo; that generates health; there is nothing greater than taking refuge in an Acharya (AGER) who causes tattva - jnanam; there is no happiness greater than &lsquo;moksha&rsquo; or liberation; there is nothing more celebrated than the Dvayamantra that causes &lsquo;moksha&rsquo;.:</p>
<p>Thus, Desika has expounded the glorious meanings of this Great Mantra.</p>
<h2 id="२९-चरमशलकधकर">२९ चरमश्लोकाधिकारः</h2>
<p>335</p>
<p>CHAPTER - XXIX</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>The eminent Charama-Sloka is taught directly to Arjuna by Lord Sri Krishna himself. This verse ordains the performance of self-surrender, the glory of which is expounded by the Mulamantra and the Dvayamantra. Desika traces the circumstances that led to the instruction of this great mantra.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Mahabharata War, Arjuna developed dejection, despondency and was overcome with feelings of compassion towards those, who were not worthy of it. He feared that he would commit grave sin by killing those who stood in battle array against him. He mistook &lsquo;dharma&rsquo; for &lsquo;adharma&rsquo;. Not knowing the right path of action, he surrendered unto the Supreme Paramatman, his charioteer, Sri Krishna, and begged of him to show him the right path by following which he could attain ultimate good.</p>
<p>Then, the most compassionate Lord taught him first of all the nature of the jivatman, which is different and distinct from the body and others, and which is solely subservient to Paramatman. He enlightened him upon the nature of the ultimate object of life and the paths of Karamayoga and Jnanayoga that are accessories to the main path of liberation viz. Bhaktiyoga. Listening to all these, Arjuna was overcome with grief on account of his utter inability to practis Bhaktiyoga and the Lord taught him this eminent path of liberation viz. surrender at the feet of the Lord, which did not require any other accessory than Anukulya Sankalpa, Pratikulya Varjanam, Maha Vishvasa, Karpanya and prayer for protection, and which was an easier means to be performed only once and by which one could attain all objects of life.</p>
<p>Finding him overcome with grief, being unable to practise Bhaktiyoga, the Lord out of compassion taught him this noble path of total surrender unto the Lord as follows:</p>
<p>&lsquo;सर्वधर्मान् परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज ।</p>
<p>अहं त्वा सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुचः&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abandoning desire in all spiritual means that are not possible of being practised, seek refuge with me alone; I shall redeem you from all sins; do not grieve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This glorious truth which was taught to Arjuna was the final teaching of the Lord, and it is in fact the reiteration of the truths taught in the Upanishads. Desika, the celebrated author of this eminent work, declares in the very beginning that the essential meanings of this verse directly taught by the Lord, would be explained according to the unbroken tradition - received from the illustrious line of Acharyas. This verse has profound meanings and has far reaching implications.</p>
<p>The first half of this verse is &lsquo;upaya vidhayaka&rsquo; or ordaining the means of attainment of spiritual perfection. The latter half mentions the fruit of such performance and is dependent upon the injunction given in the first half. So, this verse is declared as &lsquo;upaya vidhana pradhana&rsquo; or prescribing the means primarily.</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;dharma&rsquo; is a means of the attainment of the object of life, that is to be known according to the shastras.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>337</p>
<p>The word in plural as &lsquo;dharmān&rsquo; signifies that such means are many. The term &lsquo;sarva&rsquo; suggests those &lsquo;dharmas&rsquo; with all their accessories. When the term &lsquo;sarva&rsquo; is considered as related to its counter part &lsquo;eka&rsquo; here, it means that the totality of all means of attainment of liberation. The meaning according to this context is as follows:</p>
<p>All kinds of &lsquo;mokshopayas&rsquo; that are enjoined by shastras along with their respective accessories, are signified by the term &lsquo;sarva dharman&rsquo;. Here, the various types of upasanas prescribed by the Upanishads such as Dahara Vidya, Purusha Vidya, Vaishvanara Vidya and others, are intended by the term &lsquo;sarva-dharman&rsquo;. But, this term does not exclude the wisdom, of &lsquo;Purushothamatva&rsquo; jnanam or &lsquo;Avatara-Rahasya&rsquo; jnanam and such things that are inevitable for practise of any means of liberation or mokshopaya.</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;parityajya&rsquo; signifies &lsquo;tyaga&rsquo;. As the Lord saw his helplessness to practise any other means, and as He taught this means to Arjuna here, &lsquo;tyaga&rsquo; means giving up desire to undertake any other means on account of his utter inability (upayantara-nairashyam). This &lsquo;tyaga&rsquo; or abandonment is giving up of any hope to practise other means. The preposition &lsquo;pari&rsquo; signifies this rue or despair on account of his unworthiness for all time to come in ali places. When he realises his utter inability to follow other means at all times, and in all places, he will give up totally his inclination towards all those means at all times. He realises that he cannot even practise them a little according to his ability; so, he will give up his ambition or desire to undertake the means that are ever impossible for him to practise.</p>
<p>This phrase - &lsquo;sarva dharman parityajya&rsquo; - signifies the</p>
<p>338</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyataya Saram</p>
<p>full competence of the aspirant for adopting the means of surrender. This is just like the statement -</p>
<p>अनित्यमसुखं लोकं इमं प्राप्य भजस्व माम् । In this statement prapya&rsquo; is not a vidhi or commandment; but, only a restatement of the form of &lsquo;प्राप्यवर्तमानः त्वम्&rsquo; that means &lsquo;you who have come upon this world&rsquo;. Similarly, the term &lsquo;parityajya&rsquo; means you fee: 14.&rsquo; -' you, who are here, having no hope of practising any other means'. So, &lsquo;parityajya&rsquo; does not imply abandonment of dharmas, as an accessory to Prapatti. If &lsquo;parityajyam&rsquo; is taken as a vidhi or commandment, then it should be understood that it is prescribing tug' or utter helplessness as an accessory to prapatti. Then it will signify that all dharmas or other mokshopayas are beyond his ability. So this interpretation is also feasible. If &lsquo;parityajya&rsquo; is taken as a &lsquo;vidhi&rsquo; or &lsquo;commandment&rsquo;, it is appropriate to say that for the sake of Prapatti you need not practise any dharma, as Prapatti is not in need of anything other than its accessories.</p>
<p>If it is mentioned that the abandonment of all dharmas like Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga, is to be done in their essential nature, as an accessory to Prapatti, then Prapatti will not be possible of being done by all, as it would apply to only those who are competent to practise Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga. Tyaga can be ordained only in respect of one who is competent for it. As the masters of yore and the Alwars have expounded that Prapatti is applicable to one and all that are utterly helpless, this kind of abandonment of Karmayoga and others will not become compatible. In that case, the injunction &lsquo;Vraja&rsquo; also will become incompatible.</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>339</p>
<p>It cannot be said that a difficult path is first prescribed and later on negated for making one adopt an easier path. By realising success in an easier path, one will undertake a difficult path but not vice versa. It cannot be said that though the savants of the past were Prapannas, they adopted upasanas for loka-sangraha. There is no authority anywhere to support this view; even if it is admitted like that, he would be committing sin and would be giving a wrong lead by practising something which is opposed to his adhikara for the sake of loka-sangraha. If there are two paths admitted by the shastras, open to one, who is qualified for them, practising one of them which is possible of being followed by the common people, would be loka sangraha. So, it cannot be said that upasanas were undertaken for loka sangraha.</p>
<p>The interpretation that the abandonment of all duties for attainment of worldly benefits (Pravritti-roopa Dharma) is intended here by &lsquo;parityajya&rsquo;, &lsquo;Nivritti-roopa Dharama&rsquo; or Dharmas that are of the form of renunciations are not activities for one&rsquo;s own protection (swarakshanartha swavyapara), is also not sound because, even such renunciations are also for one&rsquo;s own protection. It cannot be asked on the strength of this command &ldquo;parityajya', whether the meaning of &lsquo;parityajya&rsquo; implies the abandonment of all dharmas such as the pravritti and nivritti dharmas, because in that case, all kinds of divine services rendered with great care and all kinds of &lsquo;apachara-parihara&rsquo; (avoiding all kinds of offences) by the savants of the past and the present would become performance of actions opposed to shastras. It cannot be said that those people, who promulgated the traditions of prapasti and who are ever compassionate, were deluded. It is sometime asked that there will be no contradiction if all dharmas are abandoned in their essential nature at the time of surrender, as abandonment of sarva-dharmas lifelong may be opposed to the shastras. Desika points out that this would result in the abandonment of all dharmas that are &lsquo;sambhavita&rsquo; or probable at that time such as living in a holy place or having a tuft or wearing the &lsquo;pundras&rsquo; and others. So, Desika points out that the meaning of &lsquo;parityajya&rsquo; signifies not to resort to any dharma for the sake of prapatti, as an accessory, as prapatti docs not require any accessory like karma and others.</p>
<p>If the meaning of &lsquo;tyaga&rsquo; is ordained for &lsquo;parityajya&rsquo;, it may be taken as those people who are incapable of practising other means and those, though capable of other means but who cannot wait for a long time for getting moksha, - are qualified for parapatti. Desika points out that the ancients did not argue whether or not &lsquo;sarva-dharma-svarupa-tyaga was accessory to prapatti, but they sought to know by which words of the &lsquo;charama-shloka&rsquo; the competency of &lsquo;akinchanya&rsquo; is pointed out and by which terms the &lsquo;nyrapeksha&rsquo; or non requirement of any other thing for prapatti, is signified.</p>
<p>Some masters expounded that the term &lsquo;eka&rsquo; signified that this &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; did not require any other thing and some others came to an understanding that the &lsquo;äkinchanya&rsquo; or the utter helplessness was signified on account of the prescription of this easy means.</p>
<p>If it is asked how there is difference amongst people who are qualified for prapatti as pointed out in the verse –</p>
<p>इदं शरणमज्ञानां इदमेव विजानताम् । इदं तितीर्षतां पारं इदमानन्त्यमिच्छताम् ॥</p>
<p>rse</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>341</p>
<p>Desika points out that there is no such difference as doubted in this verse. He explains this verse as follows:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Vijanatham&rsquo; signifies having knowledge regarding upasanas or about the auspicious qualities of the protector that are helpful for prapatti. This does not signify knowledge of all things that are not required for prapatti. Though a person has this kind of relevant knowledge, if he is not capable of following other means, he will become an &lsquo;akinchana&rsquo;, qualified for prapatti. If it is asked, even if he has the ability, it may be asked whether he should not give up all activities, realising the power of the redeemer? The answer to this question is that such behaviour is an example for his activity after prapatti. If not, all the shastras that prescribe the performance of spiritual discipline, become futile. Even in case he has the knowledge of the other means, even if he has the ability to practise such means, he may decide that prapatti alone is appropriate for him who desires to gain the fruit without delay and he becomes a qualified aspirant for prapatti. This is suggested by &lsquo;idam tithirshathampaaram&rsquo; - this means that those who are feeling the urgency to get rid of all 31AE or undesirables as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anantyamichhatam&rsquo; signifies that one cannot bear oneself without obtaining the experience of the Supreme fully, which is in accordance with his essential nature. This fact of getting rid of the undesirable and attaining the bliss of divine communion is signified by the phrase</p>
<p>FayTh at&rsquo; | Here, Bhakti' means Supreme Love towards the Lord, and it does not signify Bhaktiyoga. The &lsquo;bhooma&rsquo; or plentitude of this bhakti is a particular state, attaining which one cannot live without attaining that divine experience cven for a moment. For some people, this kind of great devotion happens on account of the infinite grace of the Lord, caused on account of their &lsquo;sukruta&rsquo;. So, the meaning of that verse, can be summarised as below:</p>
<p>Those people who are ignorant of the procedure in other &lsquo;upayas&rsquo;, those people who have a general knowledge about this particular means of prapatti, those people who have the knowledge of different means such as &lsquo;upasanas&rsquo; as well as this means of prapatti, but who have no ability to practise other &lsquo;upayas&rsquo;, and those who have both these viz., knowledge and ability, but yet unable to bear themselves, if there is delay in attainment - all these people are qualified for self-surrender or praparti.</p>
<p>Desike concludes after discussing all aspects that &lsquo;upasanas&rsquo; and &lsquo;prapadana&rsquo; are both valid means and meant for capable and incapable (shakra and ashakra) aspirants. Desika states that the shastras are purposeful in respect of both these kinds of adhikarins:</p>
<p>&lsquo;अशक्यातिकृच्छ्रेषु दुराशादायशालिनः ।</p>
<p>कस्यचित् बुद्धिदौर्बल्यात् लघुत्यागस्य कारणम् ।। तत्र प्रपत्त्यनर्हाणां अन्यदित्यपि युज्यते । व्यासादिषु तु नैवेषा नीतिः संशयपातिषु&rsquo; ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;One who is incapable of practising other means of liberation (i.e. upasanas) but who has a strong &lsquo;durāsha&rsquo; namely that there is no means other than Bhaktiyoga and that he would win &lsquo;mukti&rsquo; only through Bhaktiyoga, in spite of good advice by well-wishers, will give up the &lsquo;laghu upaya&rsquo; i.e. prapatti, on account of his &lsquo;buddhi-dourbalyam&rsquo;</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>343</p>
<p>or want of knowledge and faith. This lack of faith becomes the cause of abandonment of prapatti. The cause of not adopting prapatti is, therefore, &lsquo;vishvasamándyam&rsquo; or want of faith and not competency for Bhaktiyoga. In respect of those, who are not fit for prapatti, on account of &lsquo;vishvasamāndyam&rsquo; or lukewarm faith, other means such as nama-samkirtana and others are appropriate. But, in respect of Vyasa and others that are capable of dispelling the doubts of others, it is not appropriate to say that they did not follow prapatti on account of vishvasamândya. Thus, both these paths - viz. Upasana and Prapatti – are meant for two different types of adhikarins.</p>
<p>If it is asked whether the performance of the varna ashrama-dharmas is futile in respect of a prapanna, as they are not accessories to prapatti, Desika answers that it is not so. The upasaka performs them as accessories to upasana, but a prapanna performs them not as an accessory but as &lsquo;svayam-prayojana&rsquo; i.e. as loving service to the Divine.</p>
<p>If it is further asked whether kamya-karmas also could be done like this, Desika answers that there is no offence if kamya-karmas are not undertaken as they are opposed to his essential nature. He further clarifies that there is no &lsquo;virodha or fault, if such kamya-karmas are undertaken for &lsquo;Bhagavat bhagavata-samrudyartham&rsquo; i.e. for the furtherance and</p>
<p>pleasure of the Lord and the devotees of the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus, Desika has established that abandonment of the ordained duties in their essential nature (svarupa-tyaga) is not proper.</p>
<p>If sarvadharma svarupa tyaga is not ordained here, why not we take it to signify that &lsquo;upayatva-buddhi-tyaga&rsquo; is ordained here, by the term &lsquo;parityajya&rsquo;? Is not Gita teaching. as follows:</p>
<p>&lsquo;एतान्यपि च कर्माणि संगं त्यक्त्वा फलानि च । कर्तव्यानीति मे पार्थ निश्चितं मतमुत्तमम् ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;These acts too must be performed without attachment and desire in fruit. This is my considered supreme view&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The answer to this doubt is as follows:</p>
<p>It is proper to ordain &lsquo;upayatva-buddhi-tyaga&rsquo; in the duties that are done after prapatti. Then, they will be of the form of &lsquo;phala&rsquo;. If these dharmas are to be performed without &lsquo;upayatva-buddhi&rsquo;, then they will necessarily become accessories of prapatti. This will be opposed to the nature of prapatti, which has no accessory other than &lsquo;anukulya sankalpa&rsquo; and others. Then prapatti ceases to be fit for an &lsquo;akinchana&rsquo;. This question does not at all arise as &lsquo;sarva dharma-svarupa-tyaga&rsquo; is never ordained here</p>
<p>&lsquo;अतः स्वरूपत्यागोक्तौ कैंकर्यस्यापचारता । उपायत्वमतित्यागे तत्स्वरूपांगता भवेत् ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;As elaborated above, if the view of &lsquo;svarupa-tyaga&rsquo; is adopted, then the &lsquo;kainkarya&rsquo; that is done will become a fault as it will result in doing something which is ordained to be abandoned. In the event of giving up &lsquo;upayatva-buddhi&rsquo;, then such dharmas characterised by &lsquo;buddhi-tyaga&rsquo;, become accessories to prapatti&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So, it is concluded that the view that the &lsquo;savrupa-tyaga&rsquo; of all dharmas is ordained as an accessory to prapatti and the view that &lsquo;upayatva-buddhi-tyaga&rsquo; is ordained, are opposed to all the shastras that ordain that prapatti does not</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>345</p>
<p>depend upon anything, and to the traditions of the ancient Acharyas, and also to the practises of celebrated masters.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is asked by some people that when a person has surrendered totally at the feet of the Lord, he is to abide by his knowledge of his essential nature, and that he is not subordinated to shastras. This also is not reasonable; because he has to know the nature of his svarupa only through the shastras and he cannot determine that this purushartha and this means are agreeable to this essential nature of jivatman of vice-versa without the shastras. There is no way of knowing the purushartha or the upaya that is agreeable to him independent of the shastras. He can generally know through sheshatva and others that he should behave agreeably to the Lord; but, he cannot know what &lsquo;kainkarya&rsquo; done in what way would please the Lord or otherwise, directly before he is liberated from &lsquo;samsara&rsquo;. The svarupa jnanam cannot determine the types of services to the divine and the objects to be offered to the Lord. In this respect, there is no way other than the dictates of the shastras to know the righe types of services and the right types of articles of worship. Therefore, till one is liberated from &lsquo;samsara&rsquo;, he is bound by the dictates of the shastra.</p>
<p>Sri Yamuna has mentioned in this Girartha Sangraha that a bhakta should practise all his ordained duties devoting them all to the Supreme Lord with great love and that he should surrender them all to the Lord, and that he should not have an idea of &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; in thosc. When this is applied to a prapanna, it is sometimes doubted whether it would not lead to worship of other dcities and thereby disturbing his &lsquo;paramaikantitva&rsquo;? It is here mentioned by masters that a Bhaktiyogin as well as a prapanna arc observing those duties as divine service to the Lord and for the sake of the pleasure of the Lord and so, it will not in anyway harm his &lsquo;ananya upayatva&rsquo; or the fact of having Lord alone as his &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; and &lsquo;ananya-prayojanata&rsquo; or having no other goal other than attainment of godhead. The Lord alone assumes the role of the other &lsquo;upayas&rsquo; and grants him the desired benefits. The performance of the ordained duties of one&rsquo;s own station in life does not disturb his &lsquo;ckanthatva&rsquo;. The Lord, who is the innerself of all deities is worshipped through the worship of gods like Indra, Varuna and others that are associated with those varna-ashrama-dharma, and therefore, there is no disturbance in &lsquo;paramaikantitva&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The ancient masters have observed these ordained duties and have taught that one should not give up these dharmas.</p>
<p>Therefore, performing divine service along with the performance of the varna-ashrama-dharmas, does not contradict one&rsquo;s &lsquo;paramaikantitva&rsquo;. The meaning of &lsquo;माम् ' and &lsquo;अहम्&rsquo;</p>
<p>These two terms of the Charamshloka are very significant as they expound the quality of &lsquo;soulabhya&rsquo; or accessibility and &lsquo;swatantrya&rsquo; or supremacy of the Supreme Paramatman. In the Bhagavadgita, the Lord himself expounds the essential nature of his incarnation as follows:</p>
<p>अवतारस्य सत्यत्वं अजहत्स्वस्वभावता । शुद्धसत्वमयत्वं च स्वेच्छामात्र निदानता ।। धर्मग्लानौ समुदयः साधुसंरक्षणार्थता । इति जन्मरहस्यं यो वेत्ति नास्य पुनर्भवः ।।</p>
<p>ID:</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>347</p>
<p>2CC</p>
<p>&ldquo;The incarnation of the Lord is real. He is ever in his own essential nature; His body is of the pure satva; His will alone is the cause of his incarnation; He is incarnating when dharma fades; the purpose of incarnation is the protection of the virtuous. He who knows this secret of divine incarnation will never more be born here&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The knowledge of divine incarnation is an essential accessory to Bhaktiyoga; but, for a prapanna, this knowledge of the nature of incarnation of the Lord, will show vividly his accessibility. The Lord is characterised by both accessibility and supremacy. He is the one refuge of all humanity being easily accessible and He is the Supreme Object of attainment. He is awaiting for an opportunity to save erring humanity. These two terms signify this fact of the Lord&rsquo;s accessibility. He is showing Himself before all and exhorting man to choose Him. This is suggested by the term</p>
<p>HHH&rsquo;. The term &lsquo;364&rsquo; shows the state of the Lord, eagerly waiting to accept one who chooses Him. So, these two words point out the &lsquo;siddhopaya&rsquo; and the term &lsquo;ekam&rsquo; combined with TA&rsquo; signifies that He does not expect anything other than &lsquo;rakshapekshapurvakabharanyasa&rsquo; or entrusting the protection of one&rsquo;s burden preceded with a prayer for protection.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;sadhyopaya&rsquo; or means that is to be adopted for gaining the &lsquo;siddhopaya&rsquo;, is pointed out by the term &lsquo;sharanam vraja&rsquo;. From this, it is clear that Prapatti is a means of awakening the grace of the protector and happens to be a means for liberation just like Bahktiyoga. The Lord, who becomes pleased with this kind of surrender, happens to be the direct means for moksha. For this means of Prapatti, what one has to know particularly is &lsquo;nirapeksha-upayatva&rsquo; or a means that does not require any other thing. What all is required is expressed in the terms HT&rsquo; and &lsquo;T ' This term HT4 has all the meanings that have been signified in the Mulamantra and Dvaya, such as &lsquo;sarva-rakshakatva&rsquo; or the fact of redeeming all; &lsquo;sarva-sheshitva&rsquo; or the fact of having every other thing subservient to Him; &lsquo;sriyahpatitva&rsquo; or the fact of being the Lord of Goddess Mahalakshmi and &lsquo;Narayanarva&rsquo; or the fact of being the one goal of all living beings. All qualities that are suggested by &lsquo;paratva&rsquo; and &lsquo;soulabhya&rsquo; are cxplicitly expounded by this term, such as &lsquo;sarvajnatva&rsquo; omniscience, &lsquo;sarva-shaktitva&rsquo; omnipotence, &lsquo;paramakarunikatva&rsquo; supreme compassion, &lsquo;soushilya&rsquo; the quality of uniting even with the low and &lsquo;vatsalya&rsquo; the quality of not seeing the defects of His devotees. The auspicious divine form of the Lord that is signified by the term &lsquo;charanau&rsquo; in the Dvaya-mantra&rsquo;, which divine form is indicating His supremacy and accessibility, is also signified by the term &lsquo;माम्&rsquo;.</p>
<p>On account of the four qualities of &lsquo;vatsalya&rsquo;, &lsquo;swamitva&rsquo;, &lsquo;soushilya&rsquo; and &lsquo;soulabhya&rsquo; of the Lord, the Lord was very considerate to Arjuna, who was overcome by compassion towards the unworthy, and carried out his wishes such as halting the chariot in the midst of the two armies and showing his &lsquo;Visvarupa&rsquo; and showing again his original form. These four qualities of the Lord are foremost in protecting those that seek refuge in Him. Among the three qualities of &lsquo;Jnana&rsquo;, &lsquo;Shakti&rsquo; and &lsquo;Karunya&rsquo;, the first two are common for nigraha and anugraha, but karunya is unique for redemption.</p>
<p>Thus, the Lord is signifying Himself, who is characterised by all these qualities necessary for protection</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>349</p>
<p>CA</p>
<p>and who is showing Himself to all, by the term &lsquo;ATA&rsquo;. &lsquo;Ekam&rsquo; qualifying &lsquo;ATH&rsquo; points out that the object of attainment (prapya) is verily the means of attainment (prapaka). Thus, the &lsquo;upaya-phalaikya&rsquo; is pointed out by this term.</p>
<p>This means is adopted by one as dictated by the shastra and the aspirant may consider himself also, equally along with the redeeme, as a means or &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; and this kind of &lsquo;upayadvitva&rsquo; is negated by the term the</p>
<p>It is taught by the masters that the term ct&rsquo; is used to point out that one should not count the sadhyopaya or prapatti, as an equal means along with the siddhopaya. Though the means of prapatti is ordained just like Bhaktiyoga for awakening the grace of the Lord, the Lord alone characterised by the qualities of natural ability and compassion, is the main means of attainment. It is not proper, therefore, to think that Prapatti, caused by Him, is also a means equal to Him. This is the meaning of the term</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>The sadhyopaya is thus only a pretext and not the prime means; but, taking this much into account, it should not be said that Prapatti is - H H , fatyraufatufet 4124, अनिवारणमात्रम्, अनुमतिमात्रम्, अचिव्यावृत्तिमात्रम्, चैतन्यकृत्यम्, चित्तसमाधानम्, अधिकारिविशेषणम् , because, all these views are opposed to the commandment शरणं व्रज'.</p>
<p>If &lsquo;sambandha-jnana-matramn&rsquo; or mere awareness of the inherent relationship or &lsquo;siddhopayapratipatti-matram&rsquo; or mere knowledge of the ever existent means of the nature of the Paramatman, is the meaning of Prapatti, it cannot become something to be ordained as it will be of the form of mere &lsquo;vakyartha-jnanam&rsquo;. The view of those that mere knowledge is the means of moksha is contrary to the exposition of Sri Bhashyam, as it will be against the command of upasanas. It is to be admitted that it will have to result in action (kartavya-jnana-matram). Even the statement of the form of &lsquo;siddhopaya-svikaram&rsquo; implies that one should entrust the burden of one&rsquo;s protection with a formal prayer after knowing the &lsquo;siddhopaya&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of &lsquo;anivaranamatram&rsquo;? If one prevents the Lord to protect oneself by one&rsquo;s own ability, then the &lsquo;Ishvaratval of the Lord becomes curtailed. If he prevents the Lord from saving him, by indulging in offences, then the surrender made by him should become an act of winning His grace. If he prevents the Lord from saving him by &lsquo;svarakshana-Vyapara&rsquo; or actions done for his protection by himself, the Lord may act and make him liberated when that person is incapable of preventing Him in states like &lsquo;sushupti&rsquo; or &lsquo;pralaya&rsquo; or in such waking state, when he is incapable of functioning.</p>
<p>What is meant by &lsquo;anumati-matram&rsquo;? This fact of mere permitting or allowing, is common to upasaka also. &lsquo;Achitvyaritimatram&rsquo;, or being different from non-sentients, also cannot be prapatti. If it were so, even &lsquo;pratikulas&rsquo; or those that act against the Lord will also have to be saved. If &lsquo;chaitanyakrityamatram&rsquo; is said to be prapatti, then as upasanas and all other functions of the &lsquo;chetana&rsquo; are chaitanya-kritya, there cannot be any distinction for prapatti; then, there will be no need for instruction by the Acharyas. If it is said that the spontaneous actions of a sentient are</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>351</p>
<p>chaitanaya-kritya, then there will be no need for any &lsquo;upadesha&rsquo; at all.</p>
<p>If &lsquo;chitta-samadhanam&rsquo; or equipoise of the mind is said to be prapatti, then the equipoise of the mind that is not helpful for the &lsquo;phala&rsquo; or fruit, will be differing from person to person, according to one&rsquo;s own &lsquo;ruchi&rsquo; or taste and it cannot be taken as prapatti. Then &lsquo;chitta-samadhanam&rsquo; will be to function according to one&rsquo;s own desire&rsquo; -</p>
<p>From all this, it is understood that ishvara is one whose good will or prasada is to be gained and He is the prime &lsquo;siddhopayam&rsquo; or means ever realised. Bhakti and Prapatti are prasadanas or occasions of gaining His grace and so are sadhyopayas that are अप्रधान</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;ekam&rsquo; is further explained as follows:</p>
<p>After surrender unto the Lord, the &lsquo;sharanya&rsquo; or the redeemer, who has received the burden of protection, stands aloof without depending upon other &lsquo;sadhanas&rsquo; prescribed for the attainment of the desired object. An &lsquo;upasaka&rsquo; has to surrender first and on the basis of that, should practise &lsquo;upasana&rsquo; or meditation and then alone the Lord would be an &ldquo;upaya' for that &lsquo;phala&rsquo;. But, the Lord will not burden an &lsquo;akinchana&rsquo;, who cannot bear delay with any other &lsquo;sadhana&rsquo; in the middle, when once he has surrendered and put that burden on His own auspicious qualities. He becomes, a &lsquo;phala-prada&rsquo; or granter of the results without any other expectation. This fact of the Lord&rsquo;s not requiring any thing other than the proper performance of prapatti once, is also signified by the term &lsquo;ekam&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;ekam&rsquo; is also signifying the fact that it is positioned to counter &lsquo;sarva&rsquo; in &lsquo;sarva-dharman&rsquo; and &lsquo;sarva&rsquo; in &lsquo;sarva-papebhyah&rsquo;. It means that the Lord alone is sufficient and capable of giving all attainments that could be gained by other and different dharmas.</p>
<p>Though &lsquo;ekam&rsquo; significs the prime means namely the siddhopaya', it also points out that the one prapatti alone stands in the place of all other dharmas.</p>
<p>Thus, Desika has expounded the several significant meanings of the term &lsquo;ekam&rsquo; and sumamrises them all in the following verses. Six prominent meanings are pointed out here</p>
<p>‘प्राप्यस्यैव प्रापकत्वं स्वप्राधान्यनिवारणम् । प्रपत्तेः व्याजमात्रत्वं अन्योपायैरनन्वयः ।। तदंगैरप्यसंबंधः सर्वसाध्येष्वभिन्नता । इत्थमर्थाः षडाचार्यैः एकशब्दस्य दर्शिताः' ॥</p>
<p>The &lsquo;prapya&rsquo; alone is the &lsquo;prapaka&rsquo;. The importance of the &lsquo;31fefta&rsquo; is set aside. Prapatti is only a &lsquo;vyaja&rsquo; or occasion; it is not an equal to the &lsquo;siddhopaya&rsquo;. It is not combined with other means like Bhaktiyoga. It is not requiring the accessories of Bhaktiyoga. It is the one means that can get all objects of attainment. The venerable Acharyas have thus shown the six meanings of the term &lsquo;ekam&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Some expound the meaning of &lsquo;ekam&rsquo; as oneness of the &lsquo;sharanya&rsquo;. Even then, Goddess Sri characterises the Lord just like the qualities and the Divine-form. Goddess Sri is the sovereign of all entities and is dear to Him. In His vow of protecting the &lsquo;jivas&rsquo;, She is also &lsquo;dikshita&rsquo; and she is also practising His dharma. Both of them together form one &lsquo;cattva&rsquo;. Though it is said that the cause of this universe is</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>353</p>
<p>one, it is known from &lsquo;pramanas&rsquo; that it is necessarily characterised. Similarly, here also the one is qualified by Sri.</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;sharanam&rsquo; significs all meanings that were expounded to that term in the Dvayadhikara. Though this kind of seeking refuge with the Lord was taught to Arjuna, it may be known that it is applicable to all people. Ramanuja says &lsquo;अनालोचित विशेषाशेषलोकशरण्य&rsquo; | And in other such statements such as &lsquo;zwi of Hald4, , un mui a al&rsquo;, &lsquo;योगो योगविदां नेता&rsquo;, It is mentioned that this kind of instruction is not limited to Arjuna alone. It is applicable to all people; but, when He is to be sought, one should approach Him on account of having no other refuge. The term &lsquo;vraja&rsquo; in the Charamashloka signifies surrender of the self along with all the accessories, as signified by the term &lsquo;prapadye&rsquo; in Dvayamantra. In Dvayamantra, prapadye' is in he First Person, as it relates to the person that surrenders unto the Lord. In the Charamashloka, &lsquo;vraja&rsquo; ordains the person standing before Him, and so it is in the &lsquo;Second Person&rsquo;. This kind of surrender is to be performed only once, and it is not to be repeated as in the case of &lsquo;upasanas&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It is asked by some, how a person who is &lsquo;aryanthaparatantra&rsquo; or utterly dependent upon another one, could be ordained any duty at all? This subservience and utter dependence is known from the Mulamantra and the &lsquo;Adhyatma-Shastra. How can such a person be required to do some duty or &lsquo;kartavya&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Desika points out that this objection is raised without considering the utmost limit of &lsquo;paratantrya&rsquo;. The &lsquo;atman&rsquo; has &lsquo;kartrutva&rsquo;, which is dependent upon the Lord. The sutras –</p>
<p>af stefaccia&rsquo; (V.S. 2-3-33) Rig dad:' (V.S. 2-3-40) ordain that the &lsquo;jivatman&rsquo; has &lsquo;kartrucva&rsquo; as given by the Supreme Paramatman. He carries the commands of the Lord and takes the burden of &lsquo;docrship&rsquo; as given by the Lord. If docrship is totally denied to the atman, then it will be similar to the school of &lsquo;Sankhyas&rsquo; that attribute doership to matter or &lsquo;prakriti&rsquo;. It cannot be said that this docrship is &lsquo;svadheena&rsquo; F A or depending upon himself, in which case, it will negate the doctrine of the Ishvara ruling over all atmans. It cannot be said that doership that is derived from Ishvara is mere knowership, because in that case, there will be no aspiration for attainment of the object of life (52_METI) and consequently, there will be no activity for following any means. If it is further argued that knowledge and desire, which are of a particular state of knowledge itself exists, and there is no further functioning, then there will be no scope for practising different means for seen or unseen objects and also for acts of divine service that are done as &lsquo;svayam prayojana&rsquo;. So, it is established that the atman has jnanam, or knowledge, chikirsha' or desire to function and prayatna or efforts.</p>
<p>This &lsquo;kartrtva&rsquo; is unique to the sentient being, as related to &lsquo;prayatna&rsquo; or effort - S pray here i Prayatna or effort is a particular kind of consciousness that prompts the body and others. It is not appropriate to say that this kind of &lsquo;karttva&rsquo; is only in &lsquo;kainkarya&rsquo; or Divine Service and not in performance of a means - &lsquo;upaya-anushtana&rsquo;. Having the fact of &lsquo;Bhagavat-precti&rsquo; or the pleasure of the Lord, as a prayojana, a person practises the &lsquo;upayas&rsquo;. So, in doership or &lsquo;kartrtva&rsquo;, the idea of &lsquo;ahamn&rsquo; or cgo of the form of &lsquo;I am the doer&rsquo;, which is the cause of bondage, is to be discarded. One</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>355</p>
<p>has to reflect that he is functioning only according to the wisdom and power, the body and the indriyas, given to him by the Lord, as prompted by Him, who is the supporter and the ultimate beneficiary and only as he causes him to do these actions. This kind of reflection will not bind the doer. To think that he alone is the doer, and that he is acting for different benefits, will certainly bind him down to &lsquo;samsara&rsquo;. Even Bhakti' and &lsquo;Prapatti&rsquo; meant for attainment of different gains, are certainly binding. So, for a person, who is aspiring for &lsquo;svabhavika-kainkarya&rsquo; and who is not after any other benefit (ananya-prayojana), &lsquo;kartrutva&rsquo; or doership during the state of &lsquo;sadhana-upaya-dasa&rsquo; is not contrary to his nature, just as &lsquo;kartrtva&rsquo; in the state of liberation is not opposed to his nature.</p>
<p>In the state of liberation or &lsquo;mukti&rsquo;, the doership related to varied Divine-services to the Lord, is on account of the desire of the &lsquo;mukta&rsquo;, which is according to the wonderful desire of the Lord; but, the doership in this world of bondage, is according to one&rsquo;s own karma on account of which the Lord causes the variations of the satva, rajas and tamas and this kind of doership is varied. The doership which is related to the effect of rajas and tamas, and also satva, being the cause of attachment to different benefits, is &lsquo;bandhaka&rsquo; or binding. The &lsquo;karttva&rsquo; or doership that is on account of the preponderance of satva-guna, which will have the desire for the attainment of the Lord, is the cause of liberation. The &lsquo;kartitva&rsquo; or doership of a liberated soul is not related to &lsquo;guna-traya&rsquo;. So, there is no contradiction between statements positing doership and denying doership to the atman, as they are related to particular vishayas or states. The statements that deny doership to the atman affirm that one should not think the &lsquo;kartrtva&rsquo; - that is356</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>subordinated to the Lord, and to the gunas, that are dependent upon the Lord - as &lsquo;nirapeksha&rsquo; or independent doership. The statements that affirm docrship to the jivatman declare that for the knowledge &lsquo;chikirsha&rsquo; or desire to act, and effort, that are derived from the will of the Lord, the atman is the &lsquo;ashraya&rsquo;. So, there is no contradiction between these two kinds of statements.</p>
<p>It is established that the jivatman is fit for being commanded by the Lord to function, according to His intention, as the Lord has blessed him with doership. So, the jivatman has doership dependent upon the will of the Lord. So, there is every justification to command him to seek refuge with Him by the term &lsquo;vraja&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This &lsquo;sharanagati&rsquo; dharma is ordained as something to be done, just like Bhakti and others. It is to be remembered that it is not something which is independent of Paramatman&rsquo;s will; but only on account of Him alone, that these are caused. Here, a prapanna should think that his doership is &lsquo;paradheena&rsquo; or dependent on Paramatman. The statement of some masters that forgiveness is prayed of the Lord for the prapatti done by one, should be understood as related to prapatti done with &lsquo;ahankara&rsquo;. If a prapanna feels that he is offering something of his own to the Lord to be protected, that is not proper. Desika points out here, that such forgiveness is prayed to set right the feeling of &lsquo;ahankara-sparsha&rsquo;. It is not an offence to have surrendered according to shastra. &lsquo;Paradheena-Kartrtva&rsquo; or dependent doership, is not a fault. The view that any prohibited deed will not taint a person, who is aware of his essential nature of having no doership, is not tenable, as he has in reality dependent doership (978andra4).</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>357</p>
<p>The meaning of &lsquo;vraja&rsquo; is sometimes explained as knowing the relationship of the protector and the object to be protected, and it is explained that a &lsquo;mumukshu&rsquo; should gain &lsquo;shastra-janya sambandha-jnanam&rsquo; or knowledge of the inherent relation between the &lsquo;sheshi&rsquo; and the &lsquo;shesha&rsquo; that is gained from the Shastra. But, this is quite opposed to the commandments of the shastra for practising the means of Bhakti and Prapatti for realisation of spiritual perfection. This knowledge, that is gained from the shastras, is actualised by &lsquo;shravana&rsquo; and &lsquo;manana&rsquo; that are &lsquo;raga-praptha&rsquo; or possible on account of one&rsquo;s interest, and this kind of knowledge does not need any prescription or &lsquo;vidhi&rsquo;. The masters of yore have pointed out the defects such as contradiction to the commandments of Bhakti and Prapatti, in respect of those that posit that &lsquo;avidheya-jnana&rsquo; is a &lsquo;moksha-sadhana&rsquo;. So, it cannot be said that &lsquo;vraja&rsquo; signifies only as related to the knowledge of the relationship of the aspirant and the Supreme Paramatman. When one realises from the shastras his inherent relationship with the Lord, he will then desire to know, how he could attain the Lord, and this means of Bhakti and Prapatti are also ordained according to the competence of the aspirant and are particular kinds of knowledge that are different from mere &lsquo;sambandha-jnanam&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Desika explains in a Tamil verse, the summary of the Charamashloka, showing vividly the several meanings of the term &lsquo;ekam&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I alone am the means and the end or the fruit. The sadhaka seeks refuge with me not independently, but being a dependent upon me. The means of &lsquo;sharanagati&rsquo; is also not a regular upaya, but only a pretext. Other sadhanas like Bhaktiyoga and others, are not even accessories to &lsquo;sharanagati&rsquo;. There is to other accessory for this, which is to be gained with difficulty. I myself stand in the place of other means. I alone am the messenger having the quality of sousheelya and others. I am also the master of everything Get rid of your sorrow by taking resort in me.&rdquo; - Thus, says Lord to Arjuna, through this verse.</p>
<p>In the first half of this verse, the &lsquo;adhikari-krutya&rsquo; or the duty that an aspirant has to do, has been prescribed. In the latter half of the verse, the Lord, the all-protector, who accepts the burden of protection, describes what he would do to save the aspirant and make the aspirant freed from cares and worries.</p>
<p>The verb - a ' is in the first person', and implies the subject as &lsquo;T&rsquo; or &lsquo;aham&rsquo;. Even so, why is the word &lsquo;aham&rsquo; is used?</p>
<p>This term is significant because it points out the Lord who is omniscient and omnipotent, who is capable of relicving from all sins. The idea is this -</p>
<p>&ldquo;I alone - who am having no equal or superior to Me, and who bound the erring soul to samsara - am full of mercy caused by the pretext of your surrendeș, am going to release you from all sins forgiving all your faults. Nobody can obstruct me from protecting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is it not verily said that the Lord Vishnu is the bestower of liberation?</p>
<p>9319: YITAT: A Fall तेनैव मोचनीयास्ते नान्यैः मोक्षयितुं क्षमाः' ॥</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>359</p>
<p>&ldquo;The living beings (animals) are bound by the Supreme, on account of His leela. They are to be liberated only by Him. They are not possible of being liberated by others.&rdquo; Thus, in this term &lsquo;aham, the grace of the Lord that was awakened by the surrender of the soul and the natural compassion and other qualities of the Lord, and also the unsurpassed &lsquo;swatantrya&rsquo; of the Lord, are suggested and these are useful in setting aside all the obstructions for the liberation of the surrendered.</p>
<p>The natural compassion of the Lord generates His grace that ignores the infinite offences of the soul by a mere pretext of a prapatti. So, this grace will be supported by the supreme power of the Lord, and will be capable of destroying all obstructions for attainment of liberation of the &lsquo;ashritas&rsquo;. So the term &lsquo;aham&rsquo;, which has the sense of emphasis viz., &lsquo;I alone, of this nature&rsquo;, is very significant in this verse,</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;ai&rsquo; signifies the person, who surrenders unto the Lord, after gaining the discrimination of the three entities and who has renounced the attainment of the objects of life such as &lsquo;ऐश्वर्य&rsquo; , &lsquo;कैवल्य&rsquo; after having realised their defects of littleness and transitoriness, and who is yearning for the attainment of the supreme object of life of the form of the attainment of Paramatman, and who has given up other difficult means on account of his incapacity, and who has done what ought to be done by surrendering unto the Lord, who is the prapya&rsquo; and &lsquo;sarva-virodhi-nirakarana kshama&rsquo; - (or ultimate object of attainment and who is capable of setting aside all obstructions to his attainment) and who has nothing more to do for the attainment of his desired object. After having mentioned the &lsquo;moksha-prada&rsquo; (the granter of liberation) and the incapable jivatman who has surrendered unto Him, by these two terms ‘3764' and &lsquo;rat&rsquo; - the &lsquo;bandhakas&rsquo; or obstructions that bind one to samsara are mentioned by the term &lsquo;sarva-papebyah&rsquo; Hd919' &lsquo;from all sins!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa&rsquo; or sin is an &lsquo;anartha-sadhana&rsquo; or a means causing untoward results that may be &lsquo;pratikula-prapti&rsquo; or attainment or disagreeable things, or it may be &lsquo;anukula-niyritti&rsquo; or loss of agreeable things. This term &lsquo;papa&rsquo; here, signifies the &lsquo;samsarika-punya&rsquo; or the agreeable things in this worldly state, as this term &lsquo;papa&rsquo; is related to the mumukshu or an aspirant after liberacion. Even &lsquo;svarga&rsquo; and others are undesirable attainments for an aspirant after liberation. Thus, by the term &lsquo;papa&rsquo;, the cause of bondage of both &lsquo;punya&rsquo; and &lsquo;papa&rsquo; is implied in this context. The plural number in &lsquo;papebyah&rsquo; points out that such causes are infinite. Here, the term &lsquo;sarva&rsquo; signifies ignorance, karma, the reminiscent impressions, and the relationship with the gross and subtle body and inclination for the undesirable things. The group of all these obstructions is signified by the term &lsquo;sarva papebyah&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the &lsquo;Sharanagati Gadyam&rsquo;, Bhagavan Ramanuja has mentioned the groups of all &lsquo;virodhis&rsquo; in three paragraphs beginning with &lsquo;mano-vakkaya&rsquo; etc. The statement &ldquo;When the Lord wills to grant moksha even sins cannot obstruct&rdquo;, does not mean that there will be no displeasure of the Lord, even in case of intentional sins and so there is no need of expiation. The meaning of the statement is that, when the Lord becomes pleased with the surrender done unto Him, there will be necessarily liberation. The Lord will prompt</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>361</p>
<p>such a person to surrender again for forgiving those faults and he forgives them duly and grants moksha.</p>
<p>The statement that the Lord relishes the faults of the surrendered, just as the dirt in the body of the lover is relished etc., should be taken in the sense that even if wicked people surrender unto the Lord, the Lord will not let them down.</p>
<p>Instead of this, if it is meant that intentional sins done after prapatti will be enjoyable to the Lord (bhogya), it will result in the consequence of amassing more and more such sins to please the Lord. If on the other hand, intentional sins occur on account of the &lsquo;prarabdha-karma&rsquo;, the Lord will inflict light punishment upon them, if they do not repent and pray for forgiveness, and take them to His side in the end. Even this kind of light punishment is a way of the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness.</p>
<p>The argument that in the case of people, who have committed intentional sins after prapatti, and have not regretted for them, and have never asked for forgiveness, there is not even the slight punishment as witnessed in this world, is not sound, because the mode of inflicting punishment is of different kinds for different types of offences and so we are seeing different kinds of punishments inflicted on them such as suffering from the three kinds of 3 , Hautfah, fugach torments, diminution of knowledge, obstructions for &lsquo;bhagavadanubhava&rsquo;, breach in the enjoyment of the bliss of service to the Lord and the Bhagavatas, censurt by the celebrated oncs, the destruction of particular kind of &lsquo;sukruthas&rsquo;, the disregard by the satvikas, the affliction of frustration of one&rsquo;s desires and similar such punishments. The infliction of punishment varies from</p>
<p>362</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyarraya Saram</p>
<p>person to person in such cases of committing intentional sins after prapatti according to the intensity or otherwise of the offence and the kinds of punishments that are listed above can be seen being enforced on them. So, it cannot be said that the incidence of punishments like this, docs not happen in case of intentional sins.</p>
<p>So, it is an established fact that normally a prapanna does not commit any intentional sin after prapatti, and in case, on account of his past karma, such sins occur, he prays for forgiveness with repentance; and in case, one does not repent, the Lord purifics them by inflicting suitable punishment. A prapanna is, therefore, sure to attain his object of attainment with certainity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;विवेकिनां प्रपन्नानां धीपूर्वागस्यनुद्यमः । मध्यानां अनुतापादिः शिक्षा कठिनचेतसाम्&rsquo;।</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;mokshayishyami&rsquo; gives the assurance - &ldquo;I am going to relieve you from samsara, when you desire.&rdquo; The Lord has vowed that he would not forgive certain sins When it is so, is not this statement - I free you from all sins - contradictory?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is that these two references, relate to different subjects, and therefore, non-contradictory. The instances mentioned to point out that Lord would not forgive, means that such sins would not be forgiven, when one undertakes other light means of expiation. Prapatti is of the form of an expiation of all sins and the Lord is going to forgive all sins, when one undertakes this means and seeks His forgiveness. This statement of the Lord, is not a statement of consolation or 3497&rsquo;. Releasing from sins means to give up His will to punish one who has behaved</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>363</p>
<p>na</p>
<p>disagreeably from beginningless-time towards Him. When this &lsquo;nigraha&rsquo; or the will to punish is terminated, all kinds of effects of &lsquo;nigraha&rsquo; such as ignorance and others, disappear. To put it positively, Ishvara&rsquo;s nigraha-nivritt is verily Ishvara prasada. Termination of ignorance in respect of the prapanna means extension of the knowledge of the reality.</p>
<p>The destruction of the karma on account of the eminence and efficacy of &lsquo;upasana&rsquo; or &lsquo;prapatti&rsquo;, means that the Lord gives up His desire to dispense the results of those karmas to those people. ' ' or non-tainting of karmas, means that an intention to give the result of such karmas in respect of those that have taken refuge with the Lord, is given up totally by the Lord; or, we may say that an intention to dispense those results will never arise in the mind of the Lord.</p>
<p>If all karmas are thus relieved of the aspirant, what karmas of an aspirant of moksha - a prapanna or an upasaka - are transmitted to his friends and foes? Those karmas of his that do not taint him or that are destroyed and such punya karmas, done intentionally after prapatti and are stultified from yielding the results by more powerful karmas - &lsquo;अश्लेषविनाशविषयानि&rsquo; and &lsquo;बुद्धिपूर्वोत्तर पुण्येषु कर्मान्तर प्रतिबद्धफलानि&rsquo; are transmitted.</p>
<p>The Lord is going to transpose these karmas at the time of the fall of his body, and not at the very time of commencement of the mokshopaya, because those friends and foes may at some further time change their attitude of friendship or enemity towards the upasaka or prapanna.</p>
<p>Is it proper that the karmas done by some one are transmitted to some others in this way as it leads to the reaping of consequences without doing actually any such deed good or bad?</p>
<p>It is answered that this kind of transmission of karma - good or bad – to the friends and foes of the prapanna or upasaka takes place on account of the activities of those people of the form of &lsquo;upachara&rsquo; or benefaction or &lsquo;apachara&rsquo; or offence. As this kind of transmission of karma, happens on account of their good-will or ill-will about the upasaka or prapanna, there is no wrong in such transmission. That is why, there is no mention of neutrals as recipients of good and bad karmas. This is in fact the good will or wrath of the Lord in respect of those people, who treat a jnani well or in a bad manner. &lsquo;Sarva-papebyah&rsquo; includes - 1. all obstructions for the attainment of Paramatman</p>
<p>according to his desire (prapti-virodhi) 2. all obstructions for the practise of spiritual disciplines;</p>
<p>(upaya-virodhi) and all causes that lead to the experience of disagreeable things (pratikula-anubhava-hetu). Prapti-virodhi is of this form -</p>
<p>The will of the Lord that &ldquo;this atman who has committed offences is not worthy of experiencing me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upaya-virodhi, is the will of the Lord that &ldquo;this atman may not become capable of choosing Me after knowing My nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pratikula-anubhava-hetu, is of this form -</p>
<p>The will of the Lord to award one the respective fruits of the offences committed by him.</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>365</p>
<p>If the Lord gives up His will of the above nature, all causes of punishment get terminated and the aspirant attains the Paramatman.</p>
<p>When the termination of the stream of all obstructions of the form of causes and effects, happens - as mentioned in &lsquo;sarva-papebhyo-mokshayishyami&rsquo;, it amounts in declaring that such a person gains the manifestation of complete bliss of Divine experience. It is 1961: STH' or established by itself.</p>
<p>The destruction of obstructions results in the full experience of the Divine and no separate effort is needed for that experience. When once an atman manifests its true nature of being subservient to the Lord and experiences the bliss of Divine communion, he will realise that all things that were appearing disagreeable earlier, are only agreeable to him in the state of liberation. Even this is implied in &lsquo;sarva-papebhyo-mokshayishyami&rsquo;.</p>
<p>By the word &lsquo;ekam&rsquo; in this verse, if oneness of upaya and phala is implied, then the &lsquo;anishta-nivritti&rsquo; of the form of &lsquo;sarva-papebhyo-mokshayishyami&rsquo; explicitly points out this &lsquo;ishta-prapti&rsquo; or attainment of the object desired. This has been suggested in the previous verse as '</p>
<p>H o ld'. When all sins of the form of obstructions to the attainment of Paramatman are totally terminated, as declared in &lsquo;sarva papebhyo mokshayishyami&rsquo;, there is no cause for the obstruction of Divine experience and so, there cannot happen, the experience of the mere atman, divested of Divine experience.</p>
<p>One might have got rid of all sins that obstruct the experience of duf, birth and death; but, if he has not got rid of the obstructions to &lsquo;paripurna Bhagavadanubhava&rsquo;, he366</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Şaram</p>
<p>may rest in bliss of the experience of his atman alone. As such a person is having no relationship with the experience of the &lsquo;achit&rsquo; or the experience of Paramatman, he is called a &lsquo;kevala&rsquo;; but, it is not &lsquo;mukthi&rsquo; or full liberation. Sometime, the term &lsquo;Kaivalya&rsquo; is used for Bhagavat-prapti' also. There, the meaning of that term is the termination of all &lsquo;upadhis&rsquo; or limiting adjuncts. So, &lsquo;sarva-papebhyo-mokshayishyami&rsquo; implics the attainment of the full bliss of Divine Communion (Paripuran-Brahma-Anubhava).</p>
<p>As this verse assures the termination of all sins - the obstructions of the form of some karmas, to the full experience of Parabrahman, also get totally terminated, and therefore, such a person will attain Baramatman, as the Lord himself has declared as wideft'. This assurance, &ldquo;you will attain Me alone&rdquo; signifies the bliss of communion with the Supreme Paramatman. For gaining such complete experience, there will be &lsquo;archiradi-gaci&rsquo; and &lsquo;desa-visesha prapti&rsquo;. The passage of the liberated person through &lsquo;archiradi&rsquo; to attain the Divine Abode of the Lord, is well known from the Upanishads and the Sutras.</p>
<p>All this, is signified by the statement &lsquo;HTTP:&rsquo; (Do not grieve). This statement affirms the faith of the aspirant that he may not have any apprehension regarding the ultimate goal of attainment, as all causes of griet get terminated for one who adopts this means of liberation. There is no room for an aspirant to grieve when the Lord has taught this means of surrender, which is not difficult to adopt, and which is capable of averting all obstacles without any delay.</p>
<p>The grief that is terminated here, is not the grief Arjuna had earlier on account of the destruction of his relatives, as</p>
<p>367</p>
<p>that was terminated by the Lord through the instruction of the self. It is also not the grief he entertained, whether he was bom to &lsquo;asuri-sampath&rsquo;, because that also was terminated by the Lord, who gave him an assurance that he was born to &lsquo;daivi-sampath&rsquo;. What is the grief that is terminated here, then?</p>
<p>When Arjuna realised his disability to practise Bhaktiyoga, which was an arduous means, set with many obstructions, and to be practised for a long time, he intensely grieved that he was incapable of following that discipline for attainment of spiritual perfection. The compassionate Lord taught him an easier means free from all obstructions, that needed to be performed once, and made him doubtless in attaining the ultimate object of life. Then, Arjuna felt relieved. The assurance of the Lord, thus relieves Arjuna of his intense sorrow caused by the difficulties in following other means. So, it is this sorrow of Arjuna that is terminated by the statement मा शुचः ।</p>
<p>The Lord enjoined Arjuna who was depressed on account of his incapability to practise the spiritual discipline of Bhaktiyoga, to surrender unto Him, and be freed from all worries and fears. The incapable aspirant entrusted the burden of his protection to the capable Lord and the, compassionate and all powerful Lord accepted it. So, the Lord, who is omnipotent and compassionate, and who speaks the truth alone, gave the assurance that He would save him from all sins. Arjuna had no doubt about this, and his fear was dispelled. From this, it becomes evident that a person who realises his utter helplessness, will be intensely sorrowful and he would fear what would happen to him. A person who is &lsquo;bheeta&rsquo; or full of fear, is qualified for &lsquo;prapatti&rsquo;</p>
<p>368</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>or self-surrender. After prapatti, he will be freed from fear and sorrow, as he would have no doubt about the attainment of the ultimate goal on account of the grace of the Lord, awakened by his surrender unto Him.</p>
<p>Desika has explained elaborately the significance of the statement #1 Ta' : 1. One need not grieve, whether or not one has to struggle</p>
<p>hard, practising a difficult means which is not possible of even very capable people, and which needs to be practised for a long time with patience; One need not grieve whether or not one is fit for practising prapatti, when he has faith in the Lord and the realisation of his helplessness; One need not grieve about the &lsquo;siddhopaya&rsquo;, who is all powerful, compassionate and accessible to all. He is a person, in whom one can have full trust. One need not fear whether there would be short comings in the accessories, as in the case of upasanas, though there are certain deficiencies on account of</p>
<p>temporal and spacial variations; 5. One need not fear regarding the occurrence of</p>
<p>intentional offences after prapatti, if he has surrendered to the Lord for avoiding such offences. Such offences never recur on account of that prapatti; One need not fear whether he would be hurled to hell on account of intentional sins done by him after prapatti, as the Lord would purify him by appropriate punishments, if he does not repent;</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>369</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>One need not fear whether his body would follow him</li>
</ol>
<p>even after that life, because the body would continue in that birth, so long as he desires to continue; One need not fear whether the prapatti done by him would not be fruitful, on account of some wrong behaviour of his; One need not fear whether he would be having further birth on account of the &lsquo;prarabdha-karma&rsquo;, because the prapanna has specially surrendered to the Lord for</p>
<p>granting him moksha at the end of that body; 10. One need not fear whether there would be delay in the</p>
<p>attainment of liberation on account of the mere experience of the nature of the jivatman (kaivalya), because the Lord has given the assurance that he would relieve him of all sins.</p>
<p>Desika has pointed out that the profound meanings of this Charamakavya or final statement would be taught by the celebrated Acharyas at their &lsquo;charamadasa&rsquo; or last moments to the deserving disciples.</p>
<p>The gist of this celebrated verse is summarised as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You entrust the burden of your protection to me along with five accessories without wandering in other spiritual means that are yielding the results with long delay, which are difficult to know and practise by you, who are of little knowledge, little ability and who exists for a limited time and who cannot bear delay, deciding that I alone, am accessible to all and that, I am the one refuge of the entire world, and that I am characterised by all qualities helpful for redeeming one.&rdquo; YS</p>
<p>&ldquo;I who am supremely compassionate and all powerful, and who am pleased with your surrender, will for my own sake relieve you, who have done your duty and entrusted the burden of your protection unto me, from the infinite, many-fold, unsurmountable hosts of all obstructions, once and for all. I shall make you an equal to me in enjoying the bliss of communion with me and endow you with my complete service which is of the form of the spontaneous flow of the ecstasy of my experience at all times in all places and all states. I shall derive supreme joy by making you thus. You need not grieve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having expounded the meanings of this supreme mantra, Desika declares that this way of exposition was taught by the preceptors of yore. The preceptors who sought refuge with the one and non-second Lord, who is ever associated with the Mother &lsquo;Sri&rsquo;, who is the one dharma standing in the place of all dharmas, and who is the bestower of all objects, and who got rid off all sorrows, - expounded this path of explanation for this sacred mantra.</p>
<p>&lsquo;एकं सर्वप्रदं धर्म श्रिया जुष्टम् समाश्रितैः ।</p>
<p>अपेत शोकैराचार्यैः अयं पन्थाः प्रदर्शितः&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>In the concluding verse, Desika pays his homage and veneration to the great Acharyas, who expounded in a glorious way the meanings of this eminent verse, which happens to be the ultimate teaching of the Lord Krishna to Arjuna. This verse is here, praised as the eminent &lsquo;Koustubha gem&rsquo; that emanated when the milky ocean was churned. This Charamashloka is similar to that &lsquo;koustubha gem&rsquo; and is picked from the vast ocean of Mahabharata composed by</p>
<p>na</p>
<p>Charamasloka Adhikara</p>
<p>371</p>
<p>CIIL</p>
<p>the great Veda Vyasa. This verse is also very dear and pleasing to the Lord, just like that &lsquo;Koustubha gem&rsquo;. Our Acharyas realised that this verse enshrines the supreme meaning of &lsquo;sharanagati, as propounded by the shrutis and the smrutis. The path taught in this celebrated verse, is cherished by all people with great respect. The interpretations of our Acharyas happen to be the staircase (a flight of stairs) to the highest place of liberation. The cminent Vyshampayana as well as Shuka, Shounaka, Narada and other celebrated sages nod their heads with joy and appreciation in response to the glorious way of explanation of this great verse. They consider that it is their good fortune to listen to such eminent exposition.</p>
