Desika has expounded the doctrine of Prapatti in the twenty-two sections that we have already covered. In the succeeding four chapters, the doctrine is consolidated and established firmly by clearing the doubts and misapprehensions that may arise about this means of salvation. This portion is called &lsquo;Sthirikarana Bhaga&rsquo;. Here, there are four sections. In the first section, known as, &lsquo;Siddhopaya Shodhana&rsquo;, or clearing doubts regarding the ever realised means or &ldquo;Siddhopaya&#39;, which happens to be Supreme Paramatman&#39; himself, the doubts that may arise about the &lsquo;Siddhopaya&rsquo; are cleared." />

This portion is called &lsquo;Sthirikarana Bhaga&rsquo;. Here, there are four sections. In the first section, known as, &lsquo;Siddhopaya Shodhana&rsquo;, or clearing doubts regarding the ever realised means or &ldquo;Siddhopaya', which happens to be Supreme Paramatman' himself, the doubts that may arise about the &lsquo;Siddhopaya&rsquo; are cleared.</p>
<p>The section &lsquo;Sadhyopaya Shodhanadhikara&rsquo;, clears the doubts that may arise about the means of Prapatti. In the succeeding two chapters, the doubts that arise regarding the conduct and behaviour of a prapanna and the glory of a prapanna are cleared.</p>
<p>In the introductory verse, Desika expounds the essential nature of the &lsquo;Siddhopaya, the Supreme Paramatman, as follows :</p>
<p>युगपदखिलं प्रत्यक्षेणं स्वतस्सततं विदन् निरवधिदयादिव्योदन्वान् अशक्यविवर्जितः । जलधिसुतया सार्धं देवो जगत्परिपालयन् परमपुरुषस्सिद्धोपायः प्रतीष्टभरस्सताम् ।।</p>

<p>The</p>
<p>The Supreme Paramatman, who by his own nature knows everything directly, and always witnesses all entities directly is an ocean of infinite compassion, and is capable of accomplishing all things that he wills. He together with Goddess Mahalakshmi is the protector of this universe and the redeemer of humanity. He is the self-realised means of protection, and He takes upon himself the burden of protection of those aspirants who entrust Him with that burden of protection. In this verse, the essentials of the siddhopaya, have been expounded.</p>
<p>In the previous portions, the following factors were described in order :</p>
<p>The individual self who is migrating from beginningless time in this world, would reform himself and realise the most essential object of attainment, on account of the grace of the Lord, which was waiting for an opportunity to operate. He would realise the essential relationship of Sharira Shariri Bhava between himself and the Paramatman and he would also be getting an essential knowledge of the Supreme Reality, the goal and the means of salvation. He would transform himself into a mumukshu or an</p>
<p>aspirant of liberation from samsara. 4. He would adopt and perform the means of spiritual</p>
<p>realisation in accordance with his competence. He would become a Kritakritya or one who has done what ought to be done. He would engage himself in loving service to the Lord, following the dictates of the Shastras, and avoiding all</p>
<p>Siddhopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>
<p>227</p>
<p>es S</p>
<p>IS</p>
<p>kinds of &lsquo;aparadha&rsquo; or offences so long as he would remain in this world. After the fall of the body, he would move through the archiradi path and attain the Supreme Abode of Paramatman, and would enjoy the bliss of eternal communion with the Paramatman.</p>
<p>Paramatman happens to be the &lsquo;siddhopaya&rsquo; or means already realised and Prapatti happens to be the &lsquo;sadhyopaya&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Of all these truths, some doubts that may arise about the Siddhopaya, are to be cleared, and there are three prime factors, on account of which all these doubts can be totally cleared. They are – 1. the assurance given by Goddess Mahalakshmi (in</p>
<p>answer to the prayer of Bhagavan Ramanuja) in</p>
<p>Saranagati-Gadya as &lsquo;319 adeta Ho Heredia 2. the compassion of the great Acharyas and 3. the Satsampradaya-siddhi - the attainment of the</p>
<p>instruction into the true knowledge of tatva, hita and purusharta, as caught by the preceptors, who are supremely &lsquo;satvik&rsquo; in nature, and who are not after fame, wealth or worship (ख्यातिलाभपूजा निरपेक्षः) and who teach out of great compassion, the truths as received from the line of their preceptors, beginning with the Supreme Paramatman.</p>
<p>This kind of handing over of the knowledge from generation to generation through the medium of preceptors and disciples, ensures that the knowledge gained is authentic and valid. For those people, who are not enlightened upon the supreme truths, but who have faith, this &ldquo;upadesha&rsquo; is</p>
<p>228</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>most important. For more intelligent ones, it is necessary to listen to the expositions of preceptors for gaining perfect knowledge and also for cnlightening those who have not precise knowledge, and are confused.</p>
<p>So, it amounts to saying this - To get rid of all doubts, one has to study the Shastras under compassionate preceptors and determine the truths supported by valid reasons.</p>
<p>For people, who have not listened thus to the Shastras, a number of doubts arise in various forms. Some think of depriving the glory of the Lord, and some say that there is no Ishvara at all. Some say that some one other than Paramatman as &lsquo;Sarveshvara&rsquo; and point out that the Sarveshvara is the vibhuti of God. Some go to the extent of denying Ishvara totally.</p>
<p>It is natural that such doubts arise in the minds of even very faithful devotees and the Sadacharyas clear such doubts. It is mentioned -</p>
<p>एकं यदि भवेच्छास्त्रं ज्ञानं निस्संशयं भवेत् । बहुत्वादिह शास्त्राणां ज्ञानतत्त्वं सुदुर्लभम् ॥</p>
<p>If there were only one type of Shastra, wisdom would arise without any doubt. As the Shastras are very many and different from one another rcal knowledge is very difficult to gain.</p>
<p>निस्संशयेषु सर्वेषु नित्यं वसति वै हरिः ।</p>
<p>ससंशयान् हेतुबलान् नाध्यावसति माधवः ॥</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord dwells in all people who are free from doubts (and have supreme faith in the truths taught).</p>
<p>Siddhopaya Shodhagadhikara</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>The Supreme Madhava deserts those people who always doubt and who argue with reasons.</p>
<p>It is established that doubts do arise in the minds of people desirous of evolving higher and higher, and that there are many obstacles on the path of perfection. Such doubts become cleared on account of the instructions of noble preceptors.</p>
<p>श्रूयते किल गोविन्दे भक्तिमुद्वहतां नृणाम् । संसारन्यूनता भीताः त्रिदशाः परिपन्थिनः ॥</p>
<p>It is heard that the gods are opponents to those people who carry devotion towards Lord Govinda, as they are afraid of the decrease in samsara. There are a hundred obstacles for truth, a thousand for penance; but, devotion of people towards Govinda is obstructed by ten thousand obstacles.</p>
<p>Desika describes all these before discussing the several doubts and clearing them to point out that it is natural to entertain doubts regarding the nature of the siddhopaya or Paramatman, who is already realised.</p>
<p>The doubts that arise in respect of the siddhopaya or ever realised means, are of three kinds : I. As connected with his qualities of supreme</p>
<p>independence and infinite compassion II. As regards the inseparable relationship of the Shesha</p>
<p>and Sheshi, that exists between Jivatman and</p>
<p>Paramatman, III. In respect of the inseparable association of Goddess Sri</p>
<p>with Him.</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>I. Among these doubts, the doubt regarding his qualities</p>
<p>of &lsquo;Swatantrya&rsquo; and &lsquo;Karunya&rsquo;, is expounded as follows : Nammalwar has questioned the Lord thus -</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made me an object today, and you have inhabited my mind; but, on account of what reason, did you bind me to samsara and kept me to be far from you !&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Alwar questioned like this, the Lord kept quiet, without giving a definite answer. He simply described the glory of a mumukshu going through &lsquo;archiradi&rsquo;. Docs this not signify that binding one to samsara, and releasing him from bondage happen strictly according to his own independent will and nature : He is free to bless one with compassion and if He himself protects one, that soul can attain Him. So, where is the need for one to perform any spiritual discipline ?</p>
<p>He may protect or not protect, according to his will; where is any room at all for a chetana to practise some mokshopaya or other?</p>
<p>The above doubt is answered as follows :</p>
<p>Though the Supreme Paramatman is all independent, He causes the chetana to practise some pretext or other, and depending upon that pretext, He protects that chetana for guarding himself from the defects of partiality and cruelty. The &lsquo;Sutrakara&rsquo; points out that the Supreme Paramatman has no partiality or cruelty, as his actions are all. related to the respective karmas of those chetanas (2-1-34). Even Nammalwar has shown this truth, in his hymns as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I uttered the name of the Mount Tirumalirumsholai and on that protext, the Supreme Paramatman came and entered fully into my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Siddhopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>
<p>231</p>
<p>If it is asked why that Supreme Paramatman did not cause the Alwar even earlier to do this pretext, and why did He let him down earlier, it is answered that, when the beginningless stream of karma attains the stage of fruition, such a will of the Lord will arise; because, He is a dispenser of fruits according to one&rsquo;s own karma, and if otherwise, the fault of partiality happens to Him. One has to understand from the particular effect at a particular time, that such an occasion did not occur earlier From the &lsquo;karya&rsquo;, one has to infer the &lsquo;karana&rsquo;. If it is not agreed like this, it becomes difficult to answer why a person has an aspiration for moksha at a particular time, but which was not earlier. This question cannot be answered unless it is accepted that it is according to the will of the Lord, who was pleased with some pretext or other.</p>
<p>If it is asked how the question raised by Nammalwar about &ldquo;accepting him at a particular time, and letting him go far from Him before&rdquo;, can be answered, the answer is as follows :</p>
<p>There is no prime cause other than Supreme Independence and Compassion of the Lord for making one turn towards God, and making one averse to God. If there is any other reason than these, you may please tell me - asks Nammalwar. As Ishvara kept silent, it is made known to the world that &lsquo;svatantrya&rsquo; and &lsquo;Krupa&rsquo; of the Lord are the prime factors for both. The prime cause for making chetana an instrument of his &lsquo;lila&rsquo; is the &lsquo;svatantrya&rsquo; of the Lord. The accessory cause for this, is the transgression of the command of the Supreme Paramatman from beginningless time. That means that the Lord is subjecting one to samsara on account of his supreme independence, and in this act, He is doing so232</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>on account of the transgression of his command by the chetana. Likewise, His natural compassion is the prime cause of relcasing one from the bondage of samsara. The &lsquo;sahakari&rsquo; karana or the accessory cause for removing the wrath of the Lord, happens to be the &lsquo;vashikarana-visesha&rsquo; or the particular acts of surrender or upasana that happens to one, on account of his &lsquo;sukrutha visesha&rsquo; that pleases the Lord. The idea is that the Lord releases one from bondage on account of His compassion, when one observes the pretext of an upasana or self-surrender. He can act only when there is an occasion, and self-surrender or upasana happens to be that occasion. Similarly, His supreme independence is the cause of binding one to samsara. But, he binds one who has transgressed his command, and not anyone according to his own whim and fancy. By thus explaining the essential nature of the Supreme Paramatman viz. supreme independence and infinite compassion, the fact of being non-partial and ever merciful, the regulation regarding bondage and release, all these become harmonised. The gist of all this is that one should utterly depend upon the compassion of the all independent Supreme Paramatman.</p>
<p>The svatantrya of a merciless person is harmful. Similarly, the compassion of a powerless person is of no help to others and a source of discomfort for him also. The &lsquo;karunya&rsquo; of a &lsquo;svatantra&rsquo; will fulful His &lsquo;sankalpa&rsquo; and so, pleases Him most. It will be the cause of &lsquo;ishta-prapti&rsquo; and &lsquo;anista-nivritti&rsquo; to all those that take resort in Him. The Lord is a satya-sankalpa and so the mercy of the all-powerful Lord, gives Him delight and will be for the redemption of those who take refuge in Him. The prime qualities of the Lord arc jnanam, sakti and karunya. Of these, jnana and sakti are common for both &lsquo;nigraha&rsquo; and &lsquo;anugraha&rsquo; but &lsquo;karunya&rsquo;</p>
<p>Siddhopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>
<p>233</p>
<p>is uniquely responsible for &lsquo;anugraha&rsquo; alone.</p>
<p>The infinite compassion of the Lord is the prime cause for (1) the nature and existence of all the three kinds of chetanas and achetanas; (2) the creation of the world; (3) the promulgation of the Shastras; (4) the enlightenment of the knowledge relating to tattva, hita and purushartha; (5) the origination of an aspiration for liberation; (6) redeeming the erring humanity that seek refuge in Him; (7) functioning in the place of an upaya for one who is an &lsquo;akinchana&rsquo;; (8) ignoring and excusing infinite faults of the chetanas that take refuge with Him on account of the mere &lsquo;vyaja&rsquo; or pretext of bhakti and prapatti; (9) granting His infinite bliss of communion after terminating once for all their migration from birth to birth; (10) causing repentence in the minds of the prapannas for the faults committed intentionally and making them observe some expiation according to their competence (11) purifying such hardliners that do not repent by inflicting light punishments and leading them to His eternal abode. For all these, the compassion of the Lord is the prime cause.</p>
<p>The Lord of this nature viz. &lsquo;krupavishista&rsquo; is the &lsquo;siddhopaya&rsquo; or ever realised means. An aspirant after moksha, is enjoined to seek refuge with Him. This is something which ought to be done for being saved. Though Ishvara is most supreme and He may do whatever He likes, He is full of compassion and one should appeal to His compassion to get over his nigrahas. If His wrath is removed, His natural compassion flows spontaneously. So, the means of shakti and prapatti are &lsquo;sadhyopayas&rsquo; that are pretexts to awaken His mercy. So, these upayas are to be practised as ordained.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>II. Doubts that arise in respect of the inherent relationship</p>
<p>between Paramatman and the chetanas are cleared as follows:</p>
<p>The Ishvara is the &lsquo;sheshin&rsquo; and we are the &lsquo;sheshabhutas&rsquo;. We are just like infants and He is entitled to protect us just like a mother protects the infants. When our relationship is like this, does it befit our essential nature to cry bitterly or to perform &lsquo;atma-samarpanam&rsquo; - self-surrender for protection, just like giving wages for the breast-milk of the mother, or to desire that He should save us, and to have supreme faith in Him Should we not simply keep quiet being aware of this relationship?</p>
<p>Vedanta Desika points out that by such doubts, the objecters are trying to efface the accessories of the &lsquo;sadhyopaya&rsquo; viz. prapatti, through the &lsquo;siddhopaya&rsquo;. It is pointed out that great sages and Bhagavan Ramanuja and other great masters have surrendered unto the Paramatman with supreme faith, and prayer to be protected, and that they have also taught others that one should surrender at the feet of the Lord, and they have also shown scriptural authorities for the same. It is stoutly stated that though the relationship of &lsquo;sheshitva&rsquo; is eternal, in respect of those who are under the domination of karma, the Lord would not protect one without one&rsquo;s performance of some &lsquo;sadhyopaya&rsquo;. As all these are ordained by the shastra, one has to abide by this. If we do not give heed to the shastra, even the relationship of &lsquo;shesha-sheshi&rsquo; will not be established. So, it is to be understood that the fact that the Lord is entitled to protect one on account of the relationship with the jiva, and that the jivatman being a &lsquo;shesha-bhuta&rsquo; is not capable of protecting himself, is merely pointing out the</p>
<p>Siddhopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>
<p>235</p>
<p>appropriateness, as observed in the world. But, by this alone, it is not to be taken that He would be a &lsquo;nirapeksha-karana.&rsquo; If it is taken like that, it results in the eventuality of all people being eternally liberated. If it is stated that the Lord can do so on account of his svatantrya, then the Lord will be subjected to the defects of partiality and cruelty.</p>
<p>If these truths are to be established only on the basis of reasons, then they would desire for only &lsquo;sambandha jnanam&rsquo;. It cannot be said that &lsquo;rakshapeksha&rsquo; is not necessary. Non-sentient objects, animals, birds and infants are, as bereft of desire for being protected, without the knowledge of &lsquo;sambandha&rsquo; or relationship. We are seeing that they are being protected. If it is said, though we are seeing like this, that sambandha-jnana is essential as ordained by the shastra, then the particular kind of jnana of the form of &lsquo;anushtana also should be accepted.</p>
<p>If it is argued that when the Lord rushes to protect one, one should not ward him away, and the Lord&rsquo;s protection will be actualised, and this kind of &lsquo;anivarana&rsquo; is only what is wanted, we say, it is not so; because, the Lord may grant moksha to a chetana, when he is not capable of warding Him away, such as in the state of &lsquo;sushupti&rsquo; and others. It cannot be further said that if one does not prevent Him from rendering protection, when he is capable of doing so, is only what is wanted, that is also countered by the instance of protection given to non-sentient objects and reluctant animals, children and others. The following verse is quoted as an authority for non-performance of any means of protection :</p>
<p>ये नाथवन्तो हि भवन्ति लोके ते नात्मकार्याणि समारभन्ते ।</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>तेषां हि कार्येषु भवन्ति नाथाः</p>
<p>शैब्यादयो राम यथा ययातः ॥</p>
<p>The meaning of this verse is that those people who have a master, do not make any effort to save themselves. Those masters themselves will look after them.</p>
<p>Desika points out that the term &lsquo;natha&rsquo; used here signifies both prayer for protection and &lsquo;atma-nikshepa&rsquo;. The idea is when one has entrusted the responsibility of one&rsquo;s protection to the master, he will not engage himself in any kind of self-help. The term &lsquo;nachavantah&rsquo; signifies so much meaning, and otherwise it will become untenable to apply what all is said in &lsquo;loka-nceti&rsquo; to moksha-shastra.</p>
<p>यदर्थस्तु कृतो न्यासः तदर्थं न पुनः किया । पूर्वमप्यपराधीनप्रवृत्तौ अस्य नान्वयः ।।</p>
<p>The meaning of this verse is, a person, who has totally surrendered the burden of his protection to the Lord, is not entitled to function in his protection. Even in the earlier stage, what he did in entrusting the burden of his protection, was not solely on account of himself but was caused by the all merciful Lord on account of some casual good done by him knowingly or unknowingly. Thus, Desika has pointed out that when the Lord, the all protector, protects one, he causes him to undertake some means as a pretext, and saves him from samsara. This infinite grace of the Lord that spontaneously flows, depends upon the desire of the aspirant, just as the suickling of an infant for the breast-milk of the mother.</p>
<p>So, it is concluded by Desika chat some kind of spiritual</p>
<p>Siddhopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>
<p>237</p>
<p>discipline or other is absolutely necessary for awakening the grace of the Lord. III. Doubts that arise in connection with the inherent</p>
<p>relationship of Goddess Sri with the Supreme Paramatman, Sriman Narayana, are dispelled further.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord who has taken upon himself the responsibility of saving erring humanity, is declared to be such a protector along with Goddess Sri –</p>
<p>लक्ष्म्या सह हृषीकेशः देव्या कारुण्यरूपया । रक्षकः सर्वसिद्धान्ते वेदान्तेषु च गीयते ॥</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is declared as a protector, along with Goddess Lakshmi, who is an incarnation of compassion, according to all doctrines and vedanta. Here, the dvaya mantra also has the term &lsquo;Srimath&rsquo; both in the &lsquo;poorva&rsquo; and &lsquo;uttara&rsquo; khanda. Some masters are of the opinion that the word &lsquo;Srimath&rsquo; in the &lsquo;poorva&rsquo; khanda, is an &lsquo;upa-lakshana&rsquo; or indication, and the same term in the &lsquo;uttara&rsquo; khanda is a &lsquo;visheshana&rsquo; or an inseparable attribute. Thus, the same term &lsquo;Srimath&rsquo; is explained differently in the two contexts.</p>
<p>Desika points out that it is not tenable to give different implications for the same term that qualifies the term Narayana&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If it is pointed out that considering &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; also along &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo;, leads to the eventuality of &lsquo;upaya-dvitva&rsquo; and is opposed to the concept of &lsquo;ananyopayatva&rsquo; of the Lord, it is stated by Desika, that on the grounds of the same reason &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; should also be considered as an &lsquo;upalakshana&rsquo; alone, cven in the &lsquo;uttara&rsquo; khanda, lest ananyaprapyatva&rsquo; is not harmed. If it is conceded that &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; may be only an &lsquo;upa-lakshana&rsquo; in</p>
<p>238</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>both places, then it results in the eventuality of the auspicious qualities, auspicious divine form of the Lord, and the divine functions, all becoming &lsquo;upa-lakshanas&rsquo;. If it is further argued that the qualities, divinc form and actions are &lsquo;visheshanas&rsquo;, as they are helpful, it has to be known that, in the same way, as it is helpful, the relationship with &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; is also to be taken as &lsquo;visheshana&rsquo;. All these can be ascertained by the means of valid knowledge and the unbroken tradition or &lsquo;sampradaya&rsquo;. The Alwars have said that Goddess Lakshmi dispels all sins, and they pray for the grace of the Lord and the grace of Goddess Mahalakshuni. The Ramayana points out that Mother Sita is capable of giving protection. The great masters of yore have described the greatness and glory of Goddess &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; as &lsquo;संसारार्णवतारिणी&rsquo;, &lsquo;आत्मविद्या च देवीत्वं विमुक्तिफलदायिनी,&rsquo; &lsquo;यामालंब्य सुखेनेमां दस्तरं हि गुणोदधिं&rsquo; । निस्तरन्त्यचिरेणैव व्यक्तध्यान परायणाः ॥</p>
<p>It can be known from all these references that the term &lsquo;Srimath&rsquo; is the &lsquo;visheshana&rsquo; of the Supreme Paramatman just as the auspicious divine form and auspicious qualities are &lsquo;visheshanas&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Desika summarises all these thoughts in the following verses :</p>
<p>भरस्वीकाररहितं रक्षासंकल्पवर्जितम् । गुणादिकमिहेष्टं हि शरण्यस्य विशेषणम् ॥ ऐकरस्यजुषोश्शेषिदम्पत्योस्सर्वकर्मसु । विशेषणविशेष्यत्वं श्रुतं कस्मान्न रोचते ॥ प्रतर्दनादि विद्यासु वेद्येऽपि परमात्मनि । अचेतनवविच्छामः चेतनं च विशेषणम् ।</p>
<p>Siddhopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>
<p>239</p>
<p>इत्थं प्रपत्तिविद्यायां तत्तन्मन्त्रानुसारतः ।. विभुः पत्न्या गुणाद्यैश्च विशिष्टो विषयोऽत्र नः।</p>
<p>The auspicious qualities like supremacy, compassion and others as well as his Divine form, that are bereft of any resolution to protect or accepting the burden of protection, are admitted as &lsquo;visheshanas&rsquo; of the redeemer. Why does not this fact of Sriman Narayana having Goddess Lakshmi as an inseparable visheshana, that is known from the Srutis, appeal to you? The Divine Couple have mutual agreement and same purpose in all their actions and never differ even in the slightest measure in anything. In the type of meditations such as meditation upon Indra Prana, taught to Pratardana, though Paramatman alone is to be meditated upon, the chetana i.e. Indra is desired as a visheshana just like a non sentient object.</p>
<p>Thus, in Prapatti, the means of spiritual perfection to be performed according to the respective mantras, the Paramatman characterised with His consort Mahalakshmi and His auspicious qualities, is the one to whom the burden of protection is to be entrusted with supreme faith.</p>
<p>It may not be doubted that &lsquo;upayaikya&rsquo; or oneness of upaya, would be harmed, if Sri is also included in the upaya. Desika explains this fact as follows :</p>
<p>As it is explicit in the term Narayana' and &lsquo;charana&rsquo; that the upaya is only one as characterised by gunavishesha and vigraha-vishesha, even in the same way, He happens to be nityapatnisambandha-visishta and so, there is no eventuality of upaya-dvitva. It is to be noted here, that the glory of Paramatman is enhanced by the attribute of the form of Sri,</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>that Paramatman Himself is of unsurpassable glory on account of His own essential nature. His auspicious nature is svabhavasiddha and He is &lsquo;ananyadheena-kalyanam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It may be noted that they are mutually glorifying each other, and so, the supremacy of Paramatman does not become diminished if it is qualified by Goddess Sri.</p>
<p>The Divine Couple are the sheshins and all others are subservient to them.</p>
<p>As in sacrifices, duality of deities such as Indra-Vishnu, etc., are invoked together and offered oblations, likewise, these two together form one single Divinity. Wherever there is a mention of Paramatman &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; is also included in it.</p>
<p>tufara rai a certa faufa' say our masters.</p>
<p>So, it is concluded by Desika that it is to be reflected upon that &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; is a visheshana to Narayana in the purva khanda also, and that Narayana characterised by &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; is the upaya, and thus the Divine Couple together happen to be our upaya to be sought.</p>
<p>Sadhyopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>
<p>241</p>
<p>CHAPTER - XXIV</p>
<p>Sadhyopaya Shodhanadhikara Though it has been declared that Bhakti Yoga and Ptipathi are both valid means for attainment of spiritual perfection by savants of yore, Prapatti has become the practical religion of Srivaishnavism after the time of Bhagavan Ramanuja. Ramanuja gave full emphasis to Prapatti and propounded it as a sufficient and valid means of attainment of godhead. Ramanuja did not deny importance to Bhakti Yoga or Upasana. He upheld stoutly the doctrine of Upasana as a &lsquo;mokshopaya&rsquo;, in his Sri Bhasyham, Vedartha Sangraha, Gita Bhashya and others ; and likewise, he propounded the doctrine of Prapatti in his three &lsquo;Gadyas&rsquo;.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prapatti has supreme importance in shaping the fortune</li>
</ol>
<p>of the multitudes of finite selves and it is to be thoroughly understood so that one may not have any doubt about this doctrine. One should have a through knowledge of Siddhopaya, and likewise, one should also understand thoroughly the means of Prapatti that is to be adopted. Vedanta Desika has dispelled all doubts that may arise about the nature of Prapatti, the accessories and competency of Prapatti, in this section viz. Sadhyopaya Shodhanadhikara. This happens to be a powerful vindication of the doctrine of Prapatti and is of prime importance.</p>
<p>It is argued by some that Prapatti is not within the competency of all people, as it is a vedic-dharma. It is restricted to the upper three classes as it is considered as a242</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>Yaga Vishehsa or a kind of sacrifice. The answer to this objection is that the above view is not in agreement with the scriptural declaration of Swetaswathara Upanishad, which describes that the Supreme Paramatman is the one refuge for all humanity.</p>
<p>सर्वस्य प्रभुमीशानं सर्वस्य शरणं सुहृत् (9.3. 3-17) मुमुक्षु शरणमहं प्रपद्ये</p>
<p>(1.3. 6-18) Hamai ver signifies that all castes and creeds are included in having competency for this means. Statements such as -</p>

<p>प्रपन्नार्तिहरं विष्णुं शरणं गन्तुमर्हसि ॥ &ldquo;Lord Vishnu is a refuge for all people and and the means of surrender is fit for all without any rigour and which is without an equal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The statement PM Mishi includes in its purview, the three castes viz. kshatriya, vaisya and sudra. Prapatti is a &lsquo;samanya dharma&rsquo; which is universal to all. The vedic injunctions are of two kinds viz. Universal dharmas and particular dharmas and as Prapatti happens to be &lsquo;samanya dharma&rsquo;, just like &lsquo;sathya vachana&rsquo; (or speaking the truth), it is applicable to all. As there are distinct statements declaring the competency of one and all without any restriction of caste and others, Prapatti is meant for all. There are no restrictions in the general statements regarding practice of Prapatti as in the case of Upasanas. This Praparti is certainly for one who has &lsquo;akinchanya&rsquo;, whether one is a talulah or not.</p>
<p>Sadhyopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>

<p>The Lord Himself has declared,</p>
<p>स हि पार्थ व्यपाश्रित्य येऽपि स्युः पापयोनयः । स्त्रियो वैश्यास्तथा शूद्राः तेऽपि यान्ति परां गतिम् ॥</p>
<p>(गीता - 9-32) 2. Regarding the nature Prapatti, it is declared that it is</p>
<p>supreme faith alone in the Supreme Lord' &lsquo;नारायणं सलक्ष्मीकं प्राप्तुं तच्चरणद्वयम् । उपाय इति विश्वासः द्वयार्थः शरणागतिः &lsquo;IOn the basis of this, it is argued that Prapatti is only of the form of Supreme Faith and so, no act other than having faith, is necessary.</p>
<p>The answer to this argument is that Maha Vishvasa&rsquo; is emphasised in the above verse to point out its importance for becoming competent for performance of Prapatti, and also as it is an accessory to Prapatti. The meaning of this is -</p>
<p>सकृत् प्रार्थनामात्रेण अपेक्षितं दास्यतीति विश्वासपूर्वकं प्रार्थनम् इति यावत् ॥</p>
<p>That means, &ldquo;by merely submitting a prayer once, the Lord will grant our wishes - having faith like this, one should pray to the Lord.&rdquo; Here prayer is prefaced with supreme faith to point out &lsquo;vishvasa-poorvaka-prarthana&rsquo;. &lsquo;Atma Nikshepa&rsquo; is the main factor and others are accessories, as known from the statement &lsquo;न्यासः पञ्चाङ्गसंयुतः | The Lord will be expecting the expression of desire to be protected and so the supreme importance of faith is ordained in this. Ramanuja mentions this in his Sriranga Gadya as - &lsquo;PRIGRI दास्यतीति विश्वासपूर्वक भगवन्तं नित्यकिंकरतां प्रार्थये&rsquo; | And as he</p>
<p>244</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Şaram</p>
<p>concludes there as &lsquo;Thisted&rsquo; surrendering of the self is also established.</p>
<p>Here the fact of supreme faith is denoted as an accessory to the surrender of the atman that is mentioned later. In Vaikunatha Gadyam, it is expressly mentioned that &lsquo;Atma Nikshepa&rsquo; should be preceded by &lsquo;prarthana&rsquo; or prayer. The main factor of the surrender of the atman is expressly mentioned in all these authorities viz. -</p>
<p>&lsquo;अनेनैव तु मन्त्रेण स्वात्मानं मयि निक्षिपेत्&rsquo;, &lsquo;आत्मात्मीय भरन्यासः&rsquo; &lsquo;प्रपत्तिं तां प्रयुञ्जीत स्वांगैः पञ्चभिरावृताम्&rsquo;, &lsquo;न्यासः पञ्चागसंयुतः&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>&lsquo;These ordain that &lsquo;Atma Nikshepa&rsquo; alone is the main factor, and others are accessories to it. There are a number of authorities that affirm the fact of the cultic act of surrender of the atman to the Lord and &lsquo;matia-vishvasa&rsquo; or supreme faith, is an accessory to such an act. Without the surrender actually taking place, and by having a mere desire for being protected, cessation of one&rsquo;s own activity for one&rsquo;s protection, does not occur. So, it is the essence of all shastras that mere supreme faith does not signify Prapatti, but self surrender with faith is the sure way of one&rsquo;s protection. &lsquo;अकृते तु भरन्यासे रक्षापेक्षणमात्रतः । पश्चात् स्वयत्नविरतिः न प्रसिध्यति</p>
<p>Mandal&rsquo;ll 3. It is argued by some that full understanding of one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>relationship with the Lord, is exactly what is going to redeem him, and there is no need for Prapatti to be enjoined. When one realises the secret teachings of the shastras, he will reflect upon his subservience to the Lord. Is it not said that one should always remember one&rsquo;s subservience and the over lordship of the</p>
<p>Sadhyopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>
<ol start="245">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Paramatman, if one wants to uplift himself, and fulfil the purpose of his existence. &ldquo;स्वोजीवनेच्छा यदि ते स्वसत्तायां स्पृहा यदि । आत्मदास्यं हरे: स्वाम्यं स्वभावं च सदा स्मर&rdquo; ॥</p>
<p>Knowing this reality of the Lord being the Master and the jivatman being subservient to Him, one is asked to behave in accordance with this understanding. Is there a different factor that is to be enjoined as surrender of the self, apart from this ? Desika points out that this objection is not tenable just like the view of some that say moksha is possible on account of mere understanding of the meaning of the &lsquo;mahavakyas&rsquo; (i.e. Vakyajanya Jnanamatram) or the significant statements like That Thou art&rsquo;.</p>
<p>When a person has committed the sin of stealing away the atman, the expiation of that is, offering the atman at His feet. This fact of subservience to the Lord is an understanding that should qualify an aspirant after moksha. This &lsquo;sheshatva-jnanam&rsquo; will certainly prevent from stealing away the atman from the Lord later.</p>
<p>&lsquo;शिष्टं ह्यात्मापहारस्य निष्कृतिः स्वभरार्पणम् । परशेषत्वधीमात्रं अधिकारि विशेषणम् ॥ पश्चादात्मापहारस्य निरोधाय च कल्पते&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>For a person who has realised the knowledge of &lsquo;sheshatva&rsquo; that is obtained from the shastras, it is ordained that he should surrender his self unto the Lord, having supreme faith in the saving grace of the Lord, along with the desire for gaining moksha at a particular time.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>Even the statement TASHKL uTaTr&rsquo; implics the practice of some spiritual discipline as prescribed in statement like &lsquo;HA TH&rsquo;; USEctc.</p>
<p>This is summarised in the following verse : &lsquo;ज्ञानान्मोक्षोपदेशे हि तत्पूर्वोपासनादिना । उपासनादिरूपाद्वा ज्ञानान्मोक्षो विवक्षितः ॥</p>
<p>The intention of the statement - there is liberation from knowledge – is that moksha is gained through upasana or Prapatti that is done, after gaining that knowledge. Mere &lsquo;sheshatva&rsquo; jnanam that is gained from the shastras, is common to all disciplines for liberation, such as Prapatti and Upasana. The ultimate state of purushartha for mumukshu, is kainkarya or loving service to the Lord and it is not possible to practise a mokshopaya without having a &lsquo;sheshatva-jnanam&rsquo;. Even when one practises a dharma for gaining moksha, without having that &lsquo;sheshatva-jnana&rsquo;, those dharmas themselves will cause sheshatva-jnanam&rsquo; and make perfect his discipline for moksha.</p>
<p>So, the mokshopaya is – swa-raksha-bhara-nyasa – characterised by sheshatva-jnanam. The injunctions viz. &lsquo;Rui as&rsquo;, &lsquo;wafa ai sesita&rsquo; expressly ordain that Prapatti should be performed. 4. Sometimes, it is argued that the charma-sloka&rsquo; indicates</p>
<p>that Ishvara is the means of attainment of moskha and nothing more is ordained in this behalf. If it is taken thus, it would amount to mere instruction of the truth that would be helpful to Bhakti Yoga. If it is further argued that for a person who is endowed with the knowledge of</p>
<p>Sadhyopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>
<p>247</p>
<p>reality, cessation of activities for self-protection happens to be Prapatti, and therefore, what is prescribed here is the abandonment of &lsquo;sarva-dharmas&rsquo;. The reply is that the abandonment of all dharmas verily happens to be - &lsquo;swarakshanarthaswa-vyapara&rsquo; - i.c. his activity meant for his protection, and therefore, it contradicts his own statement, and also the injunction that one should surrender with all accessories to the Lord.</p>
<p>If prapatti is taken as a means Her or if it is taken as a helpful factor to the means already realised (FHSHTETE Hochfre) then it would be opposed to the nature of the supreme means or &lsquo;Ishwara&rsquo;, who is declared as the one means of liberation. The oneness, the nature of being already realised, the supreme consciousness, the supreme compassion, the omnipotence and the fact of not depending upon any other factor for protection, · such particular characteristics of Ishvara, will be harmed. (Fotora, fara, परमचेतनत्व, परम कारुणिकत्व, सर्वशक्तित्व and निरपेक्षत्व)</p>
<p>This position is not valid because, it is opposed to Srutis, the Smritis and also as this does not apply in all cases, If it is insisted upon these arguments, as valid reasons, then the &lsquo;sadhana-bhava&rsquo; or the fact of being spiritual disciplines that are accepted, will have to be taken as disturbed. Even the upasanams will have to lose their sadhanatva. If it is said that upasana is not at all a sadhana, then it contradicts their own interpretation of the term &lsquo;sarva-dharman-parityajya&rsquo; where upasana is included in the term &lsquo;sarva-dharman&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As Prapatti or sharana-varana, is also called by the name dharma&rsquo; just like &lsquo;upasana&rsquo;, is not this also to be discarded to fulfil the significance of the term &lsquo;sarva&rsquo;? This also is included</p>
<p>248</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>in the group of dharmas; so, how can one have an idea of sadhana in Prapatti ? Or, how can Prapatti be a sahakari to the ever realised means i.e. sidda-sadhana or Paramatman ?</p>
<p>It is admitted that one should give up the idea of the direct means in Prapatti as well as in Bhakti Yoga. But, in the form of prasadanatva' or awakening the grace of the Lord, &lsquo;dharmatva&rsquo; or the fact of being a means, should not be abandoned. In that case, one should have to give up the sadanatva-buddhi in the siddhopaya also, as the Lord is called &lsquo;Krishnam-Dharmam-Sanatanam&rsquo;. If it is asked how &lsquo;Bhakti&rsquo; or &lsquo;Prapatti&rsquo; are upakarakas to siddhopaya, who is eternal and of the same form always; always perfect and having the qualities of natural compassion and others, it is replied that these means are effective in removing the wrath of the Lord, which is the cause of migration and which is caused on account of beginningless transgression of the command of the Lord. For an aspirant after moskha, who adopts the sadhyopaya according to his ability, the Lord on that pretext itself-will cause the removal of diminution of knowledge, etc., and grant him the benefit of His eternal service for all time to come. Therefore, it is quite appropriate to expound that &lsquo;the destruction of all sins and the granting of paripuma kainkarya&rsquo; is on account of the siddhopaya or ever realised means i.e. Paramatman, and that this supreme benefit accrues on account of some sadhyopaya such as &lsquo;bhakti&rsquo; or &lsquo;prapatti&rsquo;. 5. It is sometimes argued like this –</p>
<p>Let Prapatti be a pretext for awakening the mercy of the Lord; but, where is the need for the shastra to prescribe it?</p>
<p>A person who is in trouble, and who cannot protect himself, naturally approaches a near-by person for help.</p>
<p>Sadhyopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>
<p>249</p>
<p>Then, if a person is aware of Ishvara from the shastra, he will naturally seek His protection, and there is no need for the shastra to prescribe it.</p>
<p>Desika points out that it is an &lsquo;athivada&rsquo; based on &lsquo;ouchitya&rsquo; or appropriateness. He gives the illustration of a person seeking refuge with another person in this world. Hc understands first of all, how he should approach a person for getting a favourable response, and then seeks his refuge. Even in the case of Prapatti, one should understand carlier how he should seek refuge with the Lord, and how the Lord would protect one approaching like that, and for knowing this, there is no &lsquo;pramana&rsquo; other than the shastras. If, by the inference that Lord would protect &lsquo;us if we seek Him, it would be applicable to all who have an awareness of godhead, and the shastras prescribing upasana and others would become futile. It cannot be known from inference that a capable person could practise upasana, whereas an incapable personi might resort to the means of Prapatti. It is only from shastras that we can understand that Prapatti is a sufficient and capable substitute to Bhakti Yoga. If one undertakes such deeds ignoring the shastras, he would be committing offences, as all the particulars of Prapatti, are to be known from the shastras alone. It is to be admitted that Prapatti along with its accessories is to be prescribed by the shastras for the guidance of the aspirants on account of the above reasons. 6. Though it is ordained by the shastras that one may</p>
<p>adopt Prapattı or Upasana in accordance with one&rsquo;s own ability, it is mentioned by some that upasana or Bhakti Yoga is opposed to the essential nature of the jivatman, who is utterly subscrvient to Paramatman. Desika says that this is also intended to praise Prapatti.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>250</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>It cannot be said that the practice or Upasana or Prapatti, is opposed to the essential nature of the atman, which is eternal. As in the case of kainkarya, even in practice of Prapatti or Bhakti Yoga, there is &lsquo;Bhagavadadhinakartrutva&rsquo; or doership subordinated to, or given by the Lord, as propounded by the Brahmasutras, and so, it cannot be said that the essential nature of the jivatman is &lsquo;atyanca-nirvyapara&rsquo; or totally devoid of any kind of doership. In that case, it will become a non-entity. It cannot be said that &lsquo;sannidhimatra&rsquo; or mere presence is the function of the atman, without even enjoyership, in which case, the world becomes unreal and there will not be even an aspiration for liberation. So, it cannot be said that upasanas are &lsquo;svarupa-viruddha&rsquo; on account of the absence of kartrutva as in the case of the sankyhas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not said&rdquo;, it may be asked, &ldquo;that wealth comes to one who refrains from any action and one who follows karma cannot even get a sip of water to drink?&rdquo; This also does not speak of the fucility of the means prescribed by the shastras, but emphasises that the results of karmas done earlier cannot be escaped.</p>
<p>Moreover, upasanas are not of the nature of binding one to samsara, as kamya and prohibited actions, that are caused by desire and others causes, are. It cannot be said that upasanas are svarupa-viruddha on the authority of the shastras. 7. It may be further argued thus –</p>
<p>&ldquo;The atman is distinct and different from the body. So, vama and asramas are not in the essential nature of the atman. The duties of the varna and sramas and the means that are</p>
<p>Sadhyopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>
<p>251</p>
<p>related to the varnas and asramas are not to be taken up. So, why not we say that the dharmas that are on account of varnas and asramas, are opposed to the essential nature of the atman ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desika points out that this also is incompatible. A person is associated with a body characterised by brahminhood, and others, on account of his past karmas; though he understands that brahminhood and others are not in his essential nature, he has to perform the duties ordained by the shastras, so long as he is associated with such bodies, as he acts to satisfy hunger and thirst, according to his ability In the same way, he has to function for &lsquo;ishta-prapatti&rsquo; and &lsquo;anishta-nivritti&rsquo; as ordained by the shastras. So, it cannot be said that these duties are to be discarded as svarupa viruddha, on the basis of dehatmaviveka&rsquo;. It is only a person, who has the discriminatory knowledge of body and soul that is entitled to undertake spiritual discipline. The &lsquo;adhikara&rsquo; or competence for practice of these dharmas is the association with body characterised with brahminhood and others</p>
<p>There is no contradiction to upasana from the knowledge of body-soul discrimination because such dehatma-viveka is helpful for the practice of all dharmas.</p>
<p>Karma Yoga and others are performed with the help of the &lsquo;upadhis&rsquo; such as body and indriyas that are got due to karma and so are they not against the &lsquo;nirupadikasvarupa&rsquo; of the atman ? A counter question is put in this behalf. How are the factors of the essential nature of the atman and the meanings of dvaya-mantra and others known ? Are they not depending upon the mind and other &lsquo;upadhis&rsquo;? But yet, the atman is an urterly dependent entity being a &lsquo;shesha&rsquo; of Paramatman, and is not liable to protect himself. So, is it reasonable to enjoin on him to practise some means for his own protection Is it proper to call that means a252</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>sadhyopaya ? So, should we not say that Bhakti Yoga and others are not appropriate as they are not in accordance with &lsquo;sheshatva&rsquo; and also as they defile the essential nature of the atman and also as they are totally opposed to the utter dependence of the atnan upon Paramatman ?</p>
<p>This objection has been already cleared, as it leads to the eventuality of &lsquo;sarva-moksha&rsquo;. If the Lord were to liberate onc, even without considering any pretext done by him, everyone would have become liberated from beginningless time. If Ishvara is going to liberate one, merely on account of His supreme power, the defects of partiality and cruelty would happen to Him. Moreover, the scriptures that ordain &lsquo;mokshopaya&rsquo; or the means of liberation, would become futile. So, it becomes appropriate in adopting some means of liberation for the atman, and for the master to protect such a one, who verily belongs to Him.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>The performance of the varna-asrama-dharmas and also</li>
</ol>
<p>Bhakti Yoga, which has those dharmas as its accessories, is opposed, it is contended, to the essential nature of the atman, who has known that he exists only for the Paramatman. An exclusive devotee of this type is a &lsquo;shuddha Yajin&rsquo; and it is argued that such a person should not practise the duties of his varna and ashrama, as there is association of other deities like Agni, Indra,</p>
<p>Varuna and others.</p>
<p>Desika points out that this objection has come only due to want of a clear understanding of the conclusions taught in Sri Bhashya and other works of great masters. It is ordained that the one and the same Paramatman, who is the antaryamin' in all, is being worshipped through the worship of all deities. The Pratardana Vidya distinctly ordains that</p>
<p>Sadhyopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>
<p>253</p>
<p>the spiritual aspirant should mcditatc upon Brahman as having Indra and others as His body. There is no contradiction to exclusive devotion in the performance of varnasrama dharmas as cven all those names of deities directly connote the Supreme Paramatman and as a devotce worships through them the one Supreme Paramatman. 9. It may be further argued that upasanas are prescribed</p>
<p>in order to produce faith in the efficacy of the shastras, just like the &lsquo;abhicharikya kriyas&rsquo; that are meant for creating faith. The Supreme Paramatman happens to be the &lsquo;means&rsquo; and the goal'. So, prapacri alone is the means and never the upasanas.</p>
<p>Desika points out that this is untenable, as upasanas are not sources of evil as the &lsquo;abhicharika kriyas&rsquo; are. Upasanas are means of liberation and so they are valid.</p>
<p>Upasanas are not prescribed just to create a desire in the minds of the aspirants for the adoption of easier means. Success through an easier means causes faith in a more difficult means. The knowledge of the means or upaya, that is appropriate to the attainment of the prapya, is known from the shastras, and it cannot be decided on the basis of merc and independent &lsquo;yukti&rsquo; or reasoning. If the authority of the shastras is questioned as relating to upasanas, by parity of reasoning, the authorities prescribing Prapatti also become invalid. So, both Bhakti Yoga and Prapatti are valid means to mukti, as they have been enjoined by the shastras for different types of aspirants, according to their competence and ability 10. It cannot be said that upasanas are to be ignored, though they are ordained, as they are (fTenfus fatas) or</p>
<p>254</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>opposed to the practices of Ries, as we see that ancient masters like Parasara and others following them. It cannot be said that they are not suitable for the present times as people qualified for upasanas are difficult to be found. It is probable even in these days that such upasakas may be here and there practising meditation just like the great yogins of yorc. As there is no contradiction to upasanas it may be taken as a valid means for spiritual perfection.</p>
<p>A person who has chosen this path of Prapatti on account of his inability to practise Bhakti Yoga, and on account of his inability to wait for any length of time to attain moksha after exhausting all his &lsquo;prarabdha&rsquo; karmas by experience, is praised as one who has done what ought to be done, and as one who has performed the sacrifice. This nyasa vidya is glorified as follows :</p>
<p>Hraffaecal: TG1: HIC Machini नार्हन्ति शरणस्थस्य कलां कोटितमीमपि॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;The karma-yogins, bhakti-yogins and jnana-yogins - all these do not equal even one-croreth-part of a person who has sought refuge with the Lord.&rdquo; A person incapable of taking an ablution in a river for purifying himself, is ordained to have &lsquo;manasa-snanam&rsquo;, which is defined as &lsquo;manasam Vishnu-Chintanam&rsquo;. The merit of this manasa snanam is that it not only puts an end to other sins, but will also cause the bliss of Divine experience (Bhagavadanubhava Rasa). Likewise, this Prapatti, though prescribed for one who is not capable of undertaking upasanas, not only grants the fruits of upasana, but also evolves upward a person who is utterly helpless.</p>
<p>Having set aside the probable doubts and objections</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Sadhyopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>
<p>255</p>
<p>that can be raised in respect of the nature and efficacy of Prapatti, Desika dispels some of the misconceptions that might be entertained regarding the accessories of Prapatti as</p>
<p>follows :</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Is there any need for Anukulya sankalpa and others for</p>
<p>Prapatti' - it is asked. The Lord is ever compassionate and has given an assurance that he would not discard anyone that approaches Him, cven in the guise of a friend - &lsquo;SHICH HMI 449&rsquo; He does not see the defects of even cnemies. ' fcal Tau: Fa44' &lsquo;3721cfaalal a rruz&rsquo; I &ldquo;He is the refuge of all and he does not consider the Particulars of those that surrender unto Him&rdquo;. So, could it not be said that &lsquo;Anukulya sankalpa and others&rsquo; may be there or not, the Lord would anyhow protect one who surrenders unto Him.</p>
<p>Desika points out that these are very necessary as accessories at the time of Prapatti. But, at some further time, even if they do not continue, the Lord would not abandon him, but would save him by expiating his sin in some way or other. There are authorities that ordain these accessories along with the main act of surrender as in - &lsquo;: wahya:&rsquo;, &lsquo;afur Trifa&rsquo;, &lsquo;Fal:</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>' and others. Thus it is maintained that Anukulya Sankalpa and others are absolutely necessary at the time of Prapatti. Prapatti does not, however, require any other thing than these. Even Brahmastra requires its accessories.</p>
<p>The verse &lsquo;97: fagud 414837 7 faed 1 TB Has सर्वेषां सर्व कामफलप्रदा&rsquo; || points out that there is no nced of any other accessory than these.</p>
<p>LRG</p>
<p>256</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyaraya Saram</p>
<p>B. Is there anything like &lsquo;Maha-vishvasa&rsquo;, other than faith</p>
<p>in the shastras, that can be prescribed as an accessory? This objection is countered on two grounds:</p>
<p>First of all, the scriptural authorities prescribe &lsquo;maha vishvasa&rsquo; expressly as an &lsquo;anga&rsquo; to Prapatti. Secondly, it is pointed out that there are different degrees of faith that result in different fruits. So, it is essential that one should have supreme faith at the time of performance of Prapatti.</p>
<p>It is further asked whether the Lord would accept one, if his faith is not in its full measure at the time of Prapatti ? The answer is in the affirmative. The Lord gradually strengthens his faith and perfects it. There may be variation in the degree of faith but as prescribed in the shastras, maha vishvasa is a very necessary accessory to Prapatti. It is known from the following verse that there is variation in faith - &lsquo;यस्य यावांश्च विश्वासः तस्य सिद्धिश्च तावती । एतावानिति नैतस्य प्रभावः</p>
<p>Rated It C. It is questioned how Bhakti and Prapatti can give such</p>
<p>opposite results, such as worldly prosperity and moksha, according to the desire of the aspirants. As one Sows, so one reaps.</p>
<p>Desika points out that the shastras are the ultimate authorities in this behalf and it cannot be reasoned out otherwise. For a person interested in worldly gains, Bhakti and Prapatti become Pravritti Dharmas, and for a person who seeks the Holy Feet of the Lord alone, they become Nivritti Dharmas. These differences happen on account of the differences in the aspirants. It is thus established by the shastras that one can attain all kinds of aspirations through these means of Bhakti and Prapatti.</p>
<p>Sadhyopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>
<p>257</p>
<p>Seeing that Prapatti done for some worldly benefit becoming unsuccessful, some people doubt in the efficacy of Prapatti, which is a means of attaining all benefits. They must be enlightened properly, says Desika, by pointing out their lapse in respect of the performance of Prapatti. There might have been the absence of the necessary accessories like &lsquo;maha-vishayasa&rsquo; and others. There might have been &lsquo;kartru vaigunya&rsquo; of the form of absence of helplessness or &lsquo;akinchanya&rsquo;. There might have been lapse of performance of Prapatti, according to the shastras on account of the absence of &lsquo;sadupadesha&rsquo; from the Acharyas. It may be known that even worldly benefits are duly obtained if Prapatti is performed in the right way bereft of these lapses.</p>
<p>It is sometimes asked how Prapatti done only once can be the cause of the supreme benefit of attaining moksha, while savants like Vyasa have taught decidedly that the Lord should be constantly mediated upon.</p>
<p>अलोढ्य सर्वशास्त्राणि विचार्य च मुहुर्मुहुः इदमेकं सुनिष्पन्नं ध्येयो नारायणस्सदा॥</p>
<p>R.: AGI :&lsquo;&lsquo;Fida: Hadi fama&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having gone deeply into all shastras and having thought over again and again, this one &lsquo;Truth&rsquo; has been ascertained and that is that Sriman Narayana is to be meditated upon always&rdquo;; &ldquo;Sri Hari is to be meditated upon always by you&rdquo;; &ldquo;Vishnu should be remembered always&rdquo;. So should not we take that the charama shloka also as an accessory Prapatti for fulfilment of Bhakti Yoga, as it is found in ‘मामेव ये प्रपद्यन्ते मायामेतां तरन्ति ते&rsquo; which is clearly an &lsquo;anga</p>
<p>Prapatti&rsquo;.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p>Essencc of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>Desika points out that this also is not compatible, as Prapatti is enjoined as a main means (svatantra-prapatti) and as a substitute to Bhakti, as evidenced in the following authorities:</p>
<p>&lsquo;यद्येन कामकामेन न साध्यं साधनान्तरैः । मुमुक्षुणा यत् सांख्येन योगेन न च भक्तितः ।। प्राप्यते परमं धाम यतो नावर्तते यतिः । तेन तेनाप्यते तत्तन्यासेनैव महामुने । परमात्मा च तेनैव साध्यते पुरुषोत्तमः&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;That which is not possible of being gained by other sadhanas, all that which is desired by one, is gained by nyasa. That which cannot be gained through Jnana-Yoga, Karma Yoga or Bhakti-Yoga, can be gained by nyasa. The supreme abode of Paramatman also from where one will never more return to this world, is gained by nyasa alone. The Paramatman, the Purushottama, is also attained by nyasa alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;शरणं त्वां प्रपन्ना ये ध्यानयोगविवर्जिताः । तेऽपि मृत्युमतिक्रम्य यान्ति तद्वैष्णवं पदम्&rsquo; |</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who are without practice of &lsquo;Dhyana-yoga but who have surrendered unto you, even those people attain that Abode of Vishnu transcending rebirth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These authorities establish that Prapatti is an independent means to the attainment of moksha. One who is steadfast in this means will think of that Supreme Paramatman always as &lsquo;स्वतः प्राप्तम्&rsquo; and there is no contradiction between Dhyana and Prapatti. Though</p>
<p>Sadlıyopaya Shodhanadhikara</p>
<p>259</p>
<p>Dhyana-Yoga with all its accessories is not within the competence of all, one is entitled to think of the Lord according to one&rsquo;s competence. So long as he is placed in this world, he should remember the Lord always as ordained in the Gadya by Ramanuja as &lsquo;ततश्च प्रत्यहं आत्मोजीवनाय 994544&rsquo; | The medication in which a prapanna engages himself is not an upaya, but only the fruit of his Prapatti.</p>
<p>Thus, in this section, Desika has vindicated Prapatti as an independent and direct means to mukti, and has clearly established that both Bhakti-Yoga and Prapatti are valid means to the attainment of Paramatman, mcant for two different kinds of aspirants.</p>
<p>Desika has written a work Nikshepa-Raksha&rsquo; where he has raised nine objections against Prapatti and answered all of them clearly and established the validity of Prapatti.</p>
<p>Prabhava Vyavasthadhikara</p>
<p>261</p>
<p>CHAPTER - XXV</p>
<p>Prabhava Vyavasthadhikara The celebrated author of this treatise has expounded the doctrine of Prapatti along with all the accessories of it, in the first part comprising twenty two sections. In the two sections that follow the expositions of this doctrine, Desika has cleared all doubts that might arise regarding the siddhopaya and the sadhyopaya, and has established firmly the efficacy of this means, according to the scriptural authorities, and the continuing tradition of the Purvacharyas.</p>
<p>In this section, the author discusses about the eminence of those that adopt this means of spiritual perfection, and regulates the significance of this means by clearing the overtones and the undertones of this means. In this section - Prabhava Vyavasthadhikara - Desika regulates the exaggerated views about a Prapanna, and in the next section - Prabhava Rakshadhikara - Desika clears the views that under-estimate the greatness of this celebrated means. By this, the eminence of this means is expounded, as it exactly is, without either over-estimating or under-estimating it.</p>
<p>There are many statements that praise one who is solely devoted to Lord Vishnu. &ldquo;The fathers shout in joy and the forefathers dance, saying - A Vaishnava is born in our line, and he will emancipate us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Even gods cannot understand the greatness of a great person, who has supreme devotion towards the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desika points out here that &lsquo;Jathi&rsquo; or caste of a person is different from &lsquo;Kula&rsquo; or a class, characterised by certain</p>
<p>262</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>characteristics, and one should not be confused with the other. There is a statement -</p>
<p>न शूद्राः भगवद्भक्ताः विप्रा भागवताः स्मृताः । सर्ववर्णेषु ते शूद्राः ये ह्यभक्ताः जनार्दने।।</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devotees of the Lord are not &lsquo;shudras&rsquo;. They are known as &lsquo;bhagavathas&rsquo;. Those of all castes, who are not devotees of Lord Vishnu, are &lsquo;shudras&rsquo;. Here, the particular characteristics of devotion towards the Lord is considered to take one as belonging to the higher caste or belonging to a lower caste. On the basis of this, it is asked whether all devotees of the Lord, belong to the same caste ? All devotees, therefore, are to be considered as &lsquo;vipras&rsquo; or brahmins. The answer to this question is - It is not so. Desika quotes the view of Kidambi Appullar, that the equality pointed out in the above statement, is on account of &lsquo;Parama-Purusha-Samya&rsquo; and not in &lsquo;vyavahara&rsquo;. All shastras ordain certain disciplines to be followed by &lsquo;Bhagavata Brahmana&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bhagavata Shudra&rsquo;. So, the statement that a &lsquo;Bhagavata Brahmana&rsquo; and a &lsquo;Bhagavata Shudra&rsquo; are equal, is on account of the same &lsquo;purushartha&rsquo; being entertained by both, and not on account of the &lsquo;varna ashrama-vyavahara-samya&rsquo;. The statcment of Thirumangai Alwar that &lsquo;Bhakti&rsquo; endows &lsquo;Kula&rsquo; - is also commented upon by the great master in the same way. If a person who is belonging to a low caste, and of an inferior character, gains &lsquo;Bhagavata Sambandham&rsquo;, one should not think of him as low, belonging to a particular caste or quality. The eminence of devotion towards the Lord, is such; but, they are not having marriage alliance with others, because it is regulated by caste, and praise and veneration are on account of thePrabhava Vyavasthadhikara</p>
<p>263</p>
<p>virtue of devotion to the Lord. Here, Desika emphasises that all devotees of the Lord, are of one class viz. Bhakta Kula but they belong to their respective castes. One&rsquo;s &lsquo;Kula&rsquo; may change but the &lsquo;Jathi&rsquo; or caste, does not change. Desika points out that even the Heavenly Cow - Surabhi - docs belong to the class of a cow, and it will not change. The idea of the above verse is that Brahmins – who are bereft of devotion towards the Lord - are not to be regarded with respect. They must be treated as &lsquo;shudras&rsquo;. Similarly, &lsquo;shudras&rsquo; who are devotees of the Lord, should be praised like Brahmins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such statements, saying that an out-caste, who has pure character and devotion, should be known as &lsquo;Brahmin&rsquo; and an ascetic who has fallen from his vows should be known as an out-caste; a person - whose head has grown grey - should not be considered as &lsquo;elder&rsquo; but an youngster - who has gained knowledge should be considered as &lsquo;old&rsquo;, prescribing praise and censure, are meant for showing respect or otherwise. They should not be literally taken as such -</p>
<p>प्रतिपत्तिविशेषार्थं अन्यत्रान्यत्वकीर्तनम् ।</p>
<p>Mentioning in something, a quite different thing, such as &ldquo;thinking of an out-caste in a fallen brahmin, fallen ascetic, etc,&rdquo; is for showing particular respect or not showing respect.</p>
<p>The instance of &lsquo;Vidura&rsquo; is quoted sometime and Desika mentions that Vidura celebrated marriages according to his &ldquo;Jathi&rsquo;. The qualities of Vidura are extolled by Krishna and the performance of obsequies or Treat' by Dharmaraya, was on account of a special command - the &lsquo;ashariravani&rsquo; and it cannot be quoted as an instance of an admixture of</p>
<p>264</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyarraya Saram</p>
<p>castes. So, Desika concludes, that all castes are required to serve the Lord, according to their competency, without transgressing the code of conduct of their castes.</p>
<p>Desika cautions that it is not proper to argue on the basis of the unique characteristics and behaviour of Vidura and other great people, as well as the most celebrated Alwars of yore. The customs and behaviour that were prevalent in different yugas, cannot be taken as an example for our behaviour. Even when their behaviours are examined, it becomes clear that they did not transgress the regulations of their respective castes. They honoured the order of the &lsquo;Varna and Ashrama&rsquo; Dharma, and never repudiated it. In the statement &lsquo;Knowledge should be gained from a Brahmin or a Kshatriya or a Vysya or a Shudra&rsquo; – the idea is that the knowledge of the Supreme Paramatman, ought to be obtained from these various people in the case of the non availability of the foremost teachers; but, it is clearly mentioned that &lsquo;jnana-matram&rsquo; or mere knowledge is to be gained from these, and not &lsquo;Brahmopadesham&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It is pointed out that Vidura informed Dhrutharashtra that he was not competent to teach &lsquo;Brahma-Jnanam&rsquo; as he was born in the fourth caste. Tuladhara and Dharma Vyadha, and others, duly enlightened the &lsquo;Brahmins&rsquo; that approached them, regarding subtlety of &lsquo;Dharma&rsquo;; but, they did not perform the duties of an &lsquo;Acharya&rsquo;. They only guided them to proceed on the right lines.</p>
<p>There is this verse -</p>
<p>भक्तिरष्टविधा ह्येषा यस्मिन् म्लेच्छेऽपि वर्तते । तस्मैदेयं ततो ग्राह्यं सच पूज्यो यथा ह्यहम् &lsquo;॥</p>
<p>Prabhava Vyavasthadhikara</p>
<p>265</p>
<p>&ldquo;in whomsoever these cight kinds of &lsquo;Bhakti&rsquo; is found, even if he is a &lsquo;mlechha&rsquo;, to him should be given, and from him should be taken. &lsquo;He is to be worshipped even as myself.&rsquo; Here, that which is to be given and taken is explained as knowledge, and not &lsquo;matrimonial alliance&rsquo;. &lsquo;Pujyah&rsquo; is a general term and it implies that they should be regarded with respect, as laid down in the shastras.</p>
<p>Desika decidedly states that one should recognise &lsquo;Bhagavata Prabhavam&rsquo; without disturbing the order of varnas and ashramas. He quotes a verse in this behalf</p>
<p>&lsquo;वैष्णवत्वेन मान्यत्वं समानं मुनिसंमतम् । जात्यादिध्वंसतः साम्यं मुक्तकाले भविष्यति&rsquo; ।।</p>
<p>&ldquo;Equality and respectability in respect of being a devotee of Vishnu, are common and acceptable to sages; but, equality on account of destruction of the caste and others, does happen at the time of liberation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desika declares that though the regulations of the Varnashrama Dharma, and the order of behaviour, are binding upon all, there is no contradiction in showing respect and regard to all people who are &lsquo;Bhagavathas&rsquo;. Those people, who have such kind of single devotion towards the Lord, and who have surrendered unto Him, should be treated with respect. The greatness of a person, who has surrendered unto the Lord, is described as follows:</p>
<p>नारायणैकनिष्ठस्य या या वृत्तिः तदर्चनम् । यो यो जल्पः स स जपः तद्ध्यान यनिरीक्षणम् । तत्पादांबु अतुलं तीर्थ तदुच्छिष्टं सुपावनम् । तदुक्तिमा मन्त्र्याग्यं तत्स्पृष्टमखिलं शुचि॥</p>
<p>266</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>&ldquo;The actions of a person, who is steadfast in Narayana, is the worship of the Lord. Whatever he utters, is the sacred &lsquo;japa&rsquo;; whatever he witnesses is &lsquo;meditation&rsquo;. The water, washing his feet, is sacred &lsquo;thirtha&rsquo;; his leftovers are purificatory: the words, he utters are the foremost of &lsquo;mantras&rsquo;; whatever he touches, becomes pure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these verses, there is a general and sweeping application, which are to be restricted. The &lsquo;yritti&rsquo; of person devoted to the Lord, does not signify behaviour opposed to the shastras. Only such behaviour, which is not opposed to the shastras, should be taken as worship of the Lord. &lsquo;Yo-Yo Jalpah&rsquo; relates to the tattva, hita and Purushartha and not uncontrolled talk, harsh words and other such repugnant ones. The &lsquo;nirikshana&rsquo; does not refer to the witnessing of some prohibited objects; but, it signifies objects that are used for the worship of the Lord, and implies that they all appear as &lsquo;Brahmatmaka&rsquo;. &lsquo;Pada-thirtha&rsquo; is only to point out that the waters offered as worship to the feet of a &lsquo;Bhagavatha&rsquo;, that becomes celebrated. This does not mean any water that is casually touched by a &lsquo;Bhagavata&rsquo;. The &lsquo;uchhista&rsquo; or left-over has got a significant purpose. It may be food that may be remaining in the vessels used for cooking, and not the left over on the leaves (or &lsquo;Bhojana-patra&rsquo;). Only the &lsquo;uchhista&rsquo; of the Acharyas, is here intended. For some expiations, the &lsquo;Bhojana-patra-uchhista&rsquo; is prescribed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thadukti-matram&rsquo; signifies the statement of a great devotee, regarding the tattva, hita and purusharra, even in the local language, is to be received, reflected and practised; but, this does not refer to the worldly talk of no significance,</p>
<p>Tar-sprstam-akhilam-shuchi' signifies the touch that is prescribed at the time of &lsquo;mantropadesha&rsquo; or</p>
<p>Prabhava Vyavasthadhikara</p>
<p>267</p>
<p>&lsquo;vigrahapratishta&rsquo; or couch prescribed for healing the disease, or touch that is prescribed according to the shastras; but,. this does not signify the purification of things that are clearly prohibited.</p>
<p>Desika points out that if it is not regulated thus, it will be opposed to all shastras, and the practice of virtuous people, and it will lead one to great sin.</p>
<p>If this kind of regulation is not ordained, there will be contradiction to a number of shastras held valid by virtuous people, and also, it will be against the practice of the shastras. This kind of &lsquo;shastreeya-niyamana&rsquo; or regulation of the shastras, is not violated even by the great masters like Sri Nathamuni, Sri Yamunamuni and Bhagavan Ramanuja. The regulations that are prescribed by the vaidika smritis and the vedas, are not to be abandoned, because, it will be &lsquo;thamasa tyaga&rsquo; as pointed out by the Gita. So, all Prapannas, and other well-meaning people, should cngage themselves in these various duties with the reflection that they are devout servants to the Lord. These duties should be followed with the three kinds of &lsquo;tyaga&rsquo; viz. Kartrutva, Sambandha and Phala. So, these duties are to be performed with the reflection that these are meant for only pleasing the Lord. One should not have the idea that moksha is the &lsquo;phala&rsquo; of the performance of these duties; because, that is already realised by the grace of the Lord, when he entrusted earlier the responsibility of his protection to the Lord.</p>
<p>Desika describes here that the term &lsquo;parityajya&rsquo; in the charma-shloka, does not prescribe the abandonment of all duties (dharmas); but, it is only an indication that one should not involve oneself in means that are not possible of performing by him. The statement - tyaja dharmam</p>
<p>268</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>va</p>
<p>adharmam ca - means that one should give up the &lsquo;kamya karma&rsquo; and the prohibited deeds. the terms &lsquo;sathya&rsquo; and &lsquo;anrita&rsquo; in the statement &ldquo;tyaja-satyanrite significs that one should not aspire for &lsquo;atmanubhava&rsquo; and 4,9 9 RHCL त्यज' signifies that one should reflect that the कर्तृत्व in tyaga, is also dependent upon the Paramatman. By all these, it is established that there is no reason at all for the transgression of the divine command.</p>
<p>Some are under the illusion that even the commitment of intentional sins, does not taint a Prapanna. This is quite improper. The sins committed intentionally, never go without tainting that person. So, to say that intentional sins do not stick to him, is quite inappropriate.</p>
<p>Some have interpreted the statement – sarva papebhyomokshaishyami – as releasing one from all sins, including intentional sins committed after &lsquo;Prapatti&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This evidently shows that the intentional sins done after the Prapatti do cling to that doer. Even the Alwars have mentioned that one should desist from unbecoming deeds and sins. &ldquo;We shall not do what ought not to be done, and we will not utter harsh and cruel words&rdquo; - says Andal. &ldquo;Whatever fault I committed in speech, may be excused and considered as a virtue&rdquo; - says the Alwar. The gist of all this is, that there is a possibility of committing sins even after Prapatti, and that those sins taint the doer. That is why, a prayer has ensued to forgive them.</p>
<p>When such intentional sins occur, it is ordained that one should particularly pray to the Lord for forgiving those sins. The expiation of such sins is to perform a Prapatti for excusing these sins :</p>
<p>Prabhava Vyavasthadhikara</p>
<p>269</p>
<p>प्रायश्चित्तिरियं सात्र यत्पुनः शरणं व्रजेत् ।</p>
<p>पुनः प्रपद्यते नाथं अभिन्दन् लोकसंग्रहम् ।</p>
<p>From all these, it becomes established that there is a possibility of committing intentional sins, even after Prapatti. When such sins happen, one should repent and run to the Lord with a prayer to forgive those sins by performing a &lsquo;prayaschitha-prapatti&rsquo;. It is ordained that non-intentional sins only, do not taint him.</p>
<p>The statement of Nammalwar &lsquo;my devotees do not do that (sin), and if they do, they have done well&rsquo; - also proves that sins do taint one even after Prapatti. The statement &ldquo;they have done well&rdquo;, means, we by ourselves will forgive those sins if they are non-intentional. If they have done it intentionally, and if they do not seek forgiveness, we will clear those sins by inflicting punishments on them. We will not give them up at any cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It cannot be said that the Lord will not think of punishing one, who has indulged in intentional sins.</p>
<p>It cannot be said that, &ldquo;he will not be deprived of his object of attainment, even in case of not praying for forgiveness. There may be only absence of his affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This kind of argument is unsound. There is no greater loss, when one is deprived of the affection of the Lord. So, one will do well to observe some kind of expiation or other, of the form of praying excuse for one&rsquo;s faults, and performing surrender at the feet of the Lord. Even from the itihasas and puranams, this fact of praying excuse for the faults committed by one, is evident.</p>
<p>Desika concludes from all the above discussions that -</p>
<p>270</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyarraya Saram</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>a</p>
<p>Even for a Prapanna, there is possibility of intentional sins happening after Prapatti, on</p>
<p>account of &lsquo;prarabdha-karma&rsquo;. 2. In such case, one should repent and pray for</p>
<p>forgiveness. So long as a Prapanna is living in his body here, he has to follow the discipline prescribed for his varna and ashrama.</p>
<p>The Lord will necessarily take the Prapanna to His abode, purifying him after punishments, in case he does not pray for forgiveness. The glory of a Prapanna should not be overestimated but should be explained according to the dictates of the shastras, and the practice of ancient masters.</p>
<p>Prabhava Rakshadhikara</p>
<p>271</p>
<p>CHAPTER - XXVI</p>
<p>Prabhava Rakshadhikara</p>
<p>In the previous section, the glory of a Prapanna, and the greatness of the means of Prapatti, were regulated, and all overtones were set right. In this section, it is expounded that the eminence of this means of spiritual perfection, should not be under-estimated. By means of these two sections, the eminence of Prapatti is safeguarded and established, as it deserves.</p>
<p>It is declared that the &lsquo;sadhya-bhakti&rsquo; or Prapatti, is capable of destroying even a large part of the sins that have commenced to yield the results –</p>
<p>साध्यभक्तिस्तु सा हन्त्री प्रारब्धस्यापि भूयसी</p>
<p>The idea of this statement is that, by the unique power of this means, even the &lsquo;prarabdha-karma&rsquo; that has commenced to yield the results, would be destroyed according to the &lsquo;arthi&rsquo; or intensive desire for being released from bondage on the part of the &lsquo;sadhaka&rsquo; either in a moment or in a day or at the end of that life. A doubt may arise here. When a person has surrendered unto the Lord, should not the sorrows / causes of sorrow that are the results of some &lsquo;prarabdha karmas&rsquo;, also get destroyed ? Should not the Lord grant on his own accord, the subsidiary benefits such as &lsquo;Pankti Pavanarva&rsquo; and others, even un-asked, to be experienced here! As we see that this is not being experienced here, should we not take the statement Ma. Shuchah' only as an exaggerated praise of the means of Prapatti? If &lsquo;Ma-Shuchah&rsquo; signifies the destruction of all</p>
<p>272</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>sorrows, a person in this world, would not have been allowed to suffer sorrows and engage in causes that lead to sin. So, this statement is merely exaggerating the greatness of Prapatti.</p>
<p>The answer to this doubt is given as follows :</p>
<p>In fact, the Lord wills to grant liberation to a person, even when he utters the sentence of surrender; but, according to the desire of the Prapanna, He places him in this world for sometime. If there would be no suffering of sorrow and others during the time, he would never gain &lsquo;vairagya&rsquo; and his desire for earthly pleasures would not at all go. He would not develop intense desire for experience of the Lord. The Lord verily says that He is going to take away the wealth of a person, whom we wants to bless –</p>
<p>यस्यानुग्रहमिच्छामि तस्य वित्तं हराम्यहम् । बान्धवैश्च वियोगेन सदा भवति दुःखितः । तेन दुःखेन संतप्तः यदि मां न परित्यजेत् । तं प्रसादम् करिष्यामि॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take away the wealth of one, when I desire to bless; he will be sorrowing on account of separation from his relatives; being tormented by such sorrows, if he does not abandon Me, I shower on him My Grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this, it becomes clear that the punishment that the Lord gives is verily grace showered on hard-hearted people for transforming them into intense devotees. Sorrows and others are verily bencficial in the sense that they will make him take a turn in life towards godliness. So, there is no exaggeration in the statement &lsquo;Ma-Shuchah&rsquo;.</p>
<p>0Prabhava Rakshadhikara</p>
<p>273</p>
<p>There is a statement as follows : तं मातापितृहन्तारं अपि पाति भवार्तिहा ।</p>
<p>It is said that the Lord would absolve even such grave sinners such as the killer of one&rsquo;s father or mother. What does this signify? The meaning of this verse should be followed properly. If this relates to the sins done prior to Prapatti, then there is no confusion; but, it cannot relate to the sinful deeds done after Prapatti. If such sins occur duc to prarabdha-karma' after Prapatti, then he has to seek forgiveness and surrender unto the Lord for expiation of that sin. This has already been pointed out earlier; but, when such slight defects occur, such persons should not be slighted and dishonoured at any cost. Though they are afflicted by certain handicaps, they should be considered as virtuous only. If not, it leads to &lsquo;Bhagavata-Apachara&rsquo;. ai geras dal 379 a fas' is a significant statement, which glorifies a Prapanna. The idea of this statement is that the eminence of a person who has the essential knowledge of Paramatman, cannot be measured even by the &lsquo;Nityasuris&rsquo;. This eminence should not be underestimated. So, even in the event of some defects happening to Bhagavatas, they should not be treated indifferently. This amounts to &lsquo;bhagavata-apachara&rsquo; and one should be very cautious in not committing this kind of sin against the devotees of the Lord.</p>
<p>From all these, it becomes established that -</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>those who are devoted to the Lord, are sure to attain moksha, even in the event of some faults happening to them, as they would be cxpiated by appropriate expiation or they would be cleared by the Lord, by inflicting mild punishments. There is no doubt at all</p>
<p>274</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>regarding the attainment of moksha for those who have surrendered unto the Lord;</p>
<p>those Prapannas who are bereft of any defect</p>
<p>whatsoever, gain moksha without delay 3. the eminence of a Prapanna is so great that even in the</p>
<p>case of certain defects happening to them, they should</p>
<p>. not be slighted; 4. If they are not treated with due respect it will lead to</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bhagavata-Apachara.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A number of quotations, as noted below, are quoted by some, and conclusions are drawn that though they are averse to the Lord, they would gain moksha, if they remember the names of the Lord, in whatever manner it may be:</p>
<p>सांकेत्यं पारिहास्यं च स्तोभं हेलनमेव च । वैकुण्ठनाम ग्रहणं अशेषापविनाशनम् ।।</p>
<p>Uttering the name of the Lord, either for some &lsquo;sanketha&rsquo; or humiliation or justing or for any other purpose, would destroy all sins.</p>
<p>हरिहरति पापानि दुष्टचित्तैरपि स्मृतः</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Hari is going to destroy all sins of one even if he is wicked, if His name is uttered.&rdquo; These and similar such statements are suggesting that the Holy Name of the Lord is purifying one, even though they are infected with sins. But, it does not mean that reciting the name of the Lord, for the very purpose of censuring the Lord, would cleanse him of all sins.</p>
<p>येद्विषन्ति महात्मानं न स्मरन्ति च केशवम् ।</p>
<p>Prabhava Rakshadhikara</p>
<ol start="275">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>न तेषां पुण्यतीर्थेषु गतिः संसर्गिणामपि॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who hate the Lord, and never remember Him with love, will not attain the highest object, even when they go to Holy places. The same fate for those who associate with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is sometimes asked whether one will get salvation by living in a Holy place, where the Lord is ever present. Will not even sinners attain moksha there?&rdquo; It is said. But, it is the conclusion of the shastras that &lsquo;Bhagavath-Kshetra Vasa&rsquo; is helpful to only those, who are not haters of the Lord. Mere living in a Holy place, will not be the cause of salvation; but, it may influence one to follow the spiritual discipline such as bhakti or prapatti, and attain moksha. If not, even those who are behaving disagreeably to the Lord, will have to gain moksha by merely dwelling at &lsquo;Bhagavath Kshetra&rsquo;. It may be possible that living in a Holy place may lead one, who is not engaged in activities opposed to shastras, to gain a clear vision and remember the Lord at the last moment. For &lsquo;Bhagavath-Pravanas&rsquo; or those who are devoted to the Lord, living in a Holy place, may be helpful to get rid of their defects and attain the Lord.</p>
<p>The offences that are committed in Holy places, will be having very devastating effects. Even this, is on account of the greatness of the Lord. The &lsquo;anukulya&rsquo; or being mostly agreeable to the Lord, would surely uplift an aspirant in some way or other, by getting rid of all faults, and the Lord would grant him his own abode, depending upon some pretext or other. If one is not devoted to the Lord, he cannot aspire to gain that Supreme benefit. So, one should be very cautious in one&rsquo;s thoughts, words and deeds.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>&lsquo;रागादिदूषिते चित्ते नास्पदी मधुसूदनः। न बघ्नाति रति हंसः कदाचित् कर्दमांभसि ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;The destroyer of the demon Madhu, the Supreme Lord, does not take resort in minds that are defiled by desire, passion, hatred and others. A swan will never take delight in marshy waters&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;कर्मणा मनसा वाचा यदभीक्ष्णं निषेवते । । तदेवापहरत्येनं तस्मात् कल्याणमाचरेत्&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>What onc indulges intensively through his mind, speech and actions, will itself overpower him. Therefore, one should always do only the good.</p>
<p>Thus, in this chapter, Desika has stoutly defended the greatness of Prapatti, and has expounded that a Prapanna should rest assured of the great benefit he would be getting after the fall of his body and that he should reflect upon the three Great Rahasyas, enshrining all the Supreme Truth.</p>
