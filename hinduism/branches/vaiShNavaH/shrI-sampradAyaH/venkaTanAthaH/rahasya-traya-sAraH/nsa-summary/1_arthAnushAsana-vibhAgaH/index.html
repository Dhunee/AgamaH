This cannot be considered as an integral part of the</p>
<p>introductory chapter being of the form of मङ्गलाचरणम् because the Upodghatha Adhikara commences with a Mangala beginning with the verse ‘3740197: stai</p>
<p>अनघां आचार्यसन्ततिं वन्दें । There are introductory verses and concluding verses for this chapter of Guruparampara Sara and so is an</p>
<p>independent chapter altogether. 3. In the conclusion also, there is no mention in the</p>
<p>colophon &ldquo;Sri Rahasyatraya sare Guruparampara Sarah&rdquo; On the other hand, it is mentioned as &lsquo;Guruparampara</p>
<p>Sarah Sampoornah&rsquo;. 4. It is expressly mentioned that Rahasyatraya Sara</p>
<p>comprises of 32 chapters as &ldquo;Muppachirandivai&rdquo;. 5. In the Anushasana Bhaga and in the Nigamanadhikara</p>
<p>there is no reference to this section. 6.</p>
<p>In the verses of Adhikara Sangraha, &ldquo;Ennuyir tandalittavarai saranampukku&rdquo; is not included in the scheme of &lsquo;Andadi&rsquo;.</p>
<p>On account of all these points, it is argued that this chapter of Guruparampara Sara is not an integral part of Rahasyatraya Sara. But, on the other hand, it is pointed out that though it is found like that, it is necessarily included in the Rahasyatraya Saram and goes together with the introductory chapter. The reasons are as follows : 1. In all manuscripts of Rahasyatraya Saram,</p>
<p>Guruparampara Sara has been included as a part of the</p>
<p>great work. 2. It is not separated from Rahasyatraya Sara, as some</p>
<p>other compositions like Sampradaya Parishuddhi and others. All preceptors teach Rahasyatraya Saram necessarily</p>
<p>commencing with Guruparampara Saram. 4. This chapter expounds that all profound truths of</p>
<p>vedantha are known from the teachings of the mystic Alwars. The term &lsquo;Dampathi Jagathampathi&rsquo; found in the invocatory verse (that it is devoted to the divine couple) is also found in the concluding verse of this great composition &ldquo;Sharanya Dampathi Vidam Sammatah Samagruhyata&rdquo; and this also indicates that the composition begins with Guruparampara Sara and concludes with Nigamana.</p>
<p>The Mangalacharanam found in the Guruparampara Saram is continued and extended in the verse आभगवत्तः प्रथितां अनघां आचार्यसन्ततिं वन्दे' in the Upodgatha</p>
<p>IL</p>
<p>Guruparampara Sara</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Adhikara and so it is to be understood that this section is introduced for profusely performing Mangalam, and there is no contradiction there.</p>
<p>It may be considered that the chapter &ldquo;Guruparampara Sara&rdquo; is also of the form of a Mangalagrantha for the commencement and completion of the study of the great composition - Rahasyatraya Sara.</p>
<p>The first invocatory verse of this section viz. Guru parampara Sara offers respectful salutations to the preceptors and seeks the grace of the Divine couple, who are verily the primeval Acharyas. &ldquo;We utter words of obeisance to our Acharyas and their Acharyas upto the Supreme Lord, who is the Principal Acharya, and we choose the divine couple Sri Mahalakshmi and Sriman Narayana who are the Masters of this universe, as our Supreme object of attainment and means&rdquo;. The first term &lsquo;Gurubyah&rsquo; relates to the immediate Acharya of the aspirant &lsquo;स्व अव्यवहित आचार्य&rsquo;. The second termagns' signifies the Acharya of his Acharya, and beginning from there and going higher and higher, upto the Supreme Lord who is the Paramacharya. It is ordained in the &ldquo;Shastras&rdquo; that one should pay obeisance to Acharya Vamsha F a rfan :', &ldquo;one should know the lineage of one&rsquo;s acharya&rdquo;, &lsquo;315lyfr than :&rsquo;, &ldquo;The Acharyas should be meditated upon as such and such upto the Supreme Bhagavan&rdquo;. The first word Gurubyah is used in plural for showing respect. The term Namah itself would suffice but 3ft 37 ' is meant for surrendering oneself unto the preceptor, EHTE: 3THdcarefu'. From this, it is evident that one should have deep devotion towards the line of one&rsquo;s own Acharya. The term 37 signifies that this kind of devotion to the Lord is something which is prescribed in the shastras and in the absence of such performance of devotion, it would lead to great &lsquo;Prathyavaya&rsquo; or offence. &lsquo;qui ' means, &ldquo;we choose the divine couple as our Prapya and Prapaka&rdquo;. Here, there is no eventuality of Srira as the Supreme Lord is characterised by Goddess Mahalakshmi inseparably. She is a 49 of the Lord. The dual number here used signifies that both the Lord and the Mother are the object of attainment and means and that self surrender is related to both of them. This verse is meant for indicating that the first section called Guruparampara Sara is having &ldquo;the worship of the line of acharyas&rdquo; as its subject matter.</p>
<p>The second half of this verse indicates that the ultimate benefit of liberation from &lsquo;samsara&rsquo; can be attained only through surrender unto the Lord. Thus by the invocatory verse Deshika indicates that surrender unto the preceptor leads to the attainment of the desired knowledge. 1. Sadacharya Sambandha is absolutely necessary :</p>
<p>In this section, Dehsika affirms first of all that it is absolutely necessary to have 370p Haru or the grace of the Acharya for all the aspirants after liberation. It is never one&rsquo;s merit only that is responsible for attainment of Moksha. Similarly, one&rsquo;s sins will not be an obstruction to Moksha. It is only the relationship with the Acharyas and the benign grace of the Acharyas that is responsible for liberation. Kshatrabandhu was the worst sinner but he gained Moksha on account of the grace of his Acharya. Pundarika was a</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>Guruparampara Sara</p>
<p>&lsquo;Punyavan&rsquo; but he gained liberation only on account of the grace of the Acharya.</p>
<p>पापिष्ठः क्षत्रबन्धुश्च पुण्डरीकश्च पुण्यकृत् ।</p>
<p>आचार्यवत्तया मुक्तौ तस्मादाचार्यवान् भवेत् ॥</p>
<p>The Upanishad says that one should himself go to the Acharya alone for gaining the knowledge of Brahman.</p>
<p>afzated Teheran (9.3 -7-87)</p>
<p>The Smruthis affirm that धर्मज्ञसमय is प्रमाणं indicating that all aspirants of liberation should seek an Acharya&rsquo;s teaching. By one&rsquo;s own Punya and effort, one cannot gain Moksha. By this, it becomes established that other efforts for liberation or performance of meritorious deeds or study of spiritual texts without Guru Bhajanam will not be capable of granting liberation. On account of one&rsquo;s association and dedication to the Acharya one gains the essential spiritual knowledge helpful for adopting</p>
<p>helpful for adopting the Mokshopaya, enhancement of the Mokshopayuktha Jnana and accomplishment of the necessary &lsquo;Sheela&rsquo; and &lsquo;Vritha&rsquo;. The Swethaswathara Upanishat ordains that one should have supreme devotion towards the Acharya as one will have towards the Supreme Lord and only such a dedicated person would imbibe the spiritual truth. II. Acharya-Parampara-Anusandhana should be done upto</p>
<p>Paramamman ___ This आचार्यपरम्परानुसन्धानम् or dedication to the lineage of Acharya, should culminate and become fulfilled upto the Supreme Paramatman who is the Paramacharya. The dedication here signifies that one should remember lovingly</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyacraya Saram</p>
<p>the line of Acharyas beginning with his own Acharya with reverence, gratitude and devotion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ध्यायेत् जपेत् नमेत् भक्त्या भजेदभ्यर्चयेत् मुदा&rsquo; । &lsquo;गुरुपादाम्बुजं ध्यायेत्&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>The Sruthi also ordains thus स च आचार्य वंशो ज्ञेयः&rsquo; &ldquo;one should meditate with devotion upon the Preceptor. One should repeat his holy names, prostrate, worship and praise with delight the guru&rdquo;. &ldquo;One should worship the lotus feet of the Acharya&rdquo;.</p>
<p>III. The Supreme Lord is the Supreme Acharya</p>
<p>The Supreme Paramatman is declared as Paramacharya who taught the supreme truth out of compassion to Hiranyagarbha, by whom it was taught to others and whenever this supreme wisdom was somewhat less illumined or almost lost, He incarnated himself on this carth and taught those truths that were somewhat forgotten and established the same truth to shine out brilliantly. It is only by the grace of the Lord that the unbroken tradition of the spiritual wisdom is established through great masters like Narada, Parasara, Vyasa, Shuka, Shounaka and other sages</p>
<p>The dismal darkness of ignorance that enveloped the universe was dispelled by the Lord and the 344 HUGRI was promulgated without any cessation in the world. The Lord is therefore the supreme guru on account of the Shasthra Pravarthana, directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;तमिमं सर्वसंपन्नं आचार्य पितरं गुरुम्&rsquo; । &lsquo;ममाप्यखिलजन्तूनां गुरुः नारायणो हरिः&rsquo; &lsquo;गुरुरसि गतिश्चासि जगताम्&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>Guruparampara Sara</p>
<p>TY</p>
<p>साक्षात् नारायणो देवः कृत्वा मर्त्यमयीं तनम् । मग्नानुद्धरते लोकान् कारुण्याच्छास्त्रपाणिना ।।</p>
<p>This Supreme Lord who is characterised with all auspicious qualities, who is an Acharya, guru, father and everything, Sriman Narayana, is verily the Guru. &lsquo;Thou art the preceptor of this universe, you are verily the goal.&rsquo; IV. The Alwars such as Nammalwar and others are in a</p>
<p>way incarnations of the Lord Himself</p>
<p>Desika establishes that the great Alwars are incarnations of the Supreme Paramatman himself for the ultimate purposes of promulgation of the supreme truths of tatwa, hita and purushartha. The compassion of the Lord manifests in many ways for establishing this Parama Dharma in this world through various measures. In the very first instance, he taught the supreme truth to the four-faced-Brahma; when he lost it due to his inadvertence, the Lord re-taught him and endowed him with the knowledge of all shasthras. Through the Chaturmukha Brahma, this supreme knowledge was handed over to many sages like Narada and others. He himself came on earth to establish this Dharma and He himself taught the Pancharathra Agama and he fulfilled his will to spread this knowledge in this world through the Alwars such as Parankusha, Parakala and others by manifesting Himself in them &lsquo;Huary</p>
<p>44:&rsquo; &ldquo;The Lord Achyuta fulfills His desired will by entering into those that are already born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desika points out that the Lord himself incarnated in ten forms like Parankusha and Parakala and promulgated the age old truths of the Vedas in a new form through the medium of a language understandable to all just as the clouds absorb the salt waters of the ocean and rain them as sweet water easily used by all. V. An aspirant should reflect upon the Guruparampara</p>
<p>with deep depotion</p>
<p>Vedantha Deshika has traced here the significant masters of yore who come in the series of Acharyas beginning with the celebrated Nathamuni. The Acharya Parampara carlier to Nathamuni is not known. Our reckoning of the &lsquo;Munitraya&rsquo; viz. Nathamuni, Yamunamuni and Ramanuja Muni, commences with Nathamuni. Desika establishes here that Nathamuni gained the spiritual knowledge directly in a trance of yoga from Nammalwar, and promulgated that wisdom amongst his disciples. Amongst the previous Acharyas Desika mentions that the wisdom of the Alwars was transmitted through Madhurakavi and other disciples. Nathamuni therefore is here described as a master par excellence who gained the wisdom of the upanishadic thought and the wisdom of the inspired teachings of the Alwars. We may note here that the various masters such as Nathamuni, Alavandar and Sri Ramanuja, their works, the names of their disciples, are all chronologically recorded here. Desika has mentioned the names of the works of the several Acharyas, as they were available to him at that time and this is an authenticated statement and from this we understand that Ramanuja has written nine works and three &lsquo;Gadyas&rsquo; were the authenticated works of the Acharya.</p>
<p>After describing the greatness of the Poorvacharyas, Desika suggests that the Sampradaya Parampara of the post</p>
<p>Guruparampara Sara</p>
<p>Ramanuja period may be grasped according to their Acharya Parampara. It is to be noted that the followers of Ramanuja, though have different Acharya Parampara, are all related to the three Great Masters that established this Sampradaya on solid foundation.</p>
<p>Desika points out that it is the primary duty of a disciple to glorify his Acharya and to keep secret the manta that is taught to him</p>
<p>गुरुं प्रकाशयेद्धीमान् मन्त्रं यत्नेन गोपयेत् । अप्रकाशप्रकाशाभ्यां हीयेते संपदायुषी ॥</p>
<p>A virtuous person should highlight his preceptor and jealously guard the mantra taught to him. If he does the contrary his wealth and longevity of life get lost. This gurubhakthi is not limited to his direct Acharya only but to the Paramacharyas also.</p>
<p>Thus, in this section, Guruparampara Sara, Desika emphasises the importance of the &ldquo;guru&rdquo; in spiritual sadhana. The Guru is a guide who initiates the process of spiritual discipline, watches the progress of the disciple, sets him right whenever he fails and ultimately leads him to the achievement of the goal. The benefactions of the Guru to Humanity is so great that it cannot be described in words. It is apt that Desika commences his great work, with this Guruparampara Sara, which is an obeisance at the feet of the Gurus for the successful completion of this work.</p>

<p>CHAPTER - I</p>
<p>Upodghathadhikara (or Introduction to the subject of the work)</p>
<p>In the Upodghathadhikara or the introductory chapter to this classic, containing thirty-two chapters, Vedantha Desika has pointed out the prime subject matter of this work and the purpose it would serve. An introduction is necessary for all kinds of works for evincing the interest of the disciples regarding the study of that subject. This introduction is like a motivation for the readers to know what exactly is proposed to be expounded in the main work.</p>
<p>Normally, the Anubandha Chathushtaya viz. f994, अधिकारिन्, सम्बन्धः and प्रयोजनम् (the subject matter, the aspirants who are competent for it and their inter relationship and the utility) will be mentioned before the commencement of a work and according to this, Desika mentions the subject matter of this work and the purpose of this exposition. In this section, there is a general statement of the supreme truths of the tatwa, hita and purushartha. It is also pointed out that a Chethana or a sentient being who is competent and qualified to enjoy the bliss of divine communion has been deprived of it on account of his indulgence in ungodly ideals and who is floundering as a consequence of that, in an ocean of sorrow and suffering, would come upon a benevolent and compassionate Acharya on account of some good done by him knowingly or unknowingly and on account of His grace, the Chethana or Jivatman would attain the supreme object of his life.</p>
<p>ON In this section, Desika points out that the emancipation of the bound-self, due to the grace of the Acharya, is the subject matter of this Great Treatisc. What all is to be known and done for one&rsquo;s own ultimate good is pointed out in a nutshell in this section. The very many aspects of that knowledge would be dealt with extensively in the body of the text.</p>
<p>Here, it is pointed out that all attainments including the attainment of the Supreme Paramatman depend upon the &lsquo;Viveka&rsquo; or discriminating knowledge that could be gained from the instructions of the Acharyas. So, this is an introduction to the spiritual endeavour of an aspirant for attainment of the ultimate good of life.</p>
<p>One should gain &lsquo;Nirveda&rsquo; or metaphysical agony for having missed the bliss of divine communion on account of his own involvement in the ungodly pleasures of the world. When one realises that the results of karma are not everlasting, he develops Nirveda' that he cannot gain the supreme through these karmas and he hurries to the Acharya for gaining that knowledge of the supreme. Thereupon, he undertakes the spiritual discipline as enlightened by the compassionate acharya. This section is meant for the origination of adesire to know the truth, जिज्ञासा जननाय ।</p>
<p>This section is commenced with an obeisance to the line of Acharya. Desika offers his prayer thus -</p>
<p>आभगवत्तः प्रथितां अनघामाचार्य सन्ततिं वन्दे । मनसि मम यत्प्रसादात् वसति रहस्यत्रयस्य सारोऽयम् ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;I offer my salutations to the line of Holy Acharyas who are opposed to all that is defiling, and to their Acharya Parampara extending upto the Supreme Paramatman. On</p>
<p>Upodghathadhikara</p>
<p>account of the very grace of these Acharyas, the essence of the wisdom of the Rahasya Traya, is enshrined in my heart.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This invocation suggests that the acharyas that are &lsquo;Anaghas&rsquo; (34427:) are similar to the Supreme Lord himself. Salutations are offered at the feet of the preceptor for the completion of this composition without any obstacles and for getting rid of any hurdles that might face in the course of the composition. It is suggested that the subject matter of the work proposed to be written is the &ldquo;Rahasya Trayam' and this kind of Mangalacharana is an instruction to the disciple also. The supreme devotion of the master towards the Acharyas is also known from this.</p>
<p>After this Mangalacharanam, Desika offers obeisance at the feet of his preceptor - Sri Appullar - and seeks his grace for a successful completion of the work undertaken. In one Sanskrit verse &lsquo;Horak sa sitt:&rsquo; the subject matter of this section that is Upodghathadikara, is expounded briefly -</p>
<p>मणिवर इव शौरेः नित्यहृद्योऽपि जीव: कलुषमतिरविन्दन् किंकरत्वाधिराज्यम् । विधिपरिणतिभेदाद्वीक्षितस्तेन काले</p>
<p>गुरुपरिषदुपज्ञं प्राप्य गोपायते स्वम् ।। The gist of the verse is as follows</p>
<p>The Jivatman who is very dear to the Supreme Lord just as the Kaustubha Gem, has not gained the sovereignty of the eternal service to the Lord on account of the covering of his real nature by the beginningless prakruthi or matter due to his karmas, Though the Jivatman is qualified for that supreme state, he has been labouring under the burden of his karmas. Though he is thus, being blessed and caught by the kind glances of the Supreme Lord at some particular time on account of some casual good done unknowingly by him, he will be blessed with the instruction of the preceptors and will save himself by taking up the spiritual disciplines prescribed therefor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this verse, it is first of all declared that the Jivatman is fully qualified for the bliss of divine communion. But, he has missed it on account of his involvement in Kamya-Karma or interested actions on account of the fact that he is not endowed with the true wisdom of the tattva, hita and purushartha.</p>
<p>Being ignorant of his nature, he is involved in samsara. This ignorance of his will be destroyed by the Acharyas at a proper time, when an opportunity comes due to some good done knowingly or unknowingly and then he will know his true nature and takes a genuine tum in his life.</p>
<p>The Jivatman is thus very dear to the Lord. The Lord is a worthy 19-L and He is eager to grant the bliss of His communion to all. The Supreme Lord is adorning the celestial abode Sri Vaikuntha as described in</p>
<p>वैकुण्ठे तु परे लोके श्रियासार्धं जगत्पतिः । आस्ते विष्णुरचिन्त्यात्मा भक्तैः भागवतैःसह ।।</p>
<p>This Jivatman has the agented or qualification by his essential nature to enjoy the supreme joy of experiencing the Lord eternally in an equal measure along with the nityasurins but on account of his beginningless karma has been bound by samsara.</p>
<p>अनेक जन्म साहसीं संसारपदीं व्रजन् । मोहश्रमं प्रयातोऽसौ वासनारेणुकुण्ठितः ॥</p>
<p>ITIL</p>
<p>12CCOU</p>
<p>Upodghathadhikara</p>
<p>Migrating in the cycle of samsara in many many thousands of births and being weakened on account of the dust of reminiscent impressions he is fatigued and deluded. He is thus in a forlorn state deprived of the true illumination of cattva, hita and purushartha, knowledge of the Supreme Reality, the path of spiritual discipline and the supreme object of attainment.</p>
<p>Here, the masters give the analogy of the &lsquo;Rajakumara Nyaya&quot;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a king had been to the forest for hunting along with his &lsquo;Anthahpura&rsquo; and children, the prince who had not yet gained speech, missed his way in play and reached a hamlet of hunters. He grew up in the hunters&rsquo; camp and behaved as they behaved. He did not know his destiny and he was not blessed with any samskaras. He was considering himself as a hunter-boy and was indulging in detestable objects. When some kind hearted person who found that he was a prince, who had missed his way taught him that he was a prince and not a hunter-boy and that his father was pining to unite with him. Then the hunter-boy came to know about his true nature and when he was taught so, he yearned to unite with his father and giving up the false notion of a hunter-boy, he would approach and unite with his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Similarly, the Jivatman who has not known his truc nature and so who considers himself independent, comes to know that he is subservient to paramatman (being related to Him as Dasa, Shishya, Prashishya, etc) and yearns to attain the Supreme Paramatman by, performing the necessary spiritual disciplinc according to the teachings of the Acharya.</p>
<p>When and how one gets an Acharya ? Desika says ईश्वरस्य च सौहार्द यदृच्छासुकृतं तथा । विष्णोः कटाक्षमद्वेषं आभिमुख्यं च सात्विकैः । संभाषणं षडेतानि ह्याचार्यप्राप्तिहेतवः ॥</p>
<p>VS &ldquo;These six namely the good will of Paramatman, some good deed done by the chetana casually, the kind glance of Sri Vishnu, having no hatred towards the Lord, a turn towards the Lord and conversation with the satvik people - are the causes of gaining an acharya&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On account of any one of these, a forlom Jivatman will be blessed with the grace of an Acharya on account of the grace of the Lord, and saves himself by performing a spiritual discipline.</p>
<p>The benevolent Acharya enlightens him on his true nature as mentioned in the verso</p>
<p>नायं देवो न मो वा न तिर्यस्थावरोऽपि वा । ज्ञानानन्दमयस्त्वात्मा शेषो हि परमात्मनः ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;This atman is not a god, a human being, not an animal nor an unmoving object. He is of the nature of knowledge and bliss and subservient to paramatman&rdquo;. The Acharya teaches him the nature of the Supreme Reality, the means and the goal very precisely without giving room for any doubt or wrong understanding. The essential nature and attributes of the land race, the nature of objects that are to be discarded such as earthly attainments and the attainments of other worlds, the objects that are to be cherished and achieved such as liberation and the means of attaining salvation and the nature of the obstacles to liberation - all these will be instructed by the compassionate preceptors. Here Acharya Sambandha is inevitable for one&rsquo;s cmancipation. Every one is qualified for it and he will surely gain it at the proper time. All these truths are enshrined in the three great Rahasyas in a unique way and they will be expounded in the proper order further.</p>

<p>Saranishkarsbadhikara</p>
<p>CHAPTER - II</p>
<p>Saranishkarshadhikara (Determining the essentials to be imbibed)</p>
<p>After giving a general introduction to the work proposed to be written, the celebrated author describes in this section, what an aspirant should determine as the most essential thing to be followed. One has to choose the most essential object to be followed without wasting time and choose that which is most beneficial to him, after due deliberation. Knowledge is vast; time at our disposal is very little. Obstructions for gaining knowledge are many. A wise man should not waste his precious time in indulging in various learnings. He has to determine what is of supreme essence and follow it devotedly. So, in this section, Desika decides what is of utmost value to mankind and exhorts one to proceed on the path of sadhana placing that as his goal.</p>
<p>In the introductory verse, Desika analyses the different kinds of knowledge and declares that the wise adopt with stout efforts the supreme truths expounded in the Upanishads. The Vedas are expounding the supreme truths that are most beneficial to mankind. They are the well wishers of mankind. &lsquo;HICLU Haut are I I</p>
<p>The vedas are impersonal. They are Parama Pramanas. They are infallible truths. Anything which is opposed to the teaching of the Vedas, is just like poison leading to disaster. &lsquo;श्रुतिपथविपरीतं श्वेलकल्पम्&rsquo;। The Vedas contain teachings that are required for all kinds of people for gaining different objects. It is just like a vast reservoir meant for different</p>
<p>wanas,</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasya raya Saram</p>
<p>LaTe</p>
<p>essen</p>
<p>kinds of purposes # fase act:&rsquo;. They contain truths that are required for all kinds of people for attaining different objects of life here and hereafter. What all is said in the Vedas is not required for all ytan 3441aela: Fiugatge i alan Hay day, slepe Panta:&quot; I says the Gita.</p>
<p>The Veda contains teachings that are required for gaining different aspirations. So, a Mumukshu who yearns to attain the supreme Paramatman, should not entertain such parts in the Veda that are leading to the attainment of Aishwarya and Kaivalya. He has to seek the supreme teachings that are the essence of the nectar of the Upanishads.</p>
<p>&lsquo;प्रकृति पुरुष भोगप्रापकांशो न पथ्यः&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this direction, the three mysterious viz. the Moolamanthra, Dwaya Manthra and Charama-sloka, are the quintessence of the teachings of the Upanishads and they are to be entertained with all effort and interest. A verse is quoted to emphasise this truth -</p>
<p>असारं अल्पसारं च सारं सारतरं त्यजेत् । भजेत् सारतमं शास्त्रे रत्नाकर इवामृतम् ॥</p>
<p>All those shasthras, that are beyond the Vedas, that do not admit the ultimate authority of the Veda or shastras that give a pervert interpretation of the Veda, are Asara. They must be totally discarded. The &lsquo;Alpasara&rsquo; or &lsquo;a little essence signifies the Poorva-Bhaga of the Veda, where different kinds of rites and karmas are prescribed as means of attainment of worldly benefits. This is also to be discarded as they are unhelpful to a Mumukshu. Those portions of the Veda thatSaranishkarshadhikara</p>
<p>teach means of attaining benefits in the ocher worlds may be &lsquo;sara&rsquo; for some people, as they have other worldly benefits. But, for a wise man, even those benefits are not to be entertained because they are g:649, gift, gitaice, 364 and er and opposed to the bliss of true nature of the atman. So, even the so called &lsquo;sara&rsquo; is futile to a Mumukshu. Now the ideal of self-realisation where the self will enjoy Kaivalya or aloofness of the nature of the Atman, may be examined. This may be called &lsquo;Sara-thara&rsquo; and may be desirable for many, as this is greater than the preceding ideals. But yet, this also is not an object of attainment for people who are yearning for the infinite bliss of communion with Paramatman. Se even this &lsquo;Sara-thara&rsquo; is not the ideal to the cherished.</p>
<p>Those texts that expound the nature of Paramatman, the attainment of Paramatman and the means of attaining that supreme Paramatman - THICH F7169, 944164 sulh and परमात्म प्राप्त्यपाय - are of utmost importance and they form the supreme essence of the Vedas. They are the &lsquo;sarathama&rsquo; portions. Even amongst them, the three Rahasyas that enshrine the essence of the tattva, hita and purushartha, are the &lsquo;sarathamal portions and they are to be entertained by all aspirants of liberation.</p>
<p>A wiseman should decide thus the quintessence of all shasthras and dedicate himself to the understanding of the three Rahasyas and this text expounds all the truths that are contained in the three Rahasyas.</p>
<p>बहुभ्यश्च महद्भ्यश्च शास्त्रेभ्यः मतिमानरः । सर्वतः सारमादद्यात् पुष्पेभ्य इव षट्पदः ।। The meaning of this verse is that -</p>
<p>A mumukshu who wants to save himself from the clutches of samsara without delay, has to gather and devote himself to the most essential truths of these three mysteries &lsquo;Rahasyatraya&rsquo; from all quarters; from all people; from all great shasthras - just like the bees that collect honey from all flowers.</p>
<p>It becomes established from all this enquiry that even from the Adhyathma Shastras that are &lsquo;sarathama&rsquo; portions, a mumukshu should gather the most essential truths of these three Rahasyas. Desika expounds that the three Rahasyas enshrine the supreme essence of all vedic lore and a mumukshu ought to devote himself whole-heartedly to these three Rahasyas.</p>
<p>In the concluding verse in Tamil, Desika points out that the Acharyas of yore, imbibed the truths of these three mysteries and taught them to the line of their chosen disciples and this doctrine of &lsquo;sarathama&rsquo; is valid and authoritative according to the unbroken tradition -</p>
<p>ufafanyera'1</p>
<p>The various disciplines of knowledge that are mastered by one in addition to what they have learnt, are all mere burdens. They will not be helpful for securing one&rsquo;s liberation from bondage. Our celebrated masters have taught us precisely that the three great mysteries are the quintessence of all vedic wisdom by means of which we can save ourselves.</p>
<p>Thus, in this section, Desika has ascertained what a Mumukshu should entertain, study and practise for attaining spiritual perfection without delay. This is the Saranishkarsha</p>

<p>CHAPTER - III</p>
<p>Pradhana Prathithanthradhikara (The unique doctrine of this School of Thought)</p>
<p>In the Saranishkarshadhikara, it was taught that the three Rahasyas are enshrining the ultimate truths of tatva, hita and purushartha and that an aspirant should endeavour to understand these truths as the quintessence of all the shasthras. In the following sections, these truths are elaborately described. Eight chapters are meant for enlightening the essential nature of the spiritual aspirant. The succeeding two chapters describe &lsquo;Sanga Prapadana&rsquo;. The remaining ten sections are describing the beneficial aspects of Prapathi. The essential nature of the Adhikarin for Prapathi, actual performance of Prapathi and post-prapathi duties are thus described with all the essentials in this work.</p>
<p>Of all these, the foremost doctrine that is to be realised is introduced in this section of Pradhana Prathithanthra. Prathithanthra means &lsquo;unique doctrine&rsquo; in this context. It is not &lsquo;prathikula-thanthra&rsquo; or counter doctrine. It is not one found in each school as &lsquo;prathi-thanthram&rsquo;. But, it is a unique doctrine that is taught in this school of thought only according to the authentic, authoritative and infallible sruthi. This doctrine is meant for enlightening the true nature of the individual self as utterly depending upon the supreme Paramatman for his very nature, existence and functioning. The Upanishads teach the relationship of the body and the soul, between the (Chetana - &amp; - Achethana) sentient and non-sentient entities on one hand and the Supreme Paramatman on the other. If this doctrine of body and soul relationship between the universe and the Paramatman is clearly understood, then one will be able to imbibe the teachings of the scriptures. This is the most important doctrine which should be understood without any confusion for understanding the nature of the Ultimate Reality. It is therefore justified to teach this unique doctrine taught by the scriptures before teaching about the subject. The Adhikarin or aspirant of Prapathi should have a sound understanding of this relationship between him and Paramatman and he must have full conviction of this truth before undertaking any spiritual discipline. The school of Advaita teaches the doctrine of Adhyasa&rsquo; or superimposition first and then introduces the teachings about Brahman, Jiva and the universe. When one becomes fully convinced about the fact that everything other than Brahman is superimposed on Brahman, he can then tread over the knowledge of other things and decide for himself that all things other than Brahman are illusory. Advaitins safeguard their doctrine like this, by first teaching that everything is superimposed on Brahman. Though this cannot be proved by any ‘Pramana&rsquo; whatsoever, the doctrine of Adhyaropa' and &lsquo;Apavada&rsquo; influences the thought of all spiritual aspirants following the doctrine of Advaita.</p>
<p>All confusion ensues regarding determining the ultimate teachings of the Upanishads on account of non determination of the inescapable relationship between the universe ard supreme Brahman. The Upanishad itself teaches this doctrine of &lsquo;Sarira-Sariri-Bhava&rsquo; any number of times to make one understand that the Supreme Brahman alone characterised by its body of the form of sentients and the non-sentients, is the One Non-Second Reality. This Body-Soul relationship is not a physiological one as found</p>
<p>Pradhana Prathithanthradhikara</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>in the case of the soul and his physical body; but, it is a spiritual analogy to illustrate the fact that the universe is supported, ruled over at all times by the supreme and is used for the purposes of that supreme principle. This is the essence of the teaching of all Upanishads and this doctrine is to be known necessarily by all aspirants of liberation. If this relationship of utter dependence upon the supreme for existence and functioning of the universe is not realised, there cannot be any salvation. This Body-Soul relationship assures the reality of Brahman, Jivatman and Matter. The entities of Jivatman and Matter are entirely depending upon Paramatman. This doctrine harmonises all apparent contradictions and wards off the doctrine of unreality of the universe and the Jiva. Due importance is assigned to all kinds of scriptural statements and the glory of Brahman becomes expounded in significant terms. This school thus teaches the Reality of all the entities viz. Man, Matter and God, whereas other schools teach the unreality of one or all those entities discarding this Upanishadic doctrine.</p>
<p>Considering the importance of the understanding of this unique doctrine, Vedantha Desika has described this in Pradhanaprathithanthradhikara and has shown conclusively that this truth is enshrined in the three manthras before explaining other doctrines. The &lsquo;Sarira-Sariri-Bhava&rsquo; is defined by Ramanuja in his Shri Bhashya as follows: &lsquo;यस्य चेतनस्य यत् द्रव्यं सर्वात्मना स्वार्थे धारयितुं नियन्तुं च शक्यं तच्छेषतैकस्वरूपं च तत्तस्य शरीरम् । इतरः शरीरी&rsquo;।</p>
<p>(afty 7-8-8) This truth is described in the introductory verse of this chapter</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Şaram</p>
<p>आधेयत्वप्रभृति नियमैः अदिकर्तुश्शरीरम् सत्तास्थेमप्रयतनफलेष्वेतदायत्तमेतत् । विश्वं पश्यन्निति भगवति व्यापकादर्शदृष्टे गम्भीराणां अकृतकगिरां गाहते चित्तवृत्तिम् ।।</p>
<p>The mcaning of this verse is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On account of the invariable fact of being supported and others, this universe is the body of that first creator of this universe. This depends entirely on Him for its existence and functioning. When one realises these truths reflected in the mirror-like Moolamanthra and others, one will be able to know the heart of the profound Upanishads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this verse, Adhcyathva, Niyamyathva and Sheshathva of the hosts of sentients and non-sentients is first of all mentioned. Adheyatwa means entirely depending upon the supreme for its essential nature and existence. The essential nature of the Jiva is entirely depending upon the nature of Paramatman. Niyamyatva signifies that the existence and functioning are depending upon the will of Paramatman. The Jivatma is thus &lsquo;Swarupa-Adhina&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sankalpa-Adhina&rsquo; to the Lord, though he is appearing to be independent.</p>
<p>All these truths are known from the three great Manthras. The Adhara-Adheya-Bhava' results in the realisation of one&rsquo;s inseparable relationship with the Supreme Lord i.e., Aprthaksidha Swarupa Labha'. The Shesha-Sheshi Bhava' results in &lsquo;Swarupa-Anurupa Purushartha-Bhava&rsquo; i.e., seeking for an object of attainment which is in accordance with his true nature. The &ldquo;Niyanthru Niyamya-Bhava' results in &lsquo;Nirapeksha-Upaya-Vishesha Jnana&rsquo; i.e., the knowledge of the particular means which does not need any other thing. All these lead to the</p>
<p>Pradhana Prathithanthradhikara</p>
<p>understanding that the Supreme Lord is the ultimate object of attainment and that He alone is the means of that attainment.</p>
<p>The body-soul relationship between Paramatman and the other two entities viz., Jivatman and Matter, establishes that all entities other than Paramatman are supported, ruled over and used for his own purposes by the Paramatman. Three concepts are to be known from this: 1. Adhara-Adheya Bhava 2. Niyamaka-Niyamya Bhava 3. Sheshi-Shesha Bhava</p>
<p>The Lord is, by his very nature - directly and immediately - Adhara (or support) to all substances (Dravya) other than himself, just as he is the Adhara (o Support) to his essential qualities such as Sathyatva, Joanatva, Anantatva, Anandatva and Amalatva as well as the infinite auspicious attributes that are derived from these Swarupa Nirupaka Dharmas. How is he supporting the several attributes or Dharmas related to Matter and Jivatman? The Paramatman is the Adhara for those attributes that are related to these substances viz., Jivatman and Matter, through those very substances (Dravya-Dwara). For the bodies that are taken by the Jivatmans, the Lord is the Adhara through those Jivatmans. Some Acharyas opine that He supports their bodies indirectly through the Jivatmas, and also directly on account of his &lsquo;Swarupa&rsquo;. From this, it is established that all entities other than Paramatman, are inseparable attributes as related to the essential nature of Paramatman. So the essential nature, the existence and functioning of all these entities are dependent upon Páramatman. The essential nature of all entities are dependent upon Paramatman, and therefore, things that are eternal and non-eternal are so, on account of the will of the Lord that wills their eternal nature or non-eternal nature. The will of the Lord is not to be taken as eternal or non eternal. It must be known that some things will be eternal, if the Lord wills that they should be so. The &lsquo;Sthithi&rsquo; or continuance of their existence also depends upon the &lsquo;Ichha&rsquo; or the will of the Lord. So all entities other than Paramatman are Ishwara-Sankalpa-Ashritha'. The will of the Lord makes those entities &lsquo;Swarupa-Ashritha&rsquo;. Thus all entities are both Ishwara Swarupa Ashritha and Ishwara Sankalpa Ashritha.</p>
<p>This can be understood from the analogy of the relationship of a Jivatman with his body. The body of the Jivatman is dependent upon the &lsquo;Swarupa&rsquo; of Jivatman as we find that it gets destroyed missing the support of Jivatman, when he departs from the body. This fact of the Tivatman supporting the body can be known clearly in the state of &lsquo;sushupti&rsquo; when there is no willing of the Jivatman. During the waking-state and the dream-state, the body is supported by the will of Jivatman. From this, we understand that the body of the Jivatman is supported through his wish during the waking-state and others in addition to his supporting the body through &lsquo;Swarupa&rsquo;. So, it is pointed out that the body is &lsquo;Sankalpa-ashritha&rsquo; and &lsquo;Swarupa Ashritha&rsquo;. Adheya signifies &lsquo;Swarupa-Ashraya&rsquo;. &lsquo;Sankalpa Ashraya&rsquo; is signified by Niyamyathva. The body is Shesha or subservient to the interest of the Jivatman. So, it is Shesha Bhava. In the same way, all entities other than Paramatman, are having the nature of Adheyatva, Niyamyatva and Sheshatva in respect of Paramatman. He is described as</p>
<p>Pradhana Prachithanthradhikara</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Fron</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sarva-Sheshi&rsquo; as he utilises for his own purposes all other entities by creating them, supporting them and accepting them, saving them and causing their essential nature to be like that. The Lord is the means of protection and also the object of attainment. So, He is Sarva-Adhara, Sarva Niyamaka and Sarva-Sheshi.</p>
<p>How will this kind of relationship with Paramatman benefit the Jivatman?</p>
<p>From the realisation of the relationship of Adhara and Adheya, the Jivatman will realise his essential nature which is inseparable from the Paramatman, even as the qualities of Jnana' and &lsquo;Shakthi&rsquo; are inseparable from the Paramatman. From this, he will gain the realisation of his true nature. From the realisation of Shesha-Sheshi-Bhava, the Jivatman will develop an aspiration for gaining the object of attainment which is in accordance with his Swarupa. This results in the realisation of the Parama Purushartha which is the attainment of Paramatman</p>
<p>himself. 3. The realisation of the Niyanthru-Niyamya-Bhava will</p>
<p>result in the realisation of the means of attainment which will be in accordance with his nature i.e., an &lsquo;Upaya or means which will not depend upon any other factor. That &lsquo;Upaya&rsquo; is the Supreme Lord himself., who is not depending on any other factor for becoming the &lsquo;Upaya&rsquo;. So, this kind of relationship results in the realisation of the fact that the Jivatman is not supported by any one other than Paramatman (Ananya-Adhara), that he has no refuge other than Paramatman (Ananya</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Sharana) and that the Supreme object of attainment is nothing other than attaining Paramatman (Ananya Prayojana).</li>
</ol>
<p>All these truths can be known from the three Rahasyas. The first Rahasya i.e. Mula Manthra, expounds that the Supreme Narayana is Ananya-Adhara&rsquo;. This is established by means of the derivation of the term &lsquo;Narayana through *Tatpurusha&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bahuvrihi&rsquo; compounds as &ldquo;TRITI 3747'</p>
<p>ART: 37474 RA&rsquo;I</p>
<p>From this, the &lsquo;Dharakatva&rsquo; and &lsquo;Vyapakatva&rsquo; of the Lord is understood. The &lsquo;Pranaval affirms that the Jivatman is in his essential nature, to subserve Paramatman alone and from this Ananya-Prayojanarvam&rsquo; is ascertained. The middle term &lsquo;Namah&rsquo; indicates utter dependence upon the Paramatman by means of the negation of the T and the &ldquo;Mine'. From this, Ananya-Sharanatva is realised.</p>
<p>In the Dwaya-Manthra, the former part expounds the fact of Paramatman alone being the redeemer i.e., Ananya Sharanatvam and the latter part teaches that the Paramatman alone is the supreme object of attainment i.e., Ananya Prayojanatvam. Both these parts together expound Ananya Dharakatvam.</p>
<p>The Mula Manthra is just like a tiny mirror reflecting huge objects and it precisely expounds all truths that are to be known for performance of Prapathi that is ordained as the particular means of salvation, by the Charama Si ka for gaining the grace of Paramarman, the Siddhopaya.</p>
<p>The first word of this mantra is Pranava. The meanings of this are to be known as in the chariot of Arjuna and asPradhana Prathithanthradhikara</p>
<p>shown in the verse of Ramayana &ldquo;Rama walked first and Sita followed him next in the middle and Lakshmana followed them holding the bow and arrow&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Charama Shloka ordains prapatti along with its accessories as the means of realisation and this is absolutely essential to enlighten ananya sharanatva – the fact of having Him alone as the protector. All these truths are thus taught by all the three mantras. A doubt may arise about the necessity of all the three mantras, as one mantra alone teaches all the things. The Mula-Mantra teaches no doubt, the means of prapatti. But, a visishta anusandhana is not possible from that. The Siddhopaya characterised by Goddess &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; - Visishta-Siddopaya - and the prapya characterised by Goddess &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; - Visishta-Prapya and HRc asinut farle or the particular means characterised by the several accessories - all these are not explicitly known from the Mula Manthra and so there is need of the Dvaya Manthra.</p>
<p>All things that are to be known necessarily while surrendering, such as Ananyarha-Sheshatva and Parathanthrya cannot be known clearly from anything other than &ldquo;Pranava' and &lsquo;Namas&rsquo; of the Mula Manthra.</p>
<p>The illustration of the chariot of Arjuna points out primacy to Krishna who is in the fore (Sheshi) and subordination to Arjuna who is in the hind (behind) (Shesha). If zore' is taken as signifying &lsquo;Sri&rsquo;, then the verse of Ramayana is an illustration. The Divine Couple who are the &lsquo;Sheshins&rsquo; are in the front and they are followed by the &lsquo;Shesha&rsquo;, the subservient one, behind. This order also points the Rakshaka, Purushakara and the Rakshya in the respective order. The Namas signifies expressly Bhagavatpăratantram and indicates iad Y 4 | This is to be known from the instances of Bharatha and Shatrughna. The quote from the hymns of Alwars – &ldquo;I am not without you, O Narayana; you are not without me&rdquo; - signifies that my essential nature is entirely dependent upon you who are the Niyantha. You also are not yourself without me – &lsquo;नाराश्चाप्ययन तस्य तैस्तद्भाव FEYYIT&rdquo; says Desika in Virodhaparihara. The derivation of the term Narayana shows the inseparable relationship between the two. He is to be known through his vibhuti &lsquo;faufa fireachra&rsquo; and the vibhuti is to be known as</p>
<p>guitarridehra&rsquo;</p>
<p>The illustrations of &lsquo;Kosalajanapadasthajanthu&rsquo; and Sri Rama of that place are given for explaining the meaning of the term Narayana. The people of the Kosala country could not bear themselves without Rama and so they went along with Rama when he made a mahaprasthana. Rama is to be indicated as Kosalendra. The sheshatva of the entities other than Paramatman, to Him, is to be known as extending up to the Bhagavatas that are devoted to the Lord.</p>
<p>The Sheshitva of Isvara is in respect of both chethana and achethana and so one should reflect that this sheshitva in respect of the chethana culminates in &lsquo;Swamitva&rsquo; and similarly the &lsquo;sheshatva&rsquo; of the chetana culminates in dasatva'.</p>
<p>On account of the fact of dasatva that is realised in respect of the chetana, the ultimate object of his attainment is determined to be Kainkarya or eternal loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Pradhana Prathithanthradhikara</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>The Isvara is Nirupadhika-Sheshi, Nirupadhika Niyantha and the Jivas are Nirupadhika-Shesha and Nirupadhika-Niyamya. The Master has to take care of his property. The capable one has to protect the helpless. But, according to his Sankalpa, he invariably engages the bound chetanas in some upaya or other and on that pretext protects them.</p>
<p>Thus, in this section, the author has described the fundamental doctrine of body-soul relationship taught by the scriptures and has shown that all those truths are to be understood from the three mysteries.</p>
<h2 id="०४-अरथपञचकधकर">०४ अर्थपञ्चकाधिकारः</h2>
<p>Artha Panchakadhikara</p>
<p>IC 1.</p>
<p>CHAPTER - NV</p>
<p>Artha Panchakadhikara After expounding the unique doctrine of Body-Soul Relationship that is taught by the Upanishads, as an essential prerequisite for the doctrine of the means of surrender at the feet of the Lord, the five essential truths that also must be necessarily known by all, are taught in this section.</p>
<p>Desika describes that these essentials are taught in the three Rahasyas. The scripture mentions the essentials to be known in different ways such as, Isvara and Isithavya, Bhoktha-Bhogya-Preritha, one Supreme Brahman characterised by all other entities, etc. It is necessary for an aspirant to know first of all, his own nature, the object he cherishes to attain and the way of attaining it. He also should know what benefit he derives from the attainment of that object. When he makes an endeavour for attaining, he must be well aware of the impediments on his way also. Without a proper knowledge of these, one cannot proceed on the right line for the attainment of one&rsquo;s goal.</p>
<p>All philosophers generally mention that three things must be known viz. (1) Who I am? (2) What should I get? and (3) How can I get it? These three include in themselves, the fruit of such attainment and the hazards on the path of &lsquo;sadhana&rsquo;.</p>
<p>These five factors are norms that can be applied to any philosophy or any religion. They are applicable to all. No progress can be made without knowing these five factors.</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyavraya Saram</p>
<p>The celebrated author of this work, has summarised in an introductory verse that all these five factors art suggested by the three Rahasyas. The five factors are as follows :</p>
<p>आदौ प्राप्यं परममनघं प्राप्तरूपं च मादौ इष्टोपायस्त्वयननमसोः ईप्सितार्थ चतुर्थ्याम् । तद्व्याघातं ममकृतिगिरि व्यंजयन्तं मनुं तं तत्प्रायं च द्वयमपिविदन् सम्मतः सर्ववेदी ॥ Supreme Paramatman characterised by all perfections is the object of attainment</p>
<p>The attainer is &lsquo;Jivatma&rsquo; 3. The way of attainment is surrender unto Him 4. The fruit of attainment is the eternal bliss of loving</p>
<p>service unto the Lord</p>
<p>Obstructions are of the form of attachment to the non godly ideals as “my' and the &lsquo;mine&rsquo;. The feeling of 1</p>
<p>and ‘Mine' is an obstacle for this gain. (a) In the letter Akara' and the word Narayana', - the</p>
<p>Supreme Brahman - opposed to all defiling - is to be</p>
<p>known.</p>
<p>(b) The letter &lsquo;Ma&rsquo; in Pranaya and the term Narah' found</p>
<p>in Narayana, signify the attainer, the Jivatman. (c) The term &lsquo;Ayana&rsquo; in Narayana, and the middle term</p>
<p>&lsquo;Namah&rsquo;, point out the Siddhopaya (Ayana) and the</p>
<p>Sadhyopaya (Namah). (d) The dative case 371 in the word &lsquo;Narayanaya&rsquo; and the</p>
<p>lupta chaturthi in the first letter &lsquo;Akara&rsquo; of Pranava,</p>
<p>Artha Panchakadhikara</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>point out that the desired object is perfect bliss of</p>
<p>communion with Brahman. (e) The impediment as pointed out by the letter ‘Ma’ in</p>
<p>the term Namah', is of the form of Mamakara.</p>
<p>The mcans can be known by the other two Mantras viz. Dvaya and Charama-Sloka.</p>
<p>The masters of yore have taught these factors based on the vivid relationship of the form of Body-Soul Relationship between the Universe and the Lord. These six factors are universally accepted by all masters.</p>
<p>We may now make a study of these five truths, one after the other.</p>
<p>(A) When we reflect upon the Supreme, we must reflect</p>
<p>upon Sriman Narayana, who is the Supreme Truth, who is inseparably associated with Goddess Mahalakshmi. The scriptures declare that Sriman</p>
<p>Narayana is the Supreme Truth who is a home of all perfections, all auspicious qualities without any defilement whatsoever. Supreme Brahman is Sriman Narayana. He is ever united with Goddess Lakshmi in all his forms and even in his divine incarnations. The &lsquo;Sriyahpatitva&rsquo; is a unique character of Supreme Brahman. Ramayana, Mahabharata and other scriptures and the Alwars describe Him as inseparably associated with Goddess Lakshmi. føren Aref Pfa: - (464) &lsquo;एष नारायणः श्रीमान् क्षीरार्णवनिकेतनः&rsquo; (व्यूह रूप) &lsquo;भवान् नारायणो देवः श्रीमान् चक्रायुधो विभुः&rsquo; (विभव) Ho fath' says Ramanuja. The Alwars also describe that Sri is inseparable from the Supreme Paramatman.</p>
<p>Vedanta Desika mentions &lsquo;Sriyahpativa’ first while describing the essential nature of Brahman, because &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; is determining his essential nature. She is Swarupa Nirupaka. Desika mentions authorities that show &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; as inseparably associated with Narayana in Para; Vyuha and Vibhava forms.</p>
<p>One should meditate upon Paramatman as ever associated in all ways in all states and in all forms with Goddess Mahalakshmi inseparably. (B) Brahman - Sriman Narayana - is of the essential nature</p>
<p>of Jnana, Ananda, Sathya, Anantha and Amala. He is opposed to all that is defiling. The great scriptures, Upanishads, the utterances of Alwars and the experiences of our Holy Masters, declare that He is &lsquo;Saguna&rsquo; and never &lsquo;Nirguna&rsquo;. Of these infinite qualities, six qualities i.e., Jnana, Shakti, Balam, Aishwaryam, Veeryam and Tejas are prominently noted. The Supreme Brahman should be thought of as characterised by the qualities of &lsquo;Supremacy and Accessibility that are necessary for ‘Prapya’ and ‘Prapakatva&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The following authorities show His Supreme nature - 44684foci fawalei 4444&rsquo; - The Supreme object of attainment is Sri Vishnu who is divested of all that is defiling. Parq: T 371451İ Yrifa:' | He is a trec giving shelter to the virtuous and he is the Supreme saviour of those who are in trouble'.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Artha Panchakadhikara</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>&lsquo;तेजोबलैश्चर्यमहावबोध सुवीर्यशक्त्यादि गुणैकराशिः&rsquo; ।।</p>
<p>He is the one repository of all auspicious qualities like Tejas, aos, tuf, gra, at, sila and others”. “Even if one has long life like the chaturmukha, and has one crore of mouths, and of pure devotional mind, he cannot even mention one thousandth part of his auspicious qualities'. (C) The Supreme Brahman should be thought of as</p>
<p>associated with an eternal auspicious body. It is eternal and ashraya to all entities. His auspicious form is 371187 or non material. = 4THTHFTA: TEISR</p>
<p>परमात्मनः । (D) The Supreme Narayana should be reflected upon as</p>
<p>existing in five forms viz. Para, Vyuha, Vibhava, Harda and Archa. He should be reflected upon as characterised by infinite vibhuties' and as engaged in the process of creation, protection, destruction, etc., and as the supreme cause of every other thing,</p>
<p>Thus the object of attainment 1044264 should be reflected upon.</p>
<p>The nature of the Prapya Swarupa or the object of attainment, has been ascertained according to the scriptural authorities such as the Upanishads, Bhagavadgita, the Agamas and the Divya Prabandhams,</p>
<p>The details and characteristics of these fivc fold natures of the Lord, are ascertained from the Agamas that are authoritative as Veda itself, as they are not contradictory to the teachings of the Veda. This aspect of possessing a Divya Mangala Vigraha, is also to be meditated upon as related to the Prapya. The Prapya or the object of attainment - Sriman Narayana - is characterised by the two vibhuties' or glories such as the &lsquo;Leela Vibhuti&rsquo; and the Nitya Vibhuti'. The &lsquo;Nitya Vibhuti&rsquo; or the Paramapada or Vaikunta, is never involved in the process of creation and destruction etc. The &lsquo;Leela Vibhuti&rsquo; i.e., the universe, comprising of matter and the bound selves is subjected to origination and destruction. All these are necessarily dependent upon the infallible will of the Supreme.</p>
<p>The second factor of the five factors to be known, is Jivatman, who has to attain the Supreme Lord. The Jivatman is called a &ldquo;Kshetrajna', who is to attain the Lord. The order of the Jivatmans is further classified into three categories - the bound-self, the liberated-self and the eternals.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Baddhas&rsquo; or bound-selves, are those who are associated with matter from beginningless time and who have to strive for getting rid of the bondage of Karma, by practising the spiritual disciplines as prescribed in the Shastras, and who are fit to enjoy the eternal communion with the divine.</p>
<p>The Muktas or the &lsquo;Liberated&rsquo; are those who have endeared themselves to the Lord by the performance of spiritual disciplines as ordained by the Shastras, and who have got rid of the association of Samsara' totally and who are enjoying the infinite bliss of divine communion.</p>
<p>The Nityas or the &lsquo;Eternals&rsquo; - are those who like Isvara, are ever remaining without contraction of knowledge and who are ever engaged in the eternal service of the Lord from beginningless time. All these Jivatmans are having the</p>
<p>Artha Panchakadhikara</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>common characteristics of Anurva, Jnantva, Anandatva, Amaltva, Bhagavat-Seshatva and Bhagavatha-Paratantrya.</p>
<p>The essencial nature of the Jivatman is to be reflected in 40R and the term : and in the usage of the verbs *Prapadye' and &lsquo;Vraja&rsquo; and the term call and in the sentence Hier' in the three Rahasyas.</p>
<p>The ‘Praptyupaya - g' is pointed out by the term &lsquo;Namah&rsquo; and Ayana' in the Mulamantra and in the poorvakhanda of the Dvayamantra and also in the first half of the &lsquo;Charama-Sloka&rsquo;. The Upaya or the way of attainment of Paramatman, is ascertained as total Surrender unto the Lord with the realisation of one&rsquo;s own utter helplessness. Surrender unto the Lord with supreme faith or Maha Vishvasa in his Grace, along with one&rsquo;s own helplessness, will certainly win the grace or Prasada' of the Lord on account of which one will get rid of the bond of karma and association with matter.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Phala-Swarupa&rsquo; or the fruit of such surrender unto the Lord is the obtainment of the eternal, infinite bliss of communion with the Lord, which culminates in the loving service unto the Lord. The Jivatman will realise his true nature and will subserve only the purposes of the divine and never thinks of his own benefit. This is to be meditated upon in the terms of the Mulamantra viz. Narayanaya' and Aya' in Pranava where the dative case is latent. The statement Hd</p>
<p>W ATER of the Charama-sloka is also pointing out the nature of the ‘Phala'.</p>
<p>Desika has described elaborately the nature of the obstacles on the way of attainment of Godhead, because, the realisation of these impediments is very necessary for a devoted spiritual career and a genuine turn in life for attainment of Godhead. The host of obstacles to realisation can be said to be of the form of Avidya, Karma, Vasana, Prakriti Sambandha and Ruchi. The bound-self has been made to contact matter which causcs the contraction of his Dharma-Bhuta-Jnanam on account of his transgression of divine command from beginningless time. Even when he is born as a human being on account of some good act whatsoever, he is liable to be disturbed and confused by counter forces of various views of life and he may not have an opportunity to seek and surrender unto the Lord. He is tempted by the objects of the senses and he is likely to get distracted from the right path. One has to be very careful and should not indulge in the pleasures of the senses. He has to develop dispassion and choose only a virtuous path. There is a hurdle at every step and he has to steer clear himself from all these obstacles and should have before him the one and only goal of the attainment of the divine. Even while practising upasana, he should not be tempted by the lower gains of life, such as wealth or fame or long life or even the bliss of self-experience or Kaivalya. A spiritual aspirant should realise that he can get rid of all these obstacles only by surrendering unto the Lord and only by a strong conviction that all attainments other than the divine, are little and transient.</p>
<p>Thus in this chapter, Vedantha Desika has described the Arthapanchaka Jnanam which is the essence of all Shastras i.e., the essence of the Upanishads, Divya-Prabandham and all philosophical speculations. What is needed here is that these five factors should be determined according to the shastras</p>
<p>Artha Panchakadhikara</p>
<p>The gist of this section is summarised in one verse to the end of this chapter as follows:</p>
<p>प्राप्यं ब्रह्म समस्तशेषिपरमं प्राप्ताहमस्योचितः प्राप्तिः दायधन क्रमादिह मम प्राप्ता स्वतः सूरिवत् । हन्तैनामतिवृत्तवानहं अहंमत्या विमत्याश्रयः सेतुः संप्रति शेषिदम्पति भरन्यासस्तु मे शिष्यते ॥</p>
<p>The object of attainment is the Supreme Brahman, that is by nature the &ldquo;sheshin&rdquo; of all and that is most celebrated on account of all perfections without any defilement. I am the one who am fit to attain him by virtue of my essential nature of consciousness, purity and others. The attainment is just like the attainment of paternal property by his son and others. Even as in the case of the eternals I am the attainer on account of my essential nature Alas ! I transgressed this attainment by my own fault of the form of ego and ignorance.</p>
<p>Now, when I have been enlightened by the Acharyas, surrender unto the Divine Couple, the sheshins, is the only way to save myself.</p>

<p>CHAPTER - V</p>
<p>Tatvatrayadhikara</p>
<p>Our Masters of yore have classified the categories in various ways, for making the disciples understand the truth clearly without any confusion. The different kinds of categorisation are not contradicting one another. The oneness of Paramatman characterised by the orders of the chetana and the achetana i.e. fagfefelleng e' is admitted by all. The difference and distinction between Brahman and the other two orders, is also admitted by all. To make the student understand the unique characteristics of the &lsquo;Prakara&rsquo; or the attributes, tatva is classified into six sub-divisions such as the Arthapanchaka' and the unique relationship of the &lsquo;Body-Soul. Likewise, tatva can be classified into two categories such as &lsquo;Isvara&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ishithavya&rsquo;, or it may be classified into three categories as declared by the scriptures viz., Bhoktha, Bhogyam and Preritha&rsquo;. It may be classified into twenty-six divisions, twenty-four divisions of matter such as Prakriti, Mahath, etc., twenty-fifth category being the Jivatman, and the twenty-six being Paramatman. In every kind of categorisation, an aspirant will realise the true nature of the matter, Jivatman and the Supreme Paramatman.</p>
<p>It is to be known that all entities other than Paramatman are real and subordinated to Him as His inseparable attribute. Paramatman is one supreme Reality, who is all independent and the one supreme ruler over all other entities. The existence, the essential nature and functioning of all sentient and non-sentient entities, other than Paramatman, are subordinated to that one Supreme Paramatman. This fact is admitted by all thinkers who have described the nature and number of categories differently.</p>
<p>In the previous section, the five factors such as the nature of the Prapya and others and the unique relationship between Paramatman and others were taught expressly. Then, where is the need for introducing this section dealing with the three tatvas viz., Prakriti, Jivatman and Paramatman? This verily forms a part of Arthapanchaka. The answer to this question is given by Vedantha Desika in the preliminary verse and further explanation of the meaning of the verse. Every aspirant has to get rid of three powerful illusions - 1. The illusion that the body itself is the Atman. This is</p>
<p>known as &lsquo;616494:&rsquo; || 2. The illusion that the Jivatman is all independent and</p>
<p>not subordinated to anyone. This is known as &lsquo;FACH MIA:&rsquo;!</p>
<p>The illusion, Most Harmful, that there is no Isvara at all, who is the creator, protector and destructor, and that all the activities of the universe are going on according to their nature. This is known as 36itur als:'</p>
<p>These three illusions should be cleared and every aspirant has to realise that they are the most formidable impediments, obstructing the path of spiritual sadhana. So, Desika has devoted a chapter here before coming to the subject of the main topic viz., Prapatti, so that one may be well aware of the nature of these three entities. Only when one is equipped with the correct understanding of these</p>
<p>Tacvatrayadhikara</p>
<p>three entities, one will be a genuine aspirant after liberation. He will be an adhikarin for practising spiritual discipline.</p>
<p>So Desika introduces this chapter with this preliminary verse. प्रकृत्यात्मभ्रान्तिर्गलति चिदचिल्लक्षणधिया तथा जीवेशैक्यप्रभृतिकलहः तद्विभजनात् । अतो भोक्ता भोग्यं तदुभयनियन्तेति निगमैः विभक्तं नः तत्त्वत्रयमुपदिशन्त्यक्षतधियः&rdquo;।</p>
<p>The gist of this verse is as follows: -</p>
<p>&ldquo;By understanding the distinct features of the sentient and the non-sentient entities properly, the illusion of the Atman as the body will vanish. Similarly, by understanding properly the difference and distinction between Isvara and Jivatman, the confusion of the oneness of Jivatman and Paramatman will disappear. The Masters of yore, therefore, teach the three realities as classified by the scriptures as the ‘Bhoktha', or the enjoyer, &lsquo;the Bhogya&rsquo;, or the object of enjoyment, and the &lsquo;Preritha&rsquo; or the ruler over both these entities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this chapter, Desika has dealt with the nature and characteristics and functioning of these entities both sentient and non-sentient, along with the nature and functioning of Isvara in a remarkably brief manner. The nature, definition and characteristics of these three entities, have been dealt with elaborately supported by dialectrical discussions in great works like Nyaya-Siddanjanam, Tarvamuktakalapam, Nyaya Parisuddhi and other works. The summaries of conclusions arrived at in those monumental works, are given here in a brief manner to serve the general purposes of an aspirant. The aim of this section is not to deal with all these entities exhaustively in all their aspects, but to point out the most essential truths that are inevitable for having a firm understanding of these truths to enable one to take up to the path of spiritual perfection.</p>
<p>Desika mentions the scatement of Yamuna, quoted by Ramanuja viz., Feta fifa</p>
<p>feefangera? and endeavours to explain in detail the meanings and implications of this statement. This statement of Yamuna is mentioned by Ramanuja also. This expounds the nature of the three entities in a nutshell. The three kinds of sentients are the &lsquo;Bound&rsquo;, &lsquo;Liberated&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Eternal&rsquo;. The three achetanas are &lsquo;Triguna Dravya&rsquo; (Matter having three qualities), &lsquo;Time&rsquo; and &lsquo;Shuddha-Satva’. Swarupa means the essential nature of the &lsquo;Dharmi&rsquo; that is qualified by its unique characteristics. &lsquo;Sthithi&rsquo; means continuance in time. This is of two kinds. Eternal entities last for eternal time. The non eternal entities continue to exist subject to the will of the Lord, for such period. &lsquo;Pravritthi&rsquo; means functioning. This is of two forms - Positive (Pravritthi) and Negative (Nivritthi). All these entities are established according to the relevant pramanas. The prime subject of this chapter is briefly expounded in this significant statement. The Svarupa, Sthiti and Pravrithi of all the three kinds of sentients and non-sentients and their differences are subordinated to the supreme Paramatman.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that the &ldquo;Pramanas&rsquo; show always the essential nature of the several entities along with their characteristics (Dharma). There is absolutely no room for an undifferentiated object. The qualities determining the cssential nature of the entities are called &lsquo;Swarupa-Nirupaka</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Tacvatrayadhikara</p>
<p>Dharmas&rsquo;. The host of qualities that are dorived from the &lsquo;Swarupa-Nirupaka-Dharmas are called &lsquo;Nirupita-Swarupa Visheshanas&rsquo;. This chapter is a clear exposition of this significant statement. Nature of Jipatman</p>
<p>Jivatman has the essential characteristics of Jnanatva, Anandatva, Amalatva, Anutva and Shesharya or subservience to the Lord. It is not subservient to any other person than Isvara. This Sheshatva&rsquo; is a Swarupa-Nirupaka-Dharma'. The Jivarman can be defined as शेषत्वेसति चेतनत्वम् ।</p>
<p>The Jivatman is self - revealing. He can know himself by his essential nature. He can know other things through his ‘Dharma Bhuta Jnana'. His subservience to the Lord is signified in the first letter of &lsquo;Pranava&rsquo; and by the term Narayana' in the dative case. This subservience of the Jivatman to the Lord, culminates in his subscrvience to the Bhagavatas also.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Pravritthi&rsquo; of Jivatman is dependent upon the Lord i.e. Paradhina. The enjoyership and the doorship of the Jivatman are dependent upon the Lord, and have been granted to the Jivatman for subserving the purposes of the Lord himself.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Bound-Soul is associated with matter on account of his beginningless past karma of the form of transgression of the divine command. He is bound to Avidya, Karma: Vasana and Prakriti-Sambandha. There are infinite number of jivas. There is difference between one Jiva and another Jiva in the experience of their knowledge and happiness. The very many chetanas or Jivatmans are ranging from the four faced-Brahma to the tiny worm. Though their essential</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Sarım</p>
<p>nature of jnanatva, anandatva and anutva, is equal to one another, their Dharma Bhuta Jnana differs from Atman to Atman. All these Jivatmans are endowed with bodies according to their Karma and the Jivatman supports its body through his essential nature and also through Dharma Bhuta Jnanam. During the &lsquo;walking state, the chetanas support their body and function through it for adoption of spiritual practices and for attainment of objects of life. At the time of &lsquo;sushupthi&rsquo;, the Jivatman supports the body through the essential nature or Dharmi-Swarupa. When they are &lsquo;liberated&rsquo;, their Dharma Bhuta Jnana will be helpful for rendering loving service to the Lord and for experiencing the bliss of divine communion.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Bound-Jivas&rsquo; are &lsquo;Baddhas&rsquo;, migrating in this universe from birth to birth till they are &lsquo;liberated&rsquo;. They will be functioning virtuously or viciously, or in a way which is neither good nor bad. The &lsquo;liberated&rsquo; souls manifest in their real nature and they will by serving the Lord according to their desire for all times to come, enjoying the bliss of divine communion.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;eternals&rsquo; are distinguished from the other two categories of bound-selves and liberated-selves in the aspect of never contacting with &lsquo;matter&rsquo; at any time. From beginningless time, their true nature is ever manifested and their subservience to the Lord, their dependence upon the Lord and their experience of the Lord for all times to come, are experienced without any limitation. Their &lsquo;Pravritthi vishesha&rsquo; is to render all kinds of services to the Lord from beginningless time for all times to come.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Nityas&rsquo; are rendering distinguished and particular services to the Lord. They are Anantha, Garuda,</p>
<p>Tarvatrayadhikara</p>
<p>Vishwaksena and others. Each one serves the Lord in a particular way and the rest of them experience the same delight without any difference.</p>
<p>The nature of the chetanas or the Jivatmans is thus explained in such a way, as it becomes useful to a sadhaka, to evolve his spiritual discipline. Attributive Consciousness (or Dharma-Biruta Jnanam)</p>
<p>This is not mentioned separately as this happens to be included in the essential nature of the chetana or the atman. This is a unique doctrine which is admitted according to the authority of the scriptures. The scriptures declare that the atman is a Kartha, Bhoktha, Vijnatha. This knowership or doership signifies this attributive consciousness. As other philosophers have not admitted this entity of attributive consciousness, they find it difficult to explain the fact of knowledge. The &lsquo;Sankhyas&rsquo; and &lsquo;Advaitins&rsquo; attribute knowledge to the mind or Anthahkarana&rsquo; which is inert. They say knowledge is superimposed on the inert Anthahkarana. For them, the atman is pure consciousness without the fact of knowership. In the school of</p>
<p>Vishistadvaita&rsquo; the atman is of the essential nature of Jnanam or Jnana-Swarupa and it has the inseparable attribute of Jnanam or Dharma-Bhuta Jnanam. The atman is a ‘Prathyak' principle i.e., a self revealing entity. The atman knows itself as an Anukula', and as one and of the nature of bliss. Swarupa-Jnana can know itself; but, it cannot show other things. Dharma-Bhuta Jnanam is an inseparable attribute of the atman. It shows itself and other objects also to its Ashraya' or the self at the time of showing the objects (Vishaya-Prakashana-Kala). This Dharma-Bhuta Jnanam also is &lsquo;Swayam-Prakasha&rsquo; and does not require any other thing to make itself known. It is &lsquo;Ubhaya-Nirvahaka&rsquo;.</p>
<p>All atmans including Paramatman are qualified by this Dharma-Bhuta Jnanam. This attributive consciousness is subject to contraction and expansion during the state of &lsquo;samsara&rsquo; for the bound-souls.</p>
<p>When the bound-self liberates himself from the bondage (of samsara) by the grace of the Lord, his Dharma Bhuta Jnanam assumes its proper proportions and is not subjected to contraction at any time. The Dharma-Bhuta Jnanam of Nityas or the eternal ones and Paramatman is, from beginningless time, all pervasive and never subjected to any contraction whatsoever. This Dharma-Bhuta Jnanam illumines all objects to its source, the ashraya and will be helpful for supporting the body, when he is in the waking and the dream state. The &lsquo;Sutraka&rsquo; declares that the atman has knowership in the sutra 3: 37747' (V.S.2-3-19) and</p>
<p>Guerrara, 14.44.4:' (V.S.2-3-29).</p>
<p>This Dharma-Bhuta Jnanam is a substance as it is subjected to contraction or expansion. But it is an inseparable and eternal attribute of the atman, and it is existing even in the state of &lsquo;sushupti&rsquo;.</p>
<p>All atmans will be undergoing the experience of several objects either as agreeable or disagreeable, according to their karma. All objects in the world are the glory or vibhuti of the Lord and are agreeable always to the eternals, the liberated and Ishwara. All things are always agreeable to them. But, for the bound-selves, these objects of the world, will be agreeable to some extent or disagreeable, or neitherTatvatrayadhikara</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>agreeable nor disagrecable according to their respective karmas and also according to the differences of times or persons or places. This kind of disagreeability is entirely due to the fact that the Supreme Paramatman is apportioning the results according to the respective karmas of those people. This is the mode of awarding the results of karmas by the Supreme Lord who is Satya-Sankalpa. The bound souls are experiencing the results of their karma and for that they are having Swarupa-Yogyata and Sahakari-Yogyata. All Jivatmans are subordinated to the Lord and therefore, they have Swarupa-Yogyata for experiencing the phala given by the Lord. As they have transgressed the command of the Lord and have committed an offence that way, they have Sahakari-yogyata also. For the eternals and the liberated, though they havc Swarupa-Yogyata, they are not having Sahakari-Yogyata because of the absence of transgression of the divine command. The Lord is the ruler over all others and he is not answerable to any other person and so he has neither Swarupa-Yogyata nor Sahakari-Yogyata. It can be noted from this, that there is nothing like disagreeable and evil really, but certain things appear disagreeable to us on account of our own past karma.</p>
<p>The essential nature or Swarupa of all atmans including Ishvara, is self-luminous to the respective atmans. The Dharmi-Swarupa never undergoes contraction even while one is bound by samsara. It is ever pure. It is of the nature of consciousness and bliss whereas the Dharma-Bhuta Jnanam or the attributive consciousness is self-luminous only at the time of illumining the objects to its source.</p>
<p>Jnanatva and Swayam-Prakashatva are common to substantive consciousness and attributive consciousness. The</p>
<p>L</p>
<p>US</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyarraya Saram</p>
<p>Dharma-Bhura Jnanam cannot know itself - but it can show itself and other things – to its ashraya. The Dharmi-Jnanam or Swarupa-Jnanam cannot show anything but it can know itself. Therefore, they become objects of knowledge along with their attributes like Nityaeva, Vibhutva or Anurva through the extension of different knowledges gained from the shastra and others. As this school has admitted both these kinds of knowledge, the fact of generation of knowledge can be explaincd according to experience and the shastras.</p>
<p>Achetana Tatra (or Non-sentient substance)</p>
<p>The achetana or non-sentient substance is not conscious of itself. It is not a substratum or locus of knowledge. It reveals itself only to others. This is known as &lsquo;Parak-Tatva&rsquo; or an entity that shows itself only to others. These two characteristics of (1) not knowing itself and (2) revealing itself only to others, are common to all the non-sentient principles and Dharma-Bhuta Jnanam. Dharma-Bhuta Jnanam is considered as Swayam-Prakasha or self-luminous, though non-sentient, as it does not require any other thing for showing itself. This achetana or non-sentient principle is of three kinds viz., Prakriti, Kala and Shuddha-sarva. Matter and Time are inert and not self-luminous. Shudda-satva is self-luminous, though not a conscious entity according to the views of the Agamas. It is not self-revealing to those who are bound by karma and who are associated with matter. But, it is self-revealing to the eternals and the liberated and the Supreme Ishvara.</p>
<p>These three non-sentient entities are functioning according to the will of the Lord and they undergo modification to form different entities. Matter or Substance</p>
<p>Tatvatrayadhikara</p>
<p>es</p>
<p>that is characterised by the three gunas is undergoing change incessantly. Matter is an ashraya to the three gunas, and it is further classified into the twenty four categories such as Mula-Prakriti, Mahat, Ahankara, eleven indriyas, five tanmatras and the five elements. When all these three qualities are in the state of equilibrium (HR) then ensures Maha-Pralaya. When these three qualities are existing in different proportions, creation and sustenance happen. The primordial matter or Mula-Prakriti is infinite in proportion except in the place where the supreme eternal paramapada or abode of the Lord exists. The primordial matter will be undergoing change incessantly to result in the form of Mahat, Ahankara and others. In such areas where there happens to be a variation in respect of the qualities viz. Satva, Rajas and Tamas, all such wonderful transformations happen only according to the will of Ishvara and it is to be known that matter is also Brahmatmaka and that it is incapable of functioning independently. The several categories under matter are described differently according to the fact of laying emphasis on certain aspects. This trigunam or Prakriti which is a non-sentient substance, which is not self-aware, is spoken of as Akshara, Mula Prakriti, Avidya or Maya.</p>
<p>Iso is an eternal entity just like the Jivatman, but ever changing in its nature. This matter is the substance that marvellously transforms itself into the form of wonderful objects of this universe. This happens to be an inseparable attribute of the Supreme Paramatman both in its causal state and effected state. All these twenty-four entities are different from one another on account of their respective</p>
<p>characteristics.</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Sarain</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Asthrabhushanaadhyaya&rsquo; describes in a metaphorical way that all these twenty-four categorics along with the order of jivatman, are represented in the form of weapons and ornaments of the Lord. This metaphorical description is to point out that both the sentient and the non-sentient principles are ever subordinated to the will of the Lord and that they function only according to His will.</p>
<p>This triguna-dravya or Matter forms the body of the bound-jivatmans in different forms and the external world forming different aspects such as the mountains, rivers and trees and innumerable other forms. When a person gets rid of his beginningless karma duc to the grace of the Lord, his contact with Matter' comes to an end, and he will escape from the clutches of Matter'.</p>
<p>Matter is thus responsible for the functioning of the baddha-chetanas for gaining the experience of the world as well as gaining liberation. Through the qualities of Rajas and Tamas, Matter becomes the cause of Viparita-Jnana or perverse knowledge about the entities by covering the reality. It is then called Maya' as it hides the true nature of the jivatman as well as paramatman and it causes the idea of enjoyership in the experience of the sense objects. The same matter, when there is enhancement of the quality of satva, helps a chetana by illumining the reality as it is, and causes him to gain liberation. All these activities of matter are according to the will of the Lord and for the Leclarasa or Joy of the Lord. The Lord is ever compassionate and helpful but he waits for an inclination from the Jivatman to be saved. The jivatman will win the grace of the Lord on account of some good done knowingly or unknowingly and liberate himself from the bondage of matter. It is impossible</p>
<p>Tatvatrayadhikara</p>
<p>to get rid of the clutches of matter by one&rsquo;s own effort without the grace of the Lord. Shuddha Satva</p>
<p>Shuddha satva is the achetana dravya which is the asraya of pure satvaguna, unmixed with rajas or thamas. This takes the form of the eternal objects such as mantapa, gopura and other objects and the bodies of Isvara, nityas and muktas according to the will of Paramatman. They will be eternal if the Lord wills that they be eternal or non-eternal if they are willed to be sq. All these different effects will be the</p>
<p>14h (U to the sarvasheshin. This is useful to the shesha bhutas such as nityas and muktas as an instrument for divine service. As this shudhha satva is unmixed with rajas or tamas it will never obstruct origination of true knowledge and it illumines the nature of the Supreme Paramatman eminently. Though this is not a pratyak principle it is self - luminous just like Dharma bhuta jnanam. Kala (or Time)</p>
<p>Kala or Time is also a Jada' dravya or inert substance. This is perceived by all organs at the time of perceiving several objects. Kala can be known only as associated with the several objects. It cannot be known apart from the objects. It is eternal. The Upanishad says Agre' as related to creation. Kala exists before creation and even after pralaya. It is necessarily related to the world here and it is found also in Nitya Vibhuti. It is Jada and all - pervasive. There is the division of Kala inco Khanda-Kala and Mahakala. Mahakala qualifies all objects of all the worlds and is all - pervasive. Similarly, Khanda-kala is in the form of Kshana (moment), Lava (as aspect), Day, Night, Month, etc., and it is subject to modification. But the modification here is not a change in the nature of the entity. This modification is not in form of clay that undergoes change in its essential nature, but it is in the aspect of attaining a different state. The change in Kala is in the aspect of change in the number of &lsquo;Kshanas&rsquo; or Muhurthas etc. So many kshanas or moments make one muhurtha and so many muhurthas make one day, so many days make one month, so many months make one year. In this way, time - though one and all - pervasive - attains, different states on account of various duration&rsquo;s that are counted in relation to the several objects; and the objects qualified by such states are called &lsquo;Anitya&rsquo; or non-eternal. This Time or Kala is found even in Paramapada, and it does not limit the objects there, but is subordinated to the will of the Lord. Doctrine of Ishvara</p>
<p>The essential nature, the continuance of nature and the functioning of all entities enumerated above are dependent upon the essential nature and will of the Supreme Paramatman. All these entities are existing is their essential nature only on account of the existence of Ishvara. This is known as Swarupashrita. Likewise, the functioning of all these entities is dependent upon the sankalpa or the will of Paramatman. So, they are sankalpashrita.</p>
<p>Ishvara or the Supreme Paramatman is the prime doctrine or all scriptures. All philosophers except the charuvakas, the sankhyas, admit Ishvara and assign him a place in their doctrines. It is only Ramajuna&rsquo;s school that propounds Ishvara faithfully according to the scriptures and assign him the highest place. The schools of Yoga, Nyaya</p>
<p>Tatvatrayadhikara</p>
<p>and Mimamsa - though admit Ishvara - have not assigned the proper place for him. They give a lower status to Ishvara. Even amongst Vedantic Schools, it is Vishistadvaita that gives him proper importance and assigns the due status as ordained in the scriptures. The school of Advaita designates Ishvara as Aparabrahma by ranking him lower than the higher Brahman which they call undifferentiated consciousness. Even in the school of Madhva, Ishvara is admitted only as an instrumental cause of this universe and not as the material cause. They posit non-difference between</p>
<p>Ishvara and his qualities.</p>
<p>Ishvara is the one supreme doctrine, who is expounded in all scriptures, Agamas and the Divyaprabhandams. The school of Vishistadvaita establishes Ishvara as the most supreme being who is the support, the ruler and the sheshin of all other entities. Ishvara is necessarily &lsquo;Saguna&rsquo; and never nirguna. The essential nature of Ishvara is described as follows: 1. He is inseparably qualified by the essential qualities of</p>
<p>Satya, Jnana, Ananta, Ananda and Amala. These qualities determine his essential nature. These are called Swarupa-Nirupaka-Dharmas. It is ordained in the scriptures that while meditating upon Ishvara, one should do so as qualified by all these Swarupa</p>
<p>Nirupaka-Dharmas. 2. All other auspicious qualities such as Bala, Virya, Tejas,</p>
<p>Sousheelya, Vathsalya, Mardva and others and various Vibhutis and the divine auspicious forms are all derived from the essential nature described above. They are called Nirupita-Swarupa-Visheshanas or particular qualities derived from the essential nature. Of these</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>auspicious qualities the six qualities (or shadgunas) known as Jnana, Bala, Aishvarya, Virya, Shakti and Tejas are qualities that point out his supremacy. Qualities such as Soushcelya, Vathsalya, Mardava, Arjava and a host of others are establishing the accessibility of the supreme. All these infinite qualities arc at all times dependent upon His essential nature. Of these six prime qualities, it is said that in the incarnation of &ldquo;Vyuha' (such as Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha) two - two qualities are prominently noticed and the other qualities are unmanifested. This is expounded in the Agamas. It is said that all these six qualities are manifested in the vyuha Vasudeva and the two qualities such as Bala and Jnanam are manifested in the incarnation of Sankarshana by means of which he actuates &lsquo;Pralaya&rsquo; and &lsquo;Shastra-Prayartana&rsquo;. Two qualities viz., Aishvarya and Virya are manifested in the incamation of Pradhyumna and are useful in creation of this universe and also promulgation of Dharma. Two qualities of Shakthi and Tejas are manifested in the vyuha incarnation of Aniruddha and these qualities are helpful in rendering protection and tacva-jnana-pradana. षाशुण्यात् वासुदेवः परइति स भवान् मुक्तभोग्यो बलाढ्यात्</p>
<p>बोधात्संकर्षणस्त्वं हरसि वितनेषु शास्त्रमैश्वर्य वीर्यात् । प्रद्युम्नाधर्मो नयसि च भगवान् शक्तितेजोनिरद्धः बिभ्राणः पासि तत्त्वं गमयसि च तथा व्यूह्य रंगाधिराज ॥</p>
<p>(Teka: splexi ste - ) All the vyuhas have always these six qualities, but in the respective vyuhas the respective two qualities are made</p>
<p>Tarvatrayadhikara</p>
<p>patent while others are latent. The five forms of the supreme are Para, Vyuha, Vibhava, Harda and Archa. The &lsquo;Para&rsquo; is the form of the supreme residing in the highest abode of Paramapada. The &ldquo;Vyuha' incarnation is described as comprising four vyuhas, when the Vasudeva-Vyuha is counted separately. As the Vasudeva-Vyuha is the same as Para-Vasudeva or the Para-Roopa, it is sometimes described as having three forms only. These different forms of the one Supreme Lord, characterised by all infinite auspicious qualities, are meditated upon by different kinds of upasakas. From these four main vyuhas, the twelve sub-vyuhas such as Keshava, Narayana and others are derived,</p>
<p>The Vibhava-Avataras are historical incarnations related to particular places and times, and causes. In these incarnations, the Lord manifests himself with the desired qualities and hides certain qualities. The ten incarnations are most prominent (such as the divine fish and others) among these historical incarnations.</p>
<p>Lord Krishna has taught the secret of the Divine incarnations in the Gita. The divine incarnations are (1) real; (2) there is no diminution of knowledge or essential nature of the Lord in the incarnations; (3) the bodies of the Lord in incarnations will be of &lsquo;Shuddha-Satva&rsquo; or pure satva and never material comprising of the three gunas; (4) the cause of Divine incarnation is His own will or sankalpa and not karma as in the case of others; (5) the time of incarnation is thc time when He has to protect Dharma; (6) the purpose of Divine incarnation is Sadhu-paritraga or protecting the Godly ones by granting his communion. The Lord declares in the Gita that one who has realised this secret knowledge of the incarnation (Avatara Rahasya Jnanam) would gain</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>liberation at the end of that birth alone and that he would not be born again.</p>
<p>Similarly the Archavatara is of great significance. One who devotes himself to the worship of the Archa incarnation, would gain liberation without heavy strain. This form of the Lord is easily accessible to all at all times unlike other forms of the Lord. Shounaka ordains thus -</p>
<p>सुंरूपां प्रतिमा विष्णोः प्रसन्नवदनेक्षणाम् । कृत्वात्मनः प्रीतिकरी सुवर्णरजतादिभिः ॥ तामर्चयेत्तां प्रणमेत् तां यजेत्तां विचिन्तयेत् । विशत्यपास्तदोषस्तु तामेव ब्रह्मरूपिणीम् ।।</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making a beautiful idol of Sri Mahavishnu having beautiful features as eyes, face and graceful looks, out of gold or silver or others, one should worship the Lord, bow down to Him, surrender unto Him, meditate upon Him; such a one freed from all blemishes is sure to attain that Supreme Paramatman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of all forms of the Lord, the Archa is most easily accessible and most significant. The great Alwars have realised the &lsquo;Avatara-Rahasya-Jnanam&rsquo; and &lsquo;Archavatara Vailakshanyam&rsquo; and have sought refuge with the Lord in this form alonc.</p>
<p>The Lord is said to be in the form of an Antaryamin for purposes of meditation by yogins as residing in their hearts. The antaryamitva of the Lord is two-fold. As declared by the scriptures, he entered into all entities – sentient and non-sentient - having the jivatman as his body, and articulated differentiations of names and forms. There will</p>
<p>126Tatvatrayadhikara</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>not be the thinghood (padartatva) of a thing - sentient or non-sentient - without this inner principle. When he is immanent in every entity thus - as the inner-self - what is the significance in positing the Harda form of the Lord? Though the supreme being is &lsquo;Sarvantaryamin&rsquo; he shows himself to the yogins that are engaged in meditation upon him as residing in their heart in his most auspicious form. This unique form of the Lord is known as the Harda aspect. The yogins mcditate upon this auspicious divine nature of the Supreme Paramatman residing in their heart. Such yogins are engaged in Astanga Yoga and they are intent upon Hrdyaga or Manasa puja. They are qualified to meditate upon the Divyatma Swarupa of the &lsquo;Sarvantaryamin&rsquo; as residing in their heart.</p>
<p>अष्टाङ्गयोगसिद्धानां हृद्यागनिरतात्मनाम् । योगिनां अधिकारस्स्यात् एकस्मिन् हृदयेशये ॥</p>
<p>In all these forms of incarnations, the Supreme Paramatman is never tainted with any kind of karma or results of the karma. His Divya-Mangala-Vigraha or Divine Auspicious form is formed of &lsquo;Shudha-Satva&rsquo; Dravya or Aparakruta Dravya and so it is called &lsquo;Shudha-Srishti&rsquo;.</p>
<p>These forms of the Lord will cause the attainment of the realisation of the auspicious qualities of the Lord to a wifefs and strengthen his Maha-Vishvas or great faith in the Lord at the time of performance of Prapatti.</p>
<p>The functions of the Supreme Paramatman who is a home of all-knowledge, power, compassion, and a host of other auspicious qualities, are creation of the entire universe, protection and destruction of the same, granting of S10</p>
<p>I el</p>
<p>liberation to the deserving souls that pray for liberation and maintaining this universe by residing in all entities as their inmost-self. All these functions are undertaken by the Lord for the fulfilment of His own ananda or delight. They are all natural to Him and He is not functioning under any other compulsion. This is leela (or sport). Lecla (or sport) is explained by mastecs as compassion for the souls that are bound from beginningiess time to samsara, Desika describes in his Dayashataka that creation and destruction of the universe are the acts of compassion for erring humanity.</p>
<p>According to the infallible authorities of the scriptures, it is understood that the Lord is inseparably associated in all states with Goddess Mahalakshmi who is the Mother of this universe. The Purushasuktha declares that the Supreme Divinity is ever associated with Mahalakshmi. Sriman Narayana and Mahalakshmi together form the &lsquo;Paratatva&rsquo; or the supreme reality. All acts of the Lord are performed along with Sri Mahalakshmi, Both of them are the sheshins for the hosts of sentient and non-sentient objects 3418Hach शेषित्वम्</p>
<p>The great masters of the yore as well as the Alwars have realised this truth of the Supreme Divinity being two-in one and one-in-two.</p>
<p>Parasharabhattar and others have taught that the greatness of both is infinite and they have by mutual consent divided their functions. &lsquo;Sugu ' or punishing according to the sins committed, is the unique function of the Lord whereas &lsquo;purushakaratva&rsquo; or appealing to the Lord on behalf of erring humanity is the unique function of Goddess Mahalakshmi.</p>
<p>Tatvatrayadhikara</p>
<p>Mahalakshmi has never known Nigraha&rsquo; or causing punishment. She is ever associated with the Lord and is full of compassion and so, argues in favour of those that surrender unto the Lord and gets protection of those from the Lord. So, anyone can confidently approach the Lord at any time praying for forgiveness for the wrongs done and secking protection of the Lord. Mahalakshmi thus is the saviour of humanity in the form of mediatrix, who always lends her cars to the wocs of humanity.</p>
<p>Desika points out that an awareness of the nature of the Supreme Principle, Sriman Narayana along with Goddess Mahalakshmi and the nature of the jivatman and the nature of the matter broadly as described here, is absolutely necessary for undertaking the spiritual disciplines for one&rsquo;s redemption. This much is absolutely necessary. All elaborations in innumerable works are only strengthening this knowledge firmly.</p>
<p>The three entities are explained thus. It may be thought of as one Supreme Reality, as qualified by all others, or it may be understood as the &lsquo;ruler&rsquo; and the &lsquo;ruled&rsquo;, &lsquo;the Arman and the Antaman&rsquo;, &lsquo;the protector and the objects to be protected&rsquo;. In whatever way it is explained, the knowledge of these will be helpful for working out one&rsquo;s upward evolution.</p>
<p>One should know that gaining the knowledge of the shastras is very difficult, as there are different views supporting and refuting the several doctrines. It may disturb the peace of one&rsquo;s mind. So, one should listen to that which is of supreme good viz. The Supreme Paramatman, and then practise the discipline of Prapati or Bhakti Yoga without going further again into the study of the shastras consisting of objections and confusions. The idea is that once when he knows the truth from the instruction of the Acharya, he should hurry to save himself without unnecessary further investigations.</p>
<p>शास्त्रज्ञानं बहुक्लेशं बुद्धेः चलनकारणम् । उपदेशात् हरि बुध्वा विरमेत्सर्वकर्मसु ।</p>
<p>The abandonment of all karmas mentioned here relates to the study of the shastra which is of the form of objections and answers based on logic. When he has known the ultimate truth from the Acharya, he need not further indulge in futile discussions that are comprising of various arguments for and against.</p>
<p>Desika concludes this chapter with one very meaningful verse, which is to be remembered always .</p>
<p>उपयुक्तेषु वैशद्यं त्रिवर्गनिरपेक्षता । करणत्रयसारूप्यं इति सौख्य रसायनम् ॥</p>
<p>There are three most important factors mentioned in this verse - 1. The truths regarding the essential knowledge to be</p>
<p>gained and the various modes of actions to be undertaken, are mentioned here as &lsquo;Upayukthesu&rsquo;. One should have clarity and steadfastness in them. This is &lsquo;Vaishadya&rsquo;. This is gained from &lsquo;Manana&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chintana&rsquo; of the truths taught by the acharyas. When one reflects</p>
<p>on these truths, all doubts and contradictions disappear.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The second factor is that one should get himself rid of</li>
</ol>
<p>desire for the attainment of benefits related to Dharma, Artha and Kama, after reflecting over their defects such</p>
<p>Tacvatrayadhikara</p>
<ol start="3">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>as &lsquo;alpatva&rsquo;, &lsquo;asthiratva&rsquo;, &lsquo;duhka-mulatva&rsquo;, &lsquo;Duhka mishratva&rsquo; and others.</p>
<p>The third factor is Karanatraya-sarupyam. This means uniformity of the functions of the mind, speech and actions. &lsquo;Sarupyam&rsquo; means &lsquo;Anurupatva&rsquo; - of similar form - and non-difference between one another. And the attainment of these three is said to be &lsquo;soukhya Rasayanam&rsquo;. &lsquo;Soukhya&rsquo; incans &lsquo;mahanandam&rsquo;. &lsquo;Rasayanam&rsquo; is &lsquo;Sadhanam&rsquo;. That means these are ever realised means of attainment of great delight. Thus, in this chapter of Tatvatrayadhikara, Desika has expounded the essential nature of the three entities, the knowledge of which is absolutely necessary for undertaking any spiritual discipline clearly and concisely.</p>
<h2 id="०६-परदवत-परमरथयधकर">०६ परदेवता-पारमार्थ्याधिकारः</h2>
<p>Paradevata Paramarthyadhikara</p>
<p>CHAPTER - VI</p>
<p>Paradevata Paramarthyadhikara</p>
<p>After having taught the nature of the three entities viz. Matter, Jivatman and Paramatman, in a general way, Desika has established in this chapter i.e. Paradevata Paramarthyadhikara, the nature of the particular deity which is the supreme reality. According to the teaching of the scriptures, the Supreme Brahman described in the Upanishads is verily the same highest divinity of religion. The distinction made by Advaitins between Supreme Brahman and Iswara is not tenable because there are no valid &lsquo;pramanas&rsquo; for positing such a difference. The argument of the advaitins that on account of the T ' or auspicious limiting adjuncts, the undifferentiated brahman is appearing as Ishwara, is not acceptable, as it is only &lsquo;kalpitha&rsquo; or a fabric of imagination.</p>
<p>Ramanuja has declared in the introductory verse itself of his Sri Bhashyam, that the Supreme Brahman is Srinivasa or Sriman Narayana inseparably associated with Goddess Mahalakshmi. While defining the word &lsquo;Brahma&rsquo; of the first sutra - 32TT) CESETH (.4.&mdash;8) - Ramanuja says - &lsquo;ब्रह्मशब्देन च निरस्तनिखिलदोषः अनवधिकातिशय कल्याणगुणः पुरुषोत्तमो ऽभिधीयते। सर्वत्र बृहत्वगुणयोगेनहि ब्रह्मशब्दः । बृहत्त्वं च स्वरूपेण गुणैश्च यत्र अनवधिकातिशयं सः अस्य मुख्योऽर्थः । स च सर्वेश्वर एवं&rsquo;।</p>
<p>In the Brahma-sutras, while explaining the meanings of the sutra &ldquo;f*4ral alcania:&rdquo; (.. - 3-3-83) Ramanuja declares that the essential nature of the Supreme Brahman, to be meditated upon in all Brahmopasanas, is determined as Sriman Narayana. It is the conclusion of the Sutrakara according to Ramanuja that the object of meditation that is described in the Upanishads differently as Akshara, Shiva, Shambu, Parabrahma, Paranjyoti, Paratatva, Paramatman, Sat, Akasha, Prana, Dahara, Jyoti and others, culminate in Sriman Narayana. The analogy of &ldquo;Chagapasu Nyaya&rdquo; is followed in determining the name of the particular dcity that is to be meditated upon in all modes of Brahmopasana. The general names or terms culminate in Sriman Narayana. This fact of Sriman Narayana being the ultimate Rcality to be meditated upon is expressly declared in the Mahanarayana Upanishad. The same truth is established in the Itihasas, Puranas, and Divya Prabhandhams. There are profuse authorities that establish the fact of Narayana being the supreme deity to be meditated upon for obtaining &lsquo;Moksha&rsquo; or liberation.</p>
<p>In view of all these facts, Vedantha Desika has expounded the whole reality of the &lsquo;Paradevata Swarupa&rsquo; in one section where he has drawn quotations from innumerable authorities to prove that the supreme deity is Sriman Narayana.</p>
<p>In an introductory vecse to this chapter, Desika declares that well-meaning people who depend upon valid means of knowledge never give credence to the different doctrines o Ishvara, proposed by unwise people. Those different doctrines arc of different forms such as</p>
<p>आत्मैक्यं देवतैक्यं त्रिकसमधिगता तुल्यतैक्यं त्रयाणां अन्यत्रैश्वर्यमित्याद्यनिपुणफणितीः आद्रियन्ते न सन्तः । त्रय्यन्तैरेककण्ठैस्तदनुगुणमनु व्यासमुख्योक्तिभिश्च श्रीमानारायणो नः पतिरखिलतनुः मुक्तिदो मुक्तभोग्यः ।।</p>
<p>Paradcvata Paramarthyadhikara</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>(A) Oneness of all the three entities - Atmaikyam ; (B) Oneness of all deities with Paramatman - Devataikyam ; (C) Equality among the trinity viz. Brahma, Vishnu and</p>
<p>Shiva ; (D) Supreme deity higher than the trinity, Brahma, Vishnu</p>
<p>and Shiva - TT RR &lsquo;I</p>
<p>Yadavaprakasha&rsquo;s view was that there is only one Brahman (Dravyam) and that it has undergone change to assume the state of chetana and achetana. His view is that the Supreme Brahman alone has undergone change to become Ishvara, Jiva and Matter.</p>
<p>The second view - Devataikyam - posits oneness of the nature of the deity and there is no difference in nature of that divinity, though there is &lsquo;Sarira-Bheda&rsquo; of deities such as Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Indra, Agni, etc.</p>
<p>The next view is &lsquo;fachaTICI Ra&rsquo;i This view posits that the three gods viz. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are equal in jnana, shakti and other qualities. All the three are equals.</p>
<p>The next view is &lsquo;n voi&rsquo; | Oneness of the three deities. The next view is that the supreme is higher than the trinity; that means faucitura&rsquo;</p>
<p>Desika suggests that there are certain views that try to establish the supremacy of Brahma or Rudra over the other two. All these views are unfounded because there are so many authorities that establish the supremacy of Sriman Narayana over all others.</p>
<p>Desika says that the Upanishads in one voice declare that Sriman Narayana is the Gea He says Pant: acud; because in the Purva-Bhaga&rdquo;, many other deities have been - in the context of karma - spoken as supreme. But in the Upanishads, it is universally declared that Vishnu - Narayana</p>
<p>is the &lsquo;Paradevatha&rsquo;. This kind of scriptural authority is not to be found in support of other doctrines of paradevatha.</p>
<p>These scriptural statements are corroborated by the teachings of Manu, Vyasa and others that are according to the Veda. This is suggested by the term suur&rsquo; and excludes the rajasic and the tamasic puranas that are opposed to the teachings of the Veda. The teachings of Valmiki, Parashara, Shuka and Shaunaka and other such masters also are implied in this statement. So, it is suggested here that certain statements that are contrary to this doctrine found in rajasic and tamasic puranas are not to be considered as authoritative. Desika declares the conclusion in the fourth line of this verse -</p>
<p>&lsquo;श्रीमान् नारायणो नः पतिरखिलतनुः मुक्तिदो मुक्तभोग्यः&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this statement, it is established that the supreme reality is inseparably associated with Goddess Sri. The paradevatha is both Sri and Narayana. Sri also is paradevatha. He is the Lord of everything other than himself. The word &lsquo;ufa:&rsquo; signifies that he is &lsquo;Sheshin&rdquo; and all entities other than Sriman Narayana are for subserving his purposes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Akhila-tanuh&rsquo; signifies that Sriman Narayana is the antharyamin&rsquo; in every other entity and when other doctrines such as Rudra, Indraprana, are ordained to be meditated upon, they signify the one, non-second antaryamin in all. Every other entity than the supreme Narayana, is his body; that means, it is supported, ruled over and used for his purposes.</p>
<p>CS</p>
<p>Paradevata Paramarthyadhikara</p>
<p>&lsquo;Muktida&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mukta-bhogyah&rsquo; are very significant terms. The meaning of the term &lsquo;devatha&rsquo; is a chetana that is to be worshipped and that grants the fruits of upasana, and - this happens to be very true in respect of Sriman Narayana. He, the all-self, is to be worshipped and the &lsquo;phala&rsquo; is also obtained from Him alone. Sriman Narayana is the Supreme Paradevatha that is experienced in the state of liberation. Thus, in the introductory verse, Desika has described the nature of the Supreme Reality.</p>
<p>At the very outset, a doubt arises whether it is necessary to determine the nature of the particular deity to be meditated upon. Would it not be enough if one understands that Ishvara is different and distinct from the Jiva To realise that the &lsquo;Prerita&rsquo; or Ishvara is different and distinct from the Jivatman or bhokta as well as from matter which is the object of enjoyment, would it not be enough for jivatman for gaining moksha?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is that an aspirant should have a definite understanding about the nature of the paradevata or Supreme Deity, for attaining liberation from the contact of matter. His efforts for gaining the knowledge of Paramatman, should not be misdirected and wasted. Because &lsquo;Moksha&rsquo; is possible of attainment only by one who is solely attached to the Supreme Deity – who is the means as well as the end. Only a paramaikantin can gain liberation immediately from the Supreme Deity. As it is established by valid authorities that there is real difference and distinction between the chetana and achetana, the view point of Yadavaprakasha and others that everything is Brahma-Dravya or Brahman in substance is incompatible. The difference between the jivas and Ishvara is established. Similarly, difference between one Jiva and another jiva is also</p>
<p>OswerEssence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>established. The variations in respect of different jivas in their abilities, knowledge, experience of joy and sorrow and others, are established by the scriptures and as these differences are real, the doctrine that all gods such as Brahma, Rudra and others and Ishvara are non-different is not correct. The gods such as Brahma, Rudra, Indra and others, are all labouring under the stress and strain of karma and they are all created by the one Supremc Deity, and so it cannot be held that they are all one with Ishvara. Except the one, non-second Supreme Lord, who is the creator of the universe, all others including the hicrarchy of gods, beginning with the four-faced Brahma, are subordinatcd to Him and therefore, they cannot be one with Ishvara. They are all &lsquo;samsarins&rsquo; holding different positions due to their different kinds of karma, good or bad. The scriptures declare in one voice that the Supreme Narayana is the cause of the origination, sustenance and destruction of the universe comprising of sentients and non-sentients.</p>
<p>Vedantha Desika quotes innumerable &lsquo;pramanas&rsquo; from the scriptures, the Itihasa, Puranas, the Agamas and the Divyaprabandams, to establish the fact that Sriman Narayana is the one paradevata, who is the innerself in all other entities. The Taittiriya Upanishad, the Mahanarayana Upanishad, the Atharvashiropanishad, the Subalopanishad, expressly declare that Sriman Narayana is the Supreme Devata.</p>
<p>Some of the authorities that declare that Vishnu or Narayana as the Supreme Deity, may be mentioned as follows :</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the time of the dissolution of this universe, when the &lsquo;Mahat&rsquo; tatva merged in the primordial matter, the great universal-self, the Lord Sriman Narayana existed. &lsquo;16 Hoa प्राप्ने प्रलीने प्रकृतौ महान् । एकस्तिष्ठति विश्वात्मा स तु नारायणः प्रभुः&rsquo;।</p>

<p>&ldquo;The primeval being was Sriman Narayana. From Him was born the four-faced Brahma, and from him was born Shiva.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;परो नारायणो देवः तस्माज्जातश्चतुर्मुखः । तस्मात् रुद्रोऽभवत् ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;For protecting all entities, you incorporated yourself, out of your will, in the midst of the trinity, as &lsquo;Vishnu&rsquo; &lsquo;रक्षार्थं सर्वभूतानां विष्णुत्वं उपजग्मिवान्&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>__ &ldquo;Except that one &lsquo;Purusha&rsquo;, the primeval Vasudeva, there is no entity either moving or non-moving that is eternal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;नित्यं हि नास्ति जगति भूतं स्थावर जङ्गमम् ।</p>
<p>ऋते तमेकं पुरुषं वासुदेवं सनातनम् ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;All gods worship Vasudeva, all gods bow down to Vasudeva&rdquo;. &lsquo;सर्वेदेवाः वासुदेवं यजन्ते सर्वे देवाः वासुदेवं नमन्ते&rsquo;।</p>
<p>&ldquo;All gods including Brahma, Rudra and Indra, and all great sages are solely worshipping the Supreme God, Narayana&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;सब्रह्मकास्सरुद्राश्च सेन्द्रा देवा महर्षयः । अर्चयन्ति सुरश्रेष्ठं देवं नारायणं हरिम्&rdquo;।</p>
<p>It is decidedly declared in the scriptures that gods like Brahma, Rudra and others, are creations of the Supreme Lord Narayana and that Supreme Narayana, is the antaryamin of all those gods. It is pointed out that the gods that occupy. positions of Brahma or Rudra, have attained those positions by means of their services to the Lord. They hold such positions on account of the grace of the one Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>&lsquo;ब्रह्माद्यास्सकला देवाः मनुष्याः पशवस्तथा । विष्णुमायामहावर्तमोहान्धतमसा वृता:&rsquo; ।।</p>
<p>These gods are subordinated to the delusion of matter or prakruthi and are dominated by the interplay of the threc &lsquo;gunas&rsquo; viz. Satva, Rajas and Tamas and their knowledge is subjected to expansion and contraction and they serve the Lord, their antaryamin, in accordance with their understanding of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>They are also the Vibhuti or the inseparable attributes of the Supreme Lord who is the Master of the two vibhutis viz. the &lsquo;Leela&rsquo; Vibhuti and &lsquo;Nitya&rsquo; Vibhuti.</p>
<p>The following reasons establish that Sriman Narayana alone is the one Supreme Deity ruling over all other entities :</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Sriman Narayana is the &lsquo;Sarveswara&rsquo; who is the creator of all others including Brahma, Rudra, Indra, Agni and others. These different deities are all in fact jivatmans occupying different positions on account of their meritorious karmas.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;purusha&rsquo; who was created by Sriman Narayana is called in this world as &lsquo;Brahma&rsquo;. &lsquo;Ka&rsquo; is the name of the chaturmukha Brahma. I am the master of all living beings called by the name &lsquo;Isa&rsquo; Both of us were born of your body. So, you are called &lsquo;Keshava&rsquo;. a la CEMT-14 $21156 Hd देहिनाम् । आवां तवांगे सम्भूतौ तस्मात् केशवनामवान्&rsquo; । 2. All jivatmans - other than Paramatman - are dominated</p>
<p>by karma (Karma-Vashya) and worshipping the Supreme Narayana, they have gained their respectable positions. They worshipped the Lord and the Lord being pleased</p>
<p>Paradcyata Paramarthyadhikarą</p>
<p>with their worship, has granted them those celebrated positions of &lsquo;Brahma&rsquo;, &lsquo;Shiva&rsquo; and &lsquo;Indra&rsquo;.</p>
<p>All gods including Indra, Rudra and Brahma and all great sages worship the supreme deity Srihari otherwise known as &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seek refuge with that great Lord whom even Brahma, Isvara and others do not understand, as he is, in spite of meditating upon him continuously&rdquo;.</p>
<p>युगकोटि सहस्राणि विष्णुमाराध्य पद्मभूः ।</p>
<p>पुनस्त्रैलोक्य धातृत्वं प्राप्तवानिति शुश्रुम'।</p>
<p>&ldquo;The louts-born Brahma worshipped Vishnu for thousands of crores of yugas (yuga-koti-sahasrani) and once again obtained the position of that Chaturmuka-Brahma&rdquo;. 3. All gods are subjugated to the &lsquo;Maya&rsquo; or Prakriti of the</p>
<p>Lord. They are dominated by the trigunas. Their Dharma-Bhuta-Jnanam, is subjected to contraction and expansion. This is evident from the very many episodes of vedapahara, the sin of brahma-hatya and others. It was the Lord who came to their rescue at the times of their peril and so these gods cannot be considered as the</p>
<p>&lsquo;Paradevata&rsquo;. 4. All these other gods depend upon the Lord - their</p>
<p>antaryamin - for gaining knowledge and for serving the Lord according to his commands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these gods are not pure, because they are all born differently according to their respective karma&rdquo;.</p>
<p>आब्रह्मस्तम्बपर्यन्तं जगदन्तर्व्यवस्थिताः । प्राणिनः कर्म जनित संसार वशवर्तिनः ॥ &ldquo;All living beings beginning with the Brahma, upto the smallest insect, are beings that are migrating in this world on account of their different karmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beginning with that Brahma, all living beings are not pure and auspicious as they are all floundering in &lsquo;samsara&rsquo; on account of karma. So, for a &lsquo;virakta&rsquo; the Supreme Goal is Vasudeva alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;कर्मणां परिपाकत्वात् आविरिश्चादमंगलम् । इतिमत्वा विरक्तस्य वासुदेवः परागतिः&rsquo;।</p>
<p>The Supreme Narayana is the &lsquo;ashrayaneeya&rsquo; or ultimate refuge to all other gods. But for that Supreme Narayana, there is no one who his &ldquo;ashrayaneeya&rdquo;. &lsquo;ममाश्रयो न कश्चित्तु सर्वेषां आश्रयोऽह्यहम् ।</p>
<p>Gods take refuge in Rudra. Rurda has Brahma as his refuge and that Brahma takes refuge in me and I have no one to take refuge. I am the final refuge.&rdquo; - says the Lord. The Supreme Narayana is the Lord of both the Nitya vibhuti and Leela-vibhuti. All others are the vibhutis of that Supreme Lord. The auspicious term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; itself</p>
<p>signifies that &lsquo;Supremacy&rsquo; of Narayana. 8. All entities - sentient and non-sentient - are the bodies of</p>
<p>the Lord, and the Supreme Lord - &lsquo;Sriman Narayana&rsquo; - is the antaryamin in all entities. All others are subservient to the Supreme Narayana.</p>
<p>In &lsquo;Mantraraja-pada-stotra, the most eminent Rudra himself declares as follows :- &lsquo;ALGU: Fag: HI HATA: परमात्मनः । अतोऽहमपि ते दासः इति मत्वा नमाम्यहम्&rdquo;।</p>

<p>&ldquo;All atmans are the servants of that Paramatman by their nature. So, I am also your &lsquo;dasa&rsquo;. Knowing thus, I seek refuge with you.&rdquo; 9. Those who are blessed with the glances of Supreme</p>
<p>Narayana at the time of their birth, are said to gain the preponderance of &lsquo;satva&rsquo; that leads them to become &lsquo;Mumukshus&rsquo;. But the glances of others are leading to</p>

<ol start="10">
<li>It is declared clearly that gods like Brahma and Rudra,</li>
</ol>
<p>are not &lsquo;upasyas&rsquo; for a person who desires moksha. Sriman Narayana is the &ldquo;upasya&rdquo; of even Brahma and Rudra, as well as all other aspirants of liberation. संसारार्णवमग्नानां विषयाक्रान्तचेतसाम् । विष्णुपोतं विना नान्यत् किंचिदस्ति परायणम्।</p>

<p>They can be worshipped by those who wish for earthly benefits and even in that case, the one, non-second, antaryamin is in fact the ultimate object of worship and the benefits granted by that Lord are given through those gods. Just like acharyas, other gods may be moksha-upakarakas or promoters of liberation. Those who crave for liberation, do not worship Brahma or Shiva or any other deity from whom one can get little benefit. &ldquo;Srihari alone is to be meditated upon always by you who are established in satva&rdquo;. &ldquo;That Supreme Lord is verily the &lsquo;upasya&rsquo;. I am only a means to that meditation of the Supreme&rdquo; (the statement of Rudra).</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>fict: HGT : Hale: HHRT: 1</p>
<p>34RTIST HET Pàm:341415 : nt&rsquo;ll 11. It is learnt from the epics and the puranas that the</p>
<p>Supreme Lord is &lsquo;sathya-sankalpa&rsquo; and if he wills to punish anybody, no other person can save him. If he</p>
<p>wills to protect some one, no one on earth can avert it. 12. There is a hierarchy of gods. These gods, their powers to</p>
<p>grant phala, and the modes of their worship are all ordained by the Lord himself. Any one who seeks benefits from such gods, gets those benefits according to the will of the Supreme himself. But, those benefits are little and impermanent. If, on the other hand, one approaches the Lord for even earthly benefits, he gets those desires fulfilled and notwithstanding those little benefits, he will ultimately gain dispassion and attains the Lord himself gradually, by some spiritual discipline or other.</p>
<p>This wisdom of the nature of the Supreme Deity is very essential particularly for a '</p>
<p>Mumukshu&rsquo;. One has the liberty to choose any god he pleases and pray for any benefit he desires. If it is in the powers of such gods, he can gain them. If he realises that he is worshipping the one Supreme Narayana, in worshipping the other gods, he will gain immense benefits and will be endowed with the necessary knowledge for liberating himself from samsara. But, it is decidedly declared that for gaining liberation one has to seck thc &lsquo;Paradevata&rsquo; and worship Him ardently.</p>
<p>This exposition is only placing the facts before aspirants and is not in any way belittling other gods.</p>
<p>Paradevara Paramarthyadhikara</p>
<p>One may worship any god. It is better than becoming an atheist. The Lord says in the Gita, that he is going to strengthen the faith of a person who is devoted to some other god. That person may, after a long time, gain the real knowledge of the &lsquo;paradevara&rsquo; at some time or other and save himself. But, it is wise to determine in the very beginning itself the nature of the &lsquo;paradevata&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Desika points out that the three mantras or rahasyas, enshrine the truth of the &lsquo;paradevata&rsquo;. In the Mulamantra, the letter &lsquo;Aa&rsquo; in pranava and the third word, &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo;, point out to this Supreme Deity. The term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; qualified by &lsquo;Sri&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Dvaya-mantra&rsquo; and the words &lsquo;Mam&rsquo; and &lsquo;Aham&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Charama-sloka&rsquo;, signify the reality of the &lsquo;Paradevara&rsquo;. The Taittiriya Upanishad and the Mahanarayana glorify the &lsquo;Paradevata&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As pointed out already, the &lsquo;paradevata&rsquo; consists of a duality viz. Goddess Sri and Narayana.</p>
<p>Sri Parashara in Vishnu Purana expounded this doctrine of &lsquo;paradevata&rsquo;. Sri Yamuna expounds in Stotra Ratna, the Supreme Paradevata.</p>
<p>All other Acharyas have taught this Supreme Reality very clearly in their noble works and a person who studies all these texts realises that the Supreme Lord ever associated with Goddess Lakshmi, is the Supreme Deity or &lsquo;paradevatal in whom one has to take refuge.</p>

<p>Mumukshuthvadhikara</p>
<p>CHAPTER - VI</p>
<p>Mumukshuthvadhikara</p>
<p>It is rightly declared that three things are very rare to be obtained. Of these three, to be bom as a human being is very rare. When one is endowed with the body, indriyas, mind and knowledge, a person will do well to obtain knowledge of the Reality and make an attempt to save himself from samsara. To be born in this world again and again, is never the goal of life. A wiseman should realise that the world nearest at hand is beset with dangers and defects and that it is not his goal to live here enmeshed in matter.</p>
<p>When one examines the real characteristics of this universe, he will understand that he is drowning in the ocean of samsara, being caught by the whirlpool of sorrows and sufferings. Being caught in this, he is subjected to birth, oldage, death, disease and others again and again without any cessation. The primordial matter which is in the subtle form at the time of pralaya, undergoes change and at the time of creation, forms the bodies of the migrating souls and will be causing great disasters in the form of clouding the knowledge of the jivatman and causing perverse knowledge of the Reality. A wiseman sees the defects and limitations of the earthly gains that are little, impermanent associated with sorrow at all levels, as Gita points out.</p>
<p>A person when he realises that life in this world being associated with matter, is heading to sorrow in all aspects, he gets displeased with this world at all levels. When a discriminating man understands this and the inescapable relationship between himself and the Supreme Lord and when he realises that he is qualified fully for attaining the supreme abode of the Lord which is free from sorrows and is of the form of supreme bliss which is verily his true nature, he yearns to get free from the clutches of samsara.</p>
<p>Then, he gains &lsquo;mumukshutva&rsquo; which is the second rare state a Jivatman gains. It is very rare to gain mumukshutva. Though a person is endowed with right knowledge, though he is following right action, though he is a home of all virtues like kshama, dama and others, he may not have &lsquo;mumukshutva&rsquo; for which God&rsquo;s grace is necessary.</p>
<p>When a person is blessed with &lsquo;manushyatva&rsquo; and &lsquo;mumukshutva&rsquo; he must take refuge with a great, compassionate master, for guiding him to proceed on the way of spiritual realisation. This is Mahapurusha Samashraya</p>
<p>These three things lead one to gain spiritual perfection.</p>
<p>It is really to a fortunate person that these three happen. It will not happen on its own account. A person has to discriminate between right values and wrong ideals and gain true knowledge from the shastras through accredited masters and develop mumukshutva in an orderly manner. Who is a mumukshu ? How should an aspirant after moksha, behave in this world ? What should he necessarily know? What should he aspire for? These have been discussed in great detail in this section - Mumukshutvadhikara. As a pre-requisite for gaining the mumukshutva, Desika has described in the earlier section that (1) one should decide the utmost essence or the sarathama knowledge; (2) the fundamental relationship of the jivatma with paramatman, as shesha and sheshi; (3) one should have a perfect knowledge of the five truthsMumukshuthvadhikara</p>
<p>(arthapanchaka); (4) the essential nature of the three realities viz. the jivatman, matter and Ishvara as well as their mutual relationship and the truth of the nature of the Supreme Deity, who is to be worshipped and sought as a refuge. With these preliminary understandings, an aspirant will be able to know the nature of matter and its wonderful way of binding the souls down to samsara, the nature of the jivatman - who is a jnanananda swarupa and who is subservient to the one Supreme Lord and his true destiny of attaining the eternal service of the Supreme Divinity. It is necessary that he should have a decisive knowledge of the nature of the Supreme Deity whom he has to worship and gain, through supreme devotion and self-surrender. This will enable him to concentrate on the means of attainment of that Supreme Deity. Such an aspirant would be wholly displeased with the nearest world at hand and he would not bear to be imprisoned any more in the mortal body. He would yearn to free himself from the bondage of matter</p>
<p>Desika outlines in this chapter - Mumukshutvadhikara - very clearly how one should develop dispassion towards the world and how one should have an earnest desire to attain the Supreme Paramatman. In the introductory verse, Desika exhorts humanity to develop a keen desire to free oneself from the clutches of matter.</p>
<p>कालावर्तान् प्रकृतिविकृतीः कामभोगेषु दोषान् ज्वालागर्तप्रतिम दुरितोदकं दुःखानुभूतिम् । याथातथ्यं स्वपरनियतं यच्च दिव्यं पदंतत् काराकल्पं वपुरपिविदन् कस्तितिक्षेतबन्धम् । When one realises the following firmly that t</p>
<p>ILY.</p>
<p>I Everything in this world is subjected to the limitation of</p>
<p>time. Destruction is the destiny of all things in this world. They are all swept away by the huge flood of time causing birth, death, oldage etc. again and again. Even people</p>
<p>who live very long are destined to die one day. II The subtle matter undergoes change incessantly and</p>
<p>evolves in the form of indriyas, objects and other things</p>
<p>resulting in the shielding of Reality. III The pleasure of this world as well as the other world are</p>
<p>full of defects. They are little, impermanent, they are obtained through dukha or pain, they are mixed with sorrow, they lead to sorrow, are the causes of perverse knowledge and they are opposed to the experience of the</p>
<p>nature of the bliss of the atman. IV They are leading to the experience of the great suffering</p>
<p>of sorrow in &lsquo;naraka&rsquo; which is similar to the terrible cauldron of blazing fire, though they appear pleasant at</p>
<p>the present time. V The true nature of his own self and Paramatman and the</p>
<p>inescapable relationship of shesha-sheshi bhava. VI That immaterial abode, the abode of the Supreme</p>
<p>Paramatman which he is going to attain and which is bereft of any defect and which is agreeable to the</p>
<p>experience of the Divine. VII The body which he is now having is just like a prison</p>
<p>obstructing him from the true experience of himself and the Paramatman by limiting his consciousness.</p>
<p>Such an aspirant who has gained this kind of knowledge would never bear cven for a moment to be bound like that by the body</p>
<p>Mumukshuthvadhikara</p>
<p>The scriptures that teach the real nature of the Individual Self, matter and Paramatman, exhort man to act without delay in such a way that he will not be born again,</p>
<p>आब्रह्मभुवनादेते दोषास्सन्ति महामुने । अत एव हि नेच्छन्ति स्वर्गप्राप्ति मनीषिणः ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beginning from the world of Brahma, all these worlds are full of defects. It is on account of this reason that the wisc do not desire to gain heaven or svarga.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desika has described in detail the characteristics of persons who are competent to become aspirants after liberation, as follows : - 1. One should know from the spiritual texts that the</p>
<p>essential nature of the atman is self-luminosity and consciousness. The atman is endowed with knowership, doership, enjoyership and the nature of being associated with a body. His atman is &lsquo;anu&rsquo; or atomic in nature, eternal, without any parts, and he is bereft of any kind of expansion or diminution, not possible of being cut or burnt or dried up, whereas the body is different and distinct from his self. He should have a general understanding that he is liable to be born with different bodies. Being endowed with this knowledge, he will be fit to gain the ultimate object of life.</p>
<p>He must be fully aware of the fact that he is different and distinct from Isvara on account of the fact of his utter dependence upon the Lord. One who realises that he is supported, ruled over by the Lord and used for the purposes of Lord himself, will realise that one should yearn for the attainment of the glory of divine service.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The aspirant should be well aware of his alpa-shaktitva</li>
</ol>
<p>and ajnana and having an inauspicious body. 3. He must get rid of the five kinds of &lsquo;ahankara&rsquo; as shown</p>
<p>below after reflecting upon the true nature reflected in the third letter of the first word of the Mulamantra. :</p>
<p>ज्ञानत्वानुसन्धान in मकार ।</p>
<p>a. The ahankara that ensues on account of his relation with</p>
<p>the body and those that are related to his body such as children and others.</p>
<p>The illusion that he has mastery over his own self and the quality of that self. He should get rid of the illusion that he is shesha or</p>
<p>subservient to others. d. He should also get rid of the illusion that he is the cause</p>
<p>of his protection independent of others i.e. having &lsquo;nirapeksha-swantra&rsquo; in his own &lsquo;rakshana-vyapara&rsquo;. He must free himself from the illusion of the form of his independent doership and independent enjoyership i.e. Swadhina Kartrutva and Swadhina Bhoktrutva. Likewise, he must get rid of the illusion of the nature of Swartha Kartrutva and Swartha Bhoktrutva, i.e. doership and enjoyership for one&rsquo;s own benefit. Such a person will realise that the experience of the objects of this world as well of the other world consisting of non-sentient things are little (alpa), impermanent (asthira), obtained through pain and suffering (duhka mularva), it is mixed with sorrow (duhka-mishra), resulting in sorrow (duhka-udarka), the cause of perverse</p>
<p>UO Tson</p>
<p>Mumukshathvadhikara</p>
<p>h</p>
<p>beliefs (viparita-abhimana-mula) and opposed to the experience of the natural bliss (swabhavika-ananda virudha). Similarly, he has to realise that the experience of the pure atman (unconnected with matter) is also having its own defects as it is deprived of the infinite bliss of divine communion.</p>
<p>When a person reflects upon these factors, mentioned above, he will come to a definite decision that he should turn away from all activitics that lead to re-birth in this universe, and he renounces interest in all these things and will be engaging himself in Nivritti-Dharma. Such a person is an adhikarin or aspirant of moksha.</p>
<p>This has been expounded by savants differently for exhorting man to have a breach with the nearest world at hand and to have a positive and genuine turn towards gaining liberation. The Alwar says like this - &ldquo;they are of very little essence; having experienced them, I have given up all of them&rdquo; (t.m. 3-2-6) &ldquo;having experienced the objects of the five senses, I have realised that the pleasure from the objects is very little.&rdquo; (t.m. 4-6-10)</p>
<p>The Gita says – &lsquo;the fruit of all those ignorant people becomes little and they end at a particular time&rsquo; (Gita 7-23). &lsquo;Having come upon this world which is full of sorrow and impermanence, worship me alone to get rid of it&rsquo;. (Gita 9. 33). &lsquo;Having heard that the most mighty, the most valiant and the most wealthy have all been swept away by the floods of time, and nothing of them, other than their names, being left behind, a wise person will not become attached to a wife or a house or a land or money&rsquo;. &ldquo;Even in heaven, one will not have happiness, as he is ever afraid of a fall due to exhaustion of that punya.&rdquo; &ldquo;These defects are found in respect of all these worlds beginning with the world of Brahma. That is why wise people do not desire the attainment of swarga.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Supreme Abode of Vishnu, is above the abode of the four faced-Brahma. It is pure, eternal and luminous and known as &lsquo;Brahman&rsquo; itself.&rdquo; &ldquo;The unwise that are devoted to the objects of the world, never reach that place.&rdquo; &ldquo;All these abodes are verily hells, when compared with the Supreme Abode of Paramatman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These authorities make it clear that all things other than the attainment and experience of Paramatman are subjected to defects. So, a discriminating person should turn away from all activities leading to worldly attainments and seek whole heartedly that means by which he attains immortality.</p>
<p>Such a person who has developed an aspiration for gaining liberation from samsara, should adopt the appropriate means for gaining moksha. Knowledge should be translated into appropriate action. This kind of anushthana or practice, will be in accordance with one&rsquo;s refinement of mind that is gained by the teaching of all great preceptors. Sadupadesha is absolutely essential for leading one to the performance of the appropriate spiritual discipline for attainment of the highest object of life. One should engage himself in the Parama Purusha-Anushthana, without any delay according to his ability and the instruction of the teachers. Desika quotes here a verse which is very meaningful. -</p>
<p>वयसः कर्मणोऽर्थस्य श्रुतस्याभिजनस्य च । वेषवाग्वृत्तिसारूप्यं आचरन् विचरेदिह ।।</p>
<p>Mumukshuthvadhikara</p>
<p>&ldquo;A person should behave in this world having unison with his attire, speech and action according to his age, profession, wealth, knowledge and birth&rdquo;. This implies that a person who has gained rare knowledge from the preceptors should act accordingly.</p>
<p>In the ultimate analysis, it may be said that it is only through Lord&rsquo;s grace that one will be born as a human being, will get a suitable teacher through whom he gains spiritual wisdom and becomes a mumukshu and adopts the necessary means for attainment of liberation,</p>
<h2 id="०८-अधकर-वभगधकर">०८ अधिकारि-विभागाधिकारः</h2>
<p>Adhikari Vibhagadhikara</p>
<p>CHAPTER - VIII</p>
<p>Adhikari Vibhagadhikara</p>
<p>After describing the essential requirements for becoming a genuine sceker of moksha or liberation, Desika has described in this section, that there are two kinds of aspirants after moksha. Adhikarin means one who is competent and fit for undertaking spiritual discipline for gaining moksha. These aspirants are of two kinds. Both these kinds of aspirants are engaged in Nivritti Dharma and they are (1) those who adopt self surrender directly for attainment of moksha and (2) those that surrender unto the Lord for gaining liberation through Bhakti Yoga or Upasana. One is adopting prapatti or self-surrender as a direct means and the other one will be performing surrender as an accessory to upasana or Bhakti Yoga. Both these are &lsquo;prapannas&rsquo; as well as &lsquo;Bhaktas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The idea is that prapatti which is an independent means to moksha is necessarily having the aspect of Bhakti or Supreme Love for God. Without Bhakti, there cannot be praparti. Similarly, Bhakti Yoga which is of the form of continuous remembrance of the form, qualities and glory of the Lord, with love, becomes possible only through prapatti. Bhakti Yoga is called &lsquo;Sadhana&rsquo; Bhakti and Prapatti is called &lsquo;Phala&rsquo; &lsquo;Bhakti&rsquo; or &ldquo;Sadhya&rdquo; Bhakti. So, it is to be known that one is not exclusive of the other. Both these types of aspirants are called as &lsquo;Bhaktas&rsquo; or Prapannis&rsquo;.</p>
<p>स्वतन्त्रांगप्रपत्तिभ्यां प्रपन्नावत्र तावुभौ । फलसाधन भक्तिभ्यां भक्तावपि च दर्शितौ । In this treatise, Desika is expounding the essentials of prapatti or self-surrender as a direct means at the feet of the Lord for attainment of moksha and therefore, works out the particulars to be noted as related to &lsquo;Prapatti&rsquo; mainly.</p>
<p>Prapatti is of three forms i.e. Ukthinishta or devoted to the essential form of uttering the words of surrender; Acharya-nishta or taking refuge with the preceptor and entrusting the responsibility of surrendering unto the Lord to be actuated through the Acharya or preceptor; the third form is &lsquo;Swanishta&rsquo; or being steadfast in surrendering unto the Lord by himself as one will be equipped with the necessary knowledge and the procedure of surrender. Now, we will briefly note the important characteristics of each one of these forms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ukthinishta&rsquo; - An aspirant who has clear conviction that there is no saviour for him other than the Supreme Lord and who has realised his utter helplessness, but is not having a clear notion of the accessories of prapatti such as aanukulya sankalpa and others, seeks the mediation of an Acharya, and utters the words of surrender unto the Lord, as the Lord clearly knows his prayes, as taught by his preceptor.</p>
<p>Here, there is an effort on the part of the aspirant in repeating the words of surrender with full faith in the saving grace of the Lord, as taught by the compassionate preceptor. It is similar to the fact of some subordinate young prince surrendering unto an emperor with the words taught by his nurses. Though they may not understand the meanings of these words, the Lord understands their desire and grants them whatever is prayed for. Desika gives the example of brahmacharins getting a from virtuous people by uttering &lsquo;भवति भिक्षां देहि&rsquo; even if they did not know the meaning of</p>
<p>SUO</p>
<p>Adhikari Vibhagadhikara</p>
<p>that sentence. As pointed out by Ramanuja in &lsquo;Sharanagati Gadya&rsquo;, &lsquo;येन केनापि प्रकारेण द्वयवक्ता त्वम्।&rsquo; The Lord will compassionately become pleased with such statements of surrender and grants them whatever is desired. This is certainly yielding the result, as there is genuine appeal to the Lord for mercy and for grant of liberation. When one surrenders in whatever manner it may be, the Lord is sure to protect him.</p>
<p>Acharya-Nishta - A person who has definite understanding that he cannot save himself and that his protection is possible only through the grace of the Lord, but has not the understanding of the way of surrendering unto the Lord, takes refuge with full faith in his preceptor and begs of him to entrust the Lord with the burden of protecting him and granting him moksha. In other words, he gives the power of attorney to his Acharya, and will have full faith in his Acharya. The Acharya on the other hand, entrusts the Lord with the burden of protection of that soul on behalf of that soul. Here, the Acharya secures liberation for that soul from the Lord and that person has only to entrust the responsibility of getting his liberation, with Acharya with full faith.</p>
<p>Any one of these ways of surrender is sure to secure the emancipation of the atman. When one takes refuge with the Acharya, his protection is included in the surrender of the Acharya unto the Lord inclusive of those that belong to him A famous statement is quoted by Desika here fargfala au नेति संशयोऽच्युत सेविनाम् । न संशयोत्र तंद्रक्त परिचर्यारतात्मनाम् ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a doubt whether a person who is worshipping the Lord, gains fulfilment or not; but, there is no doubt about a person who is devoted to the loving service or a devotee of that Lord.&rdquo; It may be asked how it could be believed that one would attain spiritual perfection by seeking an Acharya alone, without one&rsquo;s own effort for moksha? For this question, the statement of Mudaliyandan, gives a suitable answer. When one has an association with an Acharya, he is sure to be saved along with that Acharya, just as a lion that leaps from one mount to another one, carries along with it the worms or other beings taking refuge in its body in the same way, when Sri Bhashyakarar crosses over samsara, we will also cross over samsara, if we are closely devoted to Bhashyakarar. This is an example to impress on the point that the relationship with the Acharya is of utmost importance and the prime cause of gaining salvation. Desika has given an example in Nyasa-Tilaka&rsquo; where he extols the role of an Acharya, and significance of an &lsquo;Acharya Nishta&rsquo;.</p>
<p>अन्धोऽनन्धग्रहण वशगो याति रंगेश यद्वत् पङ्गुनौकाकुहरनिहितो नीयते नाविकेन भुक्ते भोगानविदितनृपः सेवकस्यार्भकादिः त्वत्संप्राप्तौ प्रभवति तथा देशिको मे दयालुः ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a blind person, who is under the care of a non blind person, moves safely; similarly when a lame person is taken from place to place, being carried in a boat by a boatman; even as the children of a servant serving a king enjoy the good things even though they are not acquainted with the king, in the same way, the compassionate Acharya will become capable of causing the attainment of thyself</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Ranganatha.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This statement of Desika, makes clear the efficacy of</p>
<p>Adhikari Vibhagadhikara</p>
<p>Acharya-Nishta. Here, the desire to attain the Lord is strong; but, the Acharya alone is capable of making the desire fulfilled. The first simile is an illustration to point out that he is not having necessary knowledge. The second illustration is an example to point out that he has no ability or shakti and the third example is to point out that there is absence of knowledge and ability.</p>
<p>The first example illustrates the &lsquo;Ukti-nishta&rsquo;; the second example is illustrating &lsquo;Acharya-nishta&rsquo;, who are saved by the preceptor on his own request and the third one is pointing out those people who are the objects of compassion to the preceptor even when an aspirant has not made a formal prayer</p>
<p>It is an established fact that the Lord does not grant moksha to one, unless one surrenders unto the Lord in some way or other, whether the act of surrendering is performed by oneself or it is performed by some other person on behalf of one. Unless one surrenders unto the Lord, seeking protection with a prayer, one will not be saved. Suppose a person has respect and reverance towards a bhagavatha or even when one lives in a holy place, it may be asked whether the Lord would not save him. &ldquo;Is it not said that taking refuge with a bhagavatha would lead to moksha ?&rdquo;. There is a statement as follows :</p>
<p>पशुः मनुष्यः पक्षी वा ये च वैष्णवसंश्रयाः । तेनैव ते प्रयास्यन्ति तद्विष्णोः परमं पदम् ।।</p>
<p>One who seeks the grace of a vaishnava, whether he is a man or a bird or an animal, he will attain the abode of Vishnu by that vaishnaya-samashraya alone.</p>
<p>2 ma</p>
<p>Va-samas &ldquo;The people who live in the domain of king, are to be protected by the king, whether they live in the city or in the forest.&rdquo; The sages of Dandaka forest said so to Sri Rama. Nammalwar says that Sri Rama took along with him all the moving and non-moving entities to santanika loka. From</p>
<p>these, does it not become clear that &lsquo;bhagavatabhimana&rsquo; and &lsquo;bhagavadvishayavasa&rsquo; would lead to the attainment of the Supreme Paramatman Desika points out that these' viz. &lsquo;Bhagavatabhimana&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bhagavadvishayavasa&rsquo; will be helpful to one in causing an urgency in attaining Brahman. It is to be noted that this kind of &lsquo;Bhagavatabhimana&rsquo; and others will influence one, either to surrender directly unto the Lord or through the preceptor, either earlier or later. This kind of relationship with prapatti or bhakti will be caused by such causes viz. भागवताभिमान and भगवद्विषय</p>
<p>The decided opinion of the masters is that moksha is possible only by prapatti. Prapatti as already pointed out, is Sadvaraka or Advaraka.</p>
<p>If one adopts the means of upasana, that meditation becomes more and more intense in course of time. For one who has surrendered for moksha itself, it will cause an utgency in attainment of godhead by promoting loving service to the Lord so long as he is stationed here. This is how &lsquo;Bhagavathabhimana&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bhagavadvishayavasa&rsquo; will be helpful for the sadhaka.</p>
<p>The means of Bhaktiyoga or Upasana and the means of surrender, are differently contributing to the attainment of the Supreme Goal. The Upasaka is capable of practising Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga, and so is not an &ldquo;akinchana&rdquo; or utterly helpless person. He performs surrender for the completion of his upasana. Such an</p>
<p>SUT</p>
<p>Adhikari Vibhagadhikara</p>
<p>aspirant will attain the moksha, the fruit of upasana, at the end of the exhaustion of the prarabdha karma, duly having &lsquo;Antima Pratyaya&rsquo; or final vivid perception of the Lord. He has to wait for the exhaustion by experience of the prarabdha karma and he would bear that delay. This kind of upasana is possible for only the higher three casces and he has to practise it continuously till the fruit is gained.</p>
<p>A person who practises surrender directly for moksha, has to perform surrender only once. All beings are qualified for this kind of self-surrender. This surrender is capable of averting all sins. It is the means of attaining all objects of desire. It is easy to perform, because it does not involve the performance of elaborate accessories of upasana such as Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Astangayoga and others. The final vision or &lsquo;Antima Pratyaya&rsquo; will be granted by the Lord himself at the right moment of his own accord. This prapatti is sure to result without delay and there are no obstructions for it. It is just like the Brahmastra and does not require any other sub-means. A person who adopts this means directly or through an Acharya, will be having that satisfaction of experiencing the Lord from the very moment of surrender. Such a &lsquo;prapanna&rsquo; would attain liberation at the fall of his body in that life. He will be enjoying the bliss of communion with the Lord in this world itself in the form of Archavatara.</p>
<p>Prapatti is a means for attainment of all kinds of fruits worldly and other worldly, just as Bhaktiyoga. The sages of yore have declared that an aspirant can gain any object of his desire through prapatti. It is declared in the verse given below:</p>
<p>तावदार्तिः तथा वाञ्छा तावन्मोहः तथा सुखन् । यावन्नयति शरणं त्वामश्वेषाघनाशनम् ॥</p>

<p>In this verse, it is stated that an &lsquo;Artha&rsquo;, &lsquo;Artharthi&rsquo;, &lsquo;Kaivalyarthi&rsquo; and &lsquo;Moksharthi&rsquo; will not be able to gain their object of desirc, until they surrender unto the Lord. &lsquo;Hift:&rsquo; signifies an &lsquo;Artha&rsquo; who is sorrowing for having not gained the lost wealth. &lsquo;Vancha&rsquo; signifies the desire to gain new wealth. &lsquo;Moha&rsquo; implies the illusion of the body being considered as atman, when that is destroyed, he will realise his pure self. &lsquo;Brya&rsquo; significs the misery of the form of not experiencing the Lord. That kind of misery will end when surrendering unto the Lord.</p>
<p>It is declared in the shastras that a &lsquo;Prapanna&rsquo; is more celebrated than a &lsquo;Karmayogin&rsquo; or a &lsquo;Jnanayogin&rsquo; or a &lsquo;Bhaktiyogin&rsquo; by virtue of the fact that he has entrusted the burden of his protection unto the Lord Himself with supreme faith and remains fearless and careless.</p>
<p>सत्कर्मनिरताः शुद्धाः सांख्ययोगविदस्तथा । नार्हन्ति शरणस्थस्य कलां कोटितमीमपि ।</p>
<p>Those who are engaged in Karmayoga or Jnanayoga or Bhaktiyoga, are not worthy of a croreth part of the celebrity of a prapanna. &lsquo;Satkarmaniratah&rsquo; signifies Karmayogin; &lsquo;Sankhya&rsquo; signifies Jnanayogin and &lsquo;Yogavidah&rsquo; points out Bhaktiyogin. The &lsquo;Sharanasta&rsquo; is the Prapanna. The greatness of the &ldquo;Prapanna&rdquo; is pointed out here and not a censure of the other yogins. The analogy of &lsquo;Nahininda Nyaya&rsquo; is to be understood here. The other three yogins are not decried, but prapatti is glorified and this kind of discrimination is caused by the punya that is done by such aspirants.</p>
<p>So long as they are embodied in this world, there may be difference in the &lsquo;kainkarya&rsquo; they offer to the Lord. For</p>
<p>Adhikari Vibhagadhikara</p>
<p>this, the difference in their desire, is the cause. This difference in desire is due to their prarabdha sukrutha. But, there is no difference in the experience of bliss when one reaches the Supreme Abode at the end or the fall of the final body. All the released have the same amount of blissful experience. Another significant factor is that, all these prapannas or bhaktas are subordinated to the Lord in the same way. The substance of this chapter is summarised in onc Sanskrit verse at the end of the chapter :</p>
<p>प्रपन्नादन्येषां न दिशति मुकुन्दो निजपदं प्रपन्नश्च द्वेधा सुचरित परीपाकभिदया । विलम्बेन प्राप्तिः भजनसुखमेकस्य विपुलं । परस्याशु प्राप्तिः परिमितरसा जीवितदशा ॥</p>
<p>The Lord does not accord His abode to those who are other than prapannas. The prapannas are on account of the difference in their &lsquo;Sucharita&rsquo; or Punya) - two-fold viz. one who is utterly helpless &lsquo;Akinchana&rsquo; and the other who can perform the means of &lsquo;Sadhana&rsquo; ie. &lsquo;Sakinchana&rsquo;. For one who is a Bhaktiyogi or a &lsquo;Sadvaraka-Prapanna&rsquo;, there is delay in attainment of the godhead but there is plenty of the bliss of loving service to the Lord here. For the other i.e. &lsquo;Advaraka-Prapanna&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Sadhya-Bhakta&rsquo;, the attainment of the God will be without delay, but here the bliss of divine experience will be limited, as it is limited to that body. Thus, both of them attain the Lord at different periods according to their sadhana.</p>

<p>Upayavibhagadhikara</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>CHAPTER - IX</p>
<p>Upayavibhagadhikara</p>
<p>SUI</p>
<p>After describing the different kinds of aspirants after liberation, that undertake the means of attainment of the Lord in general, in this chapter, the two significant means of attainment of paramatman are expounded. The two means are &lsquo;Bhakti&rsquo; and &lsquo;Prapatti&rsquo;. &ldquo;I can be attained through supreme devotion to me or surrender unto me; I cannot be attained by any other means&rdquo; says the Lord. In this section, the main features of these two moksha-upayas are outlined. It is also pointed out here that Karmayoga and Jnanayoga are not independent means of attainment of godhead. They are accessories to Bhaktiyoga. That Bhakriyoga can be possible of commencement and completion only through self surrender unto the Lord. Even for becoming an upasaka or a prapanna, the grace of the Lord is absolutely necessary. In the ultimate analysis, the Supreme Lord Himself is the means to His attainment. All these points are spelt in the introductory verse of this section.</p>
<p>उपायः स्वप्राप्तेः उपनिषदधीतस्स भगवान् प्रसत्त्यै तस्योक्ते प्रपदन निदिध्यासन सूती । तदारोहः पुंसस्सुकृत परिपाकेन महता निदानं तत्रापि स्वयमखिलनिर्माण निपुणः ॥</p>
<p>The meaning of this verse is given below:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Supreme Lord is declared by the Upanishads as the sole means of his attainment. Self-surrender and intense use</p>
<p>meditation are meant for awakening his mercy and gaining his grace. An aspirant is blessed to adopt either of these two means on account of immense merit or punya. Even when there is such great merit on the part of the aspirant, it is only on account of the Supreme Lord, who is the root-cause of adopting such a means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Upanishads expound that He is the granter of immortality.</p>
<p>ka HD:' &lsquo;7: 347447&rsquo;, de qua da guzti' These statements establish that the Lord alone is the ultimate means for His attainment. It may be asked then, where is the need for Bhakti or Prapatti? If it is admitted that these also are means of attainment, then the vedic declaration that He alone is the means of attainment becomes contradictory. So, it is declared here that these means are necessary for getting rid of His displeasure, which is an obstacle to his attainment. The Lord is displeased and has willed to punish those who have transgressed the divine command from beginningless time. For gaining his mercy, and for averting His anger, this kind of intense devotion with love or surrender with supreme faith is helpful. From this the fact of the Lord alone being the &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; is established</p>
<p>&lsquo;सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि&rsquo;, &lsquo;मच्चित्तः सर्वदुर्गाणि मत्प्रसादात् तरिष्यसि&rsquo;, &lsquo;क्षीयन्ते चास्य कर्माणि तस्मिन् दृष्टे परावरे&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>These scriprural statements affirm that Bhakti and Prapatti are meant for &lsquo;Nigraha-rupa Kalushya Nivriti&rsquo; and in the absence of these, the Lord will not shower his grace. It is also pointed out here, that one gains this kind of</p>
<p>Upayavibhagadhikara</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>knowledge on account of the grace of that Supreme Paramatman himself, who becomes pleased with some good act donc knowingly or unknowingly by a person. It is on account of the grace of the Lord that one will be blessed with an Acharya at the proper time, who enlightens him and leads to the adoption of some means of liberation. So, the fact of the Lord alone being the means of His attainment, is established.</p>
<p>In this section, the two main means of attainment of God, viz. Bhakti and Prapatti are described. The difference between &lsquo;Upaya&rsquo; and &lsquo;Upeya&rsquo; is first mentioned. The &lsquo;Upaya&rsquo; is defined as a kind of Jnana Vikasa Vishesha, that means extension of a particular kind of knowledge. The &lsquo;Upeya&rsquo; or the object of attainment, is also defined as a kind of extension of knowledge. The particular extension of knowledge which happens to be &lsquo;Upaya&rsquo; or means is - 1. Karana Sapeksha or dependent upon the functions of</p>
<p>the indriyas; 2. Shastra vihita or ordained by the scriptures and related</p>
<p>to the Supreme Brahman as its object, as necessarily qualified by the five (Swarupa Nirupaka Dharma) characteristics such as Satyatva, Jnanatva, Anantatva, Amalatva and Anandatva, and as qualified by the qualities that are to be particularly meditated upon in the several types of upasanas, and as qualified by an auspicious divine form. This is related necessarily to Brahman</p>
<p>The particular cxtension of knowledge as related to the &ldquo;Upeya' or the object of attainment is (1) Karana-Nirapekshah - not depending upon the functioning of the indriyas; (2) Swabhavaprapta or attaining according to its nature and (3) paripurna Brahman - being the object characterised by all auspicious qualities and vibhutis.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Upaya&rsquo; Jnana Vikasa and &lsquo;Upeya&rsquo; Jnana Vikasa are both having Brahman as their object. The meditation upon the qualities that are prescribed in cach type of meditation, qualify the &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; jnana. One has to meditate upon Brahman as prescribed in the respective mode of upasana. This is &lsquo;Karana-Sapeksha&rsquo; or requiring the function of indriyas and it should be as prescribed in the shastra. This kind of extension of knowledge is the upaya jnana.</p>
<p>The upcya jnana is also related to Supreme Brahman and for this kind of extension of knowledge, there is no need of the body as it is related to the liberated one, the mukta. Though the mukta has an &lsquo;Aprakrita&rsquo; sharira, there is no need for the body for extension of knowledge. It is &lsquo;swabhava prapta&rsquo; as obstruction will have been cleared, and it is naturally attained. It is related to &lsquo;Paripurna Brahman&rsquo; as qualified by all auspicious qualities, and vibhutis. When a person meditates on Brahman, he meditates upon certain qualities that are required to be meditated upon, in that type of meditation. He is not meditating upon all auspicious qualities; but, when he attains Brahman, he does not experience Brahman as conditioned by only those qualities on which he meditated. Instead, he experiences Brahman with all his perfections.</p>
<p>Vedantha Desika has expounded here that the upaya or the means of attainment of Brahman is a particular kind of extension of knowledge. Upaya or means of attainment, is also a kind of knowledge which assumes the form of vivid perception of the object of attainment &lsquo;Darshana Samanakaratapanna-jnanam&rsquo; is the upaya. Here the objectofUpayavibhagadhikara</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>meditation is Brahman alone. That is the knowledge related to Brahman, as prescribed in the several ways of upasana. For example, in &lsquo;Dahara-vidya&rsquo;, the upasaka meditates upon dahara or Brahman along with the cight auspicious qualities that are prescribed in that mode of upasana. In addition to this, he has to meditate upon the five swarupa-nirupaka dharmas or the characteristics that determine the essential nature of Brahman, such as satyatva, jnanatva, anantatva, anandatva and amalatva. This kind of particular extension of knowledge as related to Brahman the object of meditation, is the upaya. This depends upon the function of the indriyas of the upasaka, and as it is ordained in the shastras thus. Even here, one has to meditate upon Brahman, as characterised by a divine auspicious form. Thus, the upaya, is a kind of extension of knowledge.</p>
<p>The Upeya Jnana is also having the Supreme Brahman itself as its object, that relates to the Paripurna Brahma Vishaya. This extension of knowledge is not karana sapeksha. It does not depend upon the activity of the indriyas of the upasaka. It is self-established. It is related to Brahman as qualified by all perfections. This is the &lsquo;Bhogya&rsquo; or the object of experience that is gained by the aspirant through his meditation. So, this is the &lsquo;Phala&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Prapati&rsquo; of attainment. This is upcya on account of it being the object of attainment. The upayajnanam is the Paramatman himsclf as He is the &lsquo;Phalaprada&rsquo; or the granter of the result. The difference between these two aspects of knowledge related to Brahman is this - (1) one is phalaprada i.e. related to Brahman who is the bestower of the result of upasana and (2) the other one is bhogya or the object of experience.</p>
<p>A doubt may arise here. According to the Tatkratu ece</p>
<p>Nyaya, which ordains that one attains the results as he meditates here, should an aspirant not attain only Brahman as qualified by the particular qualities, which alone the sadhaka mcditates upon in his upasana here. To illustrate should not a Dahara-Upasaka attain Brahman as qualified by cight qualities alone? How can it be said that he attains Paripurna Brahman. This doubt is cleared as follows :</p>
<p>The Tatkratu-Nyaya here points out that he will necessarily attain Brahman as qualified by those qualities which he meditated upon in his Upasana; but, it does not exclude other auspicious qualities with which Brahman is necessarily qualified. So, it is concluded here that though an aspirant meditates upon Brahman as qualified by the prescribed qualities in the respective upasanas, he will attain Brahman as qualified by all auspicious qualities.</p>
<p>उपासितगुणादेर्या प्राप्नावप्यबहिष्क्रिया । सा तत्क्रतु नयग्ग्रह्या नाकारान्तरवर्जनम् ।।</p>
<p>The blissful experience of Brahman in the state of liberation, overflows in the form of eternal divine service to the Lord, and so it is declared that Nitya Kainkarya or eternal divine service to the Lord, is the object of attainment.</p>
<p>As the Supreme Lord is the object of knowledge of the form of both the means and the goal, he is declared as the means and fruit - upaya and upeya. He is upaya, as he is Phalaprada. He is upeya, as he is Bhogya. The fact of Brahman being the upaya of an upasaka, is explained thus. But, how is hc thc upaya in the case of prapanna who is performing self-surrender directly for moksha &gt; In the case of such a prapanna, the Paramatman is placed as a substitute</p>
<p>Upayavibhagadhikara</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>to Bhaktiyoga, and he is prayed to get the fruit on behalf of the aspirant. Not only this, even for a Bhakti Yogin, even from the very beginning of his sadhana - commencing with karmayoga and others and upto the fulfilment of the completion of the sadhana, Paramacman, who is pleased with his surrender, will see that all those obstructions are cleared and causing the enhancement of satva, he will see that the means of upasana will become fruitful.</p>
<p>Desika explains further the essential nature of different spiritual disciplines such as Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and others. When a person realises his self through the discipline or Karmayoga and Jnanayoga, he becomes qualified for Bhaktiyoga. Karmayoga is the performance of a particular karma that is possible for him, without having the attachment of kartrutva and phala and sambandha along with the performance of the ordained duties i.e. Nitya, Naimitrika and Kamya, with the essential knowledge of the jivatman and paramatman gained from the shastras. HR सर्वाणि कर्माणि सन्यस्य अध्यात्मचेतसा । निराशीः निर्ममो भूत्वा ।। That particular chosen karma should be performed without any desire in the fruit thereof and as worship of the Lord regularly till it becomes fruitful. It is necessary that one should surrender unto the Lord for success in Karmayoga. As Karmayoga involves in itself the essential knowledge of the jivatman, it may directly lead to the experience of the jivatman, or it may lead to that realisation of the jivatman through Jnanayoga.</p>
<p>Jnanayoga is the incessant remembrance of the essential nature of the jivatman who is different and distinct from the matter and who is the body of Paramatman by virtue of his being supported, ruled over and used for His own purposes</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saran</p>
<p>invariably. This can be done only when one has gained victory over the mind through karmayoga. Even while performing Jnanayoga, one should pray and surrender unto the Lord 44: YR HEFT T 4697:'. When an aspirant realises the true nature of his atman through yoga gained through Karmayoga and Jnanayoga, he becomes qualified for Bhaktiyoga. If he is not tempted by the happiness or the joy of the experience of the more atman (Kevala Atmanubhava Sukham) which discards the thirst for the experience of the objects of the world, he will yearn for the attainment of paramatman. This self experience and realisation of the self is a necessary accessory to Bhaktiyoga, as a transparent case is helpful to see the gem inside. Likewise, the vivid vision of the jivatman, who happens to be the body of Paramatman, is very helpful to become a Bhaktiyogin. When the aspirant realises that his essential nature is subservient to the Lord and his ultimate object of attainment is the Supreme Paramatman, who is his innerself, he gains the necessary qualification for becoming a Bhaktiyogin.</p>
<p>Thus Inanayoga is as taught in the Gita - reflection upon the pure nature of the Jivatman. It is not the meditation upon the oneness of the atman or meditation upon Paramatman. As it is clearly mentioned that one becomes qualified for Bhaktiyoga only when he realises that he is seshabhuta or utterly subservient to the Supreme Lord, it is established that Jnanayoga mentioned here is related to the meditation upon the Jivatman.</p>
<p>Bhaktiyoga is the continuous loving remembrance of the essential nature, divine form, auspicious qualities and glories of Paramatman, who is the one independent reality,</p>
<p>Upayavibhagadhikara</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>not subordinated to anyone whatsoever. The Lord is established in himself and he is not subordinate or subservient to any other person. Every other entity, sentient or non-sentient, is supported, ruled over and used for his own purposes by Paramatman.</p>
<p>भक्तियोगः परैकान्तप्रीत्या ध्यानादिषु स्थितिः ।</p>
<p>This kind of reflection or remembrance is a continuous process just like a stream of oil poured from one vessel to another. This will be of the form of vivid perception of the Lord. This kind of remembrance should be similar to the vivid perception of the Lord. This, due to its intensity, will result in direct vivid perception of the Lord. How long should one practise this? This should be practised day in and day out, until the day, he passes from the body through &lsquo;archiradi&rsquo; to attain Paramapada. This meditation is a Janana Santari-Vishesha or a series of a particular kind of knowledge of Paramatman which culminates in the final remembrance of the Lord.</p>
<p>This Bhaktiyoga is to be supported by various accessories such as the performance of the Varna-Ashrama Dharmas, the ordained duties of one&rsquo;s station in life, by which one will enhance his satva, subduing rajas and tamas. This Bhaktiyoga is a means for attainment of all the four objects of life, according to one&rsquo;s own desire. The Lord declares in the Gita that a Jnani who has single devotion towards the Lord and is ever united with the Lord is most celebrated. All others, aspiring for wealth or self-experience, are missing the ultimate object of life that is liberation from samsara. The attainment of others is only transient and little.</p>
<p>Bhaktiyoga which is prescribed as the means for</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>moksha is called by the name &lsquo;Para-Bhakti&rsquo;. &lsquo;Samanya-Bhakti&rsquo; or love towards the Lord, which is generated on account of association with the virtuous, will be the cause of &lsquo;Para Bhakti&rsquo;. For gaining this &lsquo;Para-Bhakti&rsquo;, one has to gain the knowledge of the reality through the shastras, practise Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and gain realisation of the true nature of the jivatman through yoga. This &lsquo;Para-Bhakti&rsquo; leads to a strong and intensive desire to realise the Lord. The aspirant then implores the Lord to show himself, as He is, one day. This is the stage of &lsquo;Para-Bhakti&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The next stage is called &ldquo;Para-Jnanam'. This is the &lsquo;Paripurna Sakshatkara&rsquo; or wholesome realisation of the Lord, that is granted by the Lord for a shortwhile, by his benign grace awakened by the intense desire of the aspirant.</p>
<p>The next and most important stage of Bhaktiyoga is &lsquo;Parama-Bhakti&rsquo;. This is infinite love for the Lord, which cannot rest without realising him always. When an aspirant has a flash of the realisation of the Supreme Paramatman, which is of infinite bliss, he cannot contain himself without gaining him eternally. He feels great affliction, just as a highly thirsty person feels, when he sees a lake. He would like to quench his thirst by attaining it. Similarly, an aspirant in the state of Parama-Bhakti, will have such a strong desire that he cannot bear himself without experiencing the Lord even for a moment. Nammalwar has expressed his anguish in the decad AUTE' He will cry and implore for immediate realisation of the Lord piteously, that the Lord cannot turn down his prayer. This Parama-Bhakti causes an urgency or &lsquo;tvaratishaya&rsquo; in the Lord that he grants his eternal union to the aspirant and enables him to gain liberation by fulfilling his intense desire.</p>
<p>Upayavibhagadhikara</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>This Bhaktiyoga can be practised by the three higher castes, and is not possible of being undertaken by others. This Bhaktiyoga is a direct means to the attainment of Paramatman. This yoga also, is possible only when a person surrenders unto the Lord and prays for his grace for commencement of Bhaktiyoga and also for completion of Bhaktiyoga. In the Gita, the Lord has ordained self-surrender as an &lsquo;Anga&rsquo; or accessory to the practice of Bhaktiyoga.</p>
<p>For those people, who are incapable of adopting the means of Bhaktiyoga, the shastras prescribe the means of prapatti or self-surrender. Four conditions are necessary for Bhaktiyoga - 1) One should have the ability (or shakthi) for practising</p>
<p>Bhaktiyoga ; One should have gained necessary knowledge from the</p>
<p>shastras regarding the various factors; 3) One should not have the disqualification for</p>
<p>Bhaktiyoga, such as birth in the lowest order, etc. 4) One should have the sarvic patience for obtaining the</p>
<p>final result after the exhaustion of all prarabdha karmas by experience.</p>
<p>In the absence of any one of these conditions, he will not be qualified for Bhaktiyoga. Even among the higher three orders of the society, if one has deficiency in knowledge or ability or in both, or if one cannot bear delay in obtaining liberation, he is not qualified for Bhaktiyoga, and such a person, should realise his inability for Bhaktiyoga and should choose the path of prapatti, which is the direct means of liberation. Praparti is a path for which all people, irrespective of caste, creed or colour, are qualified. Me</p>
<p>Prapatti is, like Bhaktiyoga, a means for attainment of all desires. It stands in the place of &lsquo;Para-Bhakti&rsquo; and a person who adopts this means, can also attain according to his desire, the successive stages of Para-Jnanam and others. The disqualification for Bhaktiyoga, happens to be the qualification for prapatti.</p>
<p>Prapatti and Bhakti are thus meant for two different kinds of aspirants; though these two paths are different, they lead to a common goal i.c., attainment of Paramatman. The idea is the fruit of these two paths is the same. As upasanas are of different kinds, as expounded in the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras, for Prapatti also, various mantras have been prescribed by the Agamas and Samhitas. The different mantras are particularly used by different Acharyas, as authorised by the different branches of Vedas, Bhagavath Shastras and Samhitas. As namaskara is of three types viz. Vachaka, Kayaka and Manasa i.e. through words, through body actions and through mind, even in prapatti, these differentiations are mentioned. When all the three are taken together, there will be a poorna-namaskara. Similarly, when all the three are united, there will be poorna-prapatti. Manasa-prapatti is of supreme importance here.</p>
<p>Concluding this chapter Desika says that wise people take delight in the final words of the Lord Krishna spoken to Arjuna as &lsquo;Hounfa yfir 414 moste | 36 call सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुचः&rsquo; - &lsquo;शरण्य सारथिगिरां अन्ते रमन्ते</p>
<p>ge:&rsquo;,</p>
<p>Thus praparti is expounded here as a sufficient and direct means to liberation as it is a necessary accessory for other means such as Karma, Jnana and Bhakti.</p>

<p>Prapatti Yogyadhikara</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>CHAPTER - X</p>
<p>Prapatti Yogyadhikara</p>
<p>In this chapter, the eligibility of an aspirant for performing prapatti is described. This section along with the succeeding two sections, forms one unit. In the twelfth section, the mode of performance of prapatti, along with the accessories, is outlined. The earlier chapters from I to ll are expounding the prerequisites that are to be known for self-surrender to be actuated. In this section, it is established that an aspirant who is incapable of practising Bhaktiyoga and who has no other means of salvation open to him, is qualified for prapatui. Even one, who is qualified for Bhaktiyoga, but incapable of bearing delay in attainment, is qualified for prapatti.</p>
<p>A spiritual aspirant should have &lsquo;Arthitva&rsquo; or keen sense of wanting along with three necessary requirements viz. (1) sound understanding of the essence of the shastras; (2) capacity to practise those teachings and (3) the qualifications of possessing the prescribed qualities and birth in the higher three varnas. All these combined with the strong feeling of aspiration or desire for being liberated, make one qualified for undertaking spiritual discipline. This is the general requirement for undertaking the spiritual discipline. This discipline is of two kinds viz. &lsquo;astangayoga&rsquo; or bhaktiyoga and &lsquo;Shadangayoga&rsquo; or Prapatti. For the Bhaktiyogin, he has to fulfil three conditions (1) a perfect understanding of the shastra that prescribes the means to be adopted; (2) capacity to practise that and (3) qualification of birth in the higher three varnas. These three make him entitled to Bhaktiyoga. Whereas, regarding Prapatti, one should have a gencral understanding of (1) the means prescribed in the shastra; (2) ability to perform self-surrender and (3) inability in following any other means.</p>
<p>The scriptures declare that the Lord is possible of being attained by prapatti. This path of spiritual discipline is applicable universally to all just as the cardinal virtues viz. satya and dharma are applicable to all people, irrespective of any difference in caste and others. As these virtues are &lsquo;sarvadhikara&rsquo; or related to all people, prapatti also is prescribed in respect of all people irrespective of any difference whatsoever. &lsquo;Haramu yec&rsquo;, gå RUTHE YE, and other such vedic statements as well as the statements of smrithis establish that Prapatti or self-surrender, is a spiritual means of obtaining liberation, which applies to all castes and</p>
<p>creeds.</p>
<p>A person who wants to adopt &lsquo;Nyasa Vidya&rsquo; for attaining the object of his desire, being incapable of following other means, or having no interest in following other means, should necessarily know the particulars for his competency. For that, two things are necessarily required: (1) Aspiration for obtaining the particular fruit or phala and (2) Capacity to practise the same. Ability is to be known in respect of three factors viz. a thorough knowledge of the shastra; ability to follow those rules and eligibility on account of qualities and birth.</p>
<p>When a person has got &lsquo;Arthitva&rsquo; or desire to gain liberation and when he adopts the means of prapatti for gaining liberation directly, he must have the knowledge of the inescapable relationship between himself and the Paramatman, as known from the shastra, even as BhaktiyogiPrapatti Yogyadhikara</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>knows. His utter helplessness or &lsquo;Akinchanarva&rsquo; is to be particularly realised. He must be aware of his inability to undertake any other means such as karmayoga, jnanayoga and bhaktiyoga. Another particular qualification of a prapanna is &lsquo;Ananya-gatitva&rsquo; i.e. he must be averse to objects of attainment other than the Supreme Paramatman. He should consider Paramatman alone as the sole protector and none other than Him. Such an aspirant will not sçek the help of anyone other than Paramatman, nor does he seck to gain any object other than Paramatman. This is described as &lsquo;Ananyopaya&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ananyaprayojana&rsquo;. It is said in the smrithi as follows :</p>
<p>ब्रह्माणं शितिकण्ठं च याश्चान्या देवताः स्मृताः । प्रतिबुद्धा न सेवन्ते यस्मात् परिमितं फलम् ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who aspire for moksha, do not worship the four-faced Brahma or Rudra or any other god, and take refuge with them from whom only little benefit is gained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a person has not an intense desire for getting liberated, but has interest in the continuation of the body and other things, and performs self-surrender for gaining liberation, the fact of his getting moksha will be delayed so long as his thirst for worldly things does not subside. Not bearing with delay in gaining the ultimate object of life i.e. liberation from samsara, is one of the important aspects of &lsquo;Ananyagatitva&rsquo;. Such an aspirant will have an unshakable determination that he is solely subservient to Paramatman alone. The ancient masters and the Alwars have given cxpression to this kind of &lsquo;Ananyagatitval very significantly Being discarded by his own father, the gods and the great sages, that Kakasura having gone through the three worlds, came down to Rama and surrendered himself at the feet of Sri Rama.</p>
<p>स पित्रा च परित्यक्तः सुरैश्च समहर्षिभिः । त्रीन् लोकान् संपरिक्रम्य तमेव शरणं गतः ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;364444TYTI 34144: 3147: 34fa:&rsquo; says the great sage Yamunacharya.</p>
<p>&lsquo;अनागतानन्तकालसमीक्षयापि अदृष्टसन्तारोपायः&rsquo;, तत्प्राप्तये तत्पादाम्बुजद्वयप्रपत्तेः अन्यत् न मे कल्पकोटिसहस्रेणापि साधनमस्तीति 4-:&rdquo; says Ramanuja in Vaikuntha Gadya. This much is the eligibility for one to surrender unto the Lord. This means is open to all without any distinction of caste, creed, colour or sex or any other thing.</p>
<p>Desika describes in the concluding verse of this chapter, that there will be fifteen kinds of aspirarits for performing prapatti by virtue of having one, two, three or four of the conditions such as - 1. inability to practise Bhaktiyoga 2. not having perfect knowledge of the scriptures 3. being disqualified by birth 4. not bearing any delay in attainment of godhead.</p>
<p>Those who are qualified for Bhaktiyoga may also adopt self-surrender, if they yearn to attain the highest without any delay. This is a means which is open to all types of aspirants. Such is the glory of this means.</p>

<p>CHAPTER - XI</p>
<p>Parikara Vibhagadhikara</p>
<p>In the previous section, the essential nature of an aspirant, competent to adopt this means of self-surrender, was described. It was also pointed out that prapatti was a self-sufficient and adequate means for attainment of moksha. It was declared that prapatti does not require the very many accessories that are inevitable for Bhaktiyoga. Though this spiritual means does not require the accessories of Karmayoga or Jnanayoga, Astangayoga and others, it is necessarily having five accessories for becoming effective and these accessories have been prescribed in the shruties and the nature of these essentials of Prapatti are described in this section.</p>
<p>This means of attainment of moksha is described as &lsquo;Shadvidha Sharanagati&rsquo;. This does not mean that they are six types of &lsquo;Sharanagati&rsquo;, but it is verily one, called by different names such as &lsquo;Nikshepa&rsquo;, &lsquo;Bharanyasa&rsquo;, and Thyaga. This is characterised by the five accessories. This is to be performed once along with the five accessories as prescribed in the scriptures at the feet of the all compassionate Lord, who is the inner controller of all entities other than himself and who is waiting for an occasion to redeem erring humanity.</p>
<p>निक्षेपापरपर्यायो न्यासः पञ्चाङ्गसंयुतः ।</p>
<p>संन्यासः त्याग इत्युक्तः शरणागतिरित्यपि ॥ The accessories for entrusting the burden of one&rsquo;s protection to the Lord, are as follows :</p>

<p>आत्मनिक्षेप कार्पण्ये षड्रिया शरणागतिः ॥ 1. Anukulya Sankalapa</p>
<p>A decision on the part of the aspirant to be agreeable to the Lord in all his actions. 2. Pratikulyasya Varjanam</p>
<p>Giving up totally all activities that are disagreeable to the Lord.</p>

<p>Supreme faith in the Lord that he would surely save him. 5. Goptrtva - paranam</p>
<p>Choosing the Lord to be his protector with a prayer.</p>
<p>The statement &lsquo;Shadvida Sharanagati&rsquo;, found in the verse quoted from &lsquo;Ahirbudhnya Samhita&rsquo; - (37-28,29) does not prescribe &lsquo;Sharanagati&rsquo; of six types; but, it signifies &lsquo;Sharanagati&rsquo;, the main means characterised by its accessories, as in the statement &lsquo;Astangayoga&rsquo;, which is including the main factor &lsquo;Samadhi&rsquo; along with the seven accessories such as Yama, Niyama, etc. Entrusting the burden of protection is the</p>
<p>Parikara Vibhagadhikara</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>main factor, and the other five are accessories to that. The Lakshmi Tantra declares definitely that the five are accessories to Nyasa&rsquo; in the following verse :</p>
<p>निक्षेपापरपर्यायः न्यासः पञ्चाङ्ग संयुतः । संन्यासस्त्याग इत्युक्ता शरणागतिरित्यपि।</p>
<p>(Lakshmi Tantra 17-74) This means is called by different names such as Nikshcpa', Nyasa', &lsquo;Samyak-Tyaga&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sharanagati&rsquo; and it is qualified by the five accessories. Taking into consideration, the totality of the main factor and its accessories, it is called &lsquo;Shadangayoga&rsquo;.</p>
<p>These five accessories are the natural conditions that exhort the aspirant to offer himself to the Supreme Paramatman for getting protection. In the absence of any of these factors, the self-offering becomes impossible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anukulya Sankalpa&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pratikulya Varjanam&rsquo; result out of his r123 31' or the awareness that he is for the sake of the Paramatman alone. On account of this, he wills to serve the Lord in all possible ways and determines to do whatever is agreeable to Him and to avoid whatever displeases Him. He realises that the entire universe forms the body of the Supreme and therefore resolves to act in a way which is agreeable to all beings.</p>
<p>चराचराणि भूतानि सर्वाणि भगवद्पुः । अतस्तदानुकूल्यं मे कार्यमित्येव निश्चयः ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Karpanya&rsquo; - or utter helplessness that is realised by one, is an essential factor for deserving the mercy of the Lord. This is the reflection of one&rsquo;s own unworthiness for saving oneself, and it may be the absence of &lsquo;Garva&rsquo; or pride that he is capable of saving himself. This is, in fact, a sense of genuinc humility that will win him the mercy of the Lord. On account of this fact, he will not think of any means other than Paramatman for gaining his object of desire, and thus, it will be helpful for gaining &lsquo;Ananyopayata&rsquo;. This heightens the compassion of the Paramatman, who is the protector of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maha-vishvasa' or Supreme Faith in the saving grace of the Lord, is absolutely essential for observing Prapatti. This will enable the aspirant to entrust his protection to the Lord with unshakable confidence in Him. As this is helpful at the time of performing Prapatti, it will ensure the aspirant to be free from all cares and anxieties about his protection even after the performance of Prapatti. Maha-Vishvasa or Supreme Faith is the very fundamental factor for the actualisation of Prapatti. Goptrtpa-paranam'</p>
<p>One should seek the Lord to become his protector in very clear terms. The Lord is the granter of all benefits that are prayed of Him, irrespective of their being agreeable to Him or disagreeable i.c. whether they are &lsquo;Purushartha&rsquo; or &lsquo;Apurushartha&rsquo;. The Lord grants the benefits only when He is prayed. One cannot get any benefit without asking for it. The Lakshmi Tantra points out that protection would not be given when it is not sought. &lsquo;अप्रार्थितां न गोपायेत्&rsquo; ।</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gorptreva-varanam&rsquo; is a submission regarding one&rsquo;s intention. Muraluu 714 F r Ad ' I</p>
<p>Parikara Vibhagadhikara</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>These five accessories are most helpful at the time of performance of Prapatti. These are inseparable with the performance of Prapatti.</p>
<p>Along with these accessories, one has to offer actually oneself to the &lsquo;Sarva-Sheshi&rsquo; at the time of surrender. This factor or &lsquo;Atma Nikshepa&rsquo; is very significant and absolutely necessary because without this surrender, and entrusting the Atman to the care of the Lord, the aspirant cannot be protected. The object to be saved, should be actually handed over to His care. This is the main factor and when the atman, that is to be protected, is made over to the care of Paramatman, the universal redeemer accepts it and surely protects. Having thus entrusted to the Lord, the burden of protection of one&rsquo;s self, by actually handing over to his care, the aspirant becomes freed from anxiety and fear.</p>
<p>Desika has given two classical instances of surrender, selected from the Ramayana, and has illustrated how in each case, all these five components are to be understood.</p>
<p>The first instance is the surrender of Trijata unto Mother Sita for obtaining protection from Sri Rama. Trijata urges demonesses to seek protection from Sita. She asks them not to speak harsh and cruel words to Sita. TGS Sale: :' - This is indicative of &lsquo;Pratikulya-varjanam&rsquo;. She advise them to use kind and mild words HIGHTET As speech is the very reflection of the mind, this suggests the accessory of &lsquo;Anukulya-sankalpa&rsquo;. &lsquo;Akinchanatva&rsquo; or utter helplessness is suggested by the statement &lsquo;राघवाद्धि भयं धोर TEHTI 34 Perdi&rsquo; which indicates their utter helplessness. Supreme faith in Mother Sita, is suggested by the statement &lsquo;HAN FET TERIT HEM Ta&rsquo; - which implies that even in case Sri Rama decides to punish some one, Sita would be able to make Him pleased to save the intended person. Even Anjaneya mentions that Sita alone would be capable of protecting the demonesses from Sri Rama. This is expressing Supreme Faith in Sita, A prayer for protecting them is made in the statement 3 41914 dcet' - &ldquo;may we beg of Sita to protect us&rdquo;. Thus, the five accessories of Prapatti are indicated in the words of Trijata. Handing over actually the atman to be protected is suggested by the word, &lsquo;Pranipatha&rsquo; found in the statement &lsquo;POTUIG MET A Aer Aic45&rsquo; Thus all the accessories along with the entrusting the object to be protected, arc fully indicated in this statement. Though the demonesses were advised like this, to surrender themselves unto Sita, they did not actually surrender to Her, but they did not refuse the proposal. Sita, relying on the non-refusal alone, gave her protection to all the demonesses as &lsquo;Haj mi faa:&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the instance of Vibhishana&rsquo;s surrender also, all these five accessories as well as the major factor of entrusting the burden of protection can be known from the statements made by Vibhishana.</p>
<p>Anukulya Sankalpa - or a resolution to be agreeable to Him - is noted in the statement, ' ATH GRAT4 feci'</p>
<p>Restore Sita to Rama - an advice which was made to Ravana.</p>
<p>The statements of Vibhishana viz. त्यक्त्वा पुत्रांश्च दारांश्च',</p>
<p>THIS' indicate Pratikulya varjanam, or refraining from doing anything disagreeable to Him.</p>
<p>Parikara Vibhagadhikara</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>Karpanyam or utter helplessness is suggested by the statement of Vibhishana that he has incurred the anger of the terrible Ravana, &lsquo;Ravana of evil designs&rsquo;, and &lsquo;that he has been ill-treated and insulted by Ravana&rsquo; -</p>
<p>Tault 719 goa:', a arke41a:'!</p>
<p>Mahavishvasa or Supreme Faith is indicated in these words of Vibhishana.</p>
<p>&lsquo;सर्वलोकशरण्याय राघवाय महात्मने&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surrender unto the Great Rama, who is the one refuge of all worlds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goptriva varanam or seeking protection, and Atma nivedana or actual surrender of one self to be protected, are indicated in the statement</p>
<p>Tea Rui Ta'</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surrender unto Rama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>H</p>
<p>Wa</p>
<p>This surrender is through a mediator or a &lsquo;Purushakara&rsquo;, as Vibhisahana prays to the &lsquo;Monkey Chief - Sugriva – to take him to Sri Rama for protection, in the words &lsquo;facua</p>
<p>y&rsquo; - offer me to the Lord without delay.</p>
<p>The protection given to Vibhishana was extended to the four followers of his also, as they were included in his surrender.</p>
<p>The surrender of Trijata similarly, is to be understood as inclusive of her close relatives and associates.</p>
<p>All these factors are to be reflected upon in the dvaya mantra, which is the mantra followed in surrender : When the supreme nature of Paramatman is reflected some doubts may arise in our minds, Desika has pointed out those doubts and answered them convincingly as follows - 1. The Lord is omniscient and omnipotent.</p>
<p>When the Lord is of this supreme nature, how can it be said that he is approachable by those, who have committed endless sins? He is granting the results to all people, only according to their respective karma. How can it be said that he would grant infinite benefit of liberation to those who have committed infinite</p>
<p>offences ? 3. He is never looking forward for any benefit from any</p>
<p>one. How can it be said that he would grant the Supreme benefit to one who has done very little effort ? He is not granting prayers quickly, as any other petty gods. How can it be said that he would bestow on them</p>
<p>without delay, the Highest Benefit ? 5. There is no one equal to Him or greater than Him, and</p>
<p>He is the Lord of all. Is it proper to say that he would grant the Highest Benefit to all without considering their differences ?</p>
<p>These five doubts about the nature and grace of the Lord, are cleared on the basis of the truths signified by the words of the dvaya mantra.Parikara Vibhagadhikara</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>man</p>
<p>When one reflects upon the five factors viz., (1) Purushakara; (2) Sambandha (or relationship) (3) Guna (or auspicious qualities); 4) Vyapara (or functioning) and (5) Prayojana (or benefit) that are taught by the dvaya mantra, the above doubts get cleared.</p>
<p>Though the Lord is omnipotent, He is inseparably associated with Goddess Sri Mahalakshmi, who is the purushakara or a mediatrix. On account of the mediation of Goddess Sri, the Lord will, as in the case of the attendants in the inner apartment, excuse all offences that are obstructions to approach Him. He will not see the faults of those that surrender unto Him on account of the intervention of Sri, which He cannot turn down. So, one who surrenders unto Him, can approach Him. The mother, who is full of affection for humanity never knows punishment and she pleads on behalf of erring humanity, with the Lord and secures our protection. So, one need not feel that he cannot approach the Supreme Lord on account of one&rsquo;s own transgression of divine law.</p>
<p>The second doubt is that the Lord awards the fruits of karma, according to their merits, and therefore, He does not grant the infinite benefit of moksha to those who have committed infinite sins that are obstructions for the attainment of the highest object of life. This apprehension is cleared in the following way :</p>
<p>The Lord is no doubt the dispenser of results according to one&rsquo;s action good or bad; but, He will become pleased with the surrender that is made unto Him and on account of that pretext, He will grant the infinite fruit, which is naturally His right, just like one&rsquo;s right to paternal property, as he is cternally related to Him as His Dasa or Attendant. OU</p>
<p>This relationship between the aspirant and the Lord is irrevocable and on account of this intrinsic relationship of</p>
<p>19 and file, the Lord becomes pleased and grants him the infinite fruit.</p>
<p>The third doubt is that the Lord does not expect anything from anybody, as He has attained all desires and is a &lsquo;Paripurna&rsquo;. What has He to gain by saving any one? He does not expect anything for his own sake, as other petty gods. So, why should He save anybody that seeks Him?</p>
<p>The answer to this doubt is as follows -</p>
<p>Though the Lord is not expecting anything in return, He is just like a virtuous sovereign, who is won over by even a little pretext done in favour of Him. The Lord is an ocean of infinite compassion and yet He considers even the little service rendered to Him as a great benefaction and grants their desires being grateful to them for that little service. The Lord is so noble and great that He feels that He has not responded enough to His devotee even after granting the greatest benefit of moksha.</p>
<p>The next doubt is that He is not granting the prayers of His devotees very soon as other little gods do. So, it is said that we do not know when He is going to condescend to our prayers. This doubt is solved as follows :</p>
<p>The Lord may grant at the proper time the fruits of actions offered unto Him in respect of other disciplines than self-surrender When an aspirant surrenders unto Him alone, without aspiring for any other benefit (Ananya Prayojana) and without seeking protection from any other deity (Ananya Sarana), the Lord who is known for His generosity and compassion, grants the fruit for which one has</p>
<p>Parikara Vibhagadhikara</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>surrendered at such a time that the prapanna&rsquo; desires, without depending upon any other factor, other than his crue will, just as He granted protection without delay to that Kakasura and Vibhishana. Prapatti or self-surrender, is an extraordinary means that warrants immediate award. For other disciplines, such as Bhaktiyoga and others, one may have to wait till that means becomes perfect; but, for Prapatti, there will not be any delay. At whatever time the Prapanna desires, the Lord grants those desires according to the prayer of the aspirant.</p>
<p>The next doubt is - How can it be thought that the Lord is going to grant the desires of prapannas without any discrimination whatsoever ? The answer to this question is that the Lord has the quality of &lsquo;Swatantra&rsquo; and others and he fulfils the desires of those that seek protection with Him, for His own benefit. When He saves one soul from samsara, it is not the gain of the soul but it is the gain of the Lord. The Lord saves those that seek His protection just for gaining those souls on His side.</p>
<p>Any doubt that is entertained, may be got over like this, as we see in this world. So, the means of self-surrender, is established according to shastras, as a desired means to all people. Unless one realises all these factors, he may not entertain supreme faith. The significance of these five apprehensions and answers can be known properly only when a virtuous preceptor blesses with his instructions to the disciple. In the ultimate analysis, it becomes established that the benign grace of the Acharya or Preceptor, will infuse confidence and faith in the saving grace of the Lord.</p>
<p>Though prapatri is a valid means for attaining the benefits that are very difficult to attain and though by Dec</p>
<p>performing once, one can attain that benefit without wasting energy, time or wealth, though one can attain one&rsquo;s object of desire at the particular time he desires, it is absolutely necessary that one has to gain Mahavishvasa, which is not easy to get. So this means, though appears to be very casy, is not all that easy. All these factors are to be reflected in the dvaya-mantra. The term that signifies &lsquo;Purushakara&rsquo; in the poorva-khanda enables one to gain supreme faith. The helplessness on the part of the aspirant as well as the nature of this means, are to be known in the verb &lsquo;Prapadye&rsquo;. The preposition &lsquo;Pra&rsquo; and the verb &lsquo;Prapadye&rsquo;, combined with the word &lsquo;Sharana&rsquo; and the usage of the first person of the verb, signify the essential nature of this means.</p>
<p>अहमस्म्यपराधानां आलयः अकिञ्चनोऽगतिः । त्वमेवोपायभूतो मे भवेति प्रार्थनामतिः ।। शरणागतिरित्युक्ता सा देवेऽस्मिन् प्रयुज्यताम् ।।</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am an abode of all transgressions or offences. I have nothing in my possession. I have no means. You alone should be my means. This kind of knowledge, ensuing in a prayer, is &lsquo;Sharanagati&rsquo;.</p>
<p>For a person, who is incapable of following any other means, the Lord stands in the position of a protector, as generally known from all shastras. Not only that, He will be placed in the place of any other means and He will be the &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; or means of attaining Him. The intention of this statement is that one should have a firm understanding that the Lord himself is his &lsquo;Upaya&rsquo; and as &lsquo;Upayatva&rsquo; is common to both chetana and achetana and therefore, the Lord whom he evokes like this as his upaya, implies choosing Him as a protector. The firm understanding that he is the upaya is</p>
<p>Parikara Vibhagadhikara</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>literally known whercas &lsquo;Goptrtva-varana&rsquo; or praying Him to be a protector is implied by sense.</p>
<p>In the conclusion of this chapter, Desika summarises the significance of these accessories, as follows: 1. This means of Prapatti is having five accessories and</p>
<p>when taken with the main factor, there will be six</p>
<p>factors. 2. This is to be performed only once as prescribed by the</p>
<p>Bhagavat Shastras. 3. The two viz. Anukulya Sankalpa and Pratikulya varjana,</p>
<p>save one from all dangers of transgression of the divine</p>
<p>command and desire for worldly things. 4. Karpanya significs that there is no other support or</p>
<p>means.</p>
<p>The Maha-vishvasa establishes firmly steadfastness</p>
<p>regarding the means chosen. 6. Goptrtva varanam expresses the desire to be saved by</p>
<p>Him.</p>
<p>In this way, the firm understanding of being totally subservient to the Lord is firmly established.</p>
<p>With all these accessories, one is obliged to offer his self to be protected by the Lord.</p>

<p>Sangaprapadanadhikara</p>
<p>CHAPTER - XII</p>
<p>Sangaprapadanadhikara</p>
<p>Having discussed about the various requirements that are essential for surrendering oneself unto the Lord, in this section, the mode of self-surrender, which is of the form of entrusting the burden of the protection of one&rsquo;s self to the Lord is described. This happens to be the prime factor in the process of surrender. Having qualified himself with an aspiration for liberation, having known in general terms the nature of the inseparable relationship with the Lord, and having known the several accessories that are essential for Prapatti, one becomes capable of performing Prapatti at the feet of the Lord. Whatever is described in the earlier sections will be immensely helpful to an aspirant to follow the main path of self-surrender.</p>
<p>In the introductory verse, the essential nature of Prapatti is clearly expounded. It is declared here as &lsquo;Bharanyasa&rsquo; preceded by a prayer for protection. The essential nature of Prapatti is Bharanyasa. This is common to all people who seek the Lord to be their chief means of securing their object of desire. For people who aspire for different benefits, other than liberation, Bharanyasa is a necessity; but, surrendering of the &lsquo;swarupa&rsquo; and &lsquo;phala&rsquo; is not required. This entrusting of the burden of securing the object of desire, is to be necessarily combined with a prayer for his protection. The &lsquo;yachana&rsquo; or prayer, signifies</p>
<p>gopertva-varanam'. This means of prapatti also is a kind of knowledge or &lsquo;mathi-vishesha&rsquo;. This kind of understanding is called Prapatti. Prapani is defined as 37ARATE FOR महाविश्वासपूर्वकम् । तदेकोपायता याञ्छा प्रपत्तिः शरणागतिः' || by ancient masters. Desika gives the definition of Prapatti according to this here as follows:</p>
<p>अभीष्टे दुस्साधे स्वत इतरतो वा क्वचन तत् भरन्यासं याच्नान्वितमभिवदन्ति प्रपदनम् । इतः पश्चादस्मद्यतननिरपेक्षेण भवता समोऽसावर्थस्त्विति मतिविशेषं तदविदुः ॥</p>
<p>“When one cannot obtain the object of his desire either by his effort or by the effort of others, he entrusts the burden of securing the object with some one along with a prayer or appeal for securing that object. This is called surrender. He prays to him that from the very next moment of his entrusting his burden, that object of desire, difficult to be gained, may be obtained by him alone, without requiring any effort on the part of ourselves. This kind of particular awareness of his burden of getting that object has been actually thrown on the shoulders of that Lord, is surrender. It is not mere knowledge of an appeal or prayer for protection. The idea of this is, that the person who has performed surrender like this, should be totally relieved of the cares or worries of obtaining that object from the very next moment of entrusting that burden to the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The essential nature of surrender which is the means of attainment of Paramatman, is as follows:</p>
<p>It is not something of ours that we are making over to the Lord for protection. It is just like handing over an ornament to the lawful owner for adorning himself. It is clearly expounded in the &lsquo;Pranava&rsquo; by the terms and suffixes</p>
<p>Sangaprapadanadhikara</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>that the Lord is the protector of all. The &lsquo;sarva-sheshin&rsquo; or the master of everything, is having every other thing as &lsquo;shesa&rsquo; or subservient entity unto him. When everyone is his &lsquo;shesha-bhuta&rsquo;, and everyone exists for the purpose of Himself, and as everyone is dependent upon that supreme principle, the aspirant has to reflect upon his subservicnce to the Lord even in surrendering himself unto the Lord. He has to realise fully that in the process of saving himself, and all that belongs to him, as well as in the fruit of his protection and the protection of all that belongs to him, that he is not related to all these independently or for the sake of himself. This kind of पारतन्त्र्यविशिष्ट शेषत्वानुसन्धानम् is absolutely necessary in Prapatti also.</p>
<p>One should have this reflection that the all-independent Ishvara, who is the &lsquo;sarva-sheshin&rsquo; is himself protecting all, that are subservient to Him, through a pretext. All others, being utterly subservient to Him alone, and totally dependent upon Him, are not fit to be a &lsquo;Nirupadhika Sheshi&rsquo;. &ldquo;When this atman is utterly subordinated to Him, just like a lump of clay, and when he is incapable of protecting himself, how can he be the protector of others?&rdquo; “I am not capable of protecting myself as well as all things that are called as mine, as I am neither independent nor the prime enjoyer of the result.” So, just as wisemen reflected “myself, my kingdom, wealth, my wife and dependents and my vehicles - all these are subservient to that Supreme Paramatman&rdquo; &lsquo;CHIR</p>
<p>16-A a regulad सर्व इति तत्प्रेक्षितं सदा ।।&rsquo; One should have a definite understanding that one&rsquo;s self as well as those that belong to onc, are only belonging to Him, the Supreme Paramatman. The burden of protecting all these things that belong to one,</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyacraya Saram</p>
<p>also happens to be on Paramarman himself. “Except for that Supreme-self, Sri Hari, no one else is capable of protecting anybody.&rdquo; 41457 71422 # Hoa '</p>
<p>The entrusting of the burden of protection of one&rsquo;s self as well as all that belongs to him, is called &lsquo;Atma-Nikshepa&rsquo;. &lsquo;31784 H H EUCHAT 3t4d&rsquo; | The Supreme Paramatman alone is the prime beneficiary. So, one should reflect that the fruit of protection also, is related to that Paramatman, who is the &lsquo;Pradhana-Phali&rsquo;. This is pointed out in the following versc:</p>
<p>तेन संरक्ष्यमाणस्य फले स्वाम्यवियुक्तता । केशवार्पणपर्यन्ता ह्यात्मनिक्षेप उच्यते ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;One who is being protected by that Lord, has no ownership in respect of the fruit of that protection. The benefit of protection is not for him. It is offered to the Supreme Keshava himself. This is called Atma Nikshepa'. The idea conveyed by this statement is that, the benefit of protection is necessarily related to the Supreme Lord who is the ultimate and prime beneficiary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The performance of Prapatti is consisting of three &lsquo;samarpanas&rsquo; or offerings. They are (1) the &lsquo;swarupa&rsquo; (or the essential nature of the aspirant); (2) The &lsquo;bhara&rsquo; (or entrusting the burden of protection) and (3) the &lsquo;phala&rsquo; (or the fruit of protection). A ‘mumukshu' (or an aspirant after liberation), whether he is a &lsquo;Bhaktiyogin&rsquo; or a &lsquo;Prapanna&rsquo;, has to entrust the Lord with his &lsquo;swarupa&rsquo; and the phala'. The surrender of these two &lsquo;swarupa-samarpana&rsquo; and &lsquo;phala samarpana&rsquo; is common to both types of aspirants. The &lsquo;Bhaktiyogin&rsquo; pursues the path of Bhaktiyoga, and does not</p>
<p>Sangaprapadanadhikara</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>entrust the burden of protection i.c. &lsquo;Bhara-samarpana&rsquo;. He also has to surrender unto the Lord for enabling him to commence Bhaktiyoga and complete it; whereas, an akinchana' (or an aspirant who is incapable of following Bhaktiyoga) entrusts the Lord with the burden of protection i.e. &lsquo;Bharanyasa&rsquo;, in addition to the surrendering of swarupa' and “phala’. For people who are desirous of gaining any object (i.c. people who aspire for all desires inclusive of liberation) have to adopt &lsquo;Raksha-Bharanyasa&rsquo; or surrender the burden of protection to the Lord. Whether a person desires moksha or any other phala', from the Lord, he has to surrender the burden of his protection to the Lord. This may relate to the four kinds of aspirants as noted in the Gita. A &lsquo;Phalarthi&rsquo; (or one who aspires for some benefit other than moksha) does not surrender the fruit to the Lord (i.e. Phala nikshepa). An aspirant after moksha, surrenders both swarupa and phala to the Lord. A Prapanna surrenders swarupa, bhara and phala to the Lord. When he is surrendering his swarupa, he does not surrender sheshatva jnana'. This is expounded in the following verse:</p>
<p>मुमुक्षुमात्रसामान्यं स्वरूपादिसमर्पणम् ।</p>
<p>अकिञ्चने भरन्यासस्त्वधिकोऽङ्गितया स्थितः ॥ अत्ररक्षाभरन्यासः समः सर्वफलार्थिनाम् । स्वरूपफलनिक्षेपस्त्वधिको मोक्षकांक्षिणाम् ।।</p>
<p>An objection is raised here. When a person is performing surrender aspiring for some benefit, he should become the beneficiary. How can it be said that the Paramatman is the prime beneficiary? The answer to this question is as follows: The Supreme Paramatman feels pleased when he grants certain benefits to the aspirants and feels happy, even as he enjoys the decorations and others done to a doll or a parrot and others. Desika describes this in verse ll of Sharanagati Deepika</p>
<p>पाञ्चालिकाशुकविभूषण भोगदायी</p>
<p>सम्राडिवात्मसमया सह मोदसे त्वम् ।।</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as one feels glad by decorating a doll or by re shaping an idol and by keeping a parrot in a cage and feeding it with fruits and flowers, and allowing it to fly; similarly, the Lord enjoys, when the chetanas benefit from Him. So, He is to be taken as the &lsquo;Pradhana-Phali&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A person who has no knowledge of his essential nature also, can surrender, if he has got that definite understanding that he is subservient only to the Lord. As pointed out in &lsquo;Stotraratna&rsquo; by Yamuna, a person can surrender unto the Lord, even if he does not know the essential nature, but realises that he belongs to the Lord.</p>
<p>A simile is given by Desika here. Just as a person who comes upon a transparent purse of a king, which bears his seal, and which contains a costly gem, hands it over to the king with the conviction that the king would accept it, though he does not know the nature of the gem in the purse. Similarly, if a person surrenders himself unto the Lord with the understanding that he belongs to the Lord, the Lord would certainly accept him and that soul would be freed from the &lsquo;nigraha&rsquo; (or wrath) of the Lord for having stolen the ‘atman&rsquo; (that belonged to Him) from beginningless time.</p>
<p>From this, it becomes established that for surrender,</p>
<p>Sangaprapadanadhikara</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>shesharva-jnana is absolutely essential, though one may not have the knowledge of the other essential characteristics. Desika cxplains the meaning of the verse</p>
<p>ममनाथ यदस्ति योऽस्म्यहं सकलं तद्धितवैव माधव । नियतस्वमिति प्रबुद्धधीः अथवा किं नु समर्पयामि ते ॥</p>
<p>(ti).T. 47) as not repenting for having surrendered early to the Lord. The implication of this verse, according to Desika, is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever I am and whatever is here as mine, all that is verily yours alone. Having this enlightened knowledge that they belong to You alone, what can I offer You, anything as mine!&rdquo; The idea is this, &lsquo;even when the atman is offered to you without having a thorough understanding of its nature, if it is offered with the feeling that he is offering something belonging to Him, then the offence of fatmapahara&rsquo; is remedied. The point that is emphasised here, is that the atman should be offered unto Him, with the feeling that he is offering His (Paramatman&rsquo;s) own object to the lawful owner and that he is not offering anything of his to the Lord. These two verses ay rag' and &lsquo;444-19&rsquo; signify that the essential knowledge of freyfa 49' should be had while surrendering the atman to the Lord. &lsquo;I also belong to you alone should be the reflection in entrusting the burden of our protection to Him.</p>
<p>Desika points out that in the dvaya-mantra, this kind of cntrusting the burden of protection, should be reflected as follows: The dvaya-mantra has the words &ldquo;PILUT YET I The term ‘sharana&rsquo; along with the verb &lsquo;prapadye’ signifies supreme faith as suggested by the verb, which has the meaning of &lsquo;knowing&rsquo; (Jnanarthaka). The understanding of the means or upaya which is signified by the word &lsquo;sharana&rsquo; is to be understood. Praying for protection (or goptrtva-varanam) is signified as included in &lsquo;sharanam-prapadye&rsquo;. So, one should reflect in the two terms &lsquo;sharanam-prapadye&rsquo;, offering of the atman for protection to the Lord, as characterised by the reflection of subscrvience to Him alone,</p>
<p>The five accessories to Prapatti and the act of surrender, are here enquired into separately for getting a sound understanding of the significance. But, when Prapatti is performed, the main factor of surrender characterised by all the five accessories, are to be reflected as one unit, and to be performed at one time by one. Prapatti is to be performed only once for attainment of a particular object. It should not be performed again and again, because it will imply lack of trust in the Lord. This kind of performance of Prapatti, is compared to the shooting of an arrow at a target by a deft archer. Being well trained in many aspects, the archer shoots unerringly at the target at a single moment. The Upanishad says that the &lsquo;Pranava&rsquo; is the bow and &lsquo;Brahman&rsquo; is the target. Atman&rsquo; is the arrow and without any inadvertence, the arrow is to be shot and lodged in Brahman. Like that, this act of surrender of the atman to the Paramatman is to be done once only, carefully.</p>
<p>The statement of “Satyaki Tantra' - अनेनैव तु मन्त्रेण स्वात्मानं मयि निक्षिपेत् । मयि निक्षिप्तकर्तव्यः कृतकृत्यो भविष्यति ।।</p>
<p>Sangaprapadanadhikara</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this mantra alone one should surrender oneself unto Me. He becomes one who has done what ought to be donc, by doing the duty of surrendering unto Me&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This signifies that of all the mantras, the foremost is the Dvaya-Mantra, and the entrusting of the burden of protection is the main factor in self-surrender. Nikshipta Kartavyah' means &lsquo;Nikshipta Bharah&rsquo;. One who has not entrusted completely, the burden of his protection, is not a person who has done what ought to be done. The particular mantra of surrender, which is signified as Anenaiva tu Mantrena' is indicative of other mantras also that are</p>
<p>employed in surrendering of the self.</p>
<p>Desika has taught the way of performing surrender along with the accessories as follows: 1. One should reflect that he is not the main doer or</p>
<p>&ldquo;kartha', but the Paramatman alone. This &lsquo;karttva-tyaga&rsquo; implies the abandonment of the kind of attachment that what is being performed is belonging to him. One should also reflect that the phala or the fruit belongs to the Paramatman alone. This is Phala-tyaga'. Phalopayatva tyaga' signifies that the Prapatti which is being performed is not a direct means for attaining his object, but it is only a pretext and that the Supreme Paramatman alone, is the direct</p>
<p>means of attainment of the object. 3. All these four viz. &lsquo;Kartrtva-tyaga&rsquo;, &lsquo;Mamata-tyaga&rsquo;,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Phala-tyaga&rsquo; and &lsquo;Phalopaya-tyaga&rsquo; are common to all *Nivruthi Dharmas'. Along with all these, one should have the reflection of the five accessories of Prapatti; such as a resolution to be agreeable to Him, etc., which are helpful to Prapatti. With all these reflections, one should remember the line of compassionate Acharyas, and through the words of “Dvaya-Mantra', one should entrust the burden of one&rsquo;s protection to Paramatman, which is inclusive of the surrender of one&rsquo;s essential nature (swarupa) as well as the fruit (phala). In this context, it is to be understood that a prayer for being the means of protection, has to be offered to the Lord.</p>
<p>It is to be understood here that it is justified that one should renounce &lsquo;kartrtva&rsquo; as belonging to him, as that kartrtva has been given to him by the Supreme Lord. This will enable him to remember for all time to come that he is only subordinate to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The justification for ‘Mamata-tyaga' and &lsquo;Phala-tyaga&rsquo; is this viz. the essential nature and other factors of his self and all that belongs to him, is verily subservient to the Paramatman alone.</p>
<p>The justification for abandoning the idea of the means to the phala or gaining of the object in Prapatti, i.e., फलोपायत्वत्याग is as follows:</p>
<p>The performance of Prapatri by the aspirant for awakening the mercy of the Lord, is verily a remote cause for the fruit and it is a non-sentient one and is bereft of the will to grant the fruit. So, the upaya or Prapatti that is performed, is not the immediate cause of granting the fruit.</p>
<p>The means of getting the fruit or 4019ra is the Supreme Paramatman alone. On account of his natural grace, He has been the prime cause of granting the Jivatman, the body and the indriyas as well as knowledge and</p>
<p>Sangaprapadanadhikara</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>preceptors and has been the cause of everything inclusive of the uttering of the &lsquo;Dvaya-Mantra&rsquo;. He is characterised by the particular inclination with grace to grant liberation and He happens to be the immediate cause of granting the fruit and He stands as a substitute in place of that particular mcans for which the jivatma is incapable and helpless. How is all this known? How is this possible?</p>
<p>The essential nature of Paramatman, who becomes pleased when a difficult means is practised, becomes easily pleased when an easy way of spiritual perfection is practised, as known from the infallible scriptures that expound his &lsquo;Sarva-Sharanyarva&rsquo;, &lsquo;Sarva-Suhrutva&rsquo; and his auspicious qualities of ‘vatsalya' and &lsquo;karunya&rsquo;. The shastras ordain that one, who is gained by the arduous path of Bhaktiyoga is possible of being gained by fsharanagati' or Prapatti. The shastras alone, are the ultimate authorities for Prapatti, to be a valid means for attainment of Paramatman.</p>
<p>Nadadur Ammal has described the process of self surrender along with the accessories as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From beginningless time, I have transgressed the commands of the shastras and have erred against you and so I am born in this world&rdquo; – &ldquo;Hereafter I will behave only agreeable to you. I shall not do anything which displeases you. I have no wherewithal to obtain you. I have decided you alone as my spiritual means. You alone must be means of attainment. Have I any burden thereafteç, in averting the undesirable and attaining the desirable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this statement, all the five accessories have been mentioned and in the last sentence, the fact of surrendering</p>
<p>the burden of protection is mentioned.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>The five accessories viz. Anukulya-sankalpa and others are necessarily associated and had to be had only once at the time of Prapatti. This means that at the time of Prapatti, all these should be invariably followed. the agrecability to the Lord and others that continue after the performance of Prapatti, are the results of the performance of Prapatti, and they will continue for all time to come.</p>
<p>The accessories of Prapatti such as Anukulya Sankalpa or Resolution to be agreeable to the Lord and others are to be followed at the time of surrender. After Prapatti, these attitudes viz, avoiding anything that is displeasing to the Lord, behaving agreeably to the Lord and supreme faith in the loving grace of the Lord and others, do not get included in the accessories. Are they not necessary? How are these to be practised? If this question is raised, it is answered thus:</p>
<p>These attitudes such as being agreeable to the Lord and others, are at the first moment of performance of Prapatti, accessories, and these, that continue after Prapatti, are the &lsquo;phala&rsquo; or the fruit of Prapatti. As these are dependent upon one&rsquo;s &lsquo;Prarabdha Sukrutha&rsquo;, it is advised that at the time of surrender, one has to include in his self-surrender 1. agreeable behaviour for all time to come after Prapatti; 2. &lsquo;Niraparadha Kainkarya&rsquo; or service to the Lord free</p>
<p>from any offensive or sinful deeds; and Liberation at the end of that body that has come upon</p>
<p>him due to his &lsquo;Prarabdha Karma&rsquo;. All these three are to be included in his performance of Prapatti, at that time alone.</p>
<p>The summary of this chapter is condensed in one stanza at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p>Sangaprapadanadhikara</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>to sur</p>
<p>If a doubt is raised that the Lord alone is not all independent, but the jivatman also is independent as described in the sutra of Panini &lsquo;Swatantrah Karta&rsquo;; and when it is like this, how can it be said that the jivatman has to surrender himself unto the Lord for being protected?</p>
<p>The Sruti decidedly describes that Paramatman alone is the ruler and prompter of the other two entities viz. jivatman and matter</p>
<p>युग्यस्यन्दनसारथिक्रमवति त्रय्यन्त संदर्शिते तत्त्वानां त्रितये यथार्ह विविधव्यापार सन्तानिनि । हेतुत्वं त्रिषुकर्तृभाव उभयोः स्वाधीनतैकत्र तत् स्वामिस्वीकृतयद्रोऽयमलसस्तत्रस्वयं निर्भरः ।।</p>
<p>The jivatman is ever under the direction and rulership of the Supreme Lord and Paramatman is the controller of all other things. &lsquo;Prayogyah&rsquo; or &lsquo;yugyah&rsquo; mcans horses and others. &lsquo;Acharanam and Syandanam&rsquo; is the chariot. Yuktah' means bound; Prana' means jivatman.</p>
<p>Just as the horses are yoked to the chariot, and driven by the charioteer, the jivatman under the domination of karma, is united with the body by the All Supreme Lord. Of the three entities, the activities are to be known as follows:</p>
<p>The movement and others are common to the sentient and the non-sentient. The contact or &lsquo;Samyoga&rsquo; is common to all the three. Knowledge and desire to act, are common to Ishvara and jivatman. Mutation in its nature is the unique feature of &lsquo;achetana&rsquo; or non-sentient entitics. Diminution or expansion of knowledge is unique to the jivatman. The uniquc function of Ishvara is supporting and ruling over all</p>
<p>LI</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyacraya Saram</p>
<p>entities other than himself. &lsquo;Hetutva&rsquo; or being the cause, is common to all the three, though Ishvara is the &lsquo;Pradhana Hetu&rsquo;. &lsquo;Kartru-Bhaya&rsquo; i.e. being the &lsquo;ashraya&rsquo; or resort for jnana or knowledge, &lsquo;chikirsha&rsquo; or the desire to do and Sprayatna' or effort. Of these &lsquo;Kartru-Bhava&rsquo; is common to both jivatman and Paramatman. But, being all independent and having everything other than himself under his rulc, is unique to Paramatman alone.</p>
<p>STARTE andra hy Falls is only for the Supreme being, and it is not contradictory to the nature of the jivatman to surrender. So, it is to be concluded that it is imperative for the jivatnan to surrender the burden of his protection to the Lord and it is also justified that the Lord bears the burden of protection of the jivatman, who has surrendered unto Him. So, the Lord is the protector of all and those that have entrusted the burden of their protection to the Lord will be relieved of all cares and worries.</p>

<p>Kritakricyadhikara</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>CHAPTER - XIII</p>
<p>Kritakrityadhikara</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a spiritual aspirant has surrendered the burden of his protection to the Lord, who is omniscient and omnipotent, and a well wisher of all by his very nature, and when such a Lord has accepted the burden of protection, thus entrusted to Him, he has nothing more to do regarding that in this universe. He engages himself totally in the loving service of that Supreme Lord, who is an ocean of Supreme bliss, and becomes fulfilled. Though he was, prior to his surrender, an indigent person, now after entrusting the burden of his protection, he considers himself as one, who is most affluent on account of the attainment of loving service to the Lord. He is considered to be one who has donc his duty that ought to be done.</p>
<p>The essential features of a &lsquo;Kritakritya&rsquo;, are described in this section. He will have no care or anxiety about his protection as he has un-burdened himself. A person, who has performed self-surrender at the feet of the Lord, will have absolutely na duty to perform in respect of his desired object as his part of duty is fulfilled by surrendering once the burden of protection to the Lord. As he has no responsibility of protecting himself, he feels highly relieved. He reflects on the assurance &lsquo;Ma-Shuchah&rsquo; given by the Lord, who is all independent and whose will is infallible, and becomes care free, without any worry regarding his protection. The Lord has verily willed to grant the object of desire by saving him from all sins. He will have no doubt in the realisation of his aspiration, as he thinks of the Lord, who is trustworthy, capable and ever existing means of all</p>
<p>er CX</p>
<p>mean attainments. He becomes &lsquo;Nirbhaya&rsquo; or fearless and he discards totally other objects of life and other means of spiritual perfection. He becomes overjoyed when he thinks of the supreme object of life that he is going to gain, just as a poor man comes to gain a great wealth without any effort. He becomes supremely delighted and will not have any relationship with other deities like the four-faced-Brahma or Rudra and others, who are all &lsquo;kshetrajnas&rsquo; or jivatmans, just like himself. It is declared that a person who surrenders unto Supreme Narayana, is not a servant of any other deity. &ldquo;He, who surrenders unto Sriman Narayana, who is the one refuge of all, and who is the one preceptor of all in this universe, is not the servant of either the gods or sages or other entities or human beings or the manes. He is not</p>
<p>indebted to anyone here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>देवर्षि भूतात्मनृणां पितृणां न किंकरो नायं क्रिणी च राजन् । सर्वात्मना यः शरणं शरण्यं नारायणं लोकगुरुं प्रपन्नः ॥</p>
<p>When such a person has to perform the duties of his station in life, such as the panchamaha-yajnas he may be offering worship to various deities, but all those terms and names relate to the Supreme Narayana through them and so he will have a firm conviction that he is worshipping the Lord alone through all these obligatory duties. This is declared in the following verse :</p>
<p>ये यजन्ति पितॄन् देवान् ब्राह्मणान् सहुताशनान् । सर्वभूतान्तरात्मानं विष्णुमेव यजन्ति ते।</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who worship the manes, gods, brahmins, having the sacrificial fire with them, are in fact worshipping the one Great Lord Vishnu, who is the innerself of all beings&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Kritakrityadhikara</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>When the servants of the king garland their sovereign with garlands and decorate him with ornaments, they are placed on the body of the king they intend to worship like this, for gaining the love and goodwill of the king, who is the atman in the body. Similarly, all gods are bodies of the one Supreme Narayana, and when the gods are worshipped it is really Sriman Narayana who is the innerself that becomes worshipped. It is the Great Narayana, who has granted powers to those other gods to bless their respective devotees. If one worships these gods with the idea that he is worshipping these gods alone, and that these gods alone grant one&rsquo;s desires, one is not worshipping in the proper form. They will be worshipping in a different way or &lsquo;Avidhipurvakam&rsquo;. So, when a prapanna undertakes to do this obligatory duties and when he utters the names of other deities, he must be always thinking of Sriman Narayana, whom he is serving through all these gods. So, he will not be doing a fault, if he utters the names of other gods and worships them as required by shastras prescribing his normal duties.</p>
<p>He has to obey commands of the Lord, as known from the shastras and never should he violate those commands. In this respect, he is similar to the liberated, who can know the intention of the Lord directly.</p>
<p>The prapanna is similar to the liberated, who will be rendering his little service to the Lord, and as he has observed the means of salvation, is a &lsquo;Kritakritya&rsquo; or one who has done his duty and he is called a &lsquo;Krithartha&rsquo; who has gained his &lsquo;Purushartha&rsquo; or object of attainment.</p>
<p>Sri Ramanuja has described in the &lsquo;Sharanagati Gadya&rsquo;, how a &lsquo;Kritakritya&rsquo; should be thinking in these words - : me</p>
<p>अतः त्वम् तत्त्वतो मज्ज्ञानदर्शन प्राप्तिषु निस्संशयः सुखमास्व ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, having absolutely no doubt as regards the attainment of my knowledge, my vision and my attainment, rest in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The significance of this statement is as follows :</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;samsari chetana&rsquo; who was revolving in this world from birth to birth, on account of the wrath of the Lord, caused by the transgression of His command, was blessed with the compassionate glances of a virtuous preceptor on account of the grace of the Lord, waiting for an opportunity to redeem humanity. This fact of performing surrender at the feet of the Lord, by uttering the words of surrender as taught by the preccptor, is most effective in awakening the mercy and grace of the Lord and on account of this, all causes of displeasure of the Lord, have been removed and the Lord who is capable of transforming the migrating soul, will surcly protect him on His own account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>*Placing full confidence in the Lord thus, you be without fear whatsoever.&rdquo; This is the essence of the statement of assurance given by the Lord as 7 T: the concluding statement of the charama-sloka'.</p>
<p>An aspirant should have sorrow and dejection prior to the performance of surrender unto the Lord. If not, he will not be fulfilling the conditions for seeking the grace of the Lord. &lsquo;Nirveda&rsquo; or dejection is a necessary requirement for urgently seeking a preceptor for saving him from sorrow and misery. &ldquo;If there is no cause, there will be no effect&rdquo; - This is true in the case of a prapanna also; but, if he does not have full confidence in the assurance given by the Lord, and if he</p>
<p>Kritakriryadhikara</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>SO</p>
<p>sorrows for his destiny after prapatti, the means of attainment of liberation becomes deficient, and the fruit will be delayed till that &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; becomes fulfilled completely. It may be summed up that a person who is divested of doubt, sorrow and fear after surrender, is verily a &lsquo;Krita-kritya&rsquo;. Desika concludes this section in a verse, the meaning of which is summarised below :</p>
<p>भगवति हरौ पारं गन्तुं भरन्यसनं कृतं परिमित सुखप्राप्त्यै कृत्यं प्रहीणमकृत्यवत् । भवति च वपुर्वृत्तिः पूर्वं कृतैर्नियत क्रमा परमिह विभोराज्ञासेतुः बुधैरनुपाल्यते ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go beyond the vast ocean of samsara, the responsibility of protection was entrusted to the Supreme Lord, Sriman Narayana. Hereafter, to do anything for gaining little and transient objects of life like wealth, power or pleasure, etc., is unbecoming of a prapanna, just like prohibited action. His living in the world, goes on as determined by his past karmas, as before. The wise people who have unburdened their responsibility of protection to the Lord, implicitly obey the commands of the form of the scriptures, so long as they are stationed here.</p>
<h2 id="१४-सवनषठभजञनधकर">१४ स्वनिष्ठाभिज्ञानाधिकारः</h2>
<p>Swanistabhijnanadhikara</p>
<p>CHAPTER - XIV</p>
<p>Swanistabhijnanadhikara</p>
<p>A prapanna is one who is steadfast in the awareness of his own essential nature, which is different from non-sentient matter on one hand and the Supreme Paramatman on the other hand, who is the &lsquo;sarva-seshin&rsquo;, the siddhopaya and the supreme object of attainment. The understanding of these three namely the tattva, the hita and the purushartha should be firm and unshakable by any kind of perverse arguments in a prapanna. This awareness should be in him during all the time that he remains in this world after prapatri. This kind of steadfastness can be known from various factors that are significant signs showing that awareness. On account of the glory of this knowledge, the prapanna becomes capable of passing through the vast miseries that come across during the course of his life here. He will be capable of avoiding all kinds of unbecoming actions, such as seeking the grace of some one other than the Lord, worshipping those that are different from the Supreme Paramatman, studying the scriptures of other schools and thinking in vain of other things, etc.</p>
<p>These significant marks are to be realised by a prapanna. These are in one way the characteristics of a prapanna. In another aspect, they are &lsquo;sadhanas&rsquo; or disciplines that are to be cultivated and to be achieved by a prapanna. These marks are just like the marks of a &lsquo;stita-prajna or a &lsquo;gunacccta&rsquo; or a fervent devotee of the Lord. One can examine one self and find out, if he fulfills all these conditions to call himself as a prapanna. This shows the mental attitude of a prapanna, who is solely devoted to the Lord. If a prapanna has the following characteristics, he can know that he is steadfast in his essential nature: 1. When some one accuses him, and speaks of many faults,</p>
<p>one should realise that they do not relate to his essential nature, but only relate to the body and others, and so,</p>
<p>should be frec from sorrow or depression. 2. As pointed out in the verse 144466 4419 274-</p>
<p>f ord&rsquo;a person who abuses somcone, would be amassing sin for himself, and would be getting tainted with the sin of the abused&rsquo; - a prapanna should pity those people who abuse him and thus harm themselves</p>
<p>by getting his sin. 3. When someone abuses a prapanna, he should feel</p>
<p>grateful to the abuser, who will be reminding him of his faults plausible in him. &lsquo;Upakara-smriti&rsquo; or having a sense of being helped by him for thinking of his nature, as pointed by Yamuna in the stotra-ratna as 374416:</p>
<p>5: etc., and as expressed by Tirumangai Alwar in the verse &lsquo;I have grieved and grieved. All the faults are plausible in him, and the abuser has done a good service to him by making him remember his faults. A prapnna should be convinced of the fact that those that abuse him, are behaving so, only according to the will and prompting of the Supreme Paramatman, on account of his past karma as well as the past karma of the abuser. All people in this world are by their cssential nature, dependent on Paramatman and are all dominated by karma. So, anything done by anybody, is on account of one&rsquo;s own karma alone and therefore, a</p>
<p>Swanistabhijnanadhikara</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>prapanna should not become disturbed in his mind,</p>
<p>when he is ill-treated or abused or insulted by someone. 5. When somcbody humiliates a prapanna or abuses him,</p>
<p>that prapanna should feel rejoicement as he will be exhausting the store of his past karma (prarabdha), by being subject to such kind of humiliation.</p>
<p>If one will be thinking on these lines, he can understand that he is steadfast in his essential nature, as understood from the first word i.e. pranava&rsquo; and the second word viz. &lsquo;namas&rsquo; or the supreme mantra Ashtaksharam'. The dropped dative case on Akara' 3751 in the &lsquo;pranava&rsquo;, signifies the subservience of the jiva and the &lsquo;Makara&rsquo; Hot signifies that he is endowed with Sjnanam' or consciousness which is to be agreeable to all living beings. The second word &lsquo;namas&rsquo; signifies dependence on Paramatman, utter helplessness and wishing good of all, according to the will of Paramatman. He will be realising that he is subservient to and dependent upon the Paramatman alone, and he is to be used by the Supreme Paramatman, as He wills, and all these signify his essential nature and if a prapanna realises these things, he can know that he is steadfast in his essential nature.</p>
<p>Desika has described the characteristics of a person who is steadfast in the means of protection, he has adopted, in the following way: 1. When a person has entrusted the burden of his</p>
<p>protection totally to the Lord, he should have firm conviction that he, or any other person, is never his protector, even in the event of such causes of mortal fcar such as - illness, attack from beasts like tiger and others; even when there appears to be danger to his one</p>
<p>life, he should not be disturbed in his mind, but should have total faith in the saving grace of the Lord. There should not be any worry on his part about what would happen to him, after the fall of that body. On the other hand, he should rejoice that he would obtain the ultimate object of his life i.e. salvation from samsara. It is pointed out in the following verse that a person would be afraid of ‘mrityu' or death on account of not having done, what ought to have been done. That means, when he has done his duty of surrendering the burden of his protection to the Lord, and when He has received it with compassion, he would have no cares or worries about death. He would be eagerly waiting for death, as one would be waiting for a dear guest, a he has completed what he had to do. When he has thrown away the burden of his protection on the shoulders of the Supreme Paramatman, what else he has to do? प्रायेण अकृतकृत्यत्वात् मृत्योरुद्विजते जनः ।</p>
<p>कृतकृत्याः प्रतीक्षन्ते मृत्युं प्रियमिवातिथिम् ॥ 2. He should have complete faith in the Lord, to whom</p>
<p>he has entrusted the burden of his protection, and he should totally give up his effort in his protection, and he should not seek assistance from anyone other than the Supreme Paramatman. The example of Sita' is given to illustrate such total faith - when Sita was under the protection of the mighty arms of Sri Rama, she did not feel any fear or anxiety on seeing an elephant or a lion or a tiger in the forest. Sita says to Ravana, &ldquo;I do not reduce you to ashes by virtue of my might, on account of my vow of not making any self effort, and also on</p>
<p>Swanistabhijnanadhikara</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>account of the absence of any command from Sri Rama&rdquo;. Sita says to Hanuman as follows, when Hanuman made a suggestion that he would carry her across the occan to Sri Rama, &ldquo;If Sri Rama takes me out of this enemy city &lsquo;Lanka&rsquo; by overpowering this Lanks with his scorching arrows, and destroying the enemies, that would indeed be befitting to Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For averting all undesirables and for attaining all desirables, the Lord alone is capable and it is within his powers. If one who has surrendered the burden of his protection to the Lord, entertains total confidence in that Lord, and gives up all efforts of his for obtaining that object of desire, and if he realises that for all objects of his attainment, the Lord alone is the sole means of attainment, then one can understand that he is steadfast in the means of attainment he has adopted. This is prescribed in the former part of the Dvaya-Mantra, and the first half of the Charamasloka and the middle term &lsquo;namah&rsquo; in the Tinmantra'.</p>
<p>What are the characteristics of the person, who is steadfast in the s object of attainment or &lsquo;Parama Purushartha&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Desika describes them as follows:</p>
<p>A person, who has surrendered himself and the burden of his protection along with the fruit thereof, to the Lord, should not be worried with his &lsquo;Deha-yatra&rsquo; or course of his life in this world, as the course of his life is caused by the Lord, according to the karma of that individual that has commenced to give fruit. It is verily pointed out in the following verses thus – उत्पत्तिस्थिति नाशानां स्थितौ चिन्ता कुतस्तव । यथोत्पत्तिर्यथा नाशः स्थितिः तद्वद्भविष्यति ।।</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the three factors viz. birth, life and death, why are you ruminating over life itself? As origination and destruction happen, protection also happens&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wealth is going to choose one, who is sitting idle without doing any action; whereas a person who exerts a lot of effort, does not get even a little of water to drink - This points out that the &lsquo;Deha-yatra&rsquo; or daily course of life of a person, is destined according to his past karma, caused by the impartial Ishvara. So, a prapanna, who yearns for the ultimate object of attainment viz., moksha, should not worry for these trivial things.</p>
<p>Such a prapanna is advised to realise that all these earthly attainments are the results of the past karma and therefore his duty here is to follow strictly his dharma without any worry or anxiety. Even if one worries about such earthly benefits, he cannot get them, unless they are granted by the Lord. The following verses make this point clear:</p>
<p>उत्पतन्नपि चाकाशं विशन्नपि रसातलम् । अटन्नपि महीं कृत्स्नां नादत्तमुपतिष्ठते ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;even if you leap to the sky or if you enter the nether worlds or if you roam around the world., you shall not get what is not given to you&rdquo;.</p>
<p>यत्किंचित् वर्तते लोके सर्वं तन्मद्विचेष्टितम् ।</p>
<p>अन्यो ह्यन्यच्चिन्तयति स्वच्छन्दं विदधाम्यहम् ॥&ldquo;Swanistabhijnanadhikara</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever exists in this world, all that is caused by me; someone thinks of something else, but I ordain all that, according to my will&rdquo; – says the Lord.</p>
<p>375CM: HT: TERT: Patrici | प्रयत्नेनापि कर्तव्यः स्वधर्म इति मे मतिः ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;The objects of the world that come upon them without any effort, are to be experienced; but rendering supreme effort, one should protect dharma&rdquo;.</p>
<p>नाहारं चिन्तयेत् प्राज्ञः धर्ममेवानुचिन्तयेत् ।</p>
<p>आहारो हि मनुष्याणां जन्मना सह जायते ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wise man should not think of food; but he must think of dharma alone. Food comes here with his birth for all human beings&rsquo;</p>
<p>As mentioned in all these statements, a prapanna should experience those objects that come upon him without his effort, and that are not opposed to shastras, with the idea that the debt of &lsquo;prarabdha karma&rsquo; is getting cleared.</p>
<p>A prapanna should have utmost interest in the divine service of the Lord, which is the supreme object of attainment and he should not rejoice or grieve for having attained earthly happiness or sorrow. Just like a &lsquo;stitha-prajna&rsquo; he must have an equipoise of mind.</p>
<p>A prapanna of this nature cannot bear delay in attaining the supreme object of life viz., deliverance. If one has all these fulfilled in him, it can be underscood that he is steadfast in the &lsquo;Parama-Purusharta&rsquo; or the supreme object of life.</p>
<p>The dative case in the term &lsquo;Narayanaya&rsquo; in the Mulamantra, and the dvayamantra, and the term &lsquo;namas&rsquo;, and also the second half of charamasloka, all these are pointing to the supreme &lsquo;Purusharta&rsquo; as one points out with his finger a vast ocean.</p>
<p>The fruit or &lsquo;Parama-Phala&rsquo; of attainment of this kind of steadfastness in his essential nature, the upaya or means of salvation and parama-purusharta, are described as follows:</p>
<p>For such a prapanna, there will be nothing to fear other than offence towards a knower of Brahman and he will not entertain desire for anything other than &lsquo;svarupa-prapta kainkarya&rsquo; or service to the Lord, which will be according to his essential nature. He will be blessed with such a kind of noble attitude. He will neither rejoice in things that worldly people take delight, nor does he become afraid of things that cause fear to the worldly people. The example of Sita in Ashokavana is given to illustrate this point by Desika:</p>
<p>नैषा पश्यति राक्षस्यो नेमापुष्पफलद्रुमान् । एकस्थ हृदया नूनं राममेवानुपश्यति ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sita does not look at the demonesses that strike fear and terror, nor does she look at the flower-trees, fruit-trees that cause pleasure. Her heart is set on Rama alone, and she is visualising him alone&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Thus, a prapanna who is steadfast in his essential nature is neither disturbed on account of causes of fear nor pleased with causes of joy other than loving service, to the divine. Even in case one gets interested on account of his past reminiscent impressions, it will not have any effect on him.</p>
<p>When a prapanna is stationed in this world betwixt samsara and liberation by destiny caused by the Supreme</p>
<p>Swanistabhijnanadhikara</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>Lord, he will bear on his head &ldquo;the steadfastness in his essential nature etc.,&rdquo; that is granted by the Lord just as the ‘shesha-vastra’, and lead the rest of his life, being fulfilled in his aspirations.</p>
<p>This is similar to the state of a &lsquo;schita-prajna&rsquo; or a “jivan mukta' or a &lsquo;gunaatita&rsquo;. Desika states in Achyuta-Shataka' -</p>
<p>विषयरसेविरक्ताः विकारजननैरपि न खलु विक्रियमाणाः । जीवन्मुक्तसदृशाः अच्युत दृश्यन्ते पावनाः तव भक्ताः ॥</p>
<p>(Achyuta - Shataka - 47) O Lord, your devotees who are without any desire in the enjoyment of the objects of the senses, who never get detracted even by things that detract one are like Jivanmuktas, and they are holy and purifying others.</p>
<p>Thus in this chapter the behaviour of an ideal prapanna is expounded and the way in which the realisation of the knowledge of tattva, hita and purushartha should result in practice is shown.</p>
<h2 id="१५-उततरकतयधकर">१५ उत्तरकृत्याधिकारः</h2>

<p>CHAPTER - XV Uttarakrityadhikara</p>
<p>In this section, the duties that are to be performed by a prapanna, after prapatti, are pointed out for the guidance of those who have adopted the spiritual discipline of paraptti. A prapanna is bound to continue his life as destined by his past karma, and he has to follow a way of life that is in accordance with his nature. Just like a Jivanmuktha who is engaged in certain duties of life, so long as he is embodied, a prapanna also follows a course of action, which is befitting with his knowledge and aspiration. Though he has nothing to do for the sake of gaining moksha, he should not live an erratic life, so long as he is here. He must realise that he should lead a life divested of all sins, performing all the time the duties of his station in life, that have come upon him on account of his association with the body. His behaviour should be so ordained as that is &lsquo;swayam-prayojana&rsquo; self sufficient or has the purpose of carrying out the commands of Paramatman, to please Him alone. He should not yearn for any other gain nor should he be attached to anything other than what is in accordance with his essential nature of subservience to the Lord. He will keep himself free from transgressing the commands of the Lord, and follow a virtuous life setting an example to others</p>
<p>In the introductory verse of this section, Desika points out the duties to be performed after surrendering oneself to the Lord, as follows:</p>
<p>सन्तोषार्थं विमृशति मुहुः सद्भिरध्यात्मविद्यां नित्यं ब्रूते निशमयति च स्वादु सुव्याहतानि ।</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>अङ्गीकुर्वन्ननघललितां वृत्तिमादेहपातात् दृष्टादृष्टस्वभरविगमे दत्तदृष्टिः प्रपन्नः ।। He will again and again study and reflect over the truths of &lsquo;adhyathma-vidya&rsquo; i.e. the great Sri Bhashya as propounded by Bhagavan Ramanuja on the three foundational texts of vedanta for the purpose of deriving joy caused by the experience of the auspicious qualities of the Paramatman i.c., santhoshartham. As he has already completed his spiritual discipline and as he may not need the knowledge of this vedanta for adopting a spiritual means, he is advised to undertake such study for &lsquo;bhagavat kalyana-guna-anubhava&rsquo; or enjoying the auspicious qualities of the Supreme Paramatman, which itself is of supreme benefit. This study is to be undertaken along with those who are well versed in the truths expounded in Sri Bhashya and other works. Desika points out that this kind of study should be undertaken again and again so that he may be firmly established in that Supreme Paramatman. If one is not that capable as to go into the study of Sri Bhashya, he is advised to recite the nectar like hymns of the Alwars, such as Nammalwar and others. The soul stirring utterances of the God-intoxicated Alwars arc more pleasing to an aspirant to a greater extent than even the compositions of Parashara and others, as they are composed in the spoken language of the masses, understandable to all. This is to be undertaken as &lsquo;swayam-prayojana&rsquo; and these should be heard from teachers or taught to disciples.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Urtarakrityadhikara</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>A prapanna should follow the course of his life which is pious and godly, so long as he is placed here in this world, and he must always think that there is no responsibility of his, either in things that are perceived or those that are not perceived (drishta or adrishta); what is perceived here is going on according to his past karma and what is unseen, is in the hands of Paramatman, who has taken over the burden of his protection. So, he need not worry for anything at all.</p>
<p>Having summarised the main features of the post prapatti duties like this, Desika claborates these points with a number of illustrations. A prapanna, who is a &lsquo;kritakritya&rsquo;, and who has known his ‘nishta' or steadfastness, has in one way severed his relation with the world and in one way continuing the relationship with the world. He is here ordained to be for sometime, by the Lord, and whatever he acts should be &lsquo;swayam-prayojana&rsquo; or for the sole purpose of pleasing the Lord, just like the loving service of the liberated which is most pleasing to them.</p>
<p>He will be practising here divine service, which he will be blessed with, after the fall of his body here.</p>
<p>All his actions should be for the pleasure of the Lord alone, and not for any gain, worldly or otherworldly.</p>
<p>The Alwars have given expression to the intense love for the Lord that the devotee has for the Supreme Paramatman, and they are illustrative of the behaviour or a prapanna who spends sometime in this world before attaining his eternal service in the Supreme Abode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spent my time in study of scriptures and in listening ro those great texts like Sri Bhashyam and others, serving Him in a humble manner, worshipping Him day in and day out, without wasting my time&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remembering the utterances of the seers that are admixed with the auspicious qualities of the Lord, I got rid of my immense sorrow, caused by sins in this world. If they do not get rid of their sins and miseries like this, how can they spend their time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must render our selfless service firmly in all states to that Supreme Paramatman alone, in all places&rdquo;.</p>
<p>These and others such statements of the spiritual saints show how one should spend his time in this world, till he attains the eternal abode of the Supreme Paramatman.</p>
<p>Such a prapanna should not desire for any gain other than the grace of the Lord and blissful service to Him. When he is performing promptly the duties of his station in life i.e. varnashrama-dharma, he should not have any sense of his supremacy and excellence over others that he has been very righteous. He must have a feeling of utter humility, and he must realise that he is totally at the disposal of that Supreme Paramatman always.</p>
<p>&lsquo;पत्युः प्रजानामैश्वर्यं पशूनां वा न कामये&rsquo;</p>
<p>He must not aspire for the glory of either Prajapati or Rudra, while going through the routine disciplines related to his duties in life. He must approach people who are knowledgeable for solving the doubts he may have regarding his duties.</p>
<p>He should have no disregard regarding things that he does not know under the pretext of &lsquo;kritakritya&rsquo;. As knowledge and devotion are ever necessary, he should pray</p>
<p>CO</p>
<p>Uttarakrityadhikara</p>
<p>165</p>
<p>to the Lord to grant him devotion towards Him and knowledge regarding His nature. This prayer for Jnana and Bhakti will serve the purpose of great joy regarding the Supreme Paramatman, who is his Sheshin.</p>
<p>The following statements substantiate their state of life:</p>
<p>वर्तमानः सदा चैवं पाचकालिकवर्त्मना । स्वार्जितैः गन्धपुष्पाद्यैः शुभैः शक्त्यनुरूपतः ।। आराधयन् हरिं भक्त्या गमशिष्यामि वसारान् ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being a follower of the path of the five-fold duties (Panchakalika-karma), I shall worship with supreme devotion that Supreme Lord with flowers, sandal and other articles of worship earned by me and according to my ability. I shall serve Him alone, and pass the days.&rdquo; - A person should not beg of the Supreme Paramatman - Maha-Vishnu - anything other than devotion towards His feet and supreme knowledge of His nature. If he begs thus, he will certainly get destroyed!</p>
<p>तत्पादभक्तिज्ञानाभ्यां फलमन्यत्कदाचन । न याचेत्पुरुषो विष्णुं याचनानश्यति ध्रुवम् ॥</p>
<p>A person who has unburdened himself of the responsibility of his protection, should practise divine service here which will be a kind of probation for the eternal service of the Lord, when he attains the Supreme Abode, after the fall of his body. Tirumalizai Alwar exults that he spent his time usefully by studying the shastras for his atma-dharana, gecting instructions from the Acharyas, offering obeisance to the Acharyas, and leading the life in a virtuous way and worshipping with supreme love the Lord of all (Thiruvandadi 63).</p>
<p>Nammalwar says &ldquo;what I pray you, O Lord! is that you should accept me solely for your sake alone&rdquo; (Thiruvoimoli 9.2.4).</p>
<p>Periyalwar says &lsquo;there will be no hunger for me on days that I may not dine, but they are really fasting days causing pain on which days, I do not utter always your holy names, on days on which I do not worship you with flowers reciting the vedic hymns&rsquo;. (Periyalvar Thirumoli 5-1-6).</p>
<p>Poigai Alwar says &ldquo;my mouth does not praise any one other than my Supreme Lord. My hands do not venerate any one other than the Lord. My eyes do not witness anything other than the charming beauty of the Lord Krishna. My ears do not hear any vain talk, but only the sacred names of the Lord. I do not desire for others wealth. I do not mix with the lowly. I always move with the noble and exalted. I do not consider anyone other than the Supreme Narayana as the Supreme Deity. How can any sin occur to me?&rdquo; (Mudal Thiruvandadi-11).</p>
<p>Desika has profusely quoted from the hymns of the mystic Alwars to show the ways of post-prapatti-duties in this section. It bec&hellip;nes established from all these that a prapanna will lead a supremely devoted life that is always full of divine consciousness and devotes his period of stay here to the loving service of Paramatman.</p>
<p>Other post-prapatti-duties that are pointed out in this section by Desika, may be sunmarised as below: 1. A prapanna should approach his preceptors and gain</p>
<p>enlightenment as regards the truths that he has not</p>
<p>Uttarakrityadhikara</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>known. He should not be indifferent or disinterested in gaining such knowledge on the pretext that he is a kritakritya. It is ordained that at any state of life, even in his last stage of life, one should seek knowledge of</p>
<p>Paramatman and devotion towards His fect. 2. A prapanna should seek the company of pious and</p>
<p>godly people, who are well established in divine experience and devotion to Lord. The very glances of</p>
<p>such pious people purify all sins. 3. A prapanna is ordained to perform the duties of his</p>
<p>station in life i.e. varnashrama-dharma, sincerely</p>
<p>according to his ability. 4. A prapanna should be very careful regarding his</p>
<p>conduct in this world. Never should he think of himself as superior to others. He should be always humble in his attitude and should consider himself as lowest of the low. He should not also think of others as inferiors full of defects. He should tread his path in this world very carefully, being divested of &lsquo;ahankara&rsquo; and &lsquo;mamakara&rsquo; on account of his attainments. A prapanna should always remember his &lsquo;akinchanatva&rsquo; or utter helplessness though he has gained his salvation by the grace of the Lord. He must always reflect on the following lines -</p>
<p>अहमसम्यपराधानां आलयोऽकिञ्चनोऽगतिः</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the home of all offences and I am utterly helpless. I am without any support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Nammalvar says &ldquo;I have not performed karmayoga and others. I have no knowledge of atman. But yet, I know nobody other than yourself for saving me. You are the only goal for me.&rdquo; (Thiruvoimoli 5.7.1)</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do? Who is to save me? What are you going to do with me? I know nobody other than yourself.&rdquo; (Thiruvoimoli 5.8.3) . A number of such statements of the Mystic seers, make it clear that this mode of Cakinchanya' should be reflected upon.</p>
<p>When one has performed prapatti, and won the grace of the Lord, he should not brood over the past and get dejected on account of the unfitness he had from beginningless time. When the Lord has granted him refuge and when all his past sins have been divested of him by the grace of the Lord, he should not grieve over his past; but, feel solace that he has got rid of all that by the grace of the Lord and so he should engage with all ferver in loving service of the Lord. 6. A prapanna should subdue his sense organs and engage</p>
<p>them in the loving service of the Lord. The duties of his varna and ashrama that are performed, should be done purely for pleasing the Lord and not for any other benefit. The shastras should be strictly followed, but never for attaining any other benefit. A prapanna should engage himself in the divine service of the ‘archa' incarnation of the Lord, so long as he is stationed in this world. He should have the idea that the Lord himself is fully present in the Archa, and that the very worship of the Lord would free one from all great sins and sub-sins. When one has a vision of the Lord in archa-form all kinds of illusions and erroneous</p>
<p>Uttarakrityadhikara</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>ev</p>
<p>impressions through various causes get totally destroyed. The Lord says in the Gita that he would show himself to his devotees in the very same form through which he will be worshipping Him. One should with great love and affection worship the Lord in the Archa-form.</p>
<p>It is pointed out here by Desika that this kind of worship should be rendered with articles of worship that are earned by a righteous way (Nyayarjita).</p>
<p>In the end, it is pointed out that a prapanna should ever be full of gratitude towards his preceptor and towards the Supreme Paramatman, who is the general cause of everything in this universe. Desika points out that a prapanna should note what should be discarded mainly and what should be entertained mainly - 1. What one should discard totally is &lsquo;vishaya-swada&rsquo; or</p>
<p>experience of the sense objects. 2. One should discard totally &lsquo;atmotkarsha&rsquo; or his own</p>
<p>celebrity 3. The most dangerous offence viz. offence towards</p>
<p>knowers of Brahman, is to be totally discarded. What one has to entertain always is as follows: The supreme benefaction done by the Acharya beginning with the &lsquo;prathama-kataksha&rsquo; or primary look of compassion and showing the pathway of salvation. And the most important duty that is to be done is service to the Lord culminating in the loving service to the Bhagavathas such as Acharya and others. 2.</p>
<p>It is ordained that one should reflect on the inescable relationship of himself with the Supreme Paramatman everyday, in the supreme Mulamantra as a lover would see herself and the reflection of her lover in a cleaned mirror. The jiva who is signified by the term &lsquo;Ma&rsquo; enjoys the vision of Paramatman signified by the letter Aa', as seen in the mirror, when that lover appears before her and the dative case of the term &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo; implies that he is subservient only to that Supreme Narayana and not for himself. Thus, the truths expounded in this chapter, are to be reflected in the Mulamantra.</p>
<h2 id="१६-परषरथकषठधकर">१६ पुरुषार्थकाष्ठाधिकारः</h2>
<p>171</p>
<p>CHAPTER - XVI</p>
<p>Purushartakastadhikara</p>
<p>In this section, it is expounded that service unto the preceptors and the godly ones, the Bhagavantas, that is ordained in the shastras, is the culmination of &lsquo;bhagavat kainkarya&rsquo; or loving service unto the Supreme Lord. It is pointed out that his subservience to the Lord, results in his subservience to the devotees of the Lord also, on account of the very will of that Supreme Lord, who is the Master of all, and who is the one independent Reality who can ordain all others to follow his commandments. He is capable of commanding his dependents to be subservient to His own devotees, who are supremely dear to him. As it is pointed out in the statement &lsquo;T G 46 TAYTAY Grafy falsa:&rsquo; which means &ldquo;my devotees and their devotees are to be worshipped with all regard.&rdquo; Such kind of service to the godly ones, pleases the Lord immensely and it is His supreme intention.</p>
<p>As the nityas and muktas render loving service unto the Supreme Paramatman by directly knowing His wish and cause Him delight, a prapanna who is a kritakritya is required to know the intention of the Lord through the shastras and render loving service unto Him so long as he is placed in this world. When one ponders over the wish of the Lord it is understood that service unto the Bhagavatas is most pleasing to Him.</p>
<p>Of the four objects of life the supreme purushartha is the attainment of Paramatman or Supreme Brahman. The liberated enjoys in full measure the bliss of Divine communion. The Upanishads, the Gita as well as the Bramhasutras expound that the mukta gains parama samya or equality with Brahman. &lsquo;I RUR&rsquo; | The Alwars describe that the highest object of attainment is the attainment of cternal service to the Lord. It is explained by masters that the ecstasy of divine communion overflows in the form of loving service to the Lord. Bhagavan Ramanuja mentions in the gadya that the highest object of attainment is Nityakainkarya - Ary T &lsquo;, &lsquo;Art fotoatt hafa&rsquo; This Bhagavat kainkarya extends upto Bhagavata kainkarya. 1. It is understood from a number of scriptural authorities,</p>
<p>that service unto the devotees of the Lord is the</p>
<p>abhimata&rsquo; or desire of the Lord. &lsquo;Of all worships, the worship of Lord Vishnu is greater; but, greater than the worship of Lord Vishnu, is the worship of the Bhagavatas or the godly ones. आराधनानां सर्वेषां विष्णोराराधनं परम् । तस्मात्परतरं प्रोक्तं तदीयाराधनं परम्।</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have great affection towards the devotees of my devotees. Therefore, one should render significant service to the devotees of my devotees&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;मम मद्भक्त भक्तेषु प्रीतिरभ्यधिकाभवेत् । तस्मात् मद्भक्तभक्ताश्च पूजनीया विशेषतः&rdquo;।</p>
<p>The Lord says &ldquo;In whomsocver there is devotion which is of the folowing eight forms, even if he is of the lowest birth, he is to be considered as a great Brahmin, a muni, one who has conquered over his senses, a learned man, to him should be given supreme knowledge and from him should one gather knowledge. He is verily worshipful as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Purushartakastadhikara</p>
<p>173</p>
<p>The eight-fold devotion mentioned above, are as follows: 1. Affection towards my devotees 2. Supporting my worship 3. Supreme love in hearing my divine sports 4. Experiencing with ecstasy my divine actions, shedding</p>
<p>tears of joy, speaking in a choking tone 5. Making an effort to worship me 6. Avoiding any kind of show in relations with me 7. Remembering me incessantly 8. Not exploiting me for maintaining his livelihood.</p>
<p>मद्भक्तजनवात्सल्यं पूजायां चानुमोदनम् । मत्कथाश्रवणे भक्तिः स्वरनेत्राङ्ग विक्रिया ॥ स्वयमाराधने यत्नः ममार्थे डम्भवर्जनम् । ममानुस्मरणं नित्यं यच्च मां नोपजीवति ॥ भक्तिरष्टविधा ह्येषा यस्मिन् म्लेच्छेपिवर्तते । तस्मै देयं ततो ग्राह्यम् स च पूज्यो यथा ह्यहम् ॥</p>
<p>Loving service unto the Bhagavatas, is verily stated to be service unto the Lord himself. A person who has understood the supreme nature of Paramatman, realises that the Lord himself is the innerself in all. He realises that the worship he renders to the Bhagavatas, is really worship to the Supreme Lord himself.</p>
<p>सर्वभूतान्तरात्मानं विष्णुमेव यजन्ति ते ।</p>
<p>As regards a &lsquo;paramaikanti&rsquo; or a supreme devotee who has realised the Paramatman alone as his &lsquo;upaya&rsquo; and &lsquo;upeya&rsquo;, 22</p>
<p>the Lord considers him to be his own self., as he says &lsquo;ज्ञानीत्वात्मैव मे मतम्&rsquo;। So, the intention of the Lord is that the devotee is his own self and so any service done to the Bhagavatas pleases immensely the Supreme Paramatman.</p>
<p>Subservience to the Bhagavatas is of two kinds viz. directly and indirectly. As the Lord happens to be having the devotee as his &lsquo;sheshin&rsquo;, so &lsquo;sheshatva&rsquo; is direct and indirect. So even his service to the Bhagavata will be both direct and indirect. The Bhagavan has &lsquo;Bhaktadvara Sheshitva&rsquo; and so this is &lsquo;sadvaraka&rsquo; or indirect also.</p>
<p>The subservience to the Lord, culminates in sub servience to the Bhagavatas, according to the intention of the most Supreme Paramatman.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord can command his devotees to subserve anyone, according to his pleasure. He makes his devotees serve other devotees according to His desire. Tiruppanalvar says &ldquo;The Lord has made me subservient to his ardent devotees.&rdquo; A king has freedom to adorn his subordinates or his elephant or horse with the garlands and ornaments that he wears. What devotees pray for is that they should attain subservience of those that are subservient to the Lord. So, this kind of fitness to be ucilised according to the desire of the Lord is eternal and so, Bhagavata-seshatva is the culmination of Bhagavat-seshatva.</p>
<p>Subservience to the Bhagavaras is actualised in two ways - firstly, on account of the fact of their being Bhagavatas and as such subservience to the devotees is desirable to the Lord. This is &lsquo;swarupa-prayukta&rsquo;. Secondly, this kind of subservience to the Bhagavatas, may happen on account of the knowledge related to the virtues of such a</p>
<p>Purushartakastadhikara</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>Bhagavata. This is resulting out of one&rsquo;s own free will. As Lakshmana said &lsquo;गुणैः दास्यं उपागतः&rsquo; - as a younger brother to Rama, he was subscrvient to him by nature; on account of the auspicious qualities of Rama, Lakshmana became subservient to him by his own desire. This subservience to Bhagavatas reaches such a level that one considers oneself as disposable by the Bhagavatas, according to their will.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;dasatva&rsquo; that is evolved with love towards the Lord on account of the auspicious qualities of the Lord as well as in respect of the Bhagavatas will be the cause of ever enhancing joy. The Lord causes &lsquo;Sheshitva&rsquo; to all Bhagavatas by virtue of his independent will. To these Bhagavatas he causes &lsquo;Bhagavata sheshatva&rsquo; also according to their desire. They attain &lsquo;Sheshitva&rsquo; by virtue of becoming worthy of being disposed of by the Lord according to His will. They attain their purushartha to the maximum limit as the &lsquo;Bhagavata Sheshatva&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bhagavata Kainkaryam&rsquo; desired by</p>
<p>them become fully realised.</p>
<p>The Lord becomes highly pleased by making these devotees mutually sheshas and sheshins. By this the Lord attains &lsquo;Ishvaratva&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bhoktrutvam&rsquo;. As these devotees realise that this kind of sheshatva and sheshitva that they have gained is subservient to the bhoktrutva of the Lord, they will have realised the culmination of thier &lsquo;Purashartha&rsquo;</p>
<p>Periyalwar expresses that the Bhagavatas are authorised to sell or purchase him, as he is totally subservient to them.</p>
<p>A question may be asked whether the Bhagavata Sheshatva is &lsquo;swabhavika&rsquo; or an aspect of his essential nature or &lsquo;oupadhika&rsquo; or conditional. It may be said that this is natural to the jivatman, as this continues even in the state of 1</p>
<p>release for all time to come as pointed out in the statement &lsquo;farantiaisa Tc+4 tahdi&rsquo; etc. Similarly, this is conditional also, as it is on account of the particular awareness of their relationship with Supreme Paramatman &lsquo;भगवत् संबन्ध ज्ञानविशेष निबन्धनम्।</p>
<p>When the Bhagavatas are subservient to the Lord and as Bhagavatha-Seshatva is common to all, if one is considered as &lsquo;seshin&rsquo; and in the same way he also considers the other as his &lsquo;seshin&rsquo; i.e. if this relationship is mutual, will it not be contradictory? How can one be a seshin and a sesha at the same time?</p>
<p>Desika points out that there is no contradiction in this mutual relationship. According to the will of the Lord, this will be mutually subsisting for the excellence of each other. This kind of subservience or &lsquo;dasatva&rsquo; which happens on account of the love of the Lord, is the cause of supreme joy to both. Dasatvam or subservience, in respect of the Paramatman and in respect of the Bhagavatas, is a source of supreme bliss. All this is desired by the most Supreme Paramatman and he enjoys immensely by ruling over the devotees in this manner. All this is subservient to the experience of the Supreme Paramatman.</p>
<p>The Purusharta kashta or the ultimate limit of the supreme object of life to be attained, is thus described as Bhagavara-Shesarva and a kritakritya who has entrusted the burden of his protection to the Lord, will lead his life devoted to the service of the Lord and his devotees.</p>
<p>He lives a life of self abnegation which will be a graceful gift granted to him by the Lord, and he considers that all this will be only for the pleasure of the Lord.</p>

<p>CHAPTER - XVII</p>
<p>Shastriya Niyamanadhikara</p>
<p>It was said in the previous section that a Prapanna would abide by the Shastras that ordain certain duties. But, a number of doubts arise in this behalf. The Prapanna is not required to do the (duties of the) nitya and naimitthika karmas as an accessory to Bhakti-Yoga or Praptti, as he has performed what ought to be done and is similar to a Mukta. He does not need the direction of the Shastras, as he is required to do &lsquo;svayam-prayojana-kainkarya&rsquo;, loving service to the Lord and the devotees of the Lord, as svayam prayojana. Statements like &lsquo;enceint: gai hach&rsquo;, &lsquo;risa Picshig&rsquo; declare that a Prapanna has no duties to perform. The Sruti and the Smrithi are certainly binding on those who are not Prapannas. &lsquo;31644: geta a&rsquo; &lsquo;Farby a 18441647:&rsquo; and other such authorities support this view. The great Bhashyakara also has not mentioned the performance of the pancha-maha-yajnas and others as post-prapatti duties amongst the others such as the study and propagation of Sri Bhashya and others. All these doubts are dispelled in this scction.</p>
<p>The Introductory verse sums up the subject matter of this section.</p>
<p>मुकुन्दे निक्षिप्य स्वभरमनघो मुक्तवदसौ स्वतन्त्राज्ञासिद्धां स्वयमविदितस्वामिहृदयः । परित्यागे सद्यस्स्वपरविविधानर्थजननात्</p>
<p>अलंघ्यां आमोक्षादनुसरति शास्त्रीय सरणिम् ॥ &ldquo;Having placed the burden of his protection on the Lord Mukunda he is just like a liberated one. He cannot know directly the intention of the Lord as he is yet embodied. In abandoning the path of the shastras, that is of the form of the commandment of the Supreme Lord he will be causing many hazards to himself as well as others and so he will obey the dictates of the shastras till he is liberated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Prapannadhikari who is associated with a body commenced on account of his prarabdha karmas and belonging to a particular varna and asrama, subjected to the performance of the respective duties, is verily like a liberated one, though contacting that body. Having entrusted the burden of his protection to the Lord, he is similar to a liberated one. He is to devote himself to the service of the Lord. As he is yet with the body, he cannot know the will of the Lord directly, and so has to know his intention only from the shastras. If he gives up the duties of his station in life, he will be causing 3778 to himself and others.</p>
<p>The untoward that happens to him, will be of the form of punishments meted out by the Lord, as pointed out in</p>
<p>3-ETHER&rsquo;, 1091 492&rsquo; etc. Others follow his behaviour and he will be causing great disturbance that way. So, a prapanna who continues here with the body with which he is associated, follows as long as he is in this world, the command of the shastras. He will be deprived of the love of the Lord, if he transgresses his command.</p>
<p>एवं विलंघयन् मो मर्यादा वेदनिर्मिताम् । प्रियोऽपि न प्रियोऽसौ मे मदाज्ञाव्यतिवर्तनात् ॥'</p>
<p>Shastriya Niyamanadhikara</p>
<p>179</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man who transgresses the command of the shastra though dear to me will not become dear on account of going against the shastra&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Though he is a Kritakritya, though he is pure and sinless, though he is steadfast in his essential nature bereft of the limitations of varna and asrama, yet he is in contact with a body characterised by varna and asrama, and so he is obliged to abide by the canons of the shastra.</p>
<p>For a person, who is in this world, contacting prakriti which blindfolds one&rsquo;s understanding, the shastra alone is a beacon light, which shows the right path to be tread by him, and so he is to be necessarily guided by the shastra. Where cver an option is given by the shastra, he can choose a path according to his intention,</p>
<p>Sri Desika quotes an episode here. At the time of Sri Bhashyakar&rsquo;s departure from the body, the disciples were very much dejected and thought of following their preceptor by giving up their bodies. Seeing this, Sri Ramanuja said that those who ventured to give up their lives on his account, would not have any relationship with him and swore on the sacred feet of Sri Yamuna. When they said what they could do here in this world, Ramanuja, is said to have advised them thus:</p>
<p>When a person has surrendered himself and the burden of his protection unto the Lord, he should realise that he has nothing to do in respect of his Arma-Yathra', as that depends upon the Lord. If he thinks, he has also something to do in that respect, the surrender of himself becomes a myth and unreal. His day to day life, so long as he is here, is regulated by his past-karmas and he has nothing to worry about that. If he worries, he will be a nastika or a disbeliever of the shastras. Thus, though he has severed his responsibility with the means of attainment of Godhead, he has to engage himself with acts of divine service which is the ultimate object of his attainment.</p>
<p>Sri Ramanuja has outlined the five-fold kainkarya that he can do here, so long as he is placed in this world, as follows: 1. To study and propagate Sri Bhashyam. 2. If he is unable to do so, he may study the soul-stirring</p>
<p>hymns of the Alwars, who were immersed in intense divine experience and propagate them. If one cannot do that also, he may serve the Lord, who is ever showing himself in the Holy places by raising flower gardens for worship of the Lord or lighting lamps, or offering articles of worship and such divine</p>
<p>services. 4. If one cannot do this also, he may recite always the</p>
<p>‘Dvaya-mantra' reflecting upon its meanings. 5. Even if this also is not possible, he may take shelter</p>
<p>under the benign grace of a Sreevaishnava, having deep devotion towards him,</p>
<p>If one is capable, one is urged to follow all these modes of divine service and spend one&rsquo;s time here with constant awareness of the Supreme Paramatman. Such a person, will be gratified on account of the supreme joy and satisfaction he derives from these noble services,</p>
<p>Shastriya Niyamanadhikara</p>
<p>181</p>
<p>A Prapanna has to behave carefully in this world, as related to three classes of people with whom he comes into contact. They are people who are Anukula' (favourable); &lsquo;Pratikula&rsquo; (unfavourable) or &lsquo;Udasina&rsquo; (neutral) who are neither favourable or unfavourable. The favourable are those who arc Srivaishnavas that are ardent devotecs of the Lord. The haters of God, are, thc unfavourable ones. Those who are neither, are neutrals. One must feel enjoyed in the company of favourable ones as one rejoices to have fragrant flowers, sandalpaste and the cool moonlight. One should fear to be in the company of the unfavourablc ones, as one fears a serpent and other poisonous creatures. Those who are neither of these, should be counted as a piece of straw. It is to be known that bchaving otherwise with these people, is only on counts of artha' and &lsquo;kama&rsquo;. The Lord will be displeased if the devotees of the Lord are humiliated and the haters of the Lord are venerated. The intention of the Lord is that one should not even on counts of &lsquo;artha&rsquo; and &lsquo;kama&rsquo; treat them otherwise than they are worthy.</p>
<p>Association with the ungodly people and non-believers will adversely affect the devotces of the Lord. So, one should never choose their company. This code of behaviour can be known only from the shastras and the different modes of service unto the Lord and the devotces of the Lord, should be performed only according to the shastras. That which is not in accordance with the shastra is declared to be ‘asura' and so one should follow the commands of the shastra, which are verily the commands of the Lord.</p>
<p>अविप्लवाय धर्माणां पालनाय कुलस्य च । संग्रहाय च लोकस्य मर्यादा स्थापनाय च ॥ ferg 49 faite dacaa FUT: मनीषी वैदिकाचारं मनसपि न लवयेत् ॥</p>
<p>A wiseman should never transgress the code of conduct prescribed by the shastras, even mentally, for the following reasons: 1. The codes of conduct should not get destroyed. 2. He should protect the prestige of his ‘kula' or family. 3. He must give a proper lead to the people of the world. 4. He should establish a righteous order. 5. He must please the Lord Vishnu.</p>
<p>If there is any transgression, it displeases the Lord and if he does not pray for forgiveness, he will be subjected to some punishment or other, before he departs from the body. There cannot be a greater punishment to a devotee, a satvika, than losing the affection and love of the Lord. This kind of &lsquo;आज्ञातिलंघन&rsquo; is an obstruction to the natural flow of love of the Lord and this is to be reflected in &lsquo;Namah&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ma-shuchah&rsquo; of the three mantras. This kind of compliance with the shastras will avert the obstructions for attainment of purushartha and wins the grace of the Lord.</p>
<p>आज्ञानुज्ञाविभागेन द्विधा शास्त्रीयपद्धतिः । निग्रहानुदयायाद्या परा तत्तत्फलामये ।। अनुज्ञया प्रवृत्तेऽपि क्रमकोपादि संभवे ।</p>
<p>आज्ञातिक्रमदोषस्स्यात् नियमोऽतो दुरत्ययः ||</p>
<p>The code of the shastras is two-fold viz. (1) those that are commanded and (2) those that are permitted. The</p>
<p>Shastriya Niyamanadhikara</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>compliance of the former will avoid the wrath of the Lord. The latter is followed for obtaining the respective benefits. Even when one is engaging in the latter, he has to follow the code prescribed by the Shastra. If not followed, he will be displeasing the Lord. It is not obligatory for all to undertake the permitted karmas. One will not get those benefits, if they are not done. But, the commanded duties are to be performed to avoid the displeasure of the Lord, though they are not meant for obtaining some benefits.</p>
<p>So, it is ordained here that a Prapanna has to abide by the rules of the Shastra, so long as he is stationed in this world.</p>
<h2 id="१८-अपरध-परहरधकर">१८ अपराध-परिहाराधिकारः</h2>
<p>185</p>
<p>CHAPTER - XVIII</p>
<p>Aparadhapariharadhikara</p>
<p>In this section, it is expounded that a Prapanna who commits some faults willingly, impelled by his past karmas or on account of certain spacial and temporal conditions or on account of his inadvertence, has to repent for his faults and pray forgiveness of the Lord, failing which, he would be subjected to some punishments by the Lord. A Prapanna is, therefore, warned to be very careful regarding his behaviour in this world, where he is destined to live till he is liberated from the body. It is also pointed out that one who has surrendered the burden of his protection to the Lord, is sure to obtain his desired object viz., attainment of Godhead, culminating in loving eternal service to the Lord, after being thus purified.</p>
<p>In the introductory verse it is pointed out that even after attaining the purifying Ganga of the form of compassion of Sri Madhava, which is opposed to all that is defiling, most enjoyable, the purifier of all sins, the means of attainment of all desired objects, if one becomes tainted with sins, the virtuous will not be associate with him.</p>
<p>स्वच्छस्वादुसदावदातसुभगां दैवादयं देहभृत् मालिन्यप्रशमाय माधवदयामन्दाकिनी विन्दति । यद्यप्येवमसौ असारविषयस्रोतप्रसूतैः पुनः पढेरेव कलंकयन् निजतनुं प्राज्ञैः न संश्लिष्यते ।</p>
<p>When a person has attained the mercy of the Lord, on account of his total surrender unto Him, normally he will not transgress the command of the Lord, and will not indulge in petty means for attainment of worldly benefits; but, yet on account of his prarabdha-karma, if he were to indulge in unbecoming things, he will not be contacted by wise people. Offences that are done intentionally, do not happen, as a general case in such people, who have realised their subservience to the Lord, and who are taking delight in the service of the Lord, according to the shastras. If some sins happen to him on account of prarabdha-karma, without his intention, they will not taint him, as in the case of an &lsquo;upasaka&rsquo;. If sins happen to him, being done intentionally, he has to perform an expiation for becoming free from that offence, and the expiation here, is to surrender unto the Lord again for the purpose of forgiving his offence. This &lsquo;prayaschitta&rsquo; or expiation is not for gaining moksha, because that has been done already and the burden of his protection, has already been taken over by the Lord. It is ordained in the shastras that when a Prapanna happens to commit some offence, he should pray for excuse in the form of another surrender unto the Lord. If a Prapanna adopts some other &lsquo;upaya&rsquo;, like karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga willingly after having surrendered for moksha, even then he has to perform an expiation of the form of surrender for excusing that offence. He must feel repentance and shame for having committed the fault intentionally.</p>
<p>अपायसंप्लवे सद्यः प्रायश्चित्तः समाचरेत् । प्रायश्चित्तिरियं सात्र यत्पुनः शरणं व्रजेत् ॥ उपायानामुपायत्वस्वीकारेप्येतदेवहि ॥</p>
<p>This additional Prapatti is not for the purpose of attaining moksha but only for forgiving the fault committed</p>
<p>Aparadhapariharadhikara</p>
<p>187</p>
<p>intentionally. What happens if one commits an offence intentionally and does not perform this expiation? Mild punishment, similar to the punishment given to the princes and others will be meted out by the Lord and they will be purified and then taken over to his side. Just like an offence that is to be cleared by striking with a weapon, is got over by the pricking of a thorn. The serious offence that is willingly done, and not prayed for forgiveness, will be cleared by the Lord, by making them suffer in this world in various ways, before they pass out of the body purified to reach His eternal abode. All this happens on account of the grace of the Lord, who never forsakes one who has surrendered unto Him. It is, therefore, necessary to be very careful regarding one&rsquo;s course of life here after prapatti, and be vigilant not to commit any offence intentionally. If some offence occurs on account of past karmas, in spite of one&rsquo;s vigilance, it is wise to feel shamc, repent, desist from such action further and to perform a prapatti, a second prapatti for forgiving that offence.</p>
<p>Sometime, it is asked whether one can perform a &ldquo;prayaschitta-prapatti' even before the offences occur, so that the Lord may not punish one, for such commissions. The answer to this question is that performing an expiation or prayaschitta, does not arise when the offence is not actually committed. In view of some offences that are anticipated in future, one cannot perform an expiation. But, at the time of performing prapatti for moksha, one may include in that prapatti itself, that he may be granted &lsquo;Niraparadha Kainkarya&rsquo; i.e., a course of life after prapatti, where no offences occur. If a prayer for service to the Lord not tainted with offences is included in the prayer for protection of his self at the time of self-surrender, he will not be liable to commit the offences intentionally.</p>
<p>It is sometime argued that one need not seck for any forgiveness of the Lord, even in the case of intentional offences that are committed by one, as the Lord has given an assurance &lsquo;सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि&rsquo; | It is also said that the Lord may not punish one even in case of intentional sins done by one. Some say that there would be no delay in attainment of godhead and eternal service of the Lord for those who cannot bear delay.</p>
<p>Vedanta Desika says that all these different propositions are made for extolling the auspicious qualities of the Lord and the greatness of Prapatti. But, these are all contrary to the practices of the ancient scers, who surrendered unto the Lord, and to the shastras that ordain expiations for getting rid of the bad effects of intentional offences and to the Shastras that point out that there will be delay in attaining the final fruit of Prapatti viz., attainment of Paramatman, in respect of those who have committed intentional sins and have not performed the expiations. The statement &lsquo;Haylaz Ha f ' &lsquo;is a general assurance; but, it does not clear the offences done intentionally, because, there is a particular reference in respect of surrendering again as an expiation for intentional sins as wefefafi HE AFYA: YU I</p>
<p>This is an expiation which occurs after Prapatti. It cannot be said that this second surrender prescribes the removal of intentional sins done after Prapatti, in the case of those who have not done prapatri carlier for SIGYCTERIE also, because, there is no authority that prescribes that oneAparadhapariharadhikara</p>
<p>189</p>
<p>can perform a surrender earlier even for intentional sins that may occur after Praparti. If the statement that the surrender that is made to the Lord is enough to remove the intentional sins also done after Prapatti, there will be no scope at all for the statement prescribing a second Prapatti, Then, according to the same analogy, the intentional sins that are done by an upasaka also will have to be taken as ineffective. But, the Brahmasutras have expressly mentioned that the past accumulated sins will vanish and the sins that occur unintentionally afterwards will not taint one. So, the shastra that enjoins a second Prapatti, is valid and the general statement &lsquo;सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि&rsquo; does not cover the intentional sins done after Prapatti.</p>
<p>If it is asked then, how a light punishment will be given for intentional offences done after Praptti, it is answered that the infliction of punishment differs from person to person on counts of his caste, his qualities and the &lsquo;ashrama&rsquo; or state of life. The heavy punishment that is given to an offender will not be given to a prince. He will be punished lightly and that would be enough to reform him. The Lord favours a Prapanna, and never deprives him of the main object of his prayer viz. liberation from samsara. But, sets him right, when he approaches Him with repentance for forgiveness. &lsquo;लघुर्दण्डः प्रपन्नस्य राजपुत्रापराधवत्&rsquo; ।।</p>
<p>For giving a proper lead to the people of the world, people who are celebrated are also punished lightly when they commit offences. It cannot be asked whether one can perform a Prapatti for excusing the sins that are done intentionally after Prapatti, just as the question of performing upasana for the faults that are done intentionally after commencing upasana does not arise. Unless an occasion</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyarraya Saram</p>
<p>ac</p>
<p>actually arises, there cannot be a remcdy. It is said she Ti 3454119:&rsquo;. The &lsquo;naimittika&rsquo; or surrender for a particular cause, does not come upon one, without the &lsquo;nimitta&rsquo; or the cause for that. But, if one fears that intentional sins may happen to him after his Prapatti, it is proper that he should perform a &lsquo;prayaschitta&rsquo; of the form of Prapatti for averting the effects of the prarabdha-karma that has already become operative. It is mentioned in the shastras that a part of the prarabdha karma, can be annihilated by means of dana, japa and others, as mentioned in the following verse:</p>
<p>जन्मान्तरकृतं पापं व्याधिरूपेण बाधते । Tel: aitatal: 714814fafaft: 11</p>
<p>So, it is established that &lsquo;buddhipoorvaka papa&rsquo; or committing sins intentionally after Prapatti, does not arise, if one performs a Prapatti for 4797777191&rsquo; or the sins that are liable to cause one do sins.</p>
<p>Desika points out that even slight sins done against the satvikas will have its own adverse effects and so one should be very careful and avoid any kind of offences after Praparti, so that he may not be deprived of the grace of the Lord and he may not be subjected to even light punishment.</p>
<p>The main cause of all such offences happens to be non discrimination or &lsquo;aviveka&rsquo;. One should steer clear of the body-soul illusion, and the illusion that he is not dependent upon the Ishvara, and that he has all powers.</p>
<p>The cause of clearing all this illusion, will be a right understanding of his true nature. It is declared by savants that by the termination of the cause of offences viz., body</p>
<p>Aparadhapariharadhikara</p>
<p>191</p>
<p>OIC</p>
<p>soul illusion and the illusion that he alone is an independent entity by himself; all offences that arise on account of &lsquo;artha&rsquo; and &lsquo;kama&rsquo;, will be uprooted without any further effort. The intentional sins are on account of artha' and &lsquo;kama&rsquo;. They get destroyed, when one realises his true nature of being subservient to the Lord.</p>
<p>अविवेकप्रभुत्वादेर्निदानस्य निवर्तनात् ।</p>
<p>अर्थकामापचाराणां अयत्नोन्मूलनं भवेत् ॥ Of all the offences, offences towards the Bhagavacas, are very serious ones and one should be very vigilant to avoid offences towards the godly-ones. Bhagavan Ramanuja has expounded under the Vedanta Sutra 3-4-42 Ta मुक्तफलानियमः तदवस्थावधृतेः', that the result of moksha will be delayed on account of the offence of Bhagavathapachara. It is ordained in the shastras that a Bhagavatha should be venerated in spite of all differences of caste.</p>
<p>यः शूद्रं भगवद्भक्तं निषादं श्वपचं तथा ।</p>
<p>वीक्षते जातिसामान्यात् स यातिनरकं नरः ॥ &ldquo;A devotee of the Lord, who may be a &lsquo;sudra&rsquo; or a forester or a low caste man should not be treated on counts of caste. If one does so, he will fall into hell&rdquo; -</p>
<p>तस्माद्विष्णुप्रसादाय वैष्णवान् परितोषयेत् । प्रसादसुमुखो विष्णुः तेनैव स्यानसंशयः ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;For winning the grace of the Lord, one should please the devotees of the Lord Vishnu. By this alone, the Lord becomes pleased. There is no doubt about it.&rdquo; When a Bhagavatha is offended by a person, it is necessary that he should beg pardon of that Bhagavatha for having committed that offence. The instance of Lakshmana and Sugriva praying for excuse mutually when Lakshmana was harsh on Sugriva for having delayed to meet Rama, is quoted by the Acharyas to illustrate this point.</p>
<p>It is the understanding of the shastras that the Lord is going to excuse such sins that occur even intentionally, when one surrenders unto Him with a prayer to excuse his faults. So, it is decided in this section that the Lord who is ever compassionate, will pardon such Prapannas who have consciously committed offences, when they pray for pardon by practising a second Prapatti. By his surrender for liberation, all the accumulated sins will be terminated by the Lord. The sins that occur inadvertently will not stick to him. The lord is sure to grant him moksha for his first and primary Prapatti itself. It will never fail. If such a Prapanna does not repent and pray for pardon with a second Prapatti, even in that case, the Lord will not deprive him of the fruit of his first Prapatti, but inflicts on him punishment and thus, purifying him, takes him to His side. Such is the greatness of Prapatti and consequendy, the greatness of the compassion of the Supreme Lord. This is pointed out in the concluding verse -</p>
<p>प्रारब्धेतरपूर्वपापमखिलं प्रामादिकं चोत्तरं न्यासेन क्षपयन्ननभ्युपगतप्रारब्धखण्डं चनः । धीपूर्वोत्तर पाप्मनामजननात् जातेऽपि तनिष्कृतेः । कौटिल्ये सति शिक्षयाप्यनघयन् क्रोढीकरोति प्रभुः ॥</p>

<p>Schana Visheshadhikara</p>
<p>193</p>
<p>CHAPTER - XCX</p>
<p>Sthana Visheshadhikara</p>
<p>It was expounded in the previous section viz., Aparadhapariharadhikara, that a Prapanna should engage himself in divine service to the Lord, untainted by any offence, so long as he is destined to live in this world. He would gain the eternal service of the Lord in the Supreme Abode of the Lord after casting his body. It is described in this section, whether a suitable place is available for such a person to live in and to spend his lifetime in activities that are free from offences. Where should such a Prapanna spend the rest of his life, as most of the places mentioned by the ancient sages, have all been contaminated by worldly people and are not fit for a Prapanna to lead a calm and undisturbed life?</p>
<p>The sages of yore recommended places like shores of the Ganges, Prayag, Pushkara and Naimisharanya, and such holy places, as suitable for an ardent devotee to live. They did so because, those holy places were likely to have in them sages and realisers of Paramatman. But, on account of the ravages of time such as Kali-Yuga, and the deterioration in following the eternal dharmas, all those places have become unsuitable for the Prapanna to live.</p>
<p>Considering all these factors, Vedanta Desika suggests that a Prapanna may live in any place which is helpful for gaining tranquility of the mind and for developing single minded devotion towards the Lord and to obtain the association of an ardent lover of God, who is a &lsquo;Parama: kantin&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>&lsquo;यत्रैकाग्रयं भवति भगवत्पादसेवार्चनादेः यत्रैकान्त्यव्यवसितधियो यस्य कस्यापि लाभः । वासस्थानं तदिह कृतिनां भाति वैकुण्ठकल्पं&rsquo;।</p>
<p>In the introductory verse, Desika says that &ldquo;a place where concentration of mind for worship of the Lord and meditation upon the Lord, become possible&rdquo;, where one gains the company of a devotee who is free from contact with other deities, and other benefits, would be equivalent to Vaikuntha', the cternal abode of the Lord. The places suggested by the sages, such as Naimisha, Badari and bank of Ganga, and other similar holy places were suggested perhaps on account of the possibility of the presence of single-minded Bhagavatas. As the Holy places such as Aryavartha and others, have become unsuitable on account of the expeditions of non-believers of God, one should choose a place where some ardent devotees of the Lord are present.</p>
<p>It cannot be said that there will be no Bhagavatas at all, in the Kali-Yuga, as the sages have declared that even in the Kali-Yuga, there will be cminent bhagavathas here and there -</p>
<p>कलौ खलु भविष्यन्ति नारायणपरायणाः । क्वचित्क्वचिन्महाभागाः द्राविडेषु च भूरिशः ॥</p>
<p>So, it may be known that dharma of the nature of sole devotion to the Lord will never be obliterated on account of the presence of Bhagavatas at all times. In the Moksha Dharma of the Mahabharata, it is mentioned that when gods and sages requested the Lord to suggest a suitable place for them to live, the compassionate Lord replied thus –</p>
<p>Sthana Visheshadhikara</p>
<p>195</p>
<p>SCL</p>
<p>गुरवो यत्र पूज्यन्ते साधुवृत्ताः शमान्विताः । वस्तव्यं तत्र युष्माभिः यत्र धर्मो न हीयते ।। यत्र वेदाश्च यज्ञाश्च तपस्सत्यं दमस्तथा । स वै देशो हि वस्सेव्यो मा वोऽधर्मः पदा स्पृशेत्॥</p>
<p>A place where preceptors are venerated and where on account of the presence of such devotees, Dharma prospers; in a place, where the rites prescribed by the Vedas and the courses of penance, the word of truth, conquest over the senses, prevail, that is to be resorted, and adharma will not even creep into those places.</p>
<p>A place where there are facilities for rendering selfless service to the Lord and such Holy places, are recommended for a Prapanna to live. The Holy places where the Supreme Paramatman dwells is a right place for a Prapanna to live. The statement found in the Sharanagati Gadya viz., &ldquo;till the fall of your body, you can live peacefully in Srirangam alone&rdquo;, does not exclude other Holy places, where the Lord is eternally present. This statement is only indicative of other Holy places also. The dwelling place for a discriminating person is surely a holy place where the Lord is showing Himself. It is said in Mahabharata,</p>
<p>यत्र नारायणोदेवः परमात्मा सनातनः । तत्पुण्यं तत्परब्रह्म तत्तीर्थं तत्तपोवनम् ॥ ca 2984: Mal: # :</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place where that Supreme Paramatman is present that is punya, that is a holy place, that is verily a hermitage. The Deva Rishis, Siddhas and all hermits engaged in penance are all there&rdquo;.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyarraya Saram</p>
<p>In the &lsquo;Agamas&rsquo;, it is pointed out that the Holy places are of different types such as &lsquo;svayam-vyakta&rsquo;, installed by siddapurushas, and installed by Vaisnavas, and that an ardent devotee may live in such Holy places doing whatever divine services he could. It is declared in the Shastras that a person who breathes his last in a Holy place, becomes purified of all impurities and gradually attains the eternal abode of the Lord.</p>
<p>Mere dwelling in a Holy place, will not be the cause of emancipation. It helps him to strengthen his faith in the Lord, and adopt a means of salvation such as Bhakti Yoga or Prapatti, through which he may attain the Supreme Paramatman. It is declared -</p>
<p>यत्किञ्चिदपि कुर्वाणो विष्णोरायतने वसेत् । न किश्चिदपि कुर्वाणो विष्णोरायतने वसेत् ॥'</p>
<p>The idea of this verse is, &ldquo;he must dwell in the Holy place of the Lord, doing any kind of ordained service to the Lord, be it by his body or mind or speech. This points out that he must engage while living there in some divine service or other as approved by the scriptures. &lsquo;Not doing anything means not indulging in any kind of prohibited deed and dis-service to the Lord and the Godly-ones&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Desika ordains that a Prapanna lives in a place where there are Bhagavatas and where there is a possibility of enhancing one&rsquo;s &lsquo;satvic&rsquo; nature. He points out that the verse -</p>
<p>निगृहीतेन्द्रियग्रामः यत्र यत्र वसेन्नरः । तत्र तत्र कुरुक्षेत्रं नैमिषं पुष्करं तथा ।।</p>
<p>Sthana Visheshadhikara</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>i.e. &ldquo;that place where a devotee who has restrained his sense organs lives, is verily Kurukshetra, Naimisharanya and Pushkara&rdquo;; emphasises that the place, where a Bhagavata dwells, also become celebrated. This is to be followed, when there is no other go. This also affirms that there is no rule that a particular place is necessary for discarding one&rsquo;s body. One may cast away his body anywhere, but he is sure to obtain the fruit of his Prapatti, wherever he breathes his last.</p>
<p>ज्ञानसमकालमुक्त्वा कैवल्यं याति गतशोकः । तीर्थे श्वपचगृहे वा नष्टस्मृतिरपि परित्यजन् देहम्।</p>
<p>&ldquo;A person who utters the words of surrender and surrenders and gains the knowledge of Paramatman, may give up his body in a Holy place or in the place of an out caste or in a state of unconsciousness, but he surely attains liberation getting rid of all sorrows&rdquo;. This statement is meant for emphasising the fact that the surrender performed by one will never become futile and this does not in anyway discard the principle that was stated for living in a place conducive to one&rsquo;s devotional activities.</p>
<p>Vedanta Desika concludes that a place like Kashi (or Benares) or Ayodhya or Avanthi or Kanchipuram or Madhura or any other Holy place, will not, merely of themselves, become celebrated, if those places are not desired by Bhagavatas who are intent upon drinking the nectar of the Holy names and exploits of the Lord. The intention is that any Holy place which is not relished by Bhagavatas, does not appeal to a Prapanna and on the contrary, any place that is relished by ardent devotees, becomes a coveted place for a Prapanna to live. सा काशीति न चाकशीति भुविसायोध्येति नाध्यास्यते सावन्तीति न कल्मषादवतिसा काञ्चीति नोदञ्चति । धत्ते सामधुरेति नोत्तमधुरां नान्यापि मान्या पुरी या वैकुण्ठकथा सुधारस भुजां रोचेत नो चेतसे ॥Niryandhikara</p>

<p>CHAPTER - XX</p>
<p>Niryandhikara</p>
<p>The process of the jivas passing out of the body has been described in the Upanishads and the same has been expounded in the Brahmasutras (second quarter of the fourth chapter). In Chandogya Upanishad, it is said that when the &lsquo;purusha&rsquo; dies, his speech unites with mind, the mind gets into prana and the prana into tejas and the tejas becomes one with Supreme Deity (Chandogya 6-8-6). The Chandogya Upanishad describes the passage of the released atman to reach Paramatman. There, it is pointed out that the knowers of Brahman, reach fire or &lsquo;Agni&rsquo;, the first in the path of &lsquo;Archiradi&rsquo;. From fire to the deity of the day, from him to the deity of shukla-paksha, from him to the deity of uttarayana and then to samvathsara. From the deity of samvathsara, to the sun, from him to the moon and from him to the vidyuth or the deity of lightning. From vidyuth, the Amanava Purusha will unite him with Brahman. It is said that those who go by this path, never any more return to this world of Humans (Chandogya 4-15-5 and 4-15-6). This process of &lsquo;uthkranthi&rsquo; and the path by which a meditator upon Brahman, attains Brahman, is described vividly in the Brahmasutras in the second pada and third pada of the fourth chapter.</p>
<p>What has been described thus in respect of the Brahmopasakas regarding &lsquo;niryana&rsquo; or &lsquo;uthkranti&rsquo; and &lsquo;archiradi-gati&rsquo; or the path beginning with &lsquo;Agni&rsquo; that lcads to Brahman, applies equally to the Prapannas, who have</p>
<p>Sa totally surrendered the burden of their protection to the Lord.</p>
<p>Vedanta Desika describes in two sections viz., Niryanadhikara and Garichintanadhikara, the mode of passing out of the body and journey to Supreme Brahman through the path of &lsquo;Archiradi&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In Niryanadhikara i.c., the section describing the process of passing out of the body, Desika describes how a Prapanna passes out of the body, after becoming pure by exhausting the prarabdha-karmas that had come upon him in that body at such a time that he decides to quit this body. In the introductory verse, this process of passing out of the body, has been summarized in a nutshell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;मनसि करणग्रामं प्राणे मनः पुरुषे च तं झटिति घटयन् भूतेष्वे परे च तमात्मनि । स्वविदविदुषोरित्थं साधारणे सरणेर्मुखैः नयति परतो नाडीभेदैर्यथोचितमीश्वरः ॥</p>
<p>At the time of Niryana or the jivatma&rsquo;s passing out of the body, all the ten indriyas unite with the mind, and that mind unites with the prana, and that prana in which the mind and others are united, unite with the jivatman and that jivatman is united with the subtle elements and then this jivatman unites with the Paramatman, who is the inner controller in the heart. Like this, both the persons - one that has knowledge of Brahman and another that does not have knowledge of Brahman - pass out of the body in the same way. But, the Lord leads the knower of Brahman i.e., the Prapanna through the path of archiradi&rsquo; and the other one through the path of &lsquo;Dhuma&rsquo;, according to their differences.</p>
<p>Niryandhikara</p>
<p>201</p>
<p>cans</p>
<p>When a person surrenders unto the Lord, the Lord holds him by his hand and wills to take him to his side; but, on account of some prarabdha-karmas, the Prapanna may be affected by &lsquo;ahankara&rsquo; and &lsquo;mamakara&rsquo; or commit some offences or may desire for some other benefits, on account of which, he may be associated with some other deity, or their faith may be disturbed a little, and they may think of some other means and on account of these &lsquo;niryana&rsquo; or &lsquo;uthkranti&rsquo; may be delayed. But, on the other hand, those who have surrendered unto the Lord, including the fact of non-occurrence of offences during the post-prapatti-period, and who have unshakable faith, and who never feel &lsquo;ahankara&rsquo; or &lsquo;mamakara&rsquo; and who guard themselves from all kinds of intentional sins, the &lsquo;niryana&rsquo; will be at a time that is desired by such aspirants.</p>
<p>If one surrenders unto the Lord, without specifying the time of his departure from this world, he attains the Lord with some delay, after annihilating all sins that have happened to him. Such a person will not cherish to have other objects of life, as he is a &lsquo;mumukshu&rsquo;. If a Prapanna has &lsquo;prayojananthara - ruchi&rsquo; a taste for other benefits also along with &lsquo;moksha-ruchi&rsquo;, the Lord who is a well-wisher does not grant him other benefits and he will treat with indifference those desires and he enlightens him on the true nature of such other attainments such as &lsquo;alpatva&rsquo;, &lsquo;asthiratva&rsquo;, dukhamisratva&rsquo; etc., or He will see that, that person becomes dejected in the experience of certain ungodly benefits and he will see that such a person becomes averse to other benefits within the time that he had intended for deliverance at the time of Prapatti. It is pointed out in the verse below:</p>
<p>202</p>
<p>Esscncc of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>अथोपायप्रसक्तोऽपि भुक्त्वा भोगाननामयान् । अन्ते विरक्तिमासाद्य विशते वैष्णवं पदम् ॥</p>
<p>The delay for attainment of Godhead, is only so long as he has not gained dispassion or &lsquo;vairagya&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If a Prapanna contacts other deities with devotion, what happens to him? The Lord will see that he feels ashamed of getting devacantara-sparsa some day or other or by some means or other, and overcome that defect in him. Desika points out that if &lsquo;devatantara-sparsa&rsquo; becomes steadfast in him, it should be understood that he is not having the &lsquo;mokshopaya-sparsa&rsquo;. For such people &lsquo;naraka&rsquo; and others do certainly happen. If it is asked whether there is no benefit for the means adopted by him before, it is said that the act that is done as regards the Lord, by some way or other is surely going to fulfil one day or other, the proper performance of the means and becomes fulfilled. What he has done in respect of the Lord does not go a waste. It is a &lsquo;sukrut-lesa&rsquo; and it completes the performance of the means some day or other</p>
<p>For those, who have surrendered unto the Lord with perfect faith, weakness of mind (budhi-dourbalya) or desire for some other means will never arise. If these arise, it can be understood that their faith was faint. The Lord who is compassionate, will correct even such people and make them have supreme faith and convert them into those who have &lsquo;poorna-prapatti&rsquo;.</p>
<p>For a person, who is free from all these perverse temperaments, there will be no doubt of delay in attaining liberation. The delay is, only according to their wishes.</p>
<p>Niryandhikara</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>Suppose, a person has surrendered desirous of &lsquo;moksha&rsquo; at the time of the fall of that body, he is sure to get moksha at the time of the fall of that body.</p>
<p>When a person has surrendered the burden of his protection to the Lord and after that on account of his prarabdha-karına, if he develops interest in worldly objects, the Lord - who is a well-wisher - will not be granting those little benefits, even though prayed for them. The Lord will see that whatever the aspirant has sincerely done in respect of the Lord, will never go wasted, but it will become fully effective and successful in some future time and the means of surrender will be fully accomplished. The Supreme Paramatman who is all independent, and the &lsquo;sheshin&rsquo; of all others, other than himself, will certainly will the annihilation of the accumulated sins, and the non-tainting of sins done inadvertently after prapatti, at the very moment of the utterance of the statement of surrender unto the Lord. He wills to take the Prapanna and his associates to his eternal abode at the time that is desired by the Prapnna viz., at the termination of that body.</p>
<p>For those sins that were intentionally done by a Prapanna after his prapatti, the Lord wills to destroy them by making that Prapanna repent for his sins and to pray for pardon of the Lord for doing such sins. If he does not pray for pardon, which will be of the form of second prapatti for excusing those sins, the Lord will purify him by inflicting suitable punishment to him. But, He will never deprive the Prapanna of the supreme benefit of attaining moksha. All his &lsquo;sukruca&rsquo; and &lsquo;dushkruta&rsquo; will be completely divested of a Prapanna, at the time of his death, and they will be transmitted to his friends and foes.</p>
<p>Esscoce of Srimad Rahasyatraya Saram</p>
<p>&lsquo;प्रियेषु स्वेषु सुकृतमप्रियेषु च दुष्कृतम् । विसृज्य ध्यानयोगेन ब्रह्माप्येति सनातनम् ।</p>
<p>This statement that an upasaka gets rid of his sins, applies equally in the case of a Prapanna also, and a Prapanna becomes freed from all karmas at the time of the fall of his body itself. This question has been discussed in the Brahmasutras and it is decided there that the Bhakti-yogi becomes freed from both kinds of good and bad karmas and proceeds on the path of archiradi&rsquo; to attain the Supreme Paramatman. The upasaka or the Prapanna will get a subtle body not due to karma, but on account of the efficacy of the upasana' or &lsquo;prapatti&rsquo;, for moving on through the path of &lsquo;archiradi&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The statement of the Smritis that the day time, the bright half of the month and the &lsquo;uttarayana&rsquo; are celebrated periods for departing from the body, does not relate to a Prapanna or a Bhakti-yogi. It is verily pointed out that the death may occur at any time in any place, but a Prapanna is sure to attain his goal.</p>
<p>ज्ञानसमकालमुक्त्वा कैवल्यं याति गतशोकः । तीर्थे श्वपचगृहे वा नष्टस्मृतिरपि परित्यजन् देहम् ॥</p>
<p>Having uttered the statement of surrender as soon as getting knowledge of the Supreme Paramatman, a Prapanna attains moksha bereft of all sorrows by casting away his body in a Holy Place or in the household of an out caste or in a state of unconsciousness. At the time of passing out of the body, all the ten indriyas unite with the mind, and that mind unites with the vital airs and that prana-vayu along with others already united, unites with the jivatman, united with</p>
<p>Niryandhikara</p>
<p>205</p>
<p>the five subtle elements and he will be churned out of the body, and he will proceed out of the body through the &lsquo;nadis&rsquo;. This process of the jivatman passing out of the body is common to both the knower of Brahman and non-knower of Brahman. At that stage, there will be a significant change in the passage of the atman, who is a Prapanna. A Prapanna will be led by the well-wisher, the Supreme Paramatman to cnter into the &lsquo;moordhanya-nadi&rsquo; and he will come out of the body to go on the path of &lsquo;archiradi. The Prapnna and others part ways at the time of the entrance into &lsquo;moordhanya-nadi&rsquo;. Being blessed by the Supreme Paramatman, the Prapanna and the Bhakti-yogin enter the &lsquo;moordhanya-nadi&rsquo; to reach through it, the path of &lsquo;archiardi&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Desika discusses in this connection the propriety of having &lsquo;antima-smriti&rsquo; or final remembrance of the Lord. In the verse quoted above, where the case of a person, who is unconscious (nasta-smriti) is mentioned. Similarly, there is a statement ferd Haltart which affirms, that in the case of a person, who remembers the Lord when his mind and body are sound, the Lord would never forsake him, but remember him when he has gone unconscious, just like a log of wood. He would remember his devotee and would lead him to his supreme abode. The great Bhashyakara has said in his &lsquo;Gadya&rsquo; that a Prapanna would have a vivid vision of the Lord, his poorva-samskara being never lost and that he would be led to the Supreme Abode by the compassion itself of the Lord -</p>
<p>&lsquo;केवलेन, मदीययैव दयया अतिप्रबुद्धः मामेव अवलोकयन्&rsquo;।</p>
<p>Desika points out all these statements should be reconciled and explained harmoniously as follows: - As mentioned in Sharanagati-Gadya&rsquo;, the final remembrance of the Lord, will certainly come to a Prapanna, who has performed prapatti for attainment of moksha. The &lsquo;antima-smriti&rsquo; is not a kind of &lsquo;upaya&rsquo;, which is possible of one&rsquo;s own effort, as pointed out in statements like -</p>
<p>यं यं वापि स्मरन् भावं or यं योगिनो प्राणवियोगकाले यत्नेन चित्ते Padre</p>
<p>But, it is the remembrance of the Lord that arises in the mind of a person which has not yet merged with vital airs, but in which, all the ten indriyas are united. This is not possible of knowing by those who are by the side of the dying person. It is pointed out in the Bhashya as follows:</p>
<p>· दृश्यते हि वागिन्द्रिये उपरतेऽपि मनः प्रवृत्तिः । So, it is to be concluded that the final remembrance of the Lord is known to those that are becoming liberated and to the Ishvara who grants that final remembrance of Him.</p>
<p>After the merging of the subtle prana with the jivatman who is united with the subtle elements, the jivatman unites with Paramatman, who is in his heart and after taking rest there, the Prapanna and Bhakti-yogi go through the &lsquo;sushumna-nadi&rsquo; leading to &lsquo;archiradi&rsquo;. Till the time of entry into &lsquo;sushumna-nadi&rsquo; which is caused by the compassionate Paramatman, he will be in a state, which is similar to &lsquo;sushupti&rsquo;. Being awakened by the Lord, the Prapanna enters into the &lsquo;sushumna-nadi&rsquo; which is made to illumine by the Lord himself. For others, who are not &lsquo;upasakas&rsquo; or &lsquo;Prapannas&rsquo;, they pass out of the body through other nerves, and attain the destined places further. From the moment of</p>
<p>LA</p>
<p>Niryandhikara</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>entry into the &lsquo;sushumna-nadi&rsquo;, the jivatman becomes endowed with perfect knowledge and there will be only one day for all time to come. This has been explained as Hora दिवाहैव अस्य भवति ।</p>
<p>Thus, in this chapter, the passage of the jivatman from the body, is described till he enters into the &lsquo;sushumna-nadi&rsquo;. His attainment of Paramatman through the Archiradi path is described in the next chapter, the &lsquo;Gatichintanadhikara&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 id="२१-गतचनतनधकर">२१ गतिचिन्तनाधिकारः</h2>
<p>Gatichintanadhikara</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>CHAPTER - XXI</p>
<p>Gatichintapadhikara</p>
<p>The Upanishads describe the path of &lsquo;archiradi&rsquo; and calls it &lsquo;Devapatha&rsquo; or &lsquo;Brahmapatha&rsquo;. The various guides lead jivatman from one place to another place and a superhuman called &lsquo;Amanava&rsquo;, leads him to Supreme Brahman in the end. As a king fondles his son, the prince, who is obedient to him, the Lord himself makes this liberated soul led to his place by the various &lsquo;ativahikas&rsquo; such as Agni and others. The &lsquo;athivahikas&rsquo; are as follows: -</p>
<p>Agni the deity of the day, the deity of the bright half of the month, the deity of uttarayana, the deity of the year or samvatsara, Vayu, Adirya, the moon, the Vaidyutapurusha, Varuna, Indra and Prajapathi.</p>
<p>ज्वलनदिवसज्योत्स्ना पक्षोत्तरायणवत्सरान् पवन तपन प्रालेयांशून् क्रमादचिरद्युतिम् । जलधरपतिं देवाधीशं प्रजापतिमागतः तरति विरजां दूरे वाचस्ततः परमद्भुतम् ॥</p>
<p>The liberated soul is respectfully led by these guides or &lsquo;athivahikas&rsquo;, and he attains the Eternal Abode of Paramatman. He will be endowed with a subtle body that is meant for only movement on the path of &lsquo;archiradi&rsquo;, by virtue of his prapatti or upasana, and he casts away that subtle body while reaching the divine river &lsquo;Viraja&rsquo;. Crossing the river &lsquo;Viraja&rsquo;, he is endowed with a non-material body i.e., Aprakrita-Sharira. He will be then led to the lake ऐरम्मदीय and the peepal tree called सोमसवन and he is welcomed by five hundred divine damsels, and he will be decorated with &lsquo;Brahmalankara&rsquo;. The Kaushitaki Upanishad describes graphically the glory of the &lsquo;mukta&rsquo;. The deities Indra, Varuna and Prajapati, will be congratulating the liberated soul with great veneration. The liberated soul witnesses the Supreme Lord in his Supreme Abode. By thus attaining the Lord, in his abode, the liberated atman manifests its true nature of infinite consciousness and the eight divine qualities, and for all the time to come, enjoys the bliss of divine communion. He will get rid of all obstacles and all limitations to the experience of the divine and will ever realise that he is inseparable from the Lord. The ecstasy of divine experience, overflows in the form of loving service of the Supreme Paramatman. It has been decided in the Brahmasutras that his essential nature of consciousness will be perfectly manifested at that time as well as his &lsquo;dharma-buta-jnanam&rsquo; will be all expansive just like the dharma-buta-jnanam' of Paramatman. He will be deriving the Supreme joy of eternal communion with the Lord, for all time to come.</p>
<p>A Bhakti-yogin has to reflect upon this &lsquo;archiradi&rsquo; path day-in and day-out, as it is an accessory to Bhakti-yoga. But, for a Prapanna, this reflection of the &lsquo;archiradi&rsquo; path, is a source of great delight, though it is not an accessory to Prapatti. The Prapanna becomes gratified by thinking of this &lsquo;archiradi&rsquo;, and the divine experience, he is going to gain in course of time.</p>
<p>In the concluding verse of this chapter, Desika describes that the &lsquo;Harichandana&rsquo; or sandal tree of the form of Lord Hari, would bless the souls that have surrendered unto Him,</p>
<p>Gatichintanadhikara</p>
<p>211</p>
<p>being tired of moving up and down by the paths leading to hell, and becoming completely exhausted on account of their unceasing movement, by taking them to his side, being led by his obedient servants, the &lsquo;athivahikas&rsquo;, the Lord would make them happy by granting his cool shade for all time to</p>
<p>come.</p>
<p>As the trec provides its cool shade to the tired travellers, the Lord grants the Supreme Happiness of His Eternal Communion to those who had been unceasingly involved in the circle of births and deaths. The Lord will never will to send those liberated atmans to this world - Fagarrada' say the Upanishads.</p>

<p>Paripurna Brahmanubhava Adhikara</p>
<p>213</p>
<p>CHAPTER - XXII</p>
<p>Paripurna Brahmanubhava Adhikara</p>
<p>In this section. Dcsika describes the great benefit of obtaining the bliss of communion with Paramatman for all time to come, and the unique gain of similarity or &lsquo;Paramasamya&rsquo; with the Supreme Paramatman. In explaining this complete experience of the &lsquo;Sarveswara&rsquo;, the celebrated author is guided by the upanishadic statements, as well as the conclusions of the Brahmasutras, beginning with &lsquo;Karyadhikarana&rsquo; (in the third pada of the fourth chapter) and concluding with the declaration of the Sutrakara with the sutra &lsquo;Anavritih Shabdar&rsquo; (from Sutra 4-3-6 to 4-4-22).</p>
<p>According to the exposition of the Upanishads, as related to the liberated self and according to the conclusions that are arrived at by the Brahmasutrakara, Desika describes the state of &lsquo;mukti&rsquo; as related to a Prapanna to be the same as that of an Upasaka of Brahman. The passage of the Prapanna through the archiradil to the Supreme Abode of Paramatman, and the manifestation of the true nature of the individual self after attainment of the Supreme Paramatman, the eternal bliss of communion with the Lord, the fulfilment of the goal of attaining Paramatman - all these are similar to the attainment of the Brahma-Upasakas.</p>
<p>In the introductory stanza of this chapter, Desika describes all these factors. The Prapanna reaches the Supreme Abode of Paramatman through &lsquo;archiradi&rsquo; and not &lsquo;Hiranyagarbha&rsquo; or Karya-Brahma, as some schools posit. The abode of Paramatman is described as &lsquo;Vitamasi-Pade&rsquo; which means that it is an abode of Suddha-satva' beyond the material world. The sruti says &lsquo;Tamasah-Parastat&rsquo;. The Chandogya Upanishad and the Subala Upanishad, describe this abode picturesquely. The liberated Prapanna attains the Lord, characterised by infinite auspicious qualities and who is extolled by the celebrated &lsquo;Purusha-sukta&rsquo; and who is the Lord of Goddess Mahalakshmi. Reaching the Lord, being led to his abode by the &lsquo;ativahikas&rsquo;, the liberated atman manifests his true nature of being characterised by eight qualities as pointed out in the Sutra 4.4.1 - &lsquo;Sampadya Avirbhavah Svena Shabdat&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The liberated atman realises directly his nature of being an inseparable attribute to the Supreme Lord. He will be manifesting the cight qualities such as &lsquo;apahatapapma&rsquo; and others, and he will be of the nature of consciousness or &lsquo;Jnana-svarupa&rsquo; also. He will not become mere &lsquo;jnana svarupa&rsquo;, but will also have the attribute of &lsquo;jnanam&rsquo; - jnana gunaka' as decided by the Sutrakara in Sutra 4-4-7. &lsquo;gayatricerca a cfartej akırm:&rsquo; | The view point of some, that the liberated will be mere consciousness, has been set aside by the Sutrakara. He will attain supreme similarity in his nature and attributes with Paramatman and, he will no more be returning to this world -</p>
<p>वितमसि पदे लक्ष्मीकान्तं विचित्रविभूतिकं सचिवगमितः संपद्याविर्भवत्सहजाकृतिः । स्फुट तदपृथक्सिद्धिः सिद्ध्यद्गुणाष्टकतत्फलो भजति परमं साम्यं भोगे निवृत्तिकथोझ्नितम् ॥'</p>
<p>Desika explains the state of a liberated soul as follows, 1. The mukta or liberated atman experiences the Supreme</p>
<p>Paripurna Brahmanubhava Adhikara</p>
<p>215</p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Lord characterised by all his infinite forms, qualities, glories and functions in all places, at all times, in all states, without any exception. The experience is equal to him and the Supreme Paramatman, and that is mentioned by Sruti as &lsquo;Parama-Samya&rsquo;. All the ills of samsara have vanished. &ldquo;The attainment of Paramatman which is of the form of unequalled infinite happiness is the one terminal and sure remedy for all the ills of samsara&rdquo; -</p>
<p>&ldquo;Artillerlemichoti भेषजं भागवत्प्राप्तिः एकान्तात्यन्तिकी मता&rdquo; ॥ It may be asked, how are the other objects related to Paramatman, enjoyable to the mukta? The analogy of the queen and the king is given here. While the king is &lsquo;bhogya&rsquo; to the anointed queen, all objects of enjoyment and instruments of enjoyment that are agreeable to the king, become enjoyable to the queen also. Similarly, all objects that are inherently related to the Paramatman, become equally enjoyable to the mukta also, to whom Bhagavan is a cherished object of enjoyment. The Srutis and Smritis declare that the Supreme Paramatman is &lsquo;parama-bhogya&rsquo; as characterised by all attributes. The Alwar says, &ldquo;the lover does not leave enjoying the lotus eyed Paramatman, the Lord of the two vibhutis, even a little.&rdquo; That means, the mukta immerses himself in the bliss of communion with the Lord fully, and he does not miss Him even for a fraction of a second, while enjoying the Lord with all his glory. &ldquo;He does not see any other thing, he does not hear any other thing, he does not know any other thing&rdquo;. &lsquo;यत्र नान्यत् पश्यति नान्यत् श्रृणोति नान्यद्विजानाति स भूमा&rsquo;</p>
<p>(71.3. 7-24-1) The term Paramapada signifies the essential nature of Paramatman or &lsquo;Bhagavar-svarupa&rsquo;, as the attainment of Bhagavan is &lsquo;parama-prapya&rsquo;, as it is infinitely pleasing. Similarly, the particular abode where the mukta obtains &lsquo;paripoorna-anubhava&rsquo; of bhagavat-svarupa', also becomes a cherished place, and most celebrated; so, the particular abode, where he obtains this unique divine experience is also designated as &lsquo;parama-pada&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The essential nature of the mukta also is called as &lsquo;parama-pada&rsquo;, because he is the &lsquo;ashrayal or resort for that. unique experience or Paramatman. The muktatman is the vibhuti of Bhagavan, and of the nature of consciousness and bliss, as he also is an object of experience as the &lsquo;ashraya&rsquo; for divine experience; his essential nature is also called as parama-pada&rsquo;.. Thus, the term &lsquo;parama-pada&rsquo; signifies all the three viz. Supreme Paramatman, the object of experience; the abode where that experience is gained and the muktatman who is the experiencer and the &lsquo;ashrayal of that</p>
<p>experience.</p>
<p>This is in accordance with what Bhagavan Ramanuja says in Vedartha Sangraha –</p>
<p>क्वचित् परस्थानं च परमपदशब्देन प्रतिपाद्यते । क्वचित् प्रकृतिवियुक्तात्मस्वरूपम् । क्वचित् भागवत्स्वरूपम् ॥</p>
<p>It may be asked, how the objects in the mundane world, the &lsquo;lila-vibhuti&rsquo; of the Lord, that are perceived directly as</p>
<p>Paripurna Brahmanubhava Adhikara</p>
<p>217</p>
<p>disagreeable, and that are ordained in the Shastras.as things that are to be discarded, become &lsquo;bhogya&rsquo; to a mukta? The answer to this question is, that even those objects that were disagreeable to him, while he was imprisoned in matter, become &lsquo;bhogya&rsquo; to him, as the aspect of disagreeability has been terminated when he is liberated. Desika gives two examples here -</p>
<p>Milk which is agreeable to all, becomes dis-agreeable and distasteful to one, who is affected by bile. The same person finds milk agreeable to him, when the defect of the bile (pitta) is cured.</p>
<p>Another example is given by Desika for this. A prince who is put into the prison of the monarch, finds that the prison is disagreeable to him; but, when the king releases him from the prison and makes him experience happiness equal to him, the prince does not find the prison disagreeable. He considers it as a vibhuti of his father.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the atman is in this world, according to his past karma and when he is deprived of the communion of the Lord, he finds the objects of this world as totally disagreeable or slightly agreeable. But, all these objects of this &lsquo;lila-vibhuti&rsquo; become included in the group of objects of immense joy, when he is liberated from this world, and when he is having incessant communion with the Lord. It is on account of the will of the Lord that the objects of this world are disagreeable (pratikula) or slightly agreeable (alpanukula) for those who are bound by karmas and they are cver agreeable to those who have got rid of the bondage of karma and who have gained Paramatman. The statement of the Sruti that whatever the &lsquo;Mukta&rsquo; desires becomes actualised and that he will be sporting with damsels and others; and that he will be cacing, drinking and seeing his forefathers and others, is to be understood that they are not the results of his karma (Karma Phala); but, they are actualised on account of his own desire, which will be in accordance with the desire of the Lord and so, they are all included in the stream of experience of pure kainkarya to the Lord – &lsquo;Kevala-Kainkarya&rsquo; of the form of the stream of divine experience. So the &lsquo;Prapti&rsquo; or attainment of Paramatman is to be understood as &lsquo;यथाभिमत कैंकर्यपर्यन्त SIE :&rsquo;!</p>
<p>i.e., complete experience of Brahman extending upto kainkarya, as desired.</p>
<p>When a person gains this ultimate object of divine experience once, it will not come to an end at any time. Various authorities like - ud i 14 za rada ufa:&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The upasaka of Brahman attains that Supreme Abode from which he never more returns&rdquo;;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having attained me, the aspirant does not take birth again in this world of sorrow&rdquo;;</p>
<p>मामुपेत्य तु कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते &ldquo;There will be no re-birth after attaining me.&rdquo; यदा स केवलीभूतः षद्भिशं अनुपश्यति । तदा स सर्वसिद्धत्वात् पुनर्जन्म न विन्दति ।।</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the mumukshu, getting rid of the contact with the matter, witnesses the Supreme Lord, the twenty sixth entity, he attains his true nature, and never more be born in this world again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paripurna Brahmanubhava Adhikara</p>
<p>219</p>
<p>The Alwar says, &ldquo;Having uttered the holy Mulamantra with the mouth, and folding one&rsquo;s hands on the head with reverence, and if one goes to the abode of that Lord, He will not allow him to go back even on bail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If at times, he enters into this world of &lsquo;samsara&rsquo;, at the behest of the Lord, and if he moves here at will, he will not be deprived of the bliss of divine experience of the Lord at any time, and as he experiences the Lord without any diminution, it is to be known that it is not re-birth.</p>
<p>It is not definitely known from what final body, one gains this kind of infinite divine experience. It may be from the body of a human being or from the body of a god. There is liberation even for the four-faced-Brahma and others. The variations of high and low that exists in the mumukshu state, do not follow in the state of liberation. The Mundaka Sruti expressly describes that all the liberated will attain ultimate equality with the omnipotent Ishvara. The statement of some people that there will be diminution in experience of bliss in respect of mumukshus, who have &lsquo;Achara Vaikalya&rsquo; or &lsquo;imperfection of religious behaviour&rsquo;, is not affirming variation in divine experience after liberation. But, there may be such diminution of divine experience that occurs before he is liberated. There may be only difference in respect of time in gaining that liberation.</p>
<p>The designation of &lsquo;liberated&rsquo; that is given to the people who have gained &lsquo;Salokya&rsquo; or &lsquo;Sarupya&rsquo; in other worlds of pure sarva, is given on account of the fact that they are nearer to perfection. The statement -</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slony fabunfa l l समीपमिच्छन्ति च केचिदन्ये ।</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>Essence of Srimad Rahasyattaya Saram</p>
<p>अन्ये तु रूपं सदृशं भजन्ते</p>
<p>Heyvela H 39: 11&rdquo; makes this point clear. The &lsquo;Sayujya&rsquo; or attainment of equality in auspicious qualities and others that is attained in &lsquo;Paramapada&rsquo; only, is verily &lsquo;Sayujya&rsquo;. The other terms like &lsquo;Salokya&rsquo; and others are included in the &lsquo;Sayujya&rsquo; and there is perfect equality in &lsquo;Sayujya&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sayuk&rsquo; is one who enjoys together (with Brahman), himself being an enjoyer. In the object of experience viz., Brahman, characterized by all his vibhutis, both Brahman and the liberated become enjoyers and so the liberated atman is called &lsquo;Sayuk&rsquo;. Both Brahman and the Mukta are enjoyers and both of them enjoy Brahman with all his vibhutis. If a question is asked, why the Sruti uses the word &lsquo;Sarstita&rsquo; along with &lsquo;sayujya&rsquo;, the answer is like this:</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;sayujya&rsquo; signifies that the object of enjoyment is the same for both. The term &lsquo;sarscita&rsquo; signifies that there is no difference in the degree of experience of that object.</p>
<p>सायुज्यमुभयोरत्र भोक्तव्यस्याविशिष्टता । सार्टिता तत्र भोगस्य तारतम्यविहीनता ।</p>
<p>The liberated self, though does not engage himself in the process of creation of the worlds and others, derives equal delight in the creative functions of the Lord. Desika gives the analogy of a father engaged in agriculture, shares the result of his labour with his sons, who are not toiling in the fields. The &lsquo;Rasa&rsquo; or Supreme Joy that is derived from &lsquo;jagadvyapara&rsquo; of the Lord, is equally enjoyed by the Mukta, who is witnessing the wonderful deeds of the Lord. The view that &lsquo;Sayujya&rsquo; means oncncss of Paramatman and the Jivatman, has no support anywhere.Paripurna Brahmanubhava Adhikara</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>N</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Hrnce do uryw ac ail:' says the grammarian Shakatayana. The word &lsquo;Sayujya&rsquo; has not the connotation of oneness. Moreover, the duality texts affirm difference only between Jivatman and Paramatman. The terms that are used by Lord Krishna in the Gita, are &lsquo;Samyam&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sadharmyam meaning equality. When a drop of pure water is dropped into pure water, it becomes Jigcr&rsquo; i.e. similar to that and never aca i All these authorities establish that the liberated atman co-exists with Paramatman enjoying the supreme bliss of His communion for all time to come.</p>
<p>The unique characteristics of Paramatman never happen to the liberated atman. The Muktatman is ever supported, and ever ruled over by the Paramatman and is used to serve His purposes alone, for all time to come.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jagatkaranatva&rsquo; or being the cause of this universe, &lsquo;Mokshapradarva&rsquo; or granting liberation to the atmans, &lsquo;Sarvadharatva&rsquo; or being the support of all entities other than himself, &lsquo;Sarvaniyantratva&rsquo; or being the ruler of all other entities, &lsquo;Sarvasheshitva&rsquo; or the fact of being served by all other entities, &lsquo;Sarvashariratva&rsquo; or being the innerself of all entities, &lsquo;Sarvashabda-vachyatva&rsquo; or being the import of all terms, &lsquo;Sarva-veda-vedyatva&rsquo; or being the one that is known from all vedas, &lsquo;Sarvaloka-sharanyatva&rsquo; or being the redeemer of all people in all worlds, &lsquo;Sarva-mumukshu-upasyatya&rsquo; or being the object of meditation for all mumukshus, Sarva Phala-Pradatva' or the fact of granting all fruits of all actions, &lsquo;Sarva-Vyaptatva&rsquo; or the fact of pervading everything, &lsquo;jnananada-Swarupatva&rsquo; or being of the essential nature of knowledge and bliss, &lsquo;Lakshmi-sahayatva&rsquo; or being the consort of Goddess Mahalakshmi - all these characteristics are uniquely associated with Paramatman alone exclusively just like the &lsquo;chatra&rsquo; and &lsquo;chamara&rsquo; (the royal umbrella and the royal chauri) of the king.</p>
<p>As established in the vedanta sutras and as explained by Bhagavan Ramanuja, Desika expounds that there is no possibility of the liberated to be re-born in the material world. The Muktatinan experiences everything as ensouled by Brahman and there is no occasion at all for experiencing This pure nature aloof, and as he has directly realised the defects of other objects of life, it cannot be doubted that the Muktaman returns to this world by his own desire. As the wisdom gained about the three entities viz. the chetana, achetana and Ishvara, and as regards the objects to be discarded and objects to be entertained, has now become fully established and expanded, it cannot be doubted that he might return to this world on account of his ignorance. The extension of knowledge of the form of love towards the Lord, called as &lsquo;bhakti&rsquo;, which has arisen in him, has become strengthened and fulfilled on account of directly experiencing the unique form, qualities and other characteristics of the Lord, on account of which his intense love towards the Lord has swelled, and so the all independent Lord will not make him born in this world by his mere &lsquo;sankalpa&rsquo;. As he is not subordinated to Shastra at the state of liberation, there is no fear of transgressing commands of the Lord. As what pleases the Lord, will be the desire of the Mukta, and so, there is no &lsquo;Viparita Anushtana&rsquo; or committing the fault of going against the desire of the Lord; on account of all these factors and on account of the infinite affection that the Lord has for the liberated, there is absolutely no doubt about the non-return of a liberated self to this world. He will be cternally enjoying the supreme joy of divine communion for all time to come.</p>
