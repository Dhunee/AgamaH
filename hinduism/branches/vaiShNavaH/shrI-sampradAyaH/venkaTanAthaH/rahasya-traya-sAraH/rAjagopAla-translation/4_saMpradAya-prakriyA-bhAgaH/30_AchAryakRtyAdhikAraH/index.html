</ol>
<p>AN ACHARYA.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:&ndash;</p>
<p>The noble acharya, who longs to attain the pripeval and heavenly abode of Vishnu, fights up the imperishable lamp of spiritual tradition (sampradıya) in some deserving disciple who bas been tested in various and well-known ways and fonnd fit (to receive the light). (He lights up this lamp) with true affection (sneha) when the disciple is in a state of mind (dasū) free from noworthy qualitios* (gua) like &amp; well-tested and weil-burnished vessel with oil (sucha) poured into it and with a wick (dasä) made of pure threads (guļa).</p>
<p>TO WHOM SHOULD) THE CHARYA IMPART</p>
<p>SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE :&ndash;</p>
<p>It has been said :&ndash; &ldquo;Thun' art the Wither of this world consisting of things that move about and things that do not move. Thou art also its gurn; therefore, Thon art the greatest of those who deserve to be worshipped.&rdquo; and agnin. &quot; We reqnest* perrpis. xion of all (those who are assembled here) to show our reverence to Sri Krishna wlo deserves, in virtue of the perfection of all his (good) qualities, the foremost tokens of reverence, and who is (at the same time) the üclürya, the lather, the guri and one fit to be honourud.&quot; As slated in these slokas, the Lord of all is the Supreme Acharya. From Hinn has come down to us the spiritual</p>

<p>tradition of noble üchurzas. The (true) üchirga collects together the meanings of the three great secrets (mantras) whose delightfnl flavour cannot, like the milk of the lioness, be appreciated by strangers. He makes a brief summary of them and then meditates on them. (Ilow and to whom, after doing so, he should teach these truths is described in the following slokas :). &ldquo;He who' guards this meaning from those who are unworthy and imparts it to those who are worthy he is fit to be honoured by me.&rdquo; &quot; This (the Bhagavad Gitū) is not to be taught to those who have not performed tapas. It should never be taught to the man who has no devotion or blukti and who does not show eagerness to learn it. It should never be imparted to the man who hates me. He who teaches this greatest of secrets to my devotees will show para. bhakti or deep devotion to me and will attiin muc, There is no doubt of this.&quot; &ldquo;This great sustra shoull not be taught to men who are not constantly repeating the Vedas. This siistra will impart wisdom to the man who is eager to learn it and bows devoutly to the guru for attaining wisiloin. This should aot be imparted to the man who is ever in the habit of telling lies; (it should not be imparted) to deceitful nen, to eanuchs, to men that are mentally perverse, to those who are so conceited as to think that they are learner) when they tre not tiny so, and to those who Gause affliction to others. I will tell yon of the man who deserves to be taught (this siistru). Listen. It should be taught to the man who has faith, who is virtuous, who never indulges in vilifying others, who can understand sound reasoning and who is capable of grasping what is taught. (It should be taught) to the man who per forns the rites and duties (ordained for bin) and wbo endures the inconveniences and discomforts arising from their performance, to the win who is intent on doing what is good to the world and who desires to live in solitude. (It should be taught) to the inan who delights in the injunctions of the sustras, who dreads vain argu. mentation and who has learnt much from ūchiiryas. It should be</p>

<p>taught to the man who is grateful for the help rendered to bim, who considers patience and compassion as desirable virtues and who looks upon all eternal souls as resembling bimself. Wise men declare that this s&rsquo;āstra should not be taught to those who have not these virtues. When the stāstra is imparted to the unworthy, it will not bring good to the teacher for that very reason. Even if this earth is filled with gems and offered (to one), one should not, o king, impart this sästra to the man who has not subjected himself to discipline. This noble sõstra may certainly be taught to the man who bas subdued bis senses. You need not be, in the least, afraid, O Karala. You have been taught this sūstra treating of the Supreme Brahman. You bave been taught the Supreme Brahman that has no beginning, no middle and no end, that is free from sorrow and that is most holy.&rdquo; &ldquo;If &amp; fit &amp; disciple cannot be found, the inan who is fit to teach this vidyā may (even) die with his vidya or learning. It should, on no account, even at the time of great adversity, be sown in a desert&rdquo;. &ldquo;Ignorant' men who con. sider themselves learned and hypocrites who pretend to observe dharma while they are really doing adharma - these man under the disguise of the virtuous harass (good) men who practise dharma. He who has skill in performing well such actions as would lead to moksha but who, elsewhere, follows the ways of the world &ndash; he is looked down upon is a guru of a low type. Many are the men who are foolish; the inan with a clear intelligence may occasionally be found somewhere and only one among many. He is a man with all virtuous mind who will never allow his intelligence to be clouded by men that are silly. Trust should never be placed in any wan; this is A matter for careful consideration, especially, in Kali yuga. Great signers confound the intellects of the weak-minded with perverse reasons spouted forth like a downpour of rain. One should guard dharma from the unfit and perform dharma. Naver teach any. thing to one who does not beg for it. Even when asked, secret meanings or the mysteries of religion and the true doctrine should</p>

<p>not be revealed (lightly). To bi who has sought one, with true devotion, who has constant faith in the sustras, who is pure and is prepared to learn in accordance with the rules &ndash; to him one should teach everything. The man who teaches the s&rsquo;īstras to the unworthy for winning the respect of others, for wealth, for being honoured by others and for gettiog rid of the suffering (caused by poverty ) - that man strays from the right path. (You) may sow the seed in a desert, give (your) daughter in marriage to a eunuch and give a garland of flowers to a monkey; but (you) should never impart (instruction) in the s&rsquo;istra to one who is unworthy&rdquo;. &ldquo;This great mantra should not be taught to an atheist, to one who is insincere, or who is not devout, to one who delights in harassing others and to a miser. This mantra is not fit to be taught to such as these. It should be taught by the achirya to the man who is sincere, to one who has devotion to his guru, to the man who has devotion to Vishnu and who is intent on doing good to all beings. These two things should be borne well in mind.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thus have I uttered words wbich are like a garland to the Lord and words that would delight His servants, for the sake of the enjoyment of the Lord which is sweet as anı brosia&rdquo;. &ldquo;Here have I &lsquo;tanght deep truths in the form of verses each of which begins with the last word of the previous verse (antüdi). Considering their great value, receive them without casting them among the unworthy&rdquo;. As stated in such treatises as the above, viz., Sötvata, Bhagavad Gitā, the discourse between Vasishti and Karala, Sandilya Smriti and Satyaki tantra, the ancient achärzas would teach only to those who had such qualities as goodness and faith and who would therefore be approved of by the Saviour. (They would teach these truths) only to those who were of tbe nature of the gods (Devas) as described in the following silokas :- &ldquo;These Hare the qualities, O. Bharata, which enrich man with a nature silpilar to that of the gods :- fearlessness, a miod free from the taint of rajas and tamas, meditation on the essential nature of the</p>

The god like are, by nature, always full of devotion to Vishon. The Isuric are the very opposite of this.&rdquo; Those men with a nature like that of the gods would be tested by (our) acharyas for ascertaining their real character as stated in the following slokas: &ldquo;The disciple&rdquo; shonld be tested in varions ways for a period of one year, or half of it, or (at least) three months and he should be tanght with compission and withont any thought of gain and the like&quot;, and &ldquo;If a man has come by chance from a distint land with a mind full of the love of the Lord, he should be tanght what he desires withont any prolonged tests&rdquo;. (Having ascertained his fitness), the üchirya wonld reveal (spiritual truths) in such a manner that six ears could not hear them (i.e. that it could be heard only by the sishyu&rsquo;s two ears and the guru&rsquo;s two ears and no other) and only to a disciple who had no desires and was content with what he had in regard to other things and who was keenly desirous oply of learning the s&rsquo;istrus. Acharyas of olden days would guard these secrets from asuric natures which are different and which have, as their possessions, such attributes as the</p>

<p>following:&ndash; Performing 20A dharma for the sake of praise, delight in the enjoyment of seuse-pleasures which make one indifferent to the knowledge of what is good and what is evil, irrational arrogance, anger, harshness of speech and folly&quot;. They would keep the s&rsquo;astra hidden like a wealthy man who would (guard) a cherished treasure and see to its proper use:</p>
<p>THE NATURE OF THE TEACHING :</p>
<p>They would teach their sishyas such truths as the following:</p>
<p>(1) Tative. “There is a self or utrui which is eternal and different from the body and the senses. Besides these two vis., the entient berus and non-sentient things, there is a Supreme Self whu dwe&rsquo;ls within all of them as their ruler and who is the s&rsquo;eshi</p>
<p>for whom they exist). Other than this Supreme Self there is no one, either oneself or otbers, that can protect the self&quot;. (2) Hitu : They will also teach the meins (hita) by which the end can be</p>
<p>trained, in the following words to be ultered by the s&rsquo;ishya &ldquo;Hrom beginningless time, I have been in samsura subject to the cycle of birtis and deaths. In order that I may not have such</p>
<p>sufferings is dwelling within the embryo, I pray that Thou shouldst Hrant me Thy holy feet and save me.&rdquo; (With these words) and with the uitorance of Dua ya, preceded by obeisance to the succession of gurus, taught graciously by the achirgus, the sishy, should be iilight to seek the feet of Narayana and Sri and surrender his self And whatever is his, as also the burdens or responsibilities connected with then, When be good uchraga has thus introduced the s ishigit to the Lord, the sishya should be made to feel assured that the Lord would never, thereafter, forsake him so that he way live the ret of bis life here in the spirit of good will to every one and tree from all offence and his later life may become the prelude tu moksha. Thus he would teach the s&rsquo;ishiga what be should do after the surrender of responsibility (bharunyusa) in ag brief á ruanner as would suit the aptitude of the s&rsquo;ishya.</p>
<p>20-A. Bhagavad Gita. 16-4</p>
<p>572 CHAPTER</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soul or self is different from prakriti or matter ; greater than the self is the Saviour who is the Ruler (over all); the supreme good of man consists in the surrender of the responsibility of the self to Him; the end (attained thereby) is existence solely for the fulfilment of Ilis purposes&rsquo;. In these words our spiritual teachers whose sole wealth was their compassion gave us, of their own accord, as a heritage, the (spiritual) wealth divided into three classes (vix, tativa, hita, purushirtha), when we had surrendered ourselves to them.</p>
<p>All these words of mine on the three secrets (mantras) found in the earlier and later chapters) are in accordance with the spiritual tradition of Vedānta Udayana, otherwise called, Madappalli ichun, (the preceptor in charge of the kitchen), (who propagated the truths of l&rsquo;edanta like Udayana commenting on Tarkas cistra). Kidainbi Appullar made me learn these words like a parrot, just as be had learnt them from his own ächürya (his father). (Therefore ) these words are those that illumined his mind owing to the compassion of the Lord and that were gnarded by him without forgetfulness and taught to we without any error.</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>Those lamps (of spiritual wisdom) which lighted the threshold of a certain huiise (in Tirukkovali!), when, of old, the cow.hord (Sri Krishna) who vouchs:ifed His grace (even) to cattle, came of His own accord and squeezed Himself among those three ancient singers (the first three* ilvārs)-Those lamps lighted there (i,e. their songs) dispelled the darkness of the land and revealed the path indicated in the Upanisbuds which form the concluding part of the four Vedas.</p>

<p>DUTIES OF AN ACHARYA</p>
<p>573</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>Our great achiiryas, who were absolutely free from ignorance and error, lighted this undying lamp out of con passionate grace, ia the minds of worthy disciples who had grown rich in the true wealth of the performance of orduided rites in a manner which would accord with their knowledge. (They did so) because they desired that the whole world (of meo) should become free from ignorance and adorn their heads with the Lord&rsquo;s feet owing to their longing for Paramapada,</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA :</p>
<p>The acharya who obeys the successive commands of (the Lord who is) the first achūrya regulates (the minds and actions of) his s&rsquo;ishyas by methods of instruction which *crcate in thenu noble qualities similar to those in himself and which are like irresistible waves of the celestial sea of his boundless compassion. By doing so, he saves not only the disciple but himself also under the guise of saving him.</p>
<p>(*NOTE: Gunasamkramal inay mean also “which creale a path for the entrance of their noble qualities into their disciples&rdquo;)</p>
