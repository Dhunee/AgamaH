SRIMAD RAHASYATRAYASABA
A BRIEF ACCOUNT
OF
THE SUCCESSION OF ACHARYAS
SANSKRIT SLOKA :
(With due devotion) we repeat the expression of adoration to our gurus and likewise to their gurus; and among these (latter), We pray for the grace of the Primeval Couple (Narayana and Lakshmi), the twin s&amp;rsquo;eshis* of all the worlds (so that they may be both the end to be attained by us and the means of attaining it).</description>

      <description>(1) INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.
SANSKRIT VERSE:
I adore the regular and spotless succession of Acharyas which is well-known to extend upwards even to Bhagavan, It is by virtue of their grace that the essence of the meaning of the three secret mantras (mysteries) abides in my mind.
SANSKRIT VERSE:
I bow to those great men who have refuted the arguments of men *that chop logic and ask, “Why and wherefore ?&amp;quot;, in connection with the truths of) the sastra which treats (in two parts) of karma and Brabman.</description>

      <description>(2) THE CHAPTER ON THE DETERMINATION OF WHAT IS BEST ?
NOTE &amp;ldquo;The Three Mysterics&amp;rdquo; have been occasionally referred to in previous chapters. Sri Vedantadesika presumes that everyone of his readers knows what they are. It is just possible that some of them are not in the know of these mysteries. So a brief account may be necessary of these mantras.
  One of them is called Ashtakshara or Tirumantra.</description>

THE CHAPTER ON THE MOST IMPORTANT AND DISTINCTIVE DOCTRINE THAT IS UNIQUE TO VISISTADVAITA.
SANSKRIT VERSE:
When Bhagavin is seen in the mirror of the &amp;lsquo;Vyapaka mantras, which disclose His all-pervasiveness, one will see that the universe (which we perceive with our senses) is abaolutely dependent on Him for its existence and continuance and likewise for its activity and the fruit or result arising from it; since the universe is supported and controlled by Him and is also solely for the fulfilment of His purposes, one will understand that it is the body of the Primeval Creator.</description>

      <description>THE CHAPTER ON THE FIVE THINGS THAT  SHOULD BE KNOWN TO EVERY SEEKER
AFTER SALVATION.
SANSKRIT SLOKA:
In the &amp;lsquo;&amp;amp;&amp;rsquo; in Om and in the word &amp;lsquo;Narayana&amp;rsquo; occurring in Ashtakshara, the supreme end of life (i.e.) Bhagavan, who is opposed to all that is objectionable or faulty, is indicated; in the in in om and in the part nära occurring in Nārāyaṇāya, the essential natare (svarūpa) of the jiva who is to attain this end is dis</description>

(5) THE CHAPTER ON THE THREE &amp;lsquo;REALS&amp;rsquo;
(OR TATVAS)
SANSKRIT SLOKA:
The delusion that the soul is nothing but the body and the senses (prakriti) disappears when one has a knowledge of the distinctive features of sentient beings and non-sentient things. So also the disputes on such questions as the unity of the jiva and God will no longer continue, when the characteristic features of each of them are marked out.</description>

      <description>०६ परदेवतापारमार्थ्याधिकारः
THE CHAPTER ON THE TRUTH CONCERNING  THE SUPREME DEITY.
SANSKRIT SLOKA:
Those who are not proficient in the Sastras say that there is only a single self, that all deities (like Indra, Agni and so on) are only one, that the three deities (Brahma, Vishnu and Siva), when properly understood, are alike and of equal rank, that these three deities are only one deity (in three forms) and that the Supreme Deity is other than these three and hold other such (erroneous) views, but those who bave discrimination entertain no regard for these (divergent views).</description>

      <description>(7) THE CHAPTER ON THE ASPIRATION
FOR MUKTI.
SANSKRIT SLOKA:
Who, indeed, is there that will bear the bondage of samsāra &amp;ndash; who that has understood the revolutions of time, the nature of matter (prakriti) and its evolutes or modifications which cause contraction of knowledge, the evils attendant on the enjoy. ment of the pleasures of this world and of svarga, the experience of sufferings resulting from sia which resemble &amp;amp; pit of fire, the true relationship that exists necesgarily between himself and the Supreme Being, the region of divine bliss and also the nature of the body which is like a prison-house ?</description>

      <description>(8) THE CHAPTER ON THE CLASSIFICATION
OF QUALIFIED PERSONS.
SANSKRIT SLOKA:
Even though the desire for moksha is the same, a distinction arises among those who practise the vidyās or forms of meditation prescribed in the s&amp;rsquo;rutis, &amp;amp;s a result of their respective qualifications or competence in regard to such vidyās as Madhuvidyā, Sadvidya and so on. In the same way, &amp;amp; distinction arises between the adoption of prapatti and other vidyās (which are of the nature of bhakti or devout meditation), as a result of an unseen power or destiny depending on past karma which brooks no questioning.</description>

OF THE MEANS OR UPAYA FOR
ATTAINING (MUKTI).
SANSKRIT SLOKA.
Bhagavan is declared in the Upanishads to be Himself the weans (upāya) of attaining Him. The ways of bhakti and prapatti are indicated for winning His grace. The adoption of these *ways is the result of the great ripening of meritorious deeds (done in the past ) and, even for this, Bhagavan, who has the ability to create everything, is Himself the cause.</description>

WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE (1. E.) PRAPATTI.
SANSKRIT SLOKA.
When Bhagavan, who is omnipotent, who knows all things and who is, by His nature, full of love for us, has accepted the res. ponsibility (of protecting us ), there is nothing more remaining to be done by us here for it; let us therefore fix our souls in that boundless sex of supreme bliss and feel the satisfaction (of having attained our object) by becoming rich in rendering service to Him, poor though we may have been before.</description>

AFTER PRAPATTI.

OF OUR ULTIMATE OBJECT IN LIFE.
SANSKRIT SLOKA:
In the world of everyday life (a king sometimes uses his dependents and ornaments to serve the purposes of those who are dear to bim like bis sons, wives etc.) and in the Vedas, it is declared that all the gods make their offeriogs to the devotee. Even 80, the Lord of Lakshmi uses sentient beings and non-sentient things to serve for ever the purposes of those who have won His regard, because He is independent and is their Master.</description>

(17) THE CHAPTER ON THE ORDINANCES
IMPOSED BY THE SASTRAS.
SANSKRIT SLOKA:
Having laid, on Mukunda, the responsibility for his protection and become free from sin like those released from samsāra, the prapanna walks along the path laid down in the stāstras until his release from bondage, since (unlike the mukta) he cannot read the mind of the lord directly and since the path has been ordained for us by the command of the Omnipotent Lord and since, by straying from that path, he will immediately bring, on himself and on others, ills of various kinds.</description>

      <description>(18) THE CHAPTER ON THE ATONEMENT
FOR OFFENCES.
SANSKRIT SLOKA :
This embodied being (the Jiva) obtains the grace of Madhava by the result of past karma (luck), for the removal of his sins &amp;ndash; the grace of Madhava which, by its purity, delightfulness, boliness and efficacy is like the (holy) Mandakini whose waters are clear, sweet, always pure (white) and efficacious. (That is, he becomes a prapanna ). If, in spite of this, he still makes bis body unclean by wallowing in the mire of the stream of wretcbed sense pleasures, his company is avoided by the wisa (but this would not stand in the way of his attainment of noksha after death).</description>
