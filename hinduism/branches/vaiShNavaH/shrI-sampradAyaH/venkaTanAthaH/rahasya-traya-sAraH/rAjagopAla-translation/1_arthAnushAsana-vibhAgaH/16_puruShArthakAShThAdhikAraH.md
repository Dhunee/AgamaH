(16) THE CHAPTER ON THE FARTHEST EXTENT 

OF OUR ULTIMATE OBJECT IN LIFE. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

In the world of everyday life (a king sometimes uses his dependents and ornaments to serve the purposes of those who are dear to bim like bis sons, wives etc.) and in the Vedas, it is declared that all the gods make their offeriogs to the devotee. Even 80, the Lord of Lakshmi uses sentient beings and non-sentient things to serve for ever the purposes of those who have won His regard, because He is independent and is their Master. So, for us whose minds have been disciplined by the teaching of such as the prince of sannayasins (viz. Sri Ramanuja), the service of the Lord extends as far as the service of those wbo are dear to Him (Bhagavatas).

REASONS FOR RENDERING SERVICE 

TO BHÄGAVATĀS : 

If it is asked here how it can be stated that the service of Bhagavan extends up to the service of His devotees (the Bbaga vatas), the answer is as follows:- It has been said in the Vedartha Sangraha: "He is the s'esha whose svarība or essential nature is such as is chosen on account of the desire to promote the glory of another and that another is the s'eslii." So in regard to the Supreme Ruler of all, the Jiva who is the sesha is bound to pro mote His glory. That glory will depend on the nature of the s'esha, whether it be sentient or non-sentient. It may be asked, "What is the glory that the jiva is capable of conferring on the Supreme Being? With his body and the like, he can copfer only such glory as non-sentient things do. So this service is common to him and acit. The special glory that he can be the cause of promoting must be by ineans of his intelligence or chaitanya, * When the 

NOTE:- In the sentences that follow the author points out the different ways in which different kinds of people (including those who violate his com mands ) promote His glory as His seshas.

jiva acts against the spirit of the sõstras, Iswara, who is the Ruler and the Dispenser of punishment, enjoys only the delight or delectation of lila and thus attains atisaya glory. It has been said: " Bhagavan, 'who has all beings as His body, rejoices when a jiva does what is good and does not rejoice when the action is evil." When a man acts in accordance with the stāstras, he gives thereby delight to the Lord and thus does not let his generosity and other qualities run to waste, but promotes the glory of the Lord so that He extols binn as in the words :-"All those are", indeed, generous". In the same way as the muktas (released souls) and the nityas (the sūris ) promote the glory of the Lord by direct percep tion of the Lord's will and by acting in such a way as to give Him bhoga or enjoyment, the prapanias, too, can give rise to a special kind of bhoga or enjoyment to the Lord and thus promote His glory as stated in the following sloka:-"When shall I*always be Thy servant, look upon Thee as my Master and in this way give Thee delight?". The prapanna learns the Lord's will from the sästras (though not directly ) and renders service to the Lord. 

THE LORD IS PLEASED AT THE SERVICE RENDERED 

TO HIS DEVOTEES : 

When a man gives rise to Iswara's lila rasa by actions opposed to the sāstras, it will end in his ruin. If, in the state of bondage, he acts according to the Lord's will as revealed in the sāstras and, in the state of moksha, by direct peroeption of the Lord's will, he will not only promote the Lord's lilū rasa and bhoga but incidentally attain his own desired objects. When the Jiva acts on any occasion consciously, since his desired fruit, incidental though it be, has to come from the will of the lord, the latter has to be ascertained from the s'astras which disclose that the service rendered to His devotees is most delightful to him. 

3. Alavandar Stotram : 46 

1. Mahabharata: Santiparva: 199-25 2. Bhagavad Gita: 7-18162 The following authoritative texts may be studied in this connection: "Of all forms of homage, the homage paid to Vishnu is the best, but superior even to this, is the excellent homage or adoration offered to Vishnu's devotees", "I have great affection to those who are devoted to my devotees. Therefore should one render devout service to them." "Devotion to me is of eight forms: (1) love to my devotees without any thought of their faults; (2) rejoicing at the adoration offered to nie by another; (3) delight in listening to stories concerning me; (4) a change in the voice, in the eyes and in the body, while listening to such stories; (5) trying to offer adoration to me; (6) freedom from hypocrisy in one's relations with me; (7) meditation of me at all times; (8) and not considering me as one from whom worldly benefits can be bad - if bhakti (which is of these eight forms) is found in a mleccha, he should be respected as the best of Brahmins endowed with jnana and bhakti; he is a real sannyāsi, he is a wiso man and he may be taught (the scriptures) and from him one may learn the truth. He is fit to be adored even like myself.", "They are 'my bhaktas or dovotees who do not show devotion to any other deity, who love those that are devoted to me and that have SODE ht me as their upaya", "I offer adoration also to those who offer adoration to that yajna varāha, who is of boundless splen. dour", "By *see king the protection of those who seek the Lord as their refuge and by rendering service to him who is devoted to the devotee, that is in turn) devoted to the devotee of the Lord - by doing so, men are released from all their sins." 

When we study these passages, (it beomes clear) that, of all forms of service which a s'esha of the Lord may reader, that rendered to the Bhagavatas is the most important and is the most pleasing to the Lord, in the same way as the fondling of the prince is most pleasing to the king.

In this matter, if we examine the path of the pramānas, Iswara, who has the Bhagavata es His body, is the object of worship as is declared in the sloka: "Those who worship the pitris, the gods, the Brahmins and Agni -- they worsbip only the Lord who is the inner self of all creatures". If, on the other hand, we consider the thought of the Prakari who says "He 18 dear to me also" and who is ever at the disposal of the man that is exclusively devoted to Him on account of His love for him, as bas been said in the sloka : "Among them the jnānī ig my very self" the Lord would be pleased at the service rendered to the Bhagavata, as if it were service rendered (directly) to His own inner self and not as that done to His body. 

In addition to its causing plassure to the s'eshi, the relationship of the jiva to Iswara as His s'esha is also mediately through the Bhagavata. Therefore his service to the Lord may also be mediato through the Bhagavuta. This may be explained as follows: 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

To the Supreme Being who is always with Lakshmi and who looks upon His devotees as His very self, the attribute of being & seshī may be both by being a seski along with Lakshmi and by being a seshi mediately through the devotees". (That is, those who look upon themselves as s'eshas to His devotees sro, mediately through these devotees, s'eshas to the Lord Himself). A king who is independent and who takes & pleasure in acting as he pleases places the ornaments and garlands worn by himself round the necks of his servants and of his elephants and horses. (Tiruppapalvar says):-- "The Lord who "is spotless and who has mnade ine the servant of His servants". (So does Narada say): "I, Narada, have come here with an eager longing to see you. To men like me, O Brahmin, those who are bkaktas of the Lord are masters" and again (Tirumangai Alvar says ); - "I will not 18 9. Mahabharata: Santi parva

remain in the company of those who think there is any other deity deserving of adoration thao Thee; also what I have accepted with delight is the duty of serving Thy devotees". According to these passages, since the jiva is absolutely subject to the will of the Lord and since the service of the s'esha is due also to those who are favourites of the Lord, our being a s'esha to the Lord extends even to the Bhagavatas and should last as long as the self lasts. Our being s'eshas to Bhagavatas arises from their being devotees to the Lord and pertains to our essential Datare. It arises also from their qualities and knowledge, which cause & desire in us to serve them. (As Lakshinada says) "I "am his younger brother (by birth); I have become his servant by his qualities". (That this relationship of being & s'esha is due both to our essential nature and to (our admiration for) their wisdom and character) is also indicated (respectively in the two phrases(1) "bhaktas of the lord and to "men like me" (in the speech of Narada quoted above). Perialvar, the (great) commentator of Kalpa siitras stated (in this connec tion):- "These who are 15 the servants of Bhagavatas and who utter the names of Bhagavan are entitled even to sell us". This is the purport of the middle world in Tirumantra, namely, namo: na mama (not for me). If we reflect on this purport, our beiog sesha to the Lord is both mediate (through the Bhagavatas) and immediate (direct to Him). Accordingly, the service that should be rendered by the sesha is also (both ) mediate and direct. Therefore it is the farthest limit of the service of the prapanna to perform, as much as it lies in his power, service to the Bhāgavata, since it is part of the duty of one who is s'esha to Bhagavān. So this outermost region of service to Bhagavatas should be kept properly cultivated so that it may not become fallow land full of weeds. 

. As stated in the following slokas in Poushkara samhita, "It is 16 not wrong for a wedded wife to honour her husband and to honour his servants, whether in his presence or in his absence."

and "Anong? the Lord's retinue are two classes: those that are dear to bim and worthy of His trust and those who are not. To the former class belong the nityas, the muktas and the Bhagavatās. 

To the latter class belong Brahma and the other gods who are subject to the sway of past karma. The seeker after raukti should not adore the latter;" the devotee who is exclusively attached to the Lord and whose dharma resembles that of a chaste wife would therefore do well to act according to the will of his Lord. Since the relationsbip of s'esha to Bhagavatas arises from no other cause than the knowledge of our being sesha only to the Lord and to no other, this service to Bhagavatas is not improper, (because it does not arise from other causes like the desire for wealth or power ). 

BHAGAVATĀS ARE SESHAS TO ONE ANOTHER: 

If it is asked whether this relationship of being s'esha to Bhügavatās is due to one's nature or whether it is adventitious (due to upādhi), the answer is, that it is both natural and adventi. tions. In as much as it lasts as long as the self lasts and will continue also in the state of inoksha, it may be called natural. 

Dives not Koorattalvan s2y) :-"When shall I join the eternal siiris who are always eager to be s'eshas to one another p" (This relationship of a sesha will continue even after release from bondage). It may be said to be adventitious also (due to upādhi or conditions), as it arises from a knowledge of one's relationship to Bhagavan. 

If so, it may be asked, "If both are Bhagavatas, would it not be inconsistent that they should be both s'esha and s'eshī to each other?" The answer is as follows:- There is nothing inconsistent in this, as it is possible for the same person to render help to another and also to receive help from him. (In the performance of a sacrifice), the sacrificer who performs it for the sake of some gain or benefit (phala) is the s'eshi but when he is considered as the doer of the sacrifice, he is s'esha in relation to the sacrifice.

166 CHAPTER 

So also when each of the two Bhagavatas is bent on promoting the glory (atisaya) of the other, without either of them expecting that glory, they become s'eshas by their being the cause of the promo tion of the glory of the other; they are also seshis inasmuch as they are the recipients of the glory (atisaya), though they themselves may not desire it. Since they have been directed by Iswara'd will to promote each other's glory, the relationship of being sesha to Bhagavatas is, in the case of both, based on sästraic authority. 

The relationship of being a servant (dása) to Bhagavan and Bhagavatās owing to an appreciation of their qualities or character adds to one's delight or enjoyment and promotes one's own exaltation. In this, Iswara, by His omnipotence and His will which accompanies it, enables all Bhagavatas to become seshis. Taking their desire also along with His own will, Iswara makes them seshas to Bhagavatas. Since both the Bhagavatas stand in the relation of seshis to each other as having been fit to be directed by the Master to do His will, both of them attain their true and essential nature (svarüpa). They attain the ultimate limit of their purushärtha or goal of life, since they attain the relationship of being s'eshas, which they are eager to have and also the privilege of rendering service to the Bhagavata which follows from it. Since Iswara delights in having directed them to become seshas and s'eshīs to each other, Iswara attains the state of being an Iswara or ruler and of being an enjoyer. Since they realise clearly that this relationship of being seshas and s'eshis to each other contri. butes to the enjoyment (bhoga) of Iswara, they attain the faultless and ultimate limit of purushärtha By those who have done what should be done (prapannas), who understand this subtle truth and are convinced of it, the grace of devotees who are exclusively and supremely attached to the Lord will be desired as an end in itself - devotees who are free from the following stains : the desire for transgressing the Lord's commands, excess of doubt, connection with other deities, enjoyment depending on one's own effort and enjoyment for one's own self.

SERVICE TO BHAGAVATAS 

167 

TAMIL VERSE: 

We that accept the code of conduct prescribed by the Lord, whose auspicious qualities fill, with astonishment, Bhāgavatas who have understood the meaning of the Vedas - We conduct ourselves in such a way that we do not deviate from the righteous path ordained in the eternal Vedas in rendering service to His good devotees with extreme reverence to them. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

With our words which emit a fragrance that would be eagerly desired by the lotus which arose in the pond of the Lord's navel, we do not beg of the Lord the pleasures of this world and of svarga which are like straw nor kaivalya nor even moksha. We oply pray that we should have the grace of the pure and firm-minded Bhagavatas, who are like the chaste wives in the royal harem, for their grace is like the dawn which beralds the day of the splen. dour of moksha,
