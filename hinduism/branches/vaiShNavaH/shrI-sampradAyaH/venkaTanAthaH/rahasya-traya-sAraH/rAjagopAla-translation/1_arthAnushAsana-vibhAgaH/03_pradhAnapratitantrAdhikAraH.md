THE CHAPTER ON THE MOST IMPORTANT AND DISTINCTIVE DOCTRINE THAT IS UNIQUE TO VISISTADVAITA. 

SANSKRIT VERSE: 

When Bhagavin is seen in the mirror of the 'Vyapaka mantras, which disclose His all-pervasiveness, one will see that the universe (which we perceive with our senses) is abaolutely dependent on Him for its existence and continuance and likewise for its activity and the fruit or result arising from it; since the universe is supported and controlled by Him and is also solely for the fulfilment of His purposes, one will understand that it is the body of the Primeval Creator. By realis ing this relationship of the universe being the body of the Creator, one is enabled to reach the heart of the Srutis, which were not composed by any one and which have the deepest significance. 

WHAT IS MEANT BY PRATITANTRA? THE MEANING 

OF SARĪRA - SARIRI BHĀVA: 

The word Pratitantra means a doctrine or feature which is peculiar and distinctive to a certain (pbilosophical or religious) system exclusive of all others. Here it may be asked what the doctrine that is most important and unique to our system of Vedanta is. It is the doctrine which maintains that the relation ship between Iswara and the world of sentient beings and non sentient things is that between the soul and the body. (Another is the doctrine that every word, whatever its ordinary depotation may be, such as 'cow' "man" and the like, refers ultimately to Iswara who is within them as their innermost soul). 

NOTE:-- \*Vyapaka mantras: These are (1) Ashtakshara (2) Shadakshara, the mantra with six letters (Namo Vishnave with Pranava at the beginning) and (3) Dvadasakshara, the Mantra with twelve letters (Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya with pranava at the boginning)

WHAT IS A SARĪRA AND WHAT IS A SARIRI : 

Iswara is called the inner self or soul (Sariri), because as long as they exist, He is, in regard to sentient and non-deatient substances (dravya), their sopport (adhara), their controller or ruler (niyanta) and their Lord or Master (Seshi) for whose purposes they exist. Sentient beings and non-sentient things form His body, since, with regard to Him, they stand as substances supported by Him, controlled by Him, and existing solely for the fulfilment of His purposes, throughout their existence. Iswara is called the Supporter and the Controller oz Ruler of all sentient beings and non-sentient things, because from His swarupa or essential nature and His sankalpa or will, they derive their existence, continuance and activities as \* befitting each of these two (svarüpa and sankalpa). It may be asked how this could be. Just as Iswara is the abodo, asraya or üdhāra (support) of the attributes which define His essential nature (svarüpa viz. Satyam, Jnanan, Anandam and the like) and of the other qualities possessed by Him with His essential nature so defined (qualities like compassion and &ccessibility), He is also the inseparable and direct support, (äsraya or ādhara) of all substances (sentient and non-sentient) other than Himself. He is also the support, through these substances ((1.0.) indirectly), of the qualities that pertain to them. There are some who hold that Iswara is the support, through the jivas, of the bodies supported by the jīvas. Some Acharyas say (on the other hand) that both directly by His essential Dature and indirectly through the jīvas, He is the support of these bodies. 

ISWARA'S SUPPORT BY HIS SVARŪPA AND 

BY HIS WILL. 

In relation to Iswara,. all (substances ), sentient and non. gentient, are attributes that are inseparable from Him (Aprithak 

NOTE \* 

As befitting each of these two - By His syarupa, He is the cause of their existence and continuance. this is being their support; by His Sankalpa or will also, He is the cause of their oxistence, continuance and activities, this is being their controllar.

siddha viseshanas). Therefore their existence and the like depend entirely on the existence of their support (i. e.) Ioware. The exis. tenee of all things is also dependent on His will. Those of them that have only & temporary existence take their origin from a temporary will or sankalpa of His and those of them that are eternal (like Vaikunta and the sūris ) exist for ever by His eternal will. This distinction has been stated by one who is worthy of respect for his learning in the (following) sloka :-"The 'existence of all things is only by Thy will. Of these some are eternally dear to Thee and are bence eternal and even these eternal beings or things are entirely dependent on Thee for their essential nature." 

Since the continuance of a thing is merely the continuity of its existence, everything, (i. e.) existence and continuance, is dependent on His will. There are heavy substances that are stated in the s'ästras to be supported by Iswara's will. For instance, the following sloka says: "The Heavens,2 the sky with the moon, the sun and the stars, the different quarters, the earth, the great ocean - all these are supported by the might of the Supreme Being, Vasudeva.” It is stated here that, in regard to keeping these heavy things in their respective places without their falling away from them, the existence, continuance and activity of these things depend on Iswara's will. The word 'supported' (in the sloka) means is dependent on His will'. If it be asked how, when every substance is supported by His will, the essential Datare (svarupa) of Iswara can bave anything to do with them, the answer is that the will of the Supreme Being ordains that these objects should be supported by His essential Dature ( svarüpa ). Thas all tbings are dependent on Iswara's essential nature and also on Iswara's will. In the world (of daily life) also, we find that the body is supported by the essential nature (svarapa) of the soul or self and also by the will of the self. Since the body exists from

the time of the entry of the soul into it and perishes or disintegrates when the soul leaves it, it is known to be supported by the svarupa or essential nature of the soul. In the state of dreamless sleep (sushupti) and the like, when the will of the self is dormant, the body continues to exist without any deterioration; so its existence then is clearly dependent on the svarupa of the self and not its will (or sankalpa). In the waking state, when the body is kept from falling, it is sustained by the will or sankalpa of the soul. When the existence of the body is dependent only on the svarūpa of the self or its essential pature, it is said to be supported (adheyatva) by the latter; and when the existence depends on the will or sankalpa it is said to be controlled and directed by the latter (niyāmyatva). 

WHAT IS THE MEANING OF SESHA-SESHI BHAVA? 

Iswara is said to be the s'eshin of all things, because they exist solely for the fulfilment of His purposes. They are His s'eshas, The following sloka explains how Iswara is is the seshin of all: \* The Sutterance of the Upanishads is to the effect that the Lord takes in both sentient and non-sentient things for the fulfilment of His own purposes, by being the cause of their existence, their continuance and their control. In regard to one of the two (i.e.) the sentient being), Thou art both the end to be attained (upēya) and the means of attaining it (upāya). This is Thy essential nature and not an adventitious quality of Shine. Therefore, O Thou that hast Thy repose in Srirangam, I seek refuge in Thee without any selfish interest." 

THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE. 

Sentient beings and non-sentient things exist not for their own sake but for the fulfilment of God's purposes. Their nature is ever to exist for somebody else (i.e.) the Lord. In using them for His own purposes, His glory is manifested. This is being

.. 

Seshi. "But" it may be asked, "what does this sentient being gain by being supported and controlled by Him and by existing solely for his master ?" The answer is as follows: By having the Lord as his adhāra, the Jiva becomes an inseparable attribute of the Lord even like His own attributes, Jnana and sakti or power. By being the Lord's sesha and by havicg the Lord as his seshi, the jiva acquires a taste for an ultimate goal or end which is appropriate to his essential nature, for every being aims at & goal or end suited to the conception held by it about its nature. By being the sesha of the Lord and by having Him as his controller and ruler, he comes to know the specific means or upāya (viz Bhagavan) of attaining the goal or ultimate aim suited to his essential nature. This upāya or means (is the Lord Himself who is the only proper means for the attainment of this end and who) does not require any auxiliary aid for helping Him. From what has been said above, it follows that this sentient being has no other support, exists for no body else, and has no other protector than Bhagavan. 

THE PRESENCE OF THESE IDEAS IN THE THREE 

MYSTERIES OR MANTRAS. 

If it be asked how this idea is contained in the first mystery (i.e.) ashtakshara, the answer is as follows:- The word . Nara. yana' is a compound word which means either "Ho to whom Nārāh are a resting place (ayana )", in which case it is a posges. sive adjective compound (bahuvrihi samāsa), or " the resting place of nārāh (i.e.) mon", in which case, it is & determinative compound in which the first part Nārāh is in the genitive case (i.e.) nārānām f ayanam ( which is qualified by the genitive.) The compound word Narayana interpreted in these two ways establi shes His being the support (of everything) and of His pervading it. From this it would follow that the jiva, in his essential nature, has no other support and is pervaded by no other than Narayana The words Om and Namo which precede Narayanāya imply that the jiva exists for Narayana and is entirely dependent upon Him 

THE DISTINCTIVE DOOTRINE

for protection. It would follow therofrom that the jiva serves no other purpose than that of Narayana and that he has no other refuge or protector-than He. 

In Duayam which is, as it wore, & gem of a mantra and which discloses the activity or process of self surrender (prapatti) to the Lord, the first part reveals that the jiva has no other refuge than Narayana and the second that he exists for no purposes other than those of Narayana, while, in both parts, the idea of the jiva having no other support (adhara) is evident (from the word Narayana ). 

Similarly these ideas may be discerned in the charama sloka also, either directly and explicitly in the words themselves or by implication or parport arising indirectly from the meaning of the words. 

The charama sloka declares that Bhagavan is Himself the already existing and established means (siddha upaya) for attaining Him, for He is ever ready to help us to attain Him, and that, in order to secure His help, we have yet to accomplish or adopt a means (sädhya upaya), which is self-surrender (s'aranägati) to the lord. This sädhyopāya, namely, self surrender or saražāgati is performed by uttering the dvayam and the thoughts that we should bear in mind at that time are concisely disclosed in the Tirumantra or Ashtākshara as in a little mirror reflecting bigger forms. 

The (two) meanings of the first word OM (aum) are illustrated in Arjupa's chariot and in the (famous) sloka of the Rāmāyana which says:- Rama went first. Sita walked in the middle, and Lakshmana, bow in band, walked behind, following them. The word OM is constituted of three parts a, u, aod m; a, which is seen first, means Bhagavan, the Protector or Saviour, who is seen first in Arjuna's chariot, and m means the jiva, Arjuna, the object of protection who is seen afterwards; u moans, only; it may also 

4. Ramayana; Aranya kanda. OH APTER 

mean lakshmi. When u refers to Sri or Laksbmi, the two seshis, Bhagavan and Sri appear first and the s'esha appears after wards. In the sloka quoted from the Rāmāyana, first we think of the Saviour, then we think of Lakshmi and then of Lakshmane who is their s'esha. So also is pranava or aum; a, u and in refer respectively to the Saviour, Lakshmi who pleads for the jiva and then the jiva who requires their protection. The second word in Tirumantra, viz, namo or namah means "adoration" or "I adore", This brings out explicitly, by the word itself, the idea of the jīva being entirely dependent on the Lord. Since Bhagavan is pleased with those who serve His devotees (Bhagavatās), it is implicitly stated in the word namas that we depend also on Bhagavatas and are subject to their direction and control. Illustrations of these may be found respectively in the lives of the devotees, Bharata and Satrughna (the former of whom delighted in obeying and serv ing Rama and the latter in obeying and serving Bharata). 

The third word in Tirumantra is Nārāyanāya, wbich is the dative or fourth case of Narayana. (The word Narayan, has two meanings: (1) the resting place or refuge of naras or living beings) and (2) He wbo bas naras (living beings) as His abode or resting place. This means that the jīva depends for his very existence on Narayana and that Narayana's glory (vibhūti) cannot manifest itself without the jiva. It has therefore been well said: "I do not exist without thee, O Nārāyana, nor dost Thou without me". Nārāyanñya, which means for Narayana' should be copstrued along with some such word as syam or bhaveyam and the meaning would then be, “ May I exist for Narayana"! These meanings of the word Narayana may be seen illustrated in all created beings of Kosala (who could not bear their existence without Sri Rana and who departed this world along with Him, and in Sri Rama, too, who departed with them. 

The first word, Pranava (aum), signifies that m, the jiva, exists only for a (aya) and the second word namo that the jiva depends on Bhagavān. His existence is for Bhagavad and His

devotees, to the latter of whom the s'eshatva extends as its ultimate limit, and he depends absolutely on Bhagavan and His devotees In the light of this interpretation, the third word Närāvanāya has, for its purport, the goal of the jiva, vis, kainkarya or service to the Lord and His devotees. This service may be seen illustrated in an active form in that of Lakshmand and in a passive form in the sandals \* of Sri Rama which were an incarnation of Lakshmana or Adisesha and which left Rama's feet to go along with His devotee, Bharata. (In these instances) the service is such as would be pleasing to the s'eshi (namely, Bhagavan). 

All this elucidation and illastration of the meaning of Tirumantra were vouchsafed by Sri Appullar. The implicit and explicit meanings contained in Duayan and the Charama sloka should be understood on the same lines. 

IN REGARD TO BEINGS ENDOWED WITH INTELLI 

GENCE, SESHATVA MEANS DĀSATVA: 

In these mysteries Iswara is disclosed as the s'eshi (i.e.) as one for whom everything else exists. He stands in the relation of s'eshi to both sentient beings and non-sentient things in common, In relation to non-sentient things He is Seshi, because they exist for His purposes. In relation to sentient beings or jivas endowed with intelligence, He is s'eshī in the special sense of being Swami (i.e.) Master whom it is their duty to serve, and this is the manner in which we should anderstand while uttering the manträs. Our being sesha to the Lord we share in common with non-sentient things but we are s'eshas in the special sense also of being His servants (dāsāh). 

The ordinary relationship of Sesha and Seshin between the jīva and Bhagavan is disclosed in the first syllable of the Ashtak. shara, vis, aum where the a, the first member, is in the dative 

NOTE: Lakshmana is a partial incarnation of Adisesha and Adisesha serves the Lord as His sandals. His bed, and so on. Therefore the sandals' of Rama am, in a sense, the incarnation of Lakshmana. .

case aya, though the termination has dropped. It means for a or Bhagavan'. The specifio form of being seshas which applies only to jivas (and not to non-sentient things ) and which is really being the servants of the Lord ( dāsas) and of His being the Swami or Master is revealed in the parport or implication. So also in the word 'Narayanaya' there is the general relationship of the seshin towards all things and the specific relationship of Swami or Master which obtains in the case of jivās. Here the goal of use. fulness to the Lord, which is the result of the general attitude of the s'esha, becomes the goal of service or kainkarya to the Lord, owing to the jiva being His servant or dāsa. Thus by being the s'eshin, Iswara attains a unique glory and as a consequence of His being the Swami or Master, this glory consists in the enjoyment of service which is His purushärthu. Iswara is responsible for the protection of His servants and has also the power to do so, whereas the jīva or Chetana is not responsible for his own protection por has be the ability to protect himself. This is due to Iswara being the unconditional (nirupadhika) s'eshi and the unconditional Director and Ruler. Owing to their being the unconditional sreshas and their being subject unconditionally to His control, it becomes, indeed, the responsibility of the owner to protect what belongs to Him and of the strong to protect the weak. Iswara, however, makes op Eis mind to protect the jiva only after making him adopt some means or upaya for winning His protection, (because the jiva is subject, according to the Sastra to the law of Karma). 

TAMIL VERSE: 

The Lord gave us our existence and is our support (dhāraka) as well; He is also the unconditional Ruler that directs and controls us. There is nothing that does not exist for the fulfilment of his purposes; He is also our Master for whom all things exist; He stands alone with no one to compare with Him. It is the earnest conviction of those who understand the spirit of the Vedas that we are the bodies and the unconditional (or nataral) servants of the

SANSKRIT VERSE: 

If, in the Kali yoga, there is any one supremely wise who can understand this unique and distinctive doctrine of the relationship between Iswars and the world being that between the soul and the body, which was taught by that sovereign sannyäsin (Sri Ramanuja) and which is like the dawn that dispels the darkness of ignorance , then in that place where he is, the tumultuous waves of logical disputation arising from the eagerness to establish the truths of other systems will subside at once.
