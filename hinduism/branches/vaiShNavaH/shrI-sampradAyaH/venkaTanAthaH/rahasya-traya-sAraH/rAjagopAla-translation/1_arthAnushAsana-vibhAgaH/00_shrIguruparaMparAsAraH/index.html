<p>SRIMAD RAHASYATRAYASABA</p>
<p>A BRIEF ACCOUNT</p>
<p>OF</p>
<p>THE SUCCESSION OF ACHARYAS</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA :</p>
<p>(With due devotion) we repeat the expression of adoration to our gurus and likewise to their gurus; and among these (latter), We pray for the grace of the Primeval Couple (Narayana and Lakshmi), the twin s&rsquo;eshis* of all the worlds (so that they may be both the end to be attained by us and the means of attaining it). TAMIL VERSE.</p>
<p>Having carefully studied the beautiful hymns subg with delight in Tamil by seers, we have come to understand the real meaning of the regions of the Upanishads which are otherwise difficult to comprehend - seers known as Poygai Mudi, Bhutamuni, Peyalvar, Kurugesan (Nammalvar) who was born on the banks of the cool Tamraparni, Vishnuchittan, the pure-minded Kulasekbara, our Pananathan, Thondaradippodi, the splendour that appeared in Mazhigai ( Tirumazhisai alvar) and the prince of Mangai armed with sword and spear for making bright the path of the Vedas throughout the world.</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>To those who venture to attain release from the bondage of sam. sāra, the ancient path indicated to as by the spotless Madhurakavi</p>
<p>* A sesha is one who exists solely for the purposes of another. That other is seshi.</p>
<p>Note: (1) The commentator says that Vishnuchittan stands for Vishnu chittan and also for his daughter Andal, the authoress of many hymns. by his own example is the only safe 2 path, for while there is Sri Krishna, the great cowherd, who incarnated solely for the sake of bis devotees to confer bliss on them, to be their refuge, to be their final goal, to stand in relation to them as mother, father, brother and so on, to change their desire for the pleasures of this world into a desire for Himself, to remove all their sins, to show them infinite compassion, to reveal the truth, and so also to bring about in them a likeness to Himself - while there is Sri Krishna ever ready to do all this, 3 be sought only the feet of the sage Satagopa (Nammälvār) who rendered in Tamil the truths con tained in the Vedas which are otherwise hard to understand.</p>
<p>THE ACHARYA ESSENTIAL FOR MOKSHA :</p>
<p>It is said in the Smritis: &ldquo;Kshatrabandbu* !, wbo was the worst of singers, and * 2 Pundarika, the virtuous - both of them obtained moksha or release from bondage by virtue of their having ūchüryas.&rdquo; It is thus declared that in the case of every one, the only means of securing moksha is to have an ächārya. To the man desirous of moksha, the line of achäryas is stated in the Sruti 3 to extend upward even to the Supreme Bhagavan for purposes of meditation.</p>
<p>Note (2) safe path: This means Bhakti and Prapatti which lead to moksha. Acharya bhakti is called bhakti and prapasti as it leads to them.</p>
<p>Note (3) Madhurakavi in his decade of Tamil verses, says that, to him, Nammalvar is the only God and that through him, he expects to derive all the benefits that men expect to have from God Himself. The path indicated by him is that of devotion to the Acharya for attaining mukti as well as other things.</p>
<p>* 1 Kshatrabandhu led the life of a highwayman in a forest. He was a source of terror to the sages who lived in that forest. Once when the sage Narada happened to pass by him, he rushed at him with his stick. Narada took pity on him and asked him to find out from his wife and children whether they would share the sin he was committing, as it was done for their sako. They refused and Kshatrabandhu realised his folly and begged to be instructed by Narada in the truths of religion.</p>
<p>* 2 Pundarika was a virtuous Brahmin, who, though he followed the righteous path and went on a pilgrimage to holy places, did not get a vision of God. It was only after being initiated into the Ashtakshara by Narada that he realised God.</p>
<p>3 The sruti referred to here means - “This linc of the acharyas extends up to Bhagavan thus: This is his acharya; his acharya is so and so and so on up to the Lord&quot;.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY</p>
<p>BHAGAVĀN THE FIRST ACHARYA:</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is the foremost of all acharyas, as may be seen from the following passages - &ldquo;Him! (Sri Krishna) who is possessed of all excellences, who is the acharya, father and guru&rdquo;, &ldquo;Narayana? who is the guru of all the world is also my guru&rdquo;, &ldquo;Thoa? art my kinsman, and Thou art my guru&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Thou art the guru of all the worlds and likewise their goal&rdquo;. It is He that, at the beginning, vouchsafed the Vedas to Brahma and when they were stolen, brought them back to him and through him spread their knowledge in the world. It is He that blessed Brahma&rsquo;s sons, Sanatkumara and others, to anderstands all truths by themselves and to follow the path of renunciation. Through them He revealed the means of attaining sålvation. It is Bhagavan who, later by the agency of such great seers as Narada, Parasara, Suka and Soubaka, quaintained intact the tradition of the Upanishads. It has been said &ldquo;know that Vyasa who is other. wise called Krishna Dvaipayana is the Lord Narayana Himself. Who else is there in the world, O Maitreya, that could cow pose the Mahābhārata ?&rdquo; It has also been said, “Devoutly 7 uttering the Dane of that great sage (Vysa), Bhishma said with folded hands &ldquo;. Into such great men as Vyasa referred to above the Lord entered and through them published to the world great works like Maha bhārata and Sarīraka Mimūmsa (Brahma Sutras). Further in such incarnations as Hamsa, Matsya, Hayagriva, Nara, Narayana, and the Gītācharya (Sri Krishon), He himself stood out and revealed spiritual traths and also the means of attaining moksha (tatva and hita). He had bis invaluable teaching confirmed also</p>
<p>i Mahabharata; Sabha Parva : 41-21. Acharya here means one who teaches Brahma Vidya and guru one who teaches the Vedas. This verse was spoken by Sahadeva to those assembled at the Rajasuya sacrifice, .</p>
<p>2 Vishnu Purana 5:1-14. 3 Mahabharata : Gandhari&rsquo;s words. 4 Alavandar&rsquo;s Stotram: 60. S Mahabharata: Santi Parva: 349.71. 6 Vishnu Purana : 3:45. 7 Mahabharata: Adi Parva: 11441. through the words of such men of wisdom as Bhishma. It has been said &ldquo;Narayana Himself dictated the whole of the Pancharātra&rdquo;, When this Sastra which was originally taught by Him became lost, once again at the end of the Dvapara Yuga and the beginning of the Kali Yuga, Heo revealed it again through Sankarshana in accordance with the ordinances of the Satvatas so that all castes, Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras, might, after initiation by the acharya with the prescribed marks (Sankha and Chakra), worship and render service to the lord in the performance of their daily duties with their minds set on the Eternal. As is said in the following verse, “In the yoga of Kalino, the Lord Achyuta enters into the respective persons of men already born and carries out His designs&rdquo;, Narayana Assumed a new series of ten incarna. tions in the forms of Parankusa (Nammalvar), Parakala (Tirumangai) and others. In these ten avatars, just as clouds take in the water of the ocean and then pour it down in the form of rain 80 essential to the life of every one, the Lord gathered together those parts of the Vedas which are most significant and revealed them briefly in a language (Tamil) wbicb is accessible to every one.</p>
<p>When this path of spiritual life was threatened with obstruction by heretics, open and covert, He incarnated again in the land of Agastya in the forms of many teachers of the true doctrine. Has it not been said, “The god,&quot; Narayana, Himself, assumes a mortal form out of compassion and lifts up the world submerged (in the darkness of ignorance) with the sastras as His hand &ldquo;, and so also, &ldquo;Our la Lord dressed in bis yellow raiment came as the guru out of compassion to impart the teaching of the Veda&rdquo;. In reference to this, the Maharshi, Suka, says, “In thel2 yuga of Kali, devotees of Narayana endowed with spiritual greatness, will</p>

<p>INTRODUCTORY</p>
<p>be born bere and there in large ngmbers in the land of the Dravidas, where flow the rivers, the Tanıraparni, the Vaigai, the Palar, the holy Cauveri and the Mahanadi which runs westwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE SUCCESSION OF VAISHNAVITE ACHARYAS.</p>
<p>Among these acharyas. Nathamuni was the son of Iswara. muni, and he gave us &ldquo;Nyaya Tatvan&rdquo; and &quot; Yoga Rahasyam.&quot; Since Nathanuani received the sacred tradition from one of the spiritual descendants of Madharakavi, and was blessed with spiritual wisdom from a study of Tiruvoymozhi and since, in bis yogic contemplation, Nammalvar appeared to him and taught him the sacred lore, his acharya was Nammalvar himself (though they lived at different times). Nathamuni&rsquo;s son. Was Iswara Bhatta. To Iswara Bhatta was born Alavandar (Yamunacharya). The works of Alavandar are the following eight :-&quot; Āgama Prīmātiyan&quot;, &quot; Purusha Niriiaya&quot;, the three Siddhis, name ly, “ Ātma Siddhi&quot;, &ldquo;Iswara Siddhi&rdquo;, &ldquo;Samvit Siddhi&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sri Gitārtha Sangraha&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stotram&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Tetrad of Slokas,&rdquo; Sottai Nambi was the son of Alavandar. Sottai Nambi&rsquo;s son was Engachchan. Ennachchan had four sons, one of whom was Pillayappar. Pillayappar&rsquo;s son was Thozhappar, Thozhappar had two daughters. The chief disciples who sought the feet of Nathamuni were eight :- Uyyakkoodar, Kurukaikavalappen, Nambi Karunakara Dasar, Erutiruvudaiyar, Thirukkanpamangai Andan, Vanamadevi Andan, Uruppattur Achan Pillai and Sokattur Alvan. Uyyakopdar had five disciples; they are Manakkal Nambi, Tiruvallikkeni Pan Perumal Araiyar, Settalur Sendalangarar, Sri Pundarika Dasar and Ulagapperumal Nangai. The chief disciples of Manakkal Nambi were five; they are Alavander, Deivattukkarasu Nambi, Gomatam Tirovidnagar * Appan, Siruppulloor Avudaiya Pillai and Accbi. Alavandar had fifteen disciples: they are - Peria Nambi, Tirukkottiyar Nambi, Tirumalai Andan, Alavandar Alvar, Tirumualai Nambi, Isandaa Deivavari Andaa, Siriyandan, Tirumohoor Appan, Tirumohoor Ninrar, Deivapperumal, Tirumapgai Aliyar, Pillai Tirumalirus</p>
<p>6 jolai Dasar, Maraner Nambi and Alkondi. Six disciples sought the feet of Perianambi; they were :&ndash; Emperumadar (Sri Rama. aaja), Malaikuniya Ninrar, Arya Sri Satagopa Dasar, Aniaran. gattamudanar, Tiruvoykulamudaiyan Pattar and Tirukkacchi Nambi. Sri Ramanuja learnt the meanings of the rahasyas or mantras at the feet of Tirukkottiyar Nambi. He studied Tiru. voymozhi at the feet of Tirumalai Andan. He learnt Tiruvoymoghi at the feet of Alavandar Alvar and learnt also“ Stotram&quot; and the ancient tradition from him. At the feet of Tirumalai Nambi he studied the Rāmāyana. Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s writings are nine in number: Sri Bhashyam, Deepam, Säram, Vedartha Sangrahan, Sri Gita Bhashyam, Siriya Gadyam (Sriranga Gadyam), Periya Gadyam (Saranāgati Gadyam), Vaikunta Gadyam and Nityam. The names of the chief disciples of Ramanuja may be learnt from the respective tradition of each reader,</p>
<p>BHAKTI TO ACHARYA ESSENTIAL:</p>
<p>It has been said, &ldquo;The wise man should bring his guru to the light (of renown) and should guard the sacred mantra with great care; from the omission to bring his guru to light and by revealing the mantra, he declines in wealth (of knowledge) and in age (spiritual standing).&rdquo; His bringing the guru to light and his omission to do so, it needs no saying, are due to the excess or deficiency of his devotion to his guru.</p>
<p>From * Kata Sruti and 1 Jābala Sruti it is well-known that that all desired knowledge arises from supreme devotion to the guru resenabling that to Bhagavad. This is learnt also from the incident of Sanjaya seeing all things as if they occurred before</p>
<p>| Seshasambita: 14-50 *NOTE: Kata Sruti: This wisdom concerning the soul cannot be obtained</p>
<p>by the mere exercise of reason. Only when it is imparted by another (the guru), does it lead to the knowledge wbich is the means of attaining moksha.</p>
<p>Katopanishad 1.1.9 Jabala says in the Srul: &ldquo;It is only the Vidya or wisdom learnt from an acharya that gives proficiency * Chandogya Upanishad: JY -3</p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY</p>
<p>him, as the result of his supreme devotion to his guru Vyasa. From the episodes of Railwa (and others) it is evident that the guru who does not reveal spiritual traths immediately even to those sishyas who are of excellent character will not be adversely affec ted in his spiritual life. If, on the other hand, the guru reveals these spiritual truths to any and every disciple in the belief that the sishya who has sought him must be good, he will be adversely affected; for, in such cases, it is said that the sins of the disciple become also the side of the guru. This may be seen from the story of Brahma. Without careful enquiry into his fitnese) he revealed truths to Indra. As a consequence Brabma forgot his divine knowledge and had to be taught again by Bhagavan through the agency of Narada, Brahma&rsquo;s very disciple. In the sloka referred to above, the meaning that, by not bringing the guru to light and by improper bringing of the mantra to light, the man suffers decline respectively in wealth and in age is primarily in. tended owing to appropriateness and the support of Jabala and Kata Srutis. There is nothing wrong in interpreting the sloka as meaning also &ldquo;He who omits to bring his guru to light and brings the mantra to light will suffer decline both in wealth (the wealth of spiritual knowledge ) and in age (spiritual standing).&rdquo; It follows from this that a man should bring his guru to light by way of the overflow of his sapreme devotion to him under all conditions and that the sacred mantra should not, for the sake of any mate rial advantage, be revealed to the fickle-minded who do not possess all the qualities prescribed for a disciple. If the mantra is revealed to undeserving persons, its great value wbich is like that of &amp; casket made of rubies containing &amp; precious jewel will suffer and the guru&rsquo;s spiritual greatness will also be adversely affected. The word guru refers, by implication, to the earlier gurus also in the line of ascent extending up to Bhagavan. Or it may mean gurus in general. Similarly the word mantra refers also to the meanings of the mantra and other secret doctrines connected with it. As &amp; rule or vidhi, it bas been laid down that, whenever a map medi tates on these secret meanings or mysteries, he should also medi tate on the lineal succession of gurus. It bas also been said: “As en 13expiation for having conversed with those that are forbidden as unfit (for conversation), we should meditate on the virtuous.&rdquo; By the words &quot; the virtuous &ldquo;, this sloka refers primarily to the. āchāryas.</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having sought the protection of my guru who has graciously taught me that Bhagavan is the Inner Self within me and having also bowed with devotion to the line of his gurus, I seek the refuge of the feet of the Lord, after bowing at the feet of that generous soul who appeared in Sri Perumbudur owing to his compassion ( for his fellow-men), (his guru) Peria Nambi, Alavandar (the guru of Peria Nambi, Manakkal Nambi, Uyyakkondar wbo taught the good path (of prapatti) to Manakkal Nambi, Nathamuni (the guru of Uyyakkondar), Satagopan (Nammalvar) (the guru of Nathamani) and Senainathan (the guru of Nammalvar) and then, of the gracious Lakshmi, sweet to the Lord as ambrosia.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT VERSE:</p>
<p>May these great spiritual teachers, Nathamuni and others, fill my heart here and now with delight, so that I may not be subject to the impact of the arrows of Manmatha (i. e. to the pleasures of the senses )&ndash;teachers who bring us blissful truths of varied kinds from Vedanta, who convey to us (like Bhagiratha) the celestial river of the compassion of the divine couple to be sought in full faith and who are foreigo to the paths of envy, error and decep tion!</p>
<p>SANSKRIT VERSE:</p>
<p>The blissful line of our gurus who are possessed of many auspicious qualities, who have brought down the arrogance of rival controversialists by the successive neighs issuing from Hayagriva who delights in sitting on the throne of their hearts, and whose triumphant banner fixed at the top of the mansion of the four</p>
<p>13 Goutama Dharma Sutra : 9.18</p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY</p>
<p>quarters has, by the flourish of its cloth waving in the breeze, dis pelled the doctrines of their respective systems like tufts of cotton and thereby rendered the good path clear to all this blissful line of our gurus shines supreme.</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>We that cling to the poble qualities and sweet words of the benevolent sage, Ramanuja, who adorns the world with his renown and who, like an elephant, knocking down plantain trees, refuted. the arguments of those that, with the help of their unrestrained logic, wrought great havoc in the straight paths of the * Brahma Sutrās - We (that cling to his words ) and are thereby blessed with spiritual fervour shall no longer (even) think of deeds that are evil.</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>We, who were caught up in the stream of samsāra from time immemorial, and have, now, by a change of fortune, come to acquire a knowledge of our true spiritual nature, consider that Sri Yamunacharya (Alavandar) came into this world to protect Os from being sunk again in the mire of samsära and we will ever be attached to the feet of the sage (Alavandar) who triumphed over his opponents and blessed us with his writings. Never more shall we read the works of heretics.</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>We shall come to new life again by bowing every day at the feet of the noble and generous Nathamuni, who to his (two) Sloving disciples who were like a trumpet and a conch (to proclaim the truth and to cow down the exponents of rival systems) taught the art of music so that they might sing the sweet strains of the Tamil</p>
<p>NOTE: The disputations of thesc acharyas are compared to the succes.</p>
<p>sion of neighings comiag from the God Hayagriva who is seated in their hearts. By these disputations they are said to have put</p>
<p>down the pride of the exponents of rival systems. * (or the Upanishads ) &amp; Two disciples : Kilagathalvan and Melagathalvan.</p>
<p>10 Veda which had been long forgotten in the world and who propa gated in the world, for the pursuit of all, the path of tapas (bhakti and prapatti). In all the four regions of the world there is no one equal to as (because of this devotion of ours to Nathamani).</p>
<p>NOTE: There are some who maintain that this chapter on the succession</p>
<p>of gurus is not part of Srimad Rahasyatrayasara and that the latter begips only with the &ldquo;Introductory Chapter&rdquo;, which followe.</p>
