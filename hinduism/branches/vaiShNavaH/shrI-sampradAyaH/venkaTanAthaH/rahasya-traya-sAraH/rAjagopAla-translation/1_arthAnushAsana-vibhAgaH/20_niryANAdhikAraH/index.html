  <p>(20) THE CHAPTER ON THE DEPARTURE OF THE</p>
<p>SELF (FROM THE BODY)</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>The Lord merges the aggregate of the senses in the mind, the mind with the senses in the vital breath (prāža), the vital breath with these in the self or soul, the self in the subtle elements (Sakshina bhutas ) and the self with these elements in Himself (the Supreme Self) very soon. So far, the process of the soul&rsquo;s departure is common to both the person who has realised Him and the person who has not realised Him. Thereafter, the Lord leads the sell through different veins ( nūdi) which lead either to the (dark) path of smoke or to the shiping path of light (archirādi) or elsewhere in accordance with the qualifications (of each individual).</p>
<p>NOTE:- The soul of the man who has realised Brahman is said to be led through a vein issuing out of the head into the shining path of archis along which it passes into immortality in Vaikunta. The soul of the man who has not realised Brahman is led through other veins into the dark path called dhuma or smoke. He will be born again in samsara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having &lsquo;given up all upāyas, and having given up also all desires including the desire to enjoy one&rsquo;s self, I seek as my refuge, 0, Lord, Thy feet which measured the world.&rdquo; When with these words, the prapanna takes the feet of the Lord, the Lord takes him by the hand, which, it has been said, is the only support of the prupanna: &ldquo;The hands of the Lord who is called Janar dapa and who has been bought with the price of bhakti is the only support for the prapanna.&rdquo; The Lord who has been called &ldquo;the king PA of kings of all (beings)&rdquo; and who is the possessor of the two glories, Lila Vibhūti (in this world) and Nitya Vibhuti or eternal glory in Paramapada, (having taken bim by the hand)</p>

<p>fixes him in a place of His own liking and the prapanna leads his life there, being held in as high regard as an anointed queen and following such occupations as are consistent with his exclusive and supreme attachment to the Lord.</p>
<p>DELAY IN THE ATTAINMENT OF THE GOAL :</p>
<p>Among prapannas, there may be (some ) wbo, on account of certain specific evil deeds done in past lives which have begun to operate now, may become subject to such lapses as the follow. ing :- (1) They may display the feelings of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;mine&rsquo; (ahankāra and manakīra) (2) as a result of these (feelings) they may commit offences; (3) they may display &amp; taste or desire for other objects than the Lord; (4) owing to this desire they may contact other deities; (5) they may be weak-minded; owing to this (weak-mindedness ), they may desire to adopt other upāyas. There may be others who, owing to good deeds done in past lives which have begun to yield their fruits in this life and owing to the specific nature of the request for benefits made at the time of prapatti, have never swerved from the service of the Lord. It may be asked what is the nature of the delay in the release from samsāra in the case of these two classes of prapannas. The answer is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In this matter, prapaninas will never have the feelings of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;wine&rsquo; in any deep-seated form such as the Charvü. kas (materialists) have. Even people who walk warily sometimes stumble; so also prapannas may, on rare occasions, show these feelings; but these improper feelings or potions will disappear by later wisdom originating in reason. (2) In the chapter on the atonement for offences, we explained how, if offences are com. mitted, they will last only until the time of winning pardon or the undergoing of panishment and how the offences will be expiated within the required tine.</p>
<p>In the case of those who performed prapatti without indicata ing any definite tine (for the attainment of moksha), it is said as</p>
<p>198 CH A PTER</p>
<p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>follows: &ldquo;The man who has performed prapatti to me and who has not abstained from sins committed frequently, attains me late after wearing out all his sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(3) &ldquo;Since the prapanna is bent op attaining mioksha, he is not likely to have any long-standing desire for other benefits. Like those who have both Brahna bhāvana and Karma bhavana, (Brahma, Radra and the like), they might entertain a desire for other benefits along with the desire for moksha; if so, Iswara, who is their well-wisher, will not grant them those (so called) benefits ( as they are not for his good); for it is said :-&ldquo;Even when the bhakta prays for it, Iswara does not permit him to do what is not good to himself. Does not the mother prevent her child that longs to fall into the fire ?&rdquo; It is said also :&ndash; &quot; He whom I want to bless &ndash; his wealth I take away from him. His relations will then desert him. He will become miserable. If, in his misery, he still clings to me, I confer on him such blessings as are unattainable even for the devas.&rdquo; The same idea is found in the story of Kunda dhāra. Sometimes Iswara creates in the prapanna a distaste for these other things by making hinu realise that they are trivial, tran sient and mingled with pain. Sometimes, as in the case of Soubbari and Kuchela, he gives them the benefits desired by them, but makes them feel an aversion to them afterwards.</p>
<p>(NOTE:- Kundadhara : A certain man who was devoutly attached to Kundadhara begged him for wealth. Kundadhara, instead of grapting wealth, saw to it that his follower should become attached to dharma).</p>
<p>Thus the man who performed prapatti indicating the time when he should attain moksha, will have acquired an aversion to other benefits than the Lord within the prescribed time. In the case also of the man wbo did not indicate any such time while performing prapatti, there will be delay, as bas been stated in the sloka: - &ldquo;The man who is desirous of performing such karma as is a</p>

<p>means of obtaining other benefits (than God ) enjoys pleasures unmingled with pain, and at last acquires a distaste for them (and the spirit of renunciation ), after which he reaches the abcde of Bhagavan. In accordance with this, the delay in his attainment (of the supreme goal) will be only until the birth of aversion to worldly objects.</p>
<p>(4) In regard to contact with other deities, the Ruler of All will bring bim back some day or other into the company of those who are staunchly and exclusively devoted to Bhagavan, correct his lapse until he gets ashamed and thus remove his deviation from the right path.</p>
<p>If, in some, this contact with other deities becomes permanent, it may be inferred that the adoption of prapatti as an upaya was incomplete in their case. It may also be understood that they may have such things &amp;$ Naraka in future. In &amp; man of this descrip tion, the fragmentary prapatti performed to Bhagavan may, at some time in the future, attain completion and become effective.</p>
<p>(5) In those who performed prapatti after the rise of full and great faith, there will not be any weak-mindedness nor the desire to adopt other piyas. If these - viz., weak-mindedness and the desire to adopt other means &ndash; are present, it is to be inferred that their former faith was not strong enough. The Lord of All will correct these men also until they acquire great faith and make them perfect prapannas.</p>
<p>In the case of those in whom no such lapses occur, there is no possibility at all of delay in the attainment (of the snipreme goal). There will be delay for them only as long as they desire it. They will attain moksha at the time when they desire to have it. The Adhikūrī who has attained the true state of a prapanna will always be the favourite of the Supreme Ruler, who is the Lord of Lakshmi, as pointed out in the passage. &ldquo;O, Thou, Lord of</p>

<p>Srirangam, that delightest in those idle* men (prapannas ) who stand outer-most (as being incapable of karma yoga, jnana yoga or bhakti yoga )&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the case of this prapanna, the Lord who is the uncondi tional seshi of all, who is independent of all others and without limitations of any kind and whose will is irresistible, withholds bis desire to punish, which is the cause of all fears, at the very first ponent in which he utters the sentence expressing prapatti, in the same way as at the beginning of the meditation in the case of the upāsaka or bhakti yoga nishta, who has adopted prapatti as a means to bhakti, of wbom it is said. &quot; When the evidya com. mences, the destruction of former sins and the absence of contact with subsequent sins (occur), for so the srutis say&rdquo;. The Lord makes up His mind (at that very instant) to bring him and those who are bis followers into the company of the eternal sūris and, pot satisfied with having done only this, He devours, as it were, all the heaps of sips committed by those who have sought Him and does not reveal any trace of them outside and feels also that He should stomach even more of these sins). He removes the sins of his followers too, even when they are committed deliberately, by His will to grant the prapanna His blessing. In virtue of this, they will expiate their sips by repentance and the like. It is said: &ldquo;He (&lsquo;the Lord) hastens to give Paranapada to the man who is fit for mukti&rdquo;. The Lord pities the prapanna for the delay wbich he has chosen and hasteps to create in him an impatience of delay (in attainment). He produces in him an eagerness to attain the goal as illustrated in the following (verses ) :- * 10 Hereafter I do pot want to be born in this world of ignorance&quot; and &ldquo;Do not deceive me as Thou didst before. I swear by Thee and by Thy</p>
<p>NOTE:-. They are called &lsquo;idle&rsquo;, because, after praparti they do not seek any other upaya. They are said to stand &ldquo;outer-most&rdquo; because, being unable to adopt karma yoga, jnana yoga and bhakti yoga, they have adopted the upaya prapatri) which is prescribed in the Charama sloka of the Gita.</p>

<p>queen whose beautiful locks of hair shed their fragrance like a gar land on Thy chest - I swear that I must be taken to Parama. pada.&rdquo; Having made him so eager and so impatient to obtain the goal, the Lord decides on giving him Paranapada as desired by him at the end of this life, which has come to him as a result of past karma: So bas it been said :-&ldquo;Our Lord&rdquo; is the greatest benefactor that confers Vaikunta on those who have performed prapatti, when they happen to die&quot;. The Lord* has already seen to it that the fetters of gold and iron which bind bim to samsāra namely, his pāpa and puriya, past and future, as also the karma wbich has begun to operate, except that portion of it which he has agreed to expiate (during this life) are cut off without any trace being left at all. It is said :- &ldquo;The sins 1% of the past and the sios committed after prapatti vanish like cotton thrown in the fire.&rdquo; So when the time for leaving the body has come, the Lord causes bis meritorious deeds (purya) and his sins (pūpa) to be divided and distributed among others, namely, those who were bis well-wishers and those who did evil to bim, respectively, as the consequence of the good and the evil wrougbt to him by them. For it has been said:&ndash; &ldquo;The man &ldquo;who is about to attain mukti leaves his purya and pāpa to bis friends and foes respectively and attains Brahman as the fruit of bhakti yoga&rdquo;. and again &ldquo;The sins 15which are notorious in this world add which, oppressive like Yama, make a man sink into samsära left the man about to attain inukti without making the least noise and entered into plants (vix, his foes )&rdquo;. The authors of the Smritis have expressed the truth contained in the Upanishads in tbe manner stated above;</p>
<p>· THE PRAPANNA MAY DIE AT ANY TIME, DAY OR NIGHT, IN THE BRIGHT OR IN THE DARK</p>
<p>HALF OF THE MONTH : ETC. In regard to those who are desirous of other benefits than moksha and who have not fulfilled completely the means of attain.</p>
<p>* NOTE:- Even punya karma which would lead to swarga is a fetter (though of gold ), because it stands in the way of moksha. 12. Tiruvoymozhi: 9-10-5</p>

<p>ing moksha, it has been said in the Smriti, and in the science of the celestial bodies, in the context of the departure from the body that 18&quot;Day-time, the bright half of the bonth (Sukla paksha) and the Uttarayana are favourable times for those that die&rdquo;. But (as the prapanna has adopted successfully the proper upāya) there is no such rule for him in regard to the time of death. For it has been said about him ;-&ldquo;It is not right to say that the man who dies at night will not attain moksha, for the association with karma lasts only as long as the body lasts &ldquo;, and again &quot; For the same reason, the views is not right that the man who dies in dakshiņāyana will not attain moksha.&rdquo; Whether in the day of man or in the night of man, whether in the day of pitris (s&rsquo;ukla paksha ) or in the night of the pitris (krishịapaksha ), whether in tbe day of the gods (uttarāyana ) or in the night of the gods (dakshiņāyana ) - at the time appointed by the Lord, He makes him ren ember all his previous thoughts and desires (for moksha) and like a king who is gracious and who cuts off the fetters of the prince lying in the prison-house, the Lord takes him along with Him. He causes some occasion or other suited to the time, for the soul&rsquo;s parting from the body without regard to auspicious or inauspicious time.</p>
<p>THE PROCESS OF THE SELF LEAVING THE BODY:</p>
<p>Then the Lord makes the ten external senses like speech merge in the mind and the mind with the senses of action and of knowledge, wbich are thus eleven in number, merge in the vital breath (prāna) and the vital breath in the self. Then at the moment of the shaking of the bone in the back called vamsa, the Lord cburns out the subtle elements from the gross body (sthila deha) and contacts the self with the subtle elements (sūkshna bhiita) and then comforts the self so mingled with the senses, the vital breath and the subtle elements by keepiog it by the side of Himself in the form that He has assumed in the heart; for, by</p>

<p>nature, He is its friend and well-wisher. After giving the self rest and relaxation, the Lord sees that the self passes out of the body. So far, the process is the same both for the man who has realised Brahman and for the man who has not.</p>
<p>THE PATH OF THE JOURNEY AFTER DEPARTURE:</p>
<p>(In regard to this passage of tbe self froin the body), it has been said as follows: &ldquo;The Jiva who abides in the beart like a lamp bas innumerable veins (nädi). They are of many colours:&mdash; white, black, violet, bloe, golden yellow, yellow and red. Among these veids (1ādīs), which are of varied colours, there is one which proceeds upwards. The individual self (Jiva) who passes through this vein breaks through the sphere of the sun and, having passed beyond the world of Brahma, reaches the highest state. One bundred other rādīs also go upwards. The Jiva who goes out through them attains the bodies of the devas and reaches their worlds. Some nädis of various colours go downwards and they are dim. The Jiva who goes out through them is born in samsāra in this world, without any choice on his part, in order to experience the fruits of his karma. (Since the nädīs are like rays proceeding from the heart which is like a lamp, they are called rays (rasmis).</p>
<p>The Lord sees to it that the self of the prapanna does not go out through any of these rādīs which lead those that are thieves of themselves, (i. e.) who do not realise that they belong to the lord) to svarga and naraka (hell) and are therefore like the routes along which thieves take their victims. He makes the prapanna&rsquo;s self enter the Brahma Nīdi, which is beyond the hundredth among those nādīs that go upwards and which leads to the shining path called archiradi, and helps it to start with the support of the rays of the sun.</p>
<p>When Kooratbalvan (Sri Vatsapkamisra) wes in his last momente, bis tongue was parched with the fatigue (of the moment) and (unable to speak or atter any words) he caught 19. Yagnyavalkya Smriti: 4-166-169</p>
<p>204 CHAPTER</p>
<p>hold of Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s feet. At that time Sri Ramanuja whispered the Dvaya Mantra in his ear. The other disciples, who were there, said to themselves with mental depression :- &ldquo;How can we hope to get this blessing ( Dvaya being whispered in the ear by Sri Ramapuja)? What shall we do?&rdquo; Sri Ramapuja understood their fears and said, &ldquo;Do you not know the true character of Alvan? When he is in this condition (unable to say anything owing to the parched throat), what I did was only like placing a little camphor and a piece of sugar-candy (in his mouth, to make it wet). I did not whisper the Duaya in order to make the upüya complete with its accessories&rdquo;. The disciples were relieved on hearing this.</p>
<p>NOTE:- The idea is that the prapanna will attain moksha. even if he is unconscious and unable to utter the Dvaya or other mantras.</p>
<p>Therefore as has been said in the following two slokas: &quot; The man who has performed prapatti, whether he dies in a holy place or in the house of one who eats dog&rsquo;s flesh, will attain moksha even if he dies unconscious,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;The 1279n who, wben his mind is in its normal condition, when the body is not shattered, and when the elementary constituents of the body (dhatu) are in perfect equipoise, meditates on we who have the world as my body and who ani pot subject to births due to karma w when tbat man lies like a log of wood or a piece of stone in his dying moments, I think of (him) my devotee and lead him to attain the highest state&rdquo;, and as has been stated also in the Tainil verses , &ndash; &ldquo;O, Lord *that reposest on Adi Sesha in Srirangam, a man seeks refuge under the strong in order that he may obtain their support when he is in distress; though I am not like Tby devotees who know how to seek Thy help, yet I approach Thee, since Thou wert gracious even to the elephant; when the langoor of the dying moment has come, I may not be able to think of Thee. Therefore I entreat Thee, even now, that, at that time, Thou shouldst come to my rescue,&rdquo; &ndash; as bas been said in these passages, the prapanna</p>

<p>THE DEPARTURE OF THE SELF</p>
<p>205</p>
<p>need not seek the remembrance (of God) in his last moments (by any effort of his own ).</p>
<p>THE LAST THOUGHT :</p>
<p>The statement:-&ldquo;At *the time of casting the body away, you will be in full possession of your intelligence owing to my grace; you will have a vision of me and will have all your previous memories and desires (for moksha )&rdquo; &ndash; this statement, too, bas to be interpreted in a manner that would not be in copflict with the verses cited above. This is how it should be interpreted. Some acharyas interpret as follows:-&ldquo;The statement made in (Saranagati Gadya) applies to those prapannas who, wbile performing prapatti, begged also for the remembrance of the Lord) in their last moments.&rdquo; This interpretation cannot be ac cepted for the following reason :There must be some-last thought or other at the time of casting off the body and this thought must have some object or other. If the object that is thought of were other than the Lord, it would become dangerous, for it has been said. &quot; Whatever object one thinks of at the time when one leaves one&rsquo;s body &ndash; that alone will one attain (after death)&rdquo;, So we have to conclude that) if the inan has performed prapatti as an independent means (whether or not he begged for the remen. hrance (of the Lord) in his last moments while performing prapatti,) he will get that remembrance as stated in the Gadya. This is the interpretation favoured by some ūcharyas. In the verses from Sanskrit and Tawil quoted above (where the last remembrance is not declared to be necessary), what is meant is that the last rene obrance is not prescribed for the prapanna as something to be effected by his own effort as an upaya. In the eighth chapter of the Gitä, and in the sloka which says :-&ldquo;That Bhagavan whom the yogis keep in their minds by an effort at the time of leaving the body-keeping that Bhagavan in mind, Bhishma gave up his body. Was he got one who attained the fruit of bis bhakti or upāsana ?&rdquo; (The last remembrance comes as 22. Saranagati Gadya:</p>

</ol>
<p>206</p>
<p>URI CHAPTER</p>
<p>PTUR</p>
<p>an upaya for those who adopt bhakti as the means and it comes by their own effort); but in the case of the prapanna, the remem. brance comes out of the Lord&rsquo;s grace alone. &quot; Kevalam madiya dayaya&quot; are Sri Rananoja&rsquo;s words. Wbat does this last remembrance&rsquo; mean? When speech and other activities have be come itppossible, the remembrance or thought which arises in the mind before the mind, too, ceases to function-this is the last remembrance. Those who stand by cannot know it. Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s commentary on the Brahma Sutra: “It is geen &quot; that the mind functions even after the senses have ceased to do 80&quot;, means only this, that the miod&rsquo;s functioning may be inferred by some sign or other. It may also describe his own experience in some states of ill-health and the like. Therefore this last remembrance is a thing that could be known only to the man who becomes a mukta and to (the Lord) who gives him moksha.</p>
<p>After this, the self, whether it be of the yogi or of one who is pot a yogi, takes repose by the side of the Supreme Being who is in his heart (Harda) and is in a state similar to that of dreamless sleep (sushupti).</p>
<p>It may be asked whether the description contained in the slokās and Tamil verses quoted above (Nos. 20 and 21)-such as being like &amp; log of wood or like a piece of stone, and loss of all remembrance or consciousness may not be a reference to this state of sushupti. The answer is that if so, there would be no special consideration for the prapanna ( which certainly there is).</p>
<p>Thereafter (i.e. after repose by the side of the Supreme Being), the self or soul attains perfect knowledge being awakened by the Lord (who is wise) and who says that &ldquo;the Jiva gets knowledge, ** memory and forgetfulness only from Him.&rdquo; Lighted by that know ledge, it enters into the Brahma Nadi. Thence a forward Time is one eternal day for the self.</p>

<p>THE DEPARTURE OF THE SELF</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>To the prapanna (who is a devotee of Sri Ranganatha) who departs from the body which is an transient as lightning and who is to journey from the central Brahma Dadi, along the beautiful and shining path (of archiradi), which is free from all impediments, the place of his departure is itself an auspicious place, the day of his departure is itself an auspicious day, the omens and signs that are then seen are all auspicious, whatever they may be.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>Like a father who descende into a well full of slushy mire to take out his son that has fallen into it, the Lord, (in His līlā), abides in the cave of the heart (dahara) and at the time of our leaving the body, He helps us to enter the rūdī which is beyond the hundredth, so that we may start on our journey to the city that was not built by any one.</p>
