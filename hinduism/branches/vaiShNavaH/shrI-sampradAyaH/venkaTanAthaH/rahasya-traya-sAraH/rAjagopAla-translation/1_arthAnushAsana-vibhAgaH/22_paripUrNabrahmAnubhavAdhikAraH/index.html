<p>(22) THE CHAPTER ON THE FULL AND PERFECT</p>
<p>ENJOYMENT OF THE BLISS OF BRAHMAN.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>Led by his guides (archis and others) to the Lord of Lakshmi who is possessed of varied glories in the region beyond tamas (i e.) prakriti and having attained Him, the mukta has bis essential nature in fall manifestation and realises bis inseparable connection with the Lord and as a consequence, acquires the *eight attributes (of freedom from sin and the like) and without any question of his returning again (to samsāra ), he attains, in regard to enjoy. ment, perfect resemblance to the Lord.</p>
<p>THE NATURE OF THE BLISS OF BRAHMAN :</p>
<p>If it is asked what is this full and perfect enjoyment of Brahman by the mukta who has traversed the path (described before), the answer is as follows:- He will in all places, at all times, and in all situations, have, for his unsurpassed joys, the supreme Ruler with His countless forma, attributes, glories and activities without missing any of them. This is thus described (in the following verse):&ndash; &ldquo;She &lsquo;will never, in the least, miss (the sight of) Bhagavan whose eyes are as beautiful as the lotus and who is the Lord of the world.&rdquo; (Since the Lord enjoys His own forms, attributes, glories and activities Himself), there is perfect similarity between the mukta&rsquo;s enjoyment and the Lord&rsquo;s. There fore (the srutis) speak of perfect similarity.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s svarūpa is delightful as may be seen from the following passages. &ldquo;He is all knowledge and all bliss&rdquo;. &ldquo;The Pattainment of Bhagavan is a remedy for the disease of (samsāra). It is of the nature of joy which is unsurpassed and confers joy on others. It is an end in itself and lasts for ever&rdquo;. Other things are</p>

<p>enjoyable in this way: If the king is the queen&rsquo;s joy, then all objects and instruments of his enjoyment as well as the places where he finds delight are alike objects of joy to her. Similarly the mukta finds joy in all that pertains to the Lord. That the Supreme Ruler who has all forms, attributes and the like is an object of enjoyment is evident from the srutis and the smritis. This idea has been expressed in the section on Bhima in the Brahma Sutras. The svarüpa of Bhagavan is called Parama. pada, because it is the ultimate and supreme object of attainment being of unsurpassed agreeableness. Since the perfect enjoyment of the svarūpa of Bhagavan happens only after reaching &amp; most delightful region far superior to all others, that region is also called Paramapada. The essential nature or svarüpa of the Jira, which is the recipient of this joy in the attainment of Bhagavan which is also among the glorious possessions (Vibhūtis) of the Lord and which has, for its attribates, jnana and änanda, is also (sometimes ) called Paramapada. Along with the others, these three bave, in common, only the feature of being the object of attainment.</p>
<p>It has been said above that such things as Bhagavan&rsquo;s svarūpa, attributes and forms, the region of eternal glory (nitya vibhūti) wbich is constituted of pure sattvam and his own suurüpa are objects of delight to the mukta. It may be asked, “This may be trae. But by sense perception (pratyaksha) and other sources of knowledge, the objects in this world of lilä vibhuti are found to be disagreeable and are declared by the sõstras also to be things to be given up, How then could they viz. the objects in lila vibhūti be objects of delight to the mukta ?&quot; The answer is as follows:&ndash; ** There is nothing inconceivable in this. What appears disagree. able to the man suffering from (excess of) bile is felt as agreeable when the bile bas decreased. Again when the prince is in the prison house it is disagreeable. But when the emperor is pleased to set bim free and to place him by his own side to enjoy like pleasures, the prison bouse may appear agreeable as a syinbol of</p>
<p>THE ENJOYMENT OF BRAHMAN</p>

<p>his father&rsquo;s glory, although it has not undergone any change. It is said in the Rāmāyana : &ndash;&quot; To be with you is inoksha for me; to be without you is hell to me;&quot; again, &ldquo;To me &ldquo;living without Sri Rama, the great warrior, in the midst of these Rakshasis, of what use is life, or wealth, or ornaments?&rdquo; In Tiruvoymozki 4-8 it is said :-&ldquo;As the Lord does not care for me, it would not at all matter if I lost all that I would otherwise prize highly, viz., my beauty, my mind, my modesty, the sheen of my complexion, my intel. ligence, my charnu, my bracelets, my girdle, my body and my very life.&rdquo; As illustrated in the passages cited above, the objects of this world (Lila Vibhuti), which appear disagreeable or only slightly agreeable, when the jiva is not blessed with union with the Lord, may appear supremely agreeable, when he has become a nukta enjoying without intermission (the bliss of) Bhagavan. There is nothing inconsistent in this. The same object may be disagreeable or only slightly agreeable to a mao bound to suisūra, while to one released from the bondage of karına, it is agreeable. This is the nature ordained for then by the will of God.</p>
<p>. That Bhagavan, the Lord of Sri, who has, for bis prakira or mode, all things whose agreeableness is dependent on His will, is the goal of attainment is implicit in the words in the dative or fourth case (Närāyaṇāya) in Tirumantra and in Draya. The service referred to before is the overflow of love born of the perfect enjoyment of Brahman and the Bhashyakara las explained it in several places in the (Saraṇāgati Gadya ).</p>
<p>FULL AND PERFECT ENJOYMENT OF BHAGATAV</p>
<p>OVERFLOWS INTO KAINKARYA OR SERVICE.</p>
<p>( It is said in the strutis that the wukta eats whatever he wants and can create whichever relations he wants). The enjoyment of food in the state of inukti and the contact with relations and the like are not due to karna, whether pulpe or påpa, but</p>

<p>Some jivas attain, ia such worlds as those of Vishnu, the privilege of living in the same world as Vishnu (sälokya ), some jivas attain proximity to the presence of Vishnu (sāmipya ); tome attain forms similar to that of Vishnu (sārūpya): these, too, are sometimes called muktas by courtesy (upachāra), since they are very near the ultimate goal (but they are not really muktas in the true sense of the word). This idea is set forth in the following sloka - &ldquo;Some live in the worlds of Vishnu; others approach very near to Vishnu; others, again, &amp;cquire forus resembling Vishna&rsquo;s; yet others attain sayujya with Vishnu. This, alone, is called moksha.&rdquo; This sloka declares that only säyujya in Paramapada is moksha. In the same way as a hund red and the like are included within a thousand, sälokya and the like are included within sāyujya. The truth of this statement may be seen in the following sloka : &ldquo;I do not at all&quot;A beg for moksha which goes by the names of sālokya and sarūpya. I long, O Lord that hast taken a vow (to protect those that seek Thy help) - I long, O Thou with long arms, for sãyujya with Tbee.&rdquo; Sayujya means the relationship between two who are united in communion (sayuk). One might be sayuk with another, although only in the common enjoyment of a certain pleasure. Here in regard to the mukta, the object of enjoyment is Brahman with His prakäras or modes. Since Brahman and the mukta both commune with each other in the enjoyment of that bliss, the inukta is called sayuk (with Brabman).</p>
<p>In this connection, it may be asked why, in one of the pass Ages of the Veda, the two words, sayujya and särshtitha are employed (in the same sentence ), when they mean the same thing, namely, communion in the enjoyment (would it not be reduntant to use two words when one would be enoagh?). The answer is (that there is a difference in meaning between the two words ), and it is as follows:</p>

<p>22</p>
<p>THE ENJOYMENT OF BRAHMAN</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>Sūpujyam between the two (Brabman and the mukta) means that there is no difference sc far as the objects of enjoyment are concerned : särshtita (between the two) means that there is no difference in the degree or intensity of their enjoyment. (Two wen Day bave before them the same object of enjoyment and yet one of thein may enjoy it more intensely than the other).</p>
<p>It is true that the mukta has nothing to do with the work of creating, maintaining, destroying and such other things in regard to the world (Jagad Vyāpāra). But just as the father wbo cultivates the field and the sons and others who do not cultivate it enjoy alike the fruit from the cultivated field, Iswara who is engaged in the work of the world (Jagad Vyāpāra ) and the mukta wbo only witnesses it have the same degree of enjoyment in the joy arising from that work. The author of the Brahma Sūtras bas stated at the beginning of the section : &ldquo;(The &lsquo;mukta&rsquo;s enjoy. ment is ) exclusive of the work of the world&rdquo; and concludes it by saying:&rdquo; The &ldquo;resemblance or equality (sāmyam) between the mukta and Brabman is only so far as the enjoyment is concerned, as stated in the srutis, and also by inference linga&rdquo;. Sakatayana has also stated as follows:- Those who meditate on Brahman say that sāyujyam consists in the sameness or equality of enjoy. ment&quot;.</p>
<p>REFUTATION OF THE ADVAITIC DOCTRINE OF</p>
<p>IDENTITY:</p>
<p>To those (viz. Advaitins) who maintain that the word Sayujyam, means oneness or identity with Brahman (aikyam), the derivative or etymological meaning of the word, sãyujyam, is at variance, as also the texts* in the sruti wbicb declare that</p>

<p>222 CHAPTER</p>
<p>Brahman is different from the jivas. Besides, their view is opposed also to the strutis which declare that the mukta will attain perfect resemblance (sāmyam) to Brahman and that the mukta will be like Brabman. The author of the Gita has conveyed the same idea in :- &ldquo;They will attain my likeness (sādharnyam)&quot;:</p>
<p>The Maharshi (Vyāsa) has also expressed this idea at great length in the discourse between Vasishta and Karala and concludes by saying that this is the supreme truth - &ldquo;The jiva released ** from bondage (i.c.) the mukta, attains the Supreme Being and acquires attributes similar to those of the Supreme Being. He too becomes free from all imperfections when be reaches Him. Hav. ing attained the Omniscient Brahman, he, too, becomes omnisci. ent. Having reached Him who is free from the bondage of karma, he, too, becomes free from karma. Having attained Bhagavad who is free from suffering and sorrow, he, too, becomes free from them. Having reached Him who is blissfal, he, too, becomes blissful. O best of Bharatas, having attained Bhagavan who acts by His will alone (without being influenced by karma), be, too, acts merely by his will. He becomes resplendent and having attained Bhagavan who is without the qualities (of prakriti) he, too, is without those qualities. Having reached Brahman who is without the body and the senses constituted of matter (Prakriti), he, too, becomes free from them. Having attained the Supreme Being wbo is independent of karma, he too, becomes independent. I have thus described the truth to you, O great king, just as it is in reality. Haviog accepted this teaching with a mind free from discontent (asīīya), meditate on Brahman who is eternal and free from all imperfections and who is the (ultimate) cause of the world&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the passage cited above, the mukta is called &lsquo;independent&rsquo; (svatantra ), because he is free from the influence of past karma. The Bbasbyakara (Sri Ramanuja) has explained the meaning of</p>

<p>223</p>
<p>the word Svarat (literally the independent king) as being not subject to karma&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Thus since in the srutis, the smritis and the sūtras, resemb. lapce between the mukta and Brabman (sāmyam) is explicitly stated, those places in the texts which seem to speak of identity (aikyam) between the mukta and Brahman in the state of release from bondage bave to be explained in a manner that would not be inconsistent with the srutis which declare difference between the jiva and Brahman. The word aikyam or (identity ) in such pass ages should be construed in the same manner as in the sloka : &ldquo;The aikyam between16A Rama and Sugriva arose 0, Lady, in this way.” (Here aikyam means friendship, identity not of self&rsquo;s but of interests).</p>
<p>If it were not construed in this way, it would be in conflict with thousands of authoritative passages like the following:</p>
<p>(1) “When the person who is twice-born (dvija) sees that he is different from the Supreme Being and that the Supreme Being is different from himself, he becomes free from bondage and will see for ever (Bhagavan who is) the 26th real. The Supreme Being is one and the jiva who is the 25th real - is another. Since the Supreme Being is within him (the jiva), good men call them one The Supreme Being, O, king, is different from the jiva, and the jiva, who is the 25th real, is different from the 24 reals. Therefore good men do not consider the jīva, who is the 25th real, as being identical with the Supreme Being. So in dread of birth and death, they perform, 0 Kasyapa, karına yoga, acquire thereby purity of mind, and then perform jnana yoga, and then meditate on the Supreme Being as the supreme object of attainment.</p>
<p>(2) Purushottama&rsquo;s is different from both the baddha and mukta. He is called the Supreme Being.</p>

<p>(3) He who is within the jiva as his Inder Ruler &ndash; He is eternal: He is free from the qualities of prakriti: He should be known as Nārāyaṇa: He is the soul of all and is called Purusha by the Vedas. The consequences of past karna do not cling to Him, in the same way &amp; water does not cling to the leaf of the lotus. The jīva who is inferior to the Supreme Being becomes subject to hondage owing to past karma and attains moksha by meditating on Brahman&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(4) &ldquo;Just&rsquo; as fire in a ball of (red-bot) iron seems to be one with the iron, though it is really different from it, so the Supreme Being pervades the world and is inseparable from it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Therefore the perfect resemblance of the jiva (parame sīmyam) (to Brahman) is only that arising from jučna and bhoga (enjoynept) and the like. Iswara has, for His definition, the following attributes which are like the umbrella and the chamara (insignia of royalty):&ndash; being the canse of the world, the conferring of moksha on jīvas, being the support of the world, being the controller of the world, the ope for whom all thiogs and all sentient beings exist, the one who has everything for His body, the one who is denoted by all words, the one who can be understood from all the Vedas, the one wbo is the refuge of all the world, the one who should be adored by all those who want moksha, the one who grants the fruits (of all actions), the one wbose essential nature is ownipresence, Jnana and ānanda (bliss), the one who is the spouse of Laksbnii. These are peculiar to Him and are His distinctive features. The mukta&rsquo;s distinctive attributes are the following : being sustained (by Iswara); being controlled by Him, existing only for the Lord (s&rsquo;eshtave), being atomic (anu) and such others.</p>

<p>possibility of &amp; return to samsāra. The jiva&rsquo;s dependence on Iswars has been stated in the sloka :-“For Kepabling a man to get the good things of life, and for taking away from him the ills of life, there is no one other than Purushottama who is compe tent&rdquo;. The answer to that question is, &ldquo;There will be no such possibility, for has He not Himself declared :- &ldquo;Those who *per form bhakti yoga with great devotion and those who have perfor. med prapatti which is considered as &amp; superior form of penance (tapas) will obtain säyujya and will for ever render service to me. They will always be free from the ills of samsāra&rdquo;. Ever in the state of desire for mukti, the mukta had an aversion to the enjoyment of non-sentiment things (matter) and also to the mere enjoyment of his own self (kaivalya). This aversion is now well established in him; for as he sees all things having Brahman as their inner self, there is no possibility of his enjoying his own self 48 separate (from everything else), and as he sees by constant perception (pratyaksha ) the imperfections of all other objects (than God), there is no possibility of his returning to samsāra of his own free will. As his knowledge of the three tattvas, cit. acit and Iswara and of what is good and what is evil, which he acquired before, has now attained expansion without any break or contrac. tion, there is no possibility of his ever going back to samsāra owing to ajrāna or ignorance. The knowledge which formerly in samsāra deepened into the form of love called bhakti and which he acquired by his distinctive knowledge of the specific pature of Bhagavan bas, now, in the state of mukti, become ripened into the form of supreme love, because he has now &amp; vision of all aspects of Bhagavan&rsquo;s distinctive nature of which even the sastras are incapable. Therefore Iswara&rsquo;s great love for him as stated in the sioka : &ldquo;The jirānī ig** dear to me (How dear he is to me cannot be described even by me, Ominscient though I am)&rdquo; - Iswara&rsquo;s love for bina is so overwhelming that its flow is irresistible and that its current reaches even those uplands which are connect</p>

<p>ed with him oply in distant relationship. Therefore it cannot be stated that, though he is free from karma, there is the possibility of his retarning to samsāra by the will of Iswara who is independent (and all-powerful). Since the mukta is no longer subject to the injunctions of sastra, there is no possibility of his violating the Lord&rsquo;s command in the state of mukti. He cannot do anytbing opposed to the will of Iswara as the Lord&rsquo;s pleasure is now his pleasure. Therefore the ultimate goal or attainment called moksha, which is of the nature of perfect and full enjoyment of Brahman and wbich extends into service, has now become eternal for him (i.e.) it will last as long as his soul lasts. Consider ing all this, the Sitra-kära said: &ldquo;There is no return (to samsāra) - Do return, for the Scripture says 80.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>Having reached the dazzling region of Paranapada and approached the Lord crowned with fragrant tulasī, who is ever delighted in doing what is good to all beings, and having obtained our share in service (to them), we shall ever live under the sound ing anklets of the assembly of our achāryas and enjoy delights which will never change and which will spring (from within us) to our great joy.</p>

<p>APPENDIX ( Chapter V Page 65 )</p>
<p>THE VISĀKHASTAMBHA AS DESCRIBED IN THE SATVATA SAMHITĀ AND</p>
<p>THE LAKSHMI TANTRA.</p>
<p>In the region of eternal glory (nitya vibhiiti), there is a huge column constituted of suddhasattvam. It is a special form in which Bhagavan appears there. This column or pillar is called Visakha yoopa. The column consists of four parts called, respectively, jāgrat, (the waking state ), svapna (the drean ), sushupti (dreamless sleep) and turīya (the fourth stage, coun ting from below upwards. In the part called jāgratsthina, which is somewhere above the base of the column, there are four divine forms on the four sides called, respectively, Vasudeva, Sankar shana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha facing the east, the south the vest and the north and shining like branches around that part of the column. This collection of four forms is called Jāgratvyiha. The activity of this vynha is the creation, maintenance and destruction of the world. The four forms are bright in colours, white, red and the like. They have also arms or weapons. Above this part of the column is the part called svapnasthāna. Here, too, there are four divine forms Vasudeva, Sankarshna, Pradyumna and Apiruddba shining like branches, as before, to the east, the south, the west and the north. This collection of four vyuhas in the second part of the column from below is called svapnavyuha. These four forms have no activities like creation and maintenance, but have only the will to do so. Their colours, too, are not so bright as those of the lower vyuha. They have weapons but no banners and other accessories. Above the svapnasthana, which is the second part from below, is the third part or sthāna called sushuptisthāna. Here too there are four divine forms with the same aan es as in the two other parts already described and in the same order. This collection of four forms is called sushuptivfüha. These forms have neither activities nor even the will or the desire to acte</p>
<p>APPENDIX</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>They have just the experience of their owa bliss and nothing else. In the form of Vasudeva which is like å branch of the column shooting on the eastern side, there is no such thing as a body with limbs and the like and it shines with all the six qualities. The other three forms, Sankarshane and the like on the other three sides bave &amp; body with hands, feet and the like. But they have no weapons; on the palms they bear lines resembling the concb, and the weapons. These forms have no colours. The uppermost or fourth part of the column (Turīya sthāna) has also similar four forms with the same names as in the former parts. This collection of four is the Turīya vyūha. They have no bodies with limbs and the like but resemble the Vasudeva form of the sushupti vyžiha. They have no activities, no will, no weapons and no lines on the palm resembling arms. All the six qualities shine in the form called Vasudeva and the other three have, each, only two of these qualities. The panes jāgrat, svapna, sushupti and turīya are given to them on the analogy of these states in man in the ordinary world, according to the greater or the lesser activity found in each. The turīya state is like that in a swoon when even the breath is suspended, whereas in the sushupti state, the man just breathes in or breathes out; in the svapna, bis external senses cease to act, only the mind is active, in the jāgrat state, both the mind and the external senses act.</p>
<p>These four parts with four vyūhas in each correspond to the four stages of development that may be found in the worshipper who meditates on them. On the lowest stage of meditation, there is no full control of the external seoses and the mind; in the second stage of development, control of the external senses has been attained but not of the mind; in the next stage, the mind, too, has been controlled and the man who meditates is seen just breathing in and breathing out with no other activity or sign of life; in the last or perfect development of meditation, he is like one in &amp; swoon, not even breathing in or out:</p>
