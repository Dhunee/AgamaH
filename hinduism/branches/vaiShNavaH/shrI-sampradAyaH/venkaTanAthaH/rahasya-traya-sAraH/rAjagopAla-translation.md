### PRÉFACE 

Srimad Rahasyatrayasára is a classic of the first importance to the followers of Sri Vedantadesika. Though it is in Tamil, it is so full of Sanskrit words and of Sanskrit passages quoted as praianas that the ordinary reader finds ir difficult to understand it by himself. Since a number of my friends who have studied English told me that an English translation of it would be of great help. I suggested to Professor M. R. Rajagopala Ayyangar who is well-versed in: Sri Bhashya, Rahasyatrayasara and other works connected with the tradition of Sri Vaishnavism and has, in addition, an intimate knowledge of English, that he might undertake the work. He complied with my request, completed the transla tion and handed it over to me. It is not possible for me to thank him in adequate terms for having done so. 

In getting the work through the Press, I have received great and enthusiastic help from Sri K. V. Ramaswami, B. A., Assistant Secretary, Mettur Chemicals and Sri R. Natarajan, B.Sc., Secretary of the Mettur Chemicals. I take this oppor tunity of expressing my deep gratitude to them. 

I am also thankful to the Sree Vedanta Desika Sampra daya Sabha, Bombay for having kindly lent the block of Sree Vedanta Desika appearing in the book. 

My grateful thanks are due to Sri K. Vasudevan Nair, Proprietor, The Literary Press, Salem who is well-known for his deep interest in everything that concerns our religion, for his ready and willing co-operation in the printing of the book in his press.

### INTRODUCTION 

#### Life and Writings of Sri Vedāntadestika 

Sri Venkatanatba or Vedaptadesika, to use the same by which he is more commonly known, was born at Thooppil, a village near Kancheepuram, in 1268. His father was called Apantasuri and his motber Totaramba. His maternal uncle was the renowned Appullar, whose real name was Ramanuja. It is under bim that Vedantadesika learnt the Sastras. Appullar had studied Vedanta under Nadathur Ammal (Varadacharya) along with Sudarsana Bhatta, the author of Srutaprakāsikā, the splendid commentary on Ramanuja's Sri Bhashya. Appullar was the great-grandson of Pranatartibara, the disciple of Sri Ramanuja, who was called Vedanta Udayana for bis proficiency in Vedanta. He had, there. fore, personal knowledge of Ramanuja's religious teaching and tradition, 

Vedantadesika seems to have attracted the notice of Nadathur Ammal by his precociousness. Before the age of twenty, he bad acquired a mastery of all the learning current in his days not only in religion but in secular subjects as well. He states that bis uncle, Appullar, taught him with as much patience and care as a man would teach & parrot to speak. Vedantadesika became so proficient in the composition of poetry and in the mastery of the science of jogic that be came to be called Kavi Tärkika Simha (the lion among poets and logicians). 

Three holy places are associated with Vedantadesika's name as having been bis residences. One is Tiruvaheepdrapuram in South Arcot District, where, it may be presumed, he composed some of his well-known Stotras or hymas like Gopala Vimsati and Devanāyaka Panchasat in Sanskrit and Achyuta Satakan in Prakrit. He lived for many years at Kancheepuram. It is on the chief deity in Kancheepuram that Desika composed his Varadaraja Panchasat in Sanskrit and his Attigiri Mānmiyam in Tamil. 

Srirangam was, then, the centre of Vaishnavite culture and learning and every one who had pretensions to a knowledge of Visishtadvaitic philosophy and religion made it a point to stay there as long 48 he could. Vedantadesika seems to have spent some years of his life at Srirangam, gathering round him & band of disciples who were greatly devoted to him. He says somewhere that he had taught Vedanta (i. e.) Sri Bhashya, thirty times over. He wrote also many treatises in Sapskrit and in Tamil in support of the Vedantic system of Ramanuja and in refutation of rival systems. It is no wonder that the title of Vedāntadesika (or Vedantacharya) was conferred on him, as he himself says, by the Lord Sri Ranganatha. 

Vedantadesika, or Desika, to use the shorter Dame by which also he is often referred to, followed the usual custom of going on pilgrimages to places in North India which are considered holy. It was probably at Tirupati that he composed his Stotra called Dayāsatakam. It is said that he visited also Mathura, Brindavan, Ayodhya and Banaras. 

Desika chose to live a life of poverty. He would not seek the patronage of the great as it wight lead to a loss of independence. It is said that the great Vidyaranya invited bim to the court of Vijayanagar assuring him of an honourable reception. But Vedanta desika would not consent. His reply to Vidyaranya called Vairāgyapanchakan, wbicb is in the form of five slokas in Sans. krit, reveals his stern and austere independence of spirit. 

By his extraordinary learning and exemplary way of life, Vedantadesika won the admiration and reverence of all those who were spiritually-minded. Like Ramanuja before him, he was blessed with a long life of strenuous, spiritual activity and died in his one-hundredth year (1369). 

INTRODUCTION 

. HIS WORKS Sri Vedantadesika's life was dedicated solely to stady, to teaching and to the composition of books and tracts. He is & voluminous and versatile writer who has left works in Sanskrit and Tamil, in prose and in verse, and also in manipravālam, a kiad of Sanskritized Tamil. The number of bis writings would come to a hundred or more and only the more important of them are briefly mentioned below. 

Vedantadesika reminds one of the English post Milton. It is well-known that Milton was & scholar in Greek, Latin and Italian, besides bis own language, English. His poetry was the poetry of & scholar steeped in varied learning and a full and critical appreci. ation of his poems and prose writings is possible only to men of learning. With just a few exceptions, all the poems of Milton are on religious themes, as be had a lofty conception of the poet's art and mission and would not care to dally in secular writing. He wrote a drama taking his subject from the Old Testament of the Bible. Milton wrote extensively in prose also, both in Eoglish and in Latin. He was also noted for the austerity of bis life, the earnestness of his religious convictions, and the stubborn indepen dence of his character. 

Sri Vedantadesika's works may be classified ander the following heads 

SANSKRIT 1. POETRY AND THE DRAMA : 

Though Desika was wholly absorbed in the study and the interpretation of Vedanta and of the religious tradition associated with Sri Ramapuja, he had in biw a genius for poetic composition which could not be repressed. So, instead of writing on secular subjecta, he made his mase the bandmaid of religion. With the single exception of Subhashita-ncevi, wbicb is a didactic poem containing gnomic verses like the Satakas of Bhartrihari, all his poems have a religious background. 

iv When he wanted to write a Mahakavya like Raghuvamsa, he chose for his theme Sri Krishna's life and composed his Yadavā. bhyudayam in twenty-four cantos (or sargas), The playful activities of Sri Krisboa in his boyhood and yoath lend themselves easily to poetic delight. It is Desika's peculiar feature as & poet to incorporate pbilosopbical and religious ideas even into his poems. The great Advaitic teacber, Sri Appayya Dikshitar, has written a commentary on this Mahükāoya. 

Desika was an adtuirer of Kalidasa's genius as a poet and wrote a Sandesa Kavya following his manner. This is Hamsa Sandesa. Sri Rama sends a message by a swan to Sita devi at Lanka where she bas been imprisoned by Ravana. The first part consisting of sixty slokas describes the route that the swan should take in its journey to Lanka. The religious bias of the poet makes bim speak with reverence of the holy places and shrines of South India on this route. In the second part consisting of fifty slokas Sri Rama gives a description of the state of Sita in Lanka as he visualises it in his imagination and this is tállowed by the message which is to give her comfort and consolation. The poem is written in the metre called Mandākrāntā which Kalidasa bad employed with brilliant success in bis Meghasandesa. 

Padukāsahasran is & poetical tour de force said to have been composed in the course of a single night. The theme is the sandals of Sri Ranganatha at Srirangam and the poem has one thousand and eight slokas in varied metres and is partly in praise of Sri Rama's sandals which were taken by Bharata to Ayodbya and wbich are identified with Sri Ranganatha's. 

THE DRAMA: 

Krishnamisra, a gifted poet, wrote an allegorical dracoa called Prabodhachandrodaya on the Advaita Philosophy, wherein Prabo. dhachandra or Jnana brings about the deliveratce of King Viveka from the bondage of samsāra into which he had been forced by his enemies, Lust, Anger, and the like. In reply, as it were, to 

INTRODUCTION 

this play, Desika wrote an allegorical drama called Sankalpa Suryodaya in ten acts. The war is between two sets of comba tants, Viveka, Bhakti, and Spiritual Serenity (Santi) on one side and Last, Pride, Vanity and the like on the other. The hero is Purusha or the Jiva and the final deliverance of Purusha is brought about by the victory of Viveka over Moba with the help of Vishnu. bhakti. 

2. RELIGIOUS LYRICS (STOTRAS): 

Vedantadesika has left a number of religious lyrics or Stotras which have won the admiration of Sri Vaisbdevas so much that they are often repeated with great devotion during their gatberings. These Stotras or religious lyrics are mainly on the gods worshipped in Kancheepuram, Srirangam, Tirupati and Tiruvabeendrapuram. Some of them are on Garuda, the Goddess Lakshmi, the Goddess of the Earth and Goda the saintly daughter of Perialwar,' 

Desika is said to have been an upāsaka of Bhagavan as Hayagriva and has composed thirty-three slokas in His praise. 

The ten avatars of Vishnu are described in ten slokas called Dasavatārastotram. After the Muslim raids in the 14th century, Desika composed his Abheeti-stava, praying for succour to Sri Rangapatha's shrine and worshippers, 

Darās'atakam consists of about one hundred slokas on the Lord of Tirupati and on His mercy shown to the Jiva in varied ways. 

Varadarājapanchasat, referred to before, has fifty-one slokas in praise of Sri Varadaraja of Kancheepuram. 

Desika was, for some years, & resident at Tiruvabeendraparam wbere he was a staunch devotee of the god Devanatba, in whose praise he composed fifty three slokas called Devanāyakapanchayat. 

Desika was a profound admirer of Sri Ramanuja whose works he studied again and again with reverance and also taught to others. In Yatiraja-saptati, he has expressed his boundless admiration and reverence and also bis indebtedness to Sri Ramanuja. The poem has seventy slokas. 

One of the finest of these lyrics is Gopālavimsati on Sri Krishpa. Desika's poetic style is generally that of a scholar and is not easily understood by the ordinary reader. But in Gopāla vimsati, bis deep and fervent devotion has enabled him to visualise Sri Krishoa and sing his praise in slokas which are lucid and delightful and can be understood even by the beginner of Sanskrit studies. 

3. VEDANTA. 

"It'is in the discussion of subjects connected with Vedanta that Vedaptadesika excelled. He had studied the philosopbical writings of Sri Sankaracharya and others and was a master, as has already been stated, of Visishtadvaita as taogbt by Sri Ramadnja. He dedicated his life, it may be said without any exaggeration, to the propagation of Ramanuja's gospel by all the means in his power. Being a subtle logician, be refuted rival systems of philosophical thought in many of his writings and established the soundness of Visishtadvaita from the point of view of Srutis and of reason. 

Tatvateeka : Sri Desika began an elaborate commentary on Sri Bhashyam bat left it incomplete. It is only the commentary up to the section dealing with the Mahasiddhanta that is now available. 

Adhikaranasārāvali is in 502 slokas and is a synopsis of Sri Bhashyam. Desika had a wonderful gift of expressing pbiloso pbical ideas concisely in Sanskrit verse giving the Poorvapaksha and the Siddhanta in each sloka. In this work which is in the wetre called Sragdharā. Desika summarises the meaning of each sītra and of each adhikaraṇa or section of Sri Ramapuja's com. mentary on the Brahma Sutras giving, as a general rule, the prima facie view in the first half of each siloka and the rigbt interpretation of the adhikarana or siddhanta in the second half. 

INTRODUCTION 

Tatvamuktākalapā is a controversial work in Sanskrit verse, and consists of 501 slokas. The Visishtadvaita pbilosophy is sought to be established as the only right system by & refutation of rival views or theories. Here again, the first half of each sloka expresses the Poorvapaksha stating concisely the tenets of other systems and the second the siddhanta in connection with such topics 88 the Jnda or non-sentient things, the Jiva, the Nāyaka or Iswara and buddhi, wbich are all dravya or substances and also adravya, those which are not substances. Desika has left also a commentary of, bis own on this work called Sarvārthasiddhi. 

Satadooshani is a controversial treatise in terse prose against Advaita. Desika finds & hundred points of objection against Advaita, but only sixty-six of them are extant in the texts that are DOW available. 

Nyāya Parisuddhi and Nyaya siddhanjanam are treatises op logic or nyaya as it should be understood. They are both critical of the Vaiseshing and Nyaya schools of logio. 

Seswara - rimāmsa : It is generally held that Jaimini, the author of the Purva Mimamsā Sūtras, was an agnostic who had no faith in the existence of God or Gods. In this work Desika's aim is to prove that Jaimioi did believe in the existence of gods. Only a fragment of this treatise is, at present, available. 

Nyāsa - vimsati. Niksheparakshū, Nyāsa-tilaka, Saraṇāgati panchasat, and Nyasa dasaka aim at establishing Prapatti as an upaya for moksha by refuting the arguments of those who hold that bhakti alone is prescribed in the Sastras as the means for attaiping it. They describe also the manner of performing prapatti and the potency of the upāya along with the qualifications wbich make one competent for it. 

4. COMMENTARIES : 

Desika has left commentaries on Istāvāsyopanishad, on Ala vandar's Chatus's loki and his Stotra-ratnam, and on the three proso 

viii works of Sri Ramanuja, namely, Saraṇāgati gadyam, Sriranga gadyam and Vaikunta gadyam. 

Titparya chandrikä is a scholarly commentary on Sri Rama. puja's Gitā bhishyan. The author sbows bow Sri Ramanuja's interpretation of the verses of the Gita is wore apt and more in accordance with reason than that of otber commentators. 

TAMII. 

Desika has composed many treatises in Tamil, most of them being in verse. Among the verse compositions are Attigiri Mān. miyan aheady referred to and Muomanikkovai which is on Sri Devanatha of Tiruvabeepdrapnram. 

Paramatabhangam expounds, in Tamil verse and in highly Sanskritised Tamil prose, the doctrines of Visishtadvaita and refutes sowe sixteen rival systems. It is also in support of the l'ancharatra Agamas and describes Saraṇāgati as an upaya, 

Srimad Rahasyatrayasāra is, of course, one of his greatest prose works. The Tamil prose in this work, as in others, has a large admixture of sanskrit words. 

Desika has left also a large number of tracts on the proper code of condnct and observances that a good Sri Vaishnava should follow and likewise on the doctrines of Visishtadvaita. Visishtadvaitins, who are the followers of Sri Ramapuja, consider the following as pramaniis or sources by which knowledge is acquired :-- (1) Pratyaksha or sense perception. Among the

senses or indriyas which provide us with knowledge are the sense of sight, the sense of hearing, the sense of smell, the sense of taste and the sense of touch. To these five should be added the mind or manas which perceives such internal feelings as pleasure and pain. (2) Anumāna or inference: Even without actual sepse perception, we sometimes acquire knowledge based on previous perceptions. For instance, we have seen on many occasions that wherever there is smoke, there is fire. When, afterwards, we see smoke rising on a bill, we, at once, infer that there must be fire on that hill, though we do not actually see the fire. Inference is always based on previous sense perception. (3) The third source of knowledge accepted by Visishtadvaitins is sabda or verbal authority or trustworthy utterance. Though I have never been to London, I telieve that there is a big city of that" name on the evidence of those whom I consider intelligent and trustwortby. In matters of religion, this verbal anthority is found in the sāstras, They reveal to us what we cannot see or infer by ourselves. For instance, they speak of the existence of God, who creates the Universe, sustains it and dissolves or absorbs it into Himself. They also tell us that our souls are eternal and are now in the bondage of births and deaths owing to beginningless karma. They teach us also how we can get rid of this bondage. Among these sõstras, the foremost place is given to the four Vedas with their crowning chapters called the Upanishads. These are called the Srutis. Next come the Smritis like those of Mapu, Yagnavalkya, and Parasara and also the Mahabharata with its great inset, The Bhagavad Gita, and the Rāmāyaya, and the Puranas, and likewise, the Prabandhas of the Alvars. These smritīs are valid sources of kpowledge so long as they do not state anything that is directly opposed to the teaching of the Srutīs. The Brahma Sutrās of Badarayana are the result of a critical examination of the Srutīs in regard to what they actually teach and are also authoritative. 

The followers of Ramanuja accept also the validity of the teacbing contained in the Pancharatra Agamas. These Āgamās have come down to us from time immemorial and are held by Visishtadvaitips to have been taught by the Supreme Being, Nara yana Himself. Only some among these ägamās are now available to us in print like Ahirbudhnya Samhita, Lakshmi Tantram, Satvata Samhita, Poushkara Samhitā, Iswara Samhita and Garuda Samhila. The followers of Ramanuja do not find any doctrine or statement in these âgamas which conflicts with the Srutis. Therefore they give a high place to them as to Srutis, so far as religion and spiritual life are concerned. 

It is on a careful and critical examination of the knowledge provided by these varied sources of knowledge, (pramāņās), that Sri Ramanuja based his system of religious philosophy called Visistadvaita. We get to know the doctrines and traditions con Dected with this system from his commentaries on the Brahnı Sutras of Badarayana called Sri Bhäskyam, Vedānta Deepa and Vedānta-sara and also treatises called Vēdārthasangraha, Sara nāgati-gudyan, Vaikunta gadyam and Sriranga gadyam. In regard to certain traditional beliefs and observances based on the Pancharitra ūgamas. Ramanuja has not left a clear and definite expression of his views. Sri Vedantadesika, who came some one bundred and fifty years after him and who was steeped in the religious lore and the religious discussions which had intervened during this period, aims at giving a clear, complete and compre. hensive exposition of Visishtadvaitic thought and tradition in his Srimad Rahsyatra yasära. 

The following is a brief summary of the teaching contained in Rahasyatrayasära on the more important doctrines of Rama. puja's system of philosophy and of the religious and spiritual tradition (sampradaya) connected with him as understood by the Northern School of Sri Vaishnavites (Vadagalais). 

TATTVA 

The intelligent man who is desirous of miokshu or deliverance from the bondage of samsāra or the cycle of births and deaths should know the three kinds of tattväs or Reals (things that exist) 

INTRODUCTION 

and the relation in which they stand towards one another. Accord. ing to Visishtadvaita, all existing things are roal and none of them is a mere illosory appearance. 

There are three classes or kinds of existing things or reals. (1) Chit by which are meant seotient beings which have conscious Dess, however low their level might be (2) Achit which means non sentient things, which have no consciousness and which are all modifications of matter or prakriti and (3) Iswara wbo stands by. Himself (being of different from the other two) as their Ruler and Controller. 

1. CHIT 

Chit is a class name or a name which indicates & group or class of existing things. By Chit is meant Ātma, soul or self. Ito essential nature (Svarupa) or what distinguishes it from the other two, achit and Iswara, may be described as follows:- It is different from the body, the senses, the mind, the vital breath (prāna) and intelligence (buddhi). It is ajada or wompable of shining by itself; its esseatial nature is bliss or ānanda and jnana (consciousness or kaowledge). It is eternal (nitya), atomic (anu) and incapable of being perceived by the senses. It is indivisible and has no parts or avayavas. Besides being of the nature of knowledge (jnana), it possesses also jnana or knowledge as an attribute (dharma), This karwledge possessed by the self is called dharmabhita jnana. The sell or soul is subject to the control of Iswara (ni yamya) and is also supported by Him (dharya). It is s'èsha to Iswara (i.e) it exists solely for the fulfilment of His purposes and not for itself. 

It was said above that the self can abide by itself. A pot, for instance, can be seen only when it is lighted up by the flame of & lamp, but the flame of & lamp sbines by itself and does not require any other light to help its being seen. So also the sell shines or, in other words, is felt or realised by the person without any other help. The self is also conscious of itself as when a map says 'I'. Pain, misery and the like are due to contact with the body. This contact with the body has resulted from beginningless karma. The self or ülmā thinks that the pain is its own. 

If the self is nitya or eternal, it may be asked what birth and death mean. The answer is that birth means contact acquired with a body; death is separation from that body. 

The sastrās say that the self is anu or atomic and that at the time of death, it leaves the body from the heart. Though the self is atomic or infinitesimally sipall in size and confined to one place, mamely the heart, it is able to perceive the pleasure or the pain in every part of the body by means of the knowledge which it possesses as an attribute (dharmabhita jnāna). Dharmabhūtix jrāna or attributive knowledge is capable of contraction and expan sion (sankocha vikäsa.) and can expand and reach everywhere. The self has no parts or avuyavas and cannot undergo change or modification (vikāra). In this respect it is different from achit or material objects like pots and cloths and cannot be burnt, cut, cooled or atherwise modified. Advaitins hold that the self or soul is consciousness or knowledge and does not possess knowledge as an attribute (i e.) dharmabhūta jnana. This is wrong, for we feel that we have knowledge and do not feel that we are jnana or consciousness alone. 

Just as the self is a knower who possesses knowledge (jnälä). it is also a doer (karta), one that wills and makes efforts and one that experiences or enjoys (bhoktā). It should be remembered in this connection that will wbich acts or puts forth efforts and enjoy. ment or experience are both only forms of knowledge. 

The self is a doer but a doer that is ever subject to the control of Iswara. It is supported by Iswara because it can have no exist. ence except that due to His essential nature (svarūpa) and His will (sankalpa). Taking the case of our own body and soul, the soul supports the body and prevents it from disintegrating or falling during sleep by its essential nature (svarīpa). During its waking 

INTRODUCTION 

xiii 

moments, the soul keeps the body from falling by its will (san. kalpa). So also in regard to the self as related to Iswara. It will be explained later that the soul stands in the relation of body to Iswara, who is its Inner Self. 

The soul was stated before to be sesha to Iswara add to exist only for His purposes. Houses, fields, sons, wives and the like ape sesha to a man and exist for the fulfilment of his parposes. But they can and do exist apart from himn. The self, on the other band, is a s'esha to Iswara which cannot exist apart from Him. It is inseparable from Him. So it is an inseparable attribute or viseshaņa of Iswara. In this respect the self is like the body of a man in relation to his soul. The body may be defined as that which is supported by & self and is capable of being controlled by it, while existingfor the fulfilment of its purposes. In this sease the self of every sentient being is the body of Iswara, 

When Chit is said to be a class-Dame, what is meant is that ituās or seatient beings are many, though all of them belong to the class Chit, The self's or souls may belong to any one of these groups: (1) those that are in the bondage of samsāra (baddhas) (2) those that have obtained liberation from it (muktas) and (3) those who are eternally free (nityas) (i.e.) who have never been in samsāra, such as Garuda and Adisesha. 

Owing to contact with achit, (the body or mattter), the self has avidya (ignorance), karma and vāsanās or past impressions, tastes and aptitudes. When contact with achit ceases entirely, avidya and the rest leave the self. The avidyā and karma have no beginning. Therefore their original cauae is not to be enquired into. What is of importance is to bring about their end. 

The self's, be they baddhas muktas or nityas, are inaumerable. 

Visishtadvaitids stoatly oppose the Advaitic view that there is only a single self enveloped io avidyā and that when this is realised, the self becomes identical with Brahman, that there is nothing else 

xiv but this Brahman, which is pure consciousness, and that all objects in the Universe, around, above and below as, are mere illusor y appearances. 

In the state of mukti, though souls or self's are all alike and perfectly resemble one another, yet there is difference among them capable of being perceived by themselves. 

The self or ātmā may be defined as a conscious being that solely exists for the fulfilment of Iswara's purposes (s'esha). Achit or matter, too, exists for Iswara but it is not a conscious being. The Jiva who is conscious and has intelligence is not only & yesha but a dāsa (servant) of God. 

It was stated before that the svarüpa or essential datore of the self is knowledge or consciousness and that it has knowledge a: an attribute or dharma. Is there any difference between these two kinds of knowledge or jnana, it may be asked. The know ledge which is svarūpa is incapable of contraction and expansion; it does not light up anything other than itself; it is conscious of itselt (self-conscious). The knowledge which is an attribute is capable of contraction and expansion and can light op other things like pots, cloths, stars, men and so on to the self. It is capable of all-pervasiveness in the state of mukti, though limited in its range in the state of samsāra owing to past karma. 

According to Visishtadvaita, koowledge is & substance or dravya, because it is the seat of action and qualities. Knowledge, though a substance, may also be an attribute or dharma 88 dharmabhuta jnana is of the guarūpa jnana. Attributive know ledge or dharmabhūta jnāna is eternal. In the state of sushupti or dreamless sleep, it is dormant and does not spread out and reach anything, as the senses are then inactive. 

INTRODUCTION 

II. ACHIT. 

Achit or matter, in its different forms or modifications, is without consciousness or knowledge. It is subject to changes in its form (vikara) though eternal as substance. 

Achit is of three kinds - The first kind of achit is called prakriti or matter, such as we see around us in this world. It is sometimes called also misrasattvam, because the quality of sattvam is miogled in it with rajas and tamas. It is prakriti wbich, by its contact with the bound self, conceals from it know ledge and bliss; it is also the cause of erroneous knowledge. As has already been said, it is eternal and is an accessory to Iswara's leela or sportful activity. Sometimes it is called prakriti because from it, other forms of matter are evolved (vikriti). It is also called Māyā, for it is the cause of a wonderful variety of creations. 

Misrasattvam is in twenty four forms --prakriti (the root cause or primordial matter), mahat the next stage of modification, ahankara, manas (mind), the five kinds of subtle elements (tannātras), the five senses of knowledge, sight, smell, taste, hearing and touch (Tränendriyas); the five senses of action, hand, leg, speech, the organs of excretion and sex (karmendriyās), and the five elements or bhutās viz, earth, water, fire, air aod ākāsa (space or ether). It is by mixing these twenty-four tattuās of achit that Iswara creates the anda or world by Himself and through Brabma. There are many such andās or worlds, which are all within the region of Iswara's leclā. 

The second kind of achit is called suddhasattvam. It is so called because it is sattva that is free from all admixture of rajas and tamas. Suddhasattvam is a wonderful substance entirely different from the matter or prakriti that we see around us. It is eternal and capable of producing knowledge and bliss. By the mere will of Bhagavad and constituted of suddhasattvam, towers, palaces, assembly halls, groves, gardens and the like exist in the region of eternal glory (rutya vibhuti or Paramapada) which is 

xvi beyond the region of prakriti. Suddhasattvam is of supreme splendour (tējas) and is incapable of being measured by the muktas, and nityas and even Iswara. Some acharyās say that it is capable of shining by itself (ajada), while others are of opinion that it has to be lighted up by something other than itself (jada), 

Those who hold that it is ajada state that it sbines to the nityās, muktas and Iswara without requiring to be lighted up by some. thing else. But while the jīvas are in samsāra, it remains invisible to them. It is not self-conscious and is therefore achit. Besides it is, as already pointed out, subject to changes or modifica tions such as towers, palaces and so on. It is therefore achit. 

The third kind of achit is Time or Kāla. It is in Time that the evolutes of matter (prakriti) undergo their modifications. Time or Kāla has none of the three qualities of prakriti (sattvam, rajas, or tamas). It is eternal (szitya) and all-pervasive (vibhu). 

The two kinds of achit, s'uddhasattvan, and misrasattvam serve to Iswara and sentient beings (baddha, mukta, and nitya) as objects of enjoyment (bhogya), as accessory instruments of enjoyment (bhoga upakarana) and as places of enjoyment (bhogasthāna). Bhogya is that which is experienced or enjoyed; bhoga - upakaranas are the senses which help the Jiva in experiencing or enjoying, and bhogasthānas are the various worlds (andās) and nityavibhuti and so also the innumerable bodies of sentient beings. 

III. ISWARA 

The essential nature of Iswara is Reality (satyam), knowledge (jnana), bliss (ānanda) and infiniteness (ānantam). Iswara is opposed to everythiog that is of the nature of a blemish. He has hosts of auspicious qualities (kalyāṇaguna) like knowledge and might. He creates the Universe, sustains it and likewise causes its dissolution. He is the refuge of all jivas and dispenses to them the objects desired by them whether it be dharma, artha (wealth), kama (desires), or moksha. He has a special and characteristic 

INTRODUCTION 

form (vigraha) of His own in nityavibhuti. His chief queen or consort is Lakshmi; Bbumi and Neela are also His consorts, 

Even as light is opposed to darkness, Iswara is opposed to everything of the nature of change (vikära) or of blemish (dosha). He is infinite in the sense that He is eternal in regard to time, ompipresent or all.pervasive in regard to space, and has all things and all beings as His prakaras, modes or attributes which are inseparable from Him. He is the inner self (antaryami) of all things and of all beings. Thus He is not limited from the point of view of time, space, or objects. 

It may be asked: "If Iswara is within all things and all beings, would He not be affected by their faults or blemishes per The answer is: "No. The individual self or ātmā is not affected in any way by such changes as childhood, youth and old age which are the modifications undergone by the body. As in the case of the self of the individual, the inner self of all, namely Iswara, remains within, unaffected by the faults or blemishes of chit or uchit. 

Iswara is conpact of happiness or bliss (ānanda) and His essential nature is light or splendour that shines. His qualities like knowledge and night are eternal (nitya), innumerable and boundless. He has neither equals nor superiors, 

Besides Jnāna or kaowledge and might (sakti, ), He has boundless compassion for Jivas and infinite love to them. He is easily accessible to everyone. He is ever ready to help mortals to cross over samsāra and attain moksha. He is Himself the upaya for us to attain moksha when we are without any other upāya or means for attaining it. 

As has been already stated, He is the cause of all the world and this is not due to any karma of His, but His mere will. Creation, maintenance and destruction are of the nature of sport (Tula) to Him; that is, they are not performed for the sake of any fatare 

xviii gain bat for the moment's pleasure, recreation or delectation like games played by kings. "Is destruction or dissolution of the world (samhāra ) sport to Him?" it may be asked. The answer is : "That, too, is Tila for him ", because in the state of samhāra or pralaya, the jiva is given repose and rest after the sins, troubles and tribulations of life. Iswara is also the material cause of the world (upādāna karana). It is He that evolves into the world of chit and achit. “Does it not mean that He undergoes change? it may be asked. The answer is "No. It is not His essential nature (svarūpa) that evolves iatochit and achit, but His attributes or prakaras, chit and achit, which are inseparable from Him and which, during pralaya or dissolution, lie in so subtle a state that they may not be recogoised as existing at all . it is these wbich evolve into tbe world." 

It may be asked:--- " How can the same object or person be both the material cause and the instrumental cause? In the case of a pot, mud is the material cause or upādāna kūrına and it is different from the instrumental cause such as the potter, bis wheel and bis stick." The answer is as follows." The same object may sometimes be both upädāna kāruna (the material caase) and the instrumental cause (nimitta kärana). Have we not seen the spider weaving a wonderful web out of the material or stuff constituting its body? Iswara, too, creates the universe with chit and achit, which are His body and which are inseparable froin Him. Iswara remains without change in His svarūpa; it is only his prakūras, modes or attributes, chit and achit, that change. 

To achit, Iswara is the cause of modification : to chit or sentient beings, it is He that gives the body and the senses, and that awards also inoksha. 

. When we find some beings happy and others unhappy, we should not charge Iswara with partiality and cruelty in creating them differently. It is on account of their past karma that Iswara makes them different and this karma is anädi (beginningless). 

INTRODUCTION 

It has been stated before that Iswara bas a unique form (or vigraha). By its pature and qnalities, this form is supremely delightful; it is eternal, ever the same and pare, it is constituted of s'uddha sattvam. It is radiant and is of imcomparable splendour. It is supremely beautiful and enchanting and is fit to be meditated on by Yogis. It is enjoyed by nityas and muktas in the region of eternal glory (nitya vibhuti). It is from this form that the incarnations appear. Iswara is the Universal Saviour and the refuge of all. He has orgaments, weapons, attendants and the like. 

Iswara is, according to Pancharatra, in five forms. (1) Para or Para Vasudeva, the supreme Being (2) Vyüha or emanations, such as are described in the Pancbaratra ūgamas (3) Vibhava incarnations. (4) antaryāni or Harda (the inner self in the heart who controls all activities from within) and (6) archi or image. Para is the Supreme Being in Vaikunta or nitya vibhuti ever enjoy ed by nityas and muktas. The Pancharatra Agames call Him Vasu deva. He is the same as Narayana, Visbnu and Brabmao. Vyaha is the emanation from Para into the forms of Vyaba Vasudeva, Sankarshapa, Pradyumne, and apiruddha for the sake of the creation, the maintenance and the destruction of the world and for conferring His grace on those who worsbip Him. 

Io Para the six* qualities such as Jnāna are full and perfect; each Vyuba other than Vasudeva exbibits lame only two of those six qualities. 

Vibbaves are many and they are of two kinds ;- some are principal (mukhya) and others secondary (gaung). Incarnations are dne only to the Lord's will add not to karma. 

The forms of the principal incarnations are not constituted of prakriti or matter. They retain the nature and qualities of the 

* The six qualities : Jnana (knowledge): alsvarya (lord-ship or doimpeded activity independent of all others; sakni (ability or potency to become the material cause of the world; bala (strength, absence of fatigue sustaining power); virya (virility-changcléssness); and tejas (splendour, might, the power to defeat others). Sopreme Being and are like new lamps lighted from an original one. They are fit for the meditation of those wbo aspire to mukti, Sach are Rama, Krishna and the like. 

The secondary incarnations are through such as sre Jivas like Vyasa. 

The object of an incarnation is to protect the righteous, to destroy the wicked and to establish dharma. 

The Anataryāmī or Harda dwells within the heart of the Jiva,* whatever he may be, in order to belp bim, in order to be meditated on by him and in order to redeem him. 

Archa is the Supreme Being residing within the images or other objects that are worshipped in houses or temples. 

It was said above that chit and achit are the body of Iswara and that these evolve into the world of sentiept beings and pon. sentient things during creation. This doctrine that Iswara is the inder self of all beings and of all things and that they are His body is the principal feature of Sri Ramanuja's Visishtadvaitic thought. The relation that exists between chit and achit on the one side and Iswara on the other is that between the body and the self särira sariri bhāva. The doctrine is based on a passage in the Antaryāmi Brāhmaṇam of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, where Brahman is said to have everything in the Universe as its body and to control everything from withip. The definition of body or sarira given before should be remembered in this connection. 

Note: The jiva here means a jiva who can meditate. 

INTRODUCTION 

VISISHTADVAITA AND ADVAITA 

Ramanuja's system of religious philosophy is called Visishtad. vaita or Visishta Advaita to dia inguish it from Sri Sankara. charya's Advaita. There are some passages or texts in the Upanishads which state that Brahman alone exists and that there is no second to it. Basing bis system on such texts, Sankara inaintains that there is only & single reality or Real, namely, Brabman. The multitudinous objects and beings which we see around, above, and below us in the Universe are, according to him, unreal and illusory appearances like the mirage and like the silver which sometimes appears as an illusion on the shell. The world that exists around us consists of sentient beings, chit and non sentient things, achit. Sankara bolds that all these are illusory projections (mithyā) on the only real entity which is Brahmap. His system of philosophy is, therefore, called Advaita, the philo sopby which treats of the one without a second. Sankar& states that this Brahman bas po attributes or qualities by which it can be described or defined and that we can only speak of it as mere consciousness (chit or Jnāna). It is not consciousness which is conscious of anything within it or outside of it, for there is nothing else within it or outside of it. It is the only Real and nothing more can be said of it except that it is the opposite of non existence, nonconsciousness and finiteness, 

Ramanuja interprets these texts which declare the oneness of Brahman and its having no second in the Universe in a different way. According to him, Brahmap is said to be the only Reality in the Srutis or Upanisbads in the same way as a man who has a body and the senses in addition to his soul, or ātmā is said to be & single entity. In fact the passage referred to already in the Brihadāranyaka Upanishad called * Antaryāmi Brahmana declares, in unmistakable terms, that the Universe consisting of sentient beings, jivas and non-sentient things (watter) are all the body of Brahman and that Brahman is their inner self or soul. 

• II 

7xxii All sentiert beings, be they gods, men, animals or plants, are the body of Brahman and, likewise, all inanimate things are its body. On the authority of such texts, Ramapuja explains the passage stating Brabman to be the only Reality as meaning that Brahman which has for its body the universe of septient beings and don. sentient things (chit and achit) is the only Real. The body is an attribute or viseshana of the self. So the universe consisting of chit and achit which, according to the Srutis, is the body of Brah. nan, is & viseshana or attribute of Brahman. Uplike Sankara, Ramanuja holds that Brahman has an infinite number of auspi. cious qualities and finds many passages in the Upanishads to support bis view. So the Reality that the Srutis speak of is Brabman with its viseshanas or attributes and qualities (chit and achit and guņas). All these are as real as Brabman itself and being inseparable from their inner self or soal, they are incladed in Brahman when it is declared to be the only Real. Ramanuja's religious philosophy is therefore called Visishta Advaita or the philosophy that treats of the one Reality, namely Brabman, with all its inseparable attributes or viseshanas included tithin itself. 

There is absolutely no difference between the views of the Northern School (Vadagalais) and those of the Southern School (Theogalais) in regard to wbat has been said so far about the three tattvas or Reals. It is only about Kevalas or Kaivalyan that there is a slight difference of opinion. The Soathen School con sider Keralas who delight in the enjoyment of their own dis.' embodied self without attaining the bliss of Bbagavad as being also muktas wbo are of an ipferior class residing in the outermost parts of Paramapada. The Northern School maintain that niukti, in the true sense of the word, means the attainment of that bliss and that kaivalyam is not mukti as it is without it. If, in some treatises of ancient acharyas, kovālas are called muktas, it is oply by way of courtesy, as they are in many respects superior to other baddkas, Kevalas have still to attain mukti since they have some remnants of sin or karma clingiog to them,

There is, bonever another point about which there is a diver gence of views. What is the position and the essential nature (svarupa) of Lakshmi? Is she a jīva, atomic in nature like other jivas, though superior to all of them? If she were considered as being equal in status to Bhagavan, would it not be against the relationsbip of the wife to ber lord and would it not also conflict with the saying that Bhagavan is 'destitute' of equals and superiors ? 

The Southern School hold that Lakshmi occupies & special and unique place of her own below that of Bhagavan. She is anu or atonic and is a jīva. She acts as a mediator pleading to her I ord for mercy to the sinner (purushakāra). She is also the seshi along with Her Lord, both in Leela vibhuti and in Nitya vibhuti, and is entitled to the service of the baddhas in this world and to that of the nityas and the muktas in the world beyond viz. the region of eternal glory (nitya vibhuti). Bhagavan is, however, the 

ole upaya or means for the attainment of moksha and Lakshmi has no part in this in the same way as she has no part in the creation, sustenance, and destruction of the world. 

Vedantadesika, the greatest of the exponents of the Northern School, states tbat Lakshmi, the inseparable attribute of Bhagavan as described in the Bhagavat Sastra or Pancharatra is in every way the object of equal veneration and worship as Bbagavan and that our worship is always to the Lord and Lakshmi. Being inseparable from Him, She participates in all His activities except in the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the world. She is s'eshi to all of lis, baddhas, muktas and nitrās as much as the Lord Hinuself. She is not anu or atomic bnt vibhu or all-pervasive and ompipresept. She is not only the mediator (purushakāra) intercejing and pleading for the pardon of the offences of Jivas but also the upaya along with Her Lord for the attainment of mukti by the prapanna. Our service after the attainwent of mukti extends to her as much as to Bhagavad. Whenever Bhagavan is mentioned, we should take it that Lakshmi also is intended to be understood. Our daivatam or Supreme Divinity is the Divine Couple, Bhagavan and Sri, and not Bhagavan alone. 

xiy PURUSHARTHA OR THE GOAL OF LIFE. 

It is true that men strive for varied ends or objects in the course of their lives, but the wise man who realises the misery implied in samsāra or the cycle of births and deaths anderstands that the only purushärtha or goal that he should aspire to is moksha or liberation from samsāra. Moksha, according to Visi shtadvaita, is not merely the deliverance of the ātma from the bondage of karma and the cycle of births and deaths, but the positive attainment of the bliss of Bhagavan in Paramapada or Vaikunta. This alone is true moksha or sayujyam, as it is other. wise called. In religious treatises, mention is often made of the attainnent by some jivas of sālokya, of sārībya apd of sūrneepya. These are different from the true moksha or säyujyu, in as inuch as the happiness attained in those states is neither perfect oor eternal. Sālokya means the attainment of a world or lika which is one of Bhagavan's but is not Paramapada. Sarūpya means the attainment of a form resembling the Lord's as the result of constant meditation on one of these forne, (say, Rama or Krishda). Sameepya is the attainment of a place near Parama. pada bat pot Paramapada itself. So also mention is sometimes made of 'Vibhava lokās' and Vynila lokās'. If a man constantly meditates on any of the important vibhaväs or avatārs he will attain the world of that vibhava from which he will afterwards have to attain Paramapada. So also with regard to the Vyuha loka. Sayujya, which alone is inoksha in the trge sense of the word, consists in bhoga sāmyan, that is, the self attains, in that state, perfect happiness or biiss exactly like that of Bhagavan Himself. There may be and are differences between the activities permitted to the self in moksha and those that are Bhagavan's, but in regard to enjoyment or bliss, there is absolutely no difference *(paramam samyam upaiti). The love felt by the self to Bhaga. van in moksha is so great that it overflowa into service or kainkarya to Him. Kainkarya or service to the Lord is also bliss In fact it is the crowning glory or bliss of mukti (Kainkarya sūnirajyam).

UPAYA OR THE MEANS OF ATTAINING 

THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF LIFE, 

How or by what means is the self to attain this bliss of moksha? In regard to this, there is a divergence between the viewe held by the Northern School and those held by the Southera. 

The view held by the Northern School (V'adagalais) is stated in distinct and unmistakable words by Vedantadesika in bis Rahasyatrayasāra. There are only two ways in whicb or upāyas hy which the self can get rid of its past karma and attain moksha. They are bhakti or bhaktiyoga, as it is called, and prapatti, the surrender of the sell to the Lord whom it seeks as the only refuge. Prapatti may be adopted as a preliminary way of approaching the Lord for the performance or adoption of bhakti or as a direct means of attaining moksha. In the former case, prapatti or saranagati is said to be an anga or accessory to bhakti. Or it may be adopted as the primary and direct means or upāya for attaining moksha, when it becomes angī. So prapatti may be anga prapatti or angi prapatti. These terms will be explained presently. Bhakti and prapatti sre the only two means for securing the grace of Bhagavan, who, beiog pleased thereby, grants moksha. Bhakti is otherwise called Upasana or dhyāna. There are some thirty-two vidyas* or forms of upāsana explained or indicated in the Upanishads. Constant meditation of Brahman and His attributes or qualities accompanied by the proper perfor mance of the rites and duties prescribed in the sāstras, such as nitya and naimittika for one's varna (caste) and one's ūsrama (stage of life), is the way or upāya called bhakti. The meditation has to be practised daily as long as life lasts. Ultimately it should attain the stage almost of actual visual perception of Brabman. To ordinary men, this upāya is difficult, but if it is adopted in the fulness of its perfection, all past karma which stands as an obstacle 

Brahma Vidyas like daharavidya, sadvidya, bhumavidya, sandilyavidya and antaradityavidya. 

xxvi to the attainment of Brabman is destroyed except that part of it which bas already begun to yeild its consequences (prārabdha) and when this too is brought to its end by the enjoyment or experience (anubhava) of its effects, either in this one life or in one or more future lives, the self attains moksha. Thus there is likelihood of delay in the attainment of moksha to the man who follows the way of bhakti. Bhakti is sometimes loosely employed to include bowing before archa, uttering the holy nanues of Bhagavan, singing His praise and such other acts of devotion and love. Service to Bhagavan in temples and the like is also sometimes called bhakti. This service also extends to the devotees of Bhag. van who are dear to him. These acts tend to promote bhakti but do not form bhakti-yoga. 

Bhakti yoga results from seven auxiliary states of mind : (1) viveka which arises from bodily purity resulting from the avoidance of impure food (2) vimoka (freedom from desires) (3) abhyāsa (freqnent meditation of the auspicious ohject) (s'ubhü s'raya) (4) kriyū the performance of such rites as the five kinds of yagra in accordance with ope's ability, (5) kalyānāni (kind. ness to all beings: being one in thought word and deed, compassion, freedom from covetousness, refraining from injury to others by thought, word or deed) (6) anavasüda (freedom from depres sion) and (7) anuddharsha (freedom from elation or undue exaltation of spirit). 

Bhakti aided by these virtues results in something l'esembling visual perception of Bhagavan and is the cause of the last thought being turned to Bhagavan. It has three stages of development called by Sri Ramanuja: para bhakti, parajnana and parama bhakti. 

When karma is said to be destroyed by bhakti or prapatti, what is really meant is that Bhagavan, being pleased with the man's devotion or self-sorrender, gives up the thought of ponishing bim for his sios or karma. 

INTRODUOTION 

Xxvii 

Prapatti is also called nyasa, nyasa vidyā, nikshepa, bharan. väsa, s'aranagati, and bhara-samarpanam. It consists primarily in seeking Bhagavan as the sole refuge for one's salvation and surrendering one's self to Him for salvation. 

It has five angas or accessories which are mental attitudes (1) the will or determination to do what is agreeable to the Lord, (2) the avoidance of wbatever is displeasing to Him, (3) maha. viswäsa or intense faith that the Lord can and will be one's Saviour, (4) Helplessness or being without the knowledge or capacity to adopt any means for saving oneself and (5) prayer to the Lord that He should extend his protection, 

Nyasa has to be performed only once under the guidance of the acharya and it is capable of securing moksha at the end of this very life. Bhakti, it was said before, destroys all past karma except that which has already begin to operate (prärabdha). Prapatti, on the other hand, is capable of destroying even prü rabdha karma. The central idea in prapatti is the thought of the inan that he is incapable of performing the rites and duties pres cribed in the sāstras for the expiation of his sids and for the attainment of moksha and that, therefore the Lord should, Himself, be the upāya or means for the expiation of his sids and tte attain ment of mioksha. Pleased with bis surrender, the Lord, out of bis natural compassion, pardons all the man's sips and short-comiogs and grants the map the goal desired by Him, viz. moksha. In the Rahasyatrayasära, bhakti or upāsana or dhyāna and prapatti are called sādhyopāja or upāga or meads wbich the man Oan adopt following the guidance of the swastras and the acharyas, Bhagavan is called siddhofāgia, tbe utāga that is already present ever ready to save. 

One of the finest chapters in the Rahasyatravasära is that called the Uttarakrityadhikära; it prescribes the kind of life that a man should lead after the performance of prapatti. Bodily purity, freedom from evil thronghts, the performance of nitya and Haimittika ribes without any desire for the fruits or consequences, 

xxviii goodwill to all, even to enemies who hate and revile, service to God and the devotees of God, contentment with wbatever one bas or whatever comes in one's way without any effort for attaining it - these are some of the virtues that the prapanna should cultivate. His service to God and His devotees is prompted by the mere love of it and is not due to the expectation of any reward. When one has performed prapatti, one gives ap all thoughts concerning oneself, even the thought of attaining moksha, for the Lord has taken on Himself all this burden or bhara, 

It may be asked: “It was said before that one of the angas of prapatti is the will or determination at the time of its perfor mance to do whatever is pleasing to God and the avoidance of wbat is displeasing to Him. Human nature being what it is, it is just possible that the prapanna commits offences against the Lord, either anawares or even deliberately. If he does so, how can it be said that the performance of prapatti is sure to bring bim moksha of the end of this very life?" Vedantadesika apswers this question as follows:- "In matters which cannot be understood by human reasoning, and in which the sāstras are the only authority, we have to accept with faith what is stated in them, just as they are stated there. Prapatti is said in the süstras to have the potency of conferriog moksha at the end of this life. The man who has performed prapatti is not likely to commit sips deliberately. If he commits them unawares, they will be ignored by the Lord as they were not deliberate. If he bas, at any time, owing to the weakness of buman Dature, committed & deliberate offence, he should offer expiation (prayaschitta ) for it and thus obtain pardon and the prayaschitta for such offences is another prapatti. If, however, being hard of heart, he does not choose to offer this expiation, the Lord will punish bim in this very life, before his death, in some way or other for the sin committed by him. He may become blind or lame or meet with the loss of friends or relatives or become subject social obloquy. There are bundreda of other forms which the punishment might take. It is certain, 

INTRODUCTION 

xxix 

however, that the prapanna will have moksha at the end of this very life as desired by him. 

Among the prapannas, there are two classes driptas and ārtas. Driptas are those that can bear the sufferings of this life until death overtakes them. secure in the consciousness that the Saviour will confer moksha thereafter. Artas are those who, while per forming prapatti, beg to be relieved of this life at once, as they cannot endore separation from Bhagavan even for an instant. They, too, will have their prayer fulfilled. 

Competence for the performance of prapatti consists, 88 has been already indicated in want of full knowledge of the upāya (bhakti. yoga) described in the sāstras or in the incapacity to adopt it. Even if a man bas the knowledge and the capacity, if be cannot endure the delay in the attaindent of moksha which is likely in bhakti as an upaya, he is competent to adopt prapatti. It has to be added that upāsana or bhakti is open only to men belonging to the three higher castes; prapatti, on the other hand, is open to all castes and to both sexes. 

The performance of prapatti is a rite to be gone through with the prescribed mantras or mysteries. There are two forms in which the rite is gegally performed today. One is the rite in which he disciple is made to repeat the mantra of prapatti de dictated by the Acharya. This is uktinishța in the other the disciple does not repeat that mantra but the acharya performs it for him. This is acharyanishtā. 

The reader may now ask: "In this scheme of upayas for the attaioment of moksha, if bhakti and prapatti alone &re stated to be the upayas, what is the place of karma yoga and jnana yoga which are described at considerable length in the Bhagavad Gita ? Do they in any way contribute to the attainment of moksha juu The answer is as follows:- Karma yoga means the performance, by one who has understood the truth concerning the essential nature of the jiva and that of the Supreme Being, of such karinas 

XYZ or rites and duties as are prescribed in the sāstras for one's varna and one's asrama under the heads of nitya (compulsory and regularly recurring rites) naimittika (compulsory bat occasional rites due to particular occasions) and kämya, those which are capable of yielding certain fruits but wbich are not forbidden. These rites and daties should be performed without any desire for the consequences or fruits which they might be capable of yielding and in accordance with one's ability. Further any one of the following should be treated as most important, adoration of the Gode, austerities (tapas), pilgrimages to holy places, gifts of charity and yagnas or sacrifices. If duly performed, they tend to remove the sids of the Jiva and help to promote jnāna yoga and through it to create bhakti. They may also directly promote bhakti. Jnāna yoga is capable of helping the jiva to realise bis self as detached or separated from the body. It leads directly to bhakti. Other means such as the pruise of the Lord and the utterance of Bis holy names are helpfal in promoting bhakti. 

It should be clearly anderstood that bhakti and prapatti are only particular forms of jnāna or knowledge. So the saying Jnänāt muktih (Inukti is the result of jnīna,) applies to bhakti and prapatti. 

but worship to Bhagavetiheir fruit 

The devotee may be either an Ekantin or a Paramaikantin. He is called Ekantin who prays to Bhagavan for moksha as well as for the good things of this life but worships no other deity. He is & Paramaikantin who, while praying only to Bhagavan, does not pray for anything other than bhakti and jnana and their fruit moksha. 

From what has been said before, it would be clear that bhakti, 88 an upaya, requires certain rites and duties as aids or accessories (angas) and that, withoat them, it would be incomplete. Prapatti, on the other hand, does not require the performance of any such rites and duties. It is complete in itself. It has been described as resembling the Brahma missile (Brahmtstra) whose potenoy 

INTRODUCTION 

xxxi 

would disappear if it were accompanied by the use of any other weapon or missile. The question would arise, “Why should the prapanna perform the karmas or rites like nitya and naimittika, if they serve no purpose in promoting the efficacy of prapatti ?" Vedantadesika ådmits the potency of prapatti to secure moksha without the supplementary aid of other rites and duties, but insists that the prapanna, too, like the bhakta, should continue to perform these karmas or rites as they are God's ordinances or commands revealed through the Srutis and Smritis and as their non performance would be a violation of divine injunctions and there fore disobedience to God. By their neglect the jiva would incur punishment from Bhagavan. 

So far we have described at some length Sri Vedantadesikar's teacbing on bhakti and prapatti as upāyas for the attainment of noksha with reference to the competency for each of them, the fruit arising from each and the differences between them. It is well known that in the Rahasyatrayasära, several chapters (notably 23, 24, 25, 26 and also 29) deal with controversial matter, For & clear understanding of the discussion contained in those chapters, it is necessary to have a knowledge of what the acharyas of the Southern School, especially Sri Lokacharya, have said in such treatises as Sri Vachanabhooshanam and Mumukshuppadi about bhakti and prapatti. 

1. According to Sri Lokacharya,* bhakti, thoagh described as an upaya in the Upanishads, is really against the essential nature of the jiva (svarūpa viruddhai) The jiva is the body of Iswara. He is absolutely dependent on Iswara for all that he is and does and is also His s'esha or dasa who has no will and no capacity for action which he can call his own. 

* He is not referred to by his namo in Rahasyatrayasara. MUMUKSHUPPADI: Tirumantraprakaranama Sutra: 21, Commentary of Mana 

valamamuni, Page 81, Tirukkacchi Nambidasar's Edition, Presidency 

Press, Madras. Also Srivachanabhooshanam: Dviteeyaprakaranam: Sutras 115, 116, 117, 178.xxxii Sri Lokacharya argues :-- "If this is so, to adopt bhakti as an upāya would mean that the jiva trusts to his own endeavours and efforts for his salvation. How can a creature who has no will of bis own think of depending on himself, when every thought and every movement of bis are directed and controlled by Iswara ?" Therefore prapatti alone is the means of salvation for one whose svarüpa is being s'esha to Iswara. 

To this Vedantadesika replies :- "It is true that the jīva is dependent on Iswara for all that he is. But Iswara has endowed hiin with intelligence and reason, so that, as a rational being, he may use the powers granted to him by Iswara for rejecting evil and for choosing what is good. If the jīva is absolutely without any free will of his own, the s'āstras which enjoin certain thiogs to be done by him on pain of God's displeasure would be meaningless. And the süstras do prescribe at great length bhakti as an upaya, It would be anfair on the part of the sastras to prescribe something for the adoption of the jīva if it were against his essential nature. 

2. Another point at issue between the two schools is the nature of prapatti or what is meant by that word. Sri Lokucharya lays emphasis on the jiva's being the body of Iswara and on his being His s'esha and also on the overwhelming compassion of the Lord towards the jiva. He argues from these that, like a man who would cleaose the dirt on his own body without being prayed to by that body, Iswara would, of His own accord, cleanse the impurities of the self which is his body without any prayer or effort on its part. So prapatti is, according to bim, merely mental acquiescence, on the part of the jiva, in Iswara's undertaking the responsibility of his protection. What is required of the prapanna is refraining from rejecting the Lord's eagerness to save him (*apratishedha) or in other words, mere receptivity. The jīva does not remain passive like a clod (achit) but is mentally aware of the Lord's mercy, of His omnipotence and of his grace which requires

no cause hetu or effort on the jiva's part. In fact, considering the enormity of mad's offences, bow insignificant and worthless would any endeavour of his be! So the Lord's grace redeems man from samsāra, for He is bound to protect #bat is His own. Besides, He is so compassionate and bis love to man sa over. powering that, like the cow wbich licks the slime on the body of the new-born calf, He rould consider even the faults, offences, and shortcomings of the self as agreeable (* bhogya). To a lover, the dirt on the person of his beloved is far from being bateful. 

Sri Vedantadesika replies :- "The sõstras lay down rules and regulations for the conduct of man. They teach wbat is dharma and what is adharma and state that offences against the Lord would meet with punishment unless expiated. It is gross exaggeration to say that offences could ever be agreeable to God. 

When a man feels that he is ignorant of what he should do for following the path of bhakti or is unable to adopt it owing to his weakness or inability, he seeks refuge under God, begs for His pardon and protection and surrenders bis self to God to be saved by His mercy. Then God stands in the place of expiations which he is unable to perform and in the place of bhakti as the upāya for his moksha. Here prapatti is not mere passive acquiescence or receptivity but an active mental process of seeking the Lord's refuge and praying to Him for succoar. So prāpatti is a rite or dharma which has to be adopted with the help of an acharya. It is true that God's mercy is boundless (niravadhi), but unless man who is a being endowed with intelligence, does something to deserve the Lord's grace, it will not come down on Him of its own accord So some endeavour or effort, however insignificant it night be, some gesture at least (a vyāja) is required before the Lord would undertake the bhara or responsibility of protecting him. Further if the Lord's grace were to come to man's succoar without any effort on his part, it might be asked whether it would

come to all without exception or only to those whom it chore. In the former case, it would mean that there is salvation for all beings and all at once (sarra mukti). In the latter, the grace of God would seem partial to some and in different to others. So & vyāja or gesture is necessary on mad's part to become worthy of the Lord's grace and this vyāja is the performance of prapatti. 

8. Another point at dispute is the question whether the performance of nitya and naimittika karmas is at all necessary for the prapanna, since prapatti is admitted by all to be capable of yielding moksha without any such aid. Sri Loka. charya states in his Mumukshuppadi * that it is no offence at all for the prapanna to give up the performance of these rites and duties. But, he adds, almost immediately after making this statement, that the prapanna, however, per forms them for fear of public opinion and out of compassion to those who are ignorant, lest they too should give up their perfor mance by following his example and thus bring ruin on themselves 1 (lokasangraha). Since they are performed by the prapanna ont of love for his fellow-boman beings who are not prapannas and without looking upon them as upājas, the Lord would feel delight ed at their performance, which would, therefore, be of the nature of kainkarya or service to the Lord. 

Sri Vedantadesika agrees in thipking that prapatti does not require any complementary or supplementary rites and would yield its fruit irrespective of their performance or pod.perfor. mance. But the performance of nitya and naimittika rites is ordained by God as a command and its transgression would bring the consequent punishment. So these rites have to be performed by the prapaona, not for lokasangraha or as kainkarya, but to avoid punishment due to disobedience of God's injunctions,

4. Sri Lokacharya enjoins great reverence for the prapanna, whatever may be bis caste and considers it one of the greatest of offences to treat him with indifference, disregard, ill-will or com tempt on the ground of his caste. Though he does not state that inter.dining and inter-marrying are proper among prapannas, bis eulogy of the prapanna might lead people to think that these acts were permitted. 

Sri Vedantadesika also speaks in bigb terms of the prapanna's devotion and of bis being fit for moksha, whatever his caste. But he states that the rules concerning inter-dining and inter-marrying are based on the differences of the bodily equipment of the jiva and that these rules should be observed as long as the body laste. There will, of course, be no difference in the attainment of moksha and there will be no such things as caste in Paramapada, but as long as the body lasts, the prapanna, too, however great bis devotion to God and however pure his life, bas to follow the rules and regulations of caste in social life. "The temple cow is certainly more worthy than other cows inasmuch as its milk, butter and the like are used in the service of God, but on that account, it does not cease to be a cow". 

5. In addition to prapatti, the âchāryas of the Southern School consider that the love and goodwill of the * achārya to his disciple who has won them by devout service to bin can, of themselves, secure moksha for the disciple even without any prapatti of his. It is true that Jniiiia is the means to moksha, In this case the acharya's jnāna secures it for his sishya. 

The controversy concerning the performance of nitya and naimittika by the prapanna had its origin in the interpretation of the Charamasloka t of the Bhagavad Gita. There it is said 

Sri Vachanabhushanam: Chaturthaprakaranam : Sutras 461 & 462 Pages 360m-362; Ananda Press, Madras (1908). 

Note "Having given up all rites and dutics, seek me alone as refugo. 

Do not grieve, for I will release thee from all sins. 

Chapt XVIII-Sloka 66. 

XXXVI "Sarva dharman parityajya māmekam saranam vraja" (Having given up all dharmas (rites and duties) seek me as your refuge ) What is the meaning of "Having given up all rites and daties ?" Sri Lokacharya argues, "When it is said snätvā bhunjeetha ("Having bathed, one should eat") it means “first bathe and then eat". So also "having given up" means: "First give up the performance of these rites and then seek we as the only dharma". 

Sri Vedantadesika, on the other band, interprets the words thus : "When it is said, "Having come into this world of suffering, it is your duty to seek some means of deliverance from it," having come does not mean "first come into this world and then seek deliverance". It means "since you have already come into this world of suffering". So also in the Charamasloka, the meaning is, "Since you find yourself unable to perform the rites and duties enjoined in the sästras for the forgiveness of your sids and the attainnent of moksha, seek me as your refuge". The man is not asked to give them up as a condition for seeking God's protection, since he has already given them up oning to inability. Besides the performance of ordained karma is insisted on again and again by the Gitacharya. So it is only in the event of inability that saranāgati is prescribed. 

It is because prapatti is clearly defined in it with its accessories and with its potency in full detail and in accordance with what is laid down in the Pancharätra Āgamas that Rahasyatrayasära has been called Prapatti Sastra, 

Rahasyatrayasūra is thus a handbook of Visishtadvaitic Vaishpavism as uoderstood by the Vadagalai Acharyas. It is in four parts: the first part comprises chapters 1 to 22 and gives a detailed exposition of the doctrines of Sri Ramanuja's system or Visishtadvaitic Vaisboavism, in accordance with the traditions of the Northern School and with detailed instructions about bhakti and prapatti as upayas for the attainment of the supreme goal of mad; the second part (chapters 28 to 26) discusses & number of disputed points concerning bhakti and prapatti and states the

conclusions arrived at by the Northern School. The third part (Chapters 27 to 29) is devoted to an interpretation of the words and the sentences contained in the three great rahassas or mantras wbicb are mysteries into which the disciple is initiated by the acharya. The last three chapters 30 to 32 are on the duties of acharyas and s'ishyas and a peroration. Sri Vedantadesika shows that all the vital tenets of Ramanuja's bystem are contained, as it were, in an epitonie in these mantras or buysteries. Just like the world of matter, the jiva is s'esha to the Lord and exists oply for the fulfilment of His purposes. Since the jiva is besides a chetana endowed with intelligence, bis being sesha means that be is the servant of God. His service in this world extends also to the devotees of God. The ultimate goal of life is moksha wbich has, for its crowning glory, the service of Bhagavan and Hig consort. Man does not exist for bimself and the sooner he gives up thougbts of 'I' and 'wipe', the better will it be for bim. The moolamantra states these truths briefly. The easiest and best way of obtaining God's mercy or grace and moksha wbich results from it is saraņāgati or self-surrender and this is prapatti which is done with the mantra called Duaya. The charamasloka explains how Bhagavan accepts the responsibility of redeeming the jivu when He is propitiated by prapatti and when the jīva is unable to adopt other upayas. 

Sri Vedaptadesika wrote this treatise in Tamil with a free and generous admixture of Sanskrit words and pbrases, which has been called manipravălan, for the benefit of those whose know ledge of Sanskrit is very limited. The booķis, by no means, easy to understand, for the author is not satisfied with giving only a brief and broad outline of Ramanuja's system. He aims at an 

* The Three Mantras (1) Moolamantra or Ashtakshara "Namo Narayanaya with the pranavam or the syllable aum preceding it. (2) Dvaya "Sriman Narayana charanau saranam prapadye, Srimate Narayanaya Namah" and (3) The Charama sloka of the Bhagavad Gita already referred to

XXXviji exposition of it in all its details and with all the references and authorities (pramānas) for what he says, so that it may be a manual of Visishtadvaitic Vaishnavism, complete and compre hepsive. When he quotes pramaņas in support of his statements, interpretations or contentions, Vedantadesika often gives only the first one or two words of the slokas or prose passages and of the Tamil verses of the Alwars, preso ming that these texts inust be familiar to the reader and need not therefore be quoted in full. At the present day, many readers are likely to be ignorant of them and cannot understand the line of reasoning adopted by the author owing to this ignorance. It is therefore, rightly the practice everywhere to study Rahasyatrayasāra under & guru. Besides these passages quoted as pramäņas, tbe explanation of the meao ings of the words and sentences in the three great mantras requires, for & clear understanding, at least an elementary koowledge of Sanskrit grammar. Further the author clinches conclusions arrived at after a discussion in & number of Sanskrit slokas of his own which he does not render into Tamil. The gist of each chapter is also given in Tamil verses and in Sankrit s lokas, both at the beginning and at the end. These, too, add to the difficulty of understanding the text by oneself. 

In this English translation, an attempt is made to minimise these difficulties. The pramūnas referred to only by their first words are translated and given in full. The author's own slokas are also rendered in English. Whenever it is felt necessary, explanatory words, phrases or sentences are added within brackets to make the author's meaning clear. Occasionally longer explana tions are given as footnotes. The author's interpretation of the meaning of the three mantras has been made as lucid as possible, though, as has been already said, a fall and perfect understanding would be possible only to those who have a knowledge of Sanskrit grammar, so far at least as declensions of nouns and pronouns are concerned. It is earnestly hoped that this English translation will be of help to those who have only & mengre knowledge of Sapskrit, when they study the original under their guru. 

INTRODUCTION 

Xxxix 

It now remains for me to conclude this introduction with a grateful acknowledgement of the generous belp wbich I have received in connection with this translation. I should not have taken up the adventure but for the suggestion and kind encourage. ment given by Sri Ubbaya Ve-Agnihotram Ramapuja Thatha. cbariar Swami. His approval of the repdering of some of the earlier chapters was heartening and, after the completion of the work, he took opon bimseli the entire responsibility of getting it printed and published. 

My grateful thanks are due to Sri K S. Patrachariar, m. A., whose eminence as a scholar in Sanskrit and in English bas been the admiration of all his friends and acquaintances. He read through the manuscript of the introduction with great patience and made a puniber of valuable suggestions for its improvement. I should like to express my respectful gratitude also to my guru, Sri Ubhaya Ve-Sinpamu Srinivasa Patrachariar Swami of Kumbs kopaw, under whom I studied Sri Bhashya and Srimad Rahasya. trayasära. He was kind enough to hear me translate the intro. duction orally into Tamil and to correct several errors that bad crept in. 

I consider myself as baving been lucky in having sought the assistance of my esteemed friend, Sri G. K. Rangaswami Ayyangar, M. A., before giving the manuscript to the press. As a devout admirer of Sri Vedantadesika, he gave me upstinted and entbasi. Pastic co-operation in making the translation as free from errors and defects as possible. Having studied the original under the late Chetlar Mahamahopadhyaya Narasin bachariar Swami, he has a good mastery of the subject and by close scrutiny and uneparing criticism, he drew my attention to inaccuracies in the rendering and to the omissions of even single words left untranslated by oversigbt. He assisted me also in the laborious task of reading the proofs. It would be presumptuous op my part to think of thank ing him for all that he has done.

A BRIEF ACCOUNT 

OF 

THE SUCCESSION OF ACHARYAS 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

(With due devotion) we repeat the expression of adoration to our gurus and likewise to their gurus; and among these (latter), We pray for the grace of the Primeval Couple (Narayana and Lakshmi), the twin s'eshis* of all the worlds (so that they may be both the end to be attained by us and the means of attaining it). TAMIL VERSE. 

Having carefully studied the beautiful hymns subg with delight in Tamil by seers, we have come to understand the real meaning of the regions of the Upanishads which are otherwise difficult to comprehend - seers known as Poygai Mudi, Bhutamuni, Peyalvar, Kurugesan (Nammalvar) who was born on the banks of the cool Tamraparni, Vishnuchittan, the pure-minded Kulasekbara, our Pananathan, Thondaradippodi, the splendour that appeared in Mazhigai ( Tirumazhisai alvar) and the prince of Mangai armed with sword and spear for making bright the path of the Vedas throughout the world. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

To those who venture to attain release from the bondage of sam. sāra, the ancient path indicated to as by the spotless Madhurakavi 

* A sesha is one who exists solely for the purposes of another. That other is seshi. 

Note: (1) The commentator says that Vishnuchittan stands for Vishnu chittan and also for his daughter Andal, the authoress of many hymns. by his own example is the only safe 2 path, for while there is Sri Krishna, the great cowherd, who incarnated solely for the sake of bis devotees to confer bliss on them, to be their refuge, to be their final goal, to stand in relation to them as mother, father, brother and so on, to change their desire for the pleasures of this world into a desire for Himself, to remove all their sins, to show them infinite compassion, to reveal the truth, and so also to bring about in them a likeness to Himself - while there is Sri Krishna ever ready to do all this, 3 be sought only the feet of the sage Satagopa (Nammälvār) who rendered in Tamil the truths con tained in the Vedas which are otherwise hard to understand. 

THE ACHARYA ESSENTIAL FOR MOKSHA : 

It is said in the Smritis: "Kshatrabandbu* !, wbo was the worst of singers, and * 2 Pundarika, the virtuous - both of them obtained moksha or release from bondage by virtue of their having ūchüryas." It is thus declared that in the case of every one, the only means of securing moksha is to have an ächārya. To the man desirous of moksha, the line of achäryas is stated in the Sruti 3 to extend upward even to the Supreme Bhagavan for purposes of meditation. 

Note (2) safe path: This means Bhakti and Prapatti which lead to moksha. Acharya bhakti is called bhakti and prapasti as it leads to them. 

Note (3) Madhurakavi in his decade of Tamil verses, says that, to him, Nammalvar is the only God and that through him, he expects to derive all the benefits that men expect to have from God Himself. The path indicated by him is that of devotion to the Acharya for attaining mukti as well as other things. 

* 1 Kshatrabandhu led the life of a highwayman in a forest. He was a source of terror to the sages who lived in that forest. Once when the sage Narada happened to pass by him, he rushed at him with his stick. Narada took pity on him and asked him to find out from his wife and children whether they would share the sin he was committing, as it was done for their sako. They refused and Kshatrabandhu realised his folly and begged to be instructed by Narada in the truths of religion. 

* 2 Pundarika was a virtuous Brahmin, who, though he followed the righteous path and went on a pilgrimage to holy places, did not get a vision of God. It was only after being initiated into the Ashtakshara by Narada that he realised God. 

3 The sruti referred to here means - “This linc of the acharyas extends up to Bhagavan thus: This is his acharya; his acharya is so and so and so on up to the Lord". 

INTRODUCTORY 

BHAGAVĀN THE FIRST ACHARYA: 

The Supreme Lord is the foremost of all acharyas, as may be seen from the following passages - "Him! (Sri Krishna) who is possessed of all excellences, who is the acharya, father and guru", "Narayana? who is the guru of all the world is also my guru", "Thoa? art my kinsman, and Thou art my guru", and "Thou art the guru of all the worlds and likewise their goal". It is He that, at the beginning, vouchsafed the Vedas to Brahma and when they were stolen, brought them back to him and through him spread their knowledge in the world. It is He that blessed Brahma's sons, Sanatkumara and others, to anderstands all truths by themselves and to follow the path of renunciation. Through them He revealed the means of attaining sålvation. It is Bhagavan who, later by the agency of such great seers as Narada, Parasara, Suka and Soubaka, quaintained intact the tradition of the Upanishads. It has been said "know that Vyasa who is other. wise called Krishna Dvaipayana is the Lord Narayana Himself. Who else is there in the world, O Maitreya, that could cow pose the Mahābhārata ?" It has also been said, “Devoutly 7 uttering the Dane of that great sage (Vysa), Bhishma said with folded hands ". Into such great men as Vyasa referred to above the Lord entered and through them published to the world great works like Maha bhārata and Sarīraka Mimūmsa (Brahma Sutras). Further in such incarnations as Hamsa, Matsya, Hayagriva, Nara, Narayana, and the Gītācharya (Sri Krishon), He himself stood out and revealed spiritual traths and also the means of attaining moksha (tatva and hita). He had bis invaluable teaching confirmed also 

i Mahabharata; Sabha Parva : 41-21. Acharya here means one who teaches Brahma Vidya and guru one who teaches the Vedas. This verse was spoken by Sahadeva to those assembled at the Rajasuya sacrifice, .

S Mahabharata: Santi Parva: 349.71. 6 Vishnu Purana : 3:45. 7 Mahabharata: Adi Parva: 11441. through the words of such men of wisdom as Bhishma. It has been said "Narayana Himself dictated the whole of the Pancharātra", When this Sastra which was originally taught by Him became lost, once again at the end of the Dvapara Yuga and the beginning of the Kali Yuga, Heo revealed it again through Sankarshana in accordance with the ordinances of the Satvatas so that all castes, Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras, might, after initiation by the acharya with the prescribed marks (Sankha and Chakra), worship and render service to the lord in the performance of their daily duties with their minds set on the Eternal. As is said in the following verse, “In the yoga of Kalino, the Lord Achyuta enters into the respective persons of men already born and carries out His designs", Narayana Assumed a new series of ten incarna. tions in the forms of Parankusa (Nammalvar), Parakala (Tirumangai) and others. In these ten avatars, just as clouds take in the water of the ocean and then pour it down in the form of rain 80 essential to the life of every one, the Lord gathered together those parts of the Vedas which are most significant and revealed them briefly in a language (Tamil) wbicb is accessible to every one. 

When this path of spiritual life was threatened with obstruction by heretics, open and covert, He incarnated again in the land of Agastya in the forms of many teachers of the true doctrine. Has it not been said, “The god," Narayana, Himself, assumes a mortal form out of compassion and lifts up the world submerged (in the darkness of ignorance) with the sastras as His hand ", and so also, "Our la Lord dressed in bis yellow raiment came as the guru out of compassion to impart the teaching of the Veda". In reference to this, the Maharshi, Suka, says, “In thel2 yuga of Kali, devotees of Narayana endowed with spiritual greatness, will

THE SUCCESSION OF VAISHNAVITE ACHARYAS. 

Among these acharyas. Nathamuni was the son of Iswara. muni, and he gave us "Nyaya Tatvan" and " Yoga Rahasyam." Since Nathanuani received the sacred tradition from one of the spiritual descendants of Madharakavi, and was blessed with spiritual wisdom from a study of Tiruvoymozhi and since, in bis yogic contemplation, Nammalvar appeared to him and taught him the sacred lore, his acharya was Nammalvar himself (though they lived at different times). Nathamuni's son. Was Iswara Bhatta. To Iswara Bhatta was born Alavandar (Yamunacharya). The works of Alavandar are the following eight :-" Āgama Prīmātiyan", " Purusha Niriiaya", the three Siddhis, name ly, “ Ātma Siddhi", "Iswara Siddhi", "Samvit Siddhi", "Sri Gitārtha Sangraha", "Stotram" and "The Tetrad of Slokas," Sottai Nambi was the son of Alavandar. Sottai Nambi's son was Engachchan. Ennachchan had four sons, one of whom was Pillayappar. Pillayappar's son was Thozhappar, Thozhappar had two daughters. The chief disciples who sought the feet of Nathamuni were eight :- Uyyakkoodar, Kurukaikavalappen, Nambi Karunakara Dasar, Erutiruvudaiyar, Thirukkanpamangai Andan, Vanamadevi Andan, Uruppattur Achan Pillai and Sokattur Alvan. Uyyakopdar had five disciples; they are Manakkal Nambi, Tiruvallikkeni Pan Perumal Araiyar, Settalur Sendalangarar, Sri Pundarika Dasar and Ulagapperumal Nangai. The chief disciples of Manakkal Nambi were five; they are Alavander, Deivattukkarasu Nambi, Gomatam Tirovidnagar * Appan, Siruppulloor Avudaiya Pillai and Accbi. Alavandar had fifteen disciples: they are - Peria Nambi, Tirukkottiyar Nambi, Tirumalai Andan, Alavandar Alvar, Tirumualai Nambi, Isandaa Deivavari Andaa, Siriyandan, Tirumohoor Appan, Tirumohoor Ninrar, Deivapperumal, Tirumapgai Aliyar, Pillai Tirumalirus 

6 jolai Dasar, Maraner Nambi and Alkondi. Six disciples sought the feet of Perianambi; they were :-- Emperumadar (Sri Rama. aaja), Malaikuniya Ninrar, Arya Sri Satagopa Dasar, Aniaran. gattamudanar, Tiruvoykulamudaiyan Pattar and Tirukkacchi Nambi. Sri Ramanuja learnt the meanings of the rahasyas or mantras at the feet of Tirukkottiyar Nambi. He studied Tiru. voymozhi at the feet of Tirumalai Andan. He learnt Tiruvoymoghi at the feet of Alavandar Alvar and learnt also“ Stotram" and the ancient tradition from him. At the feet of Tirumalai Nambi he studied the Rāmāyana. Sri Ramanuja's writings are nine in number: Sri Bhashyam, Deepam, Säram, Vedartha Sangrahan, Sri Gita Bhashyam, Siriya Gadyam (Sriranga Gadyam), Periya Gadyam (Saranāgati Gadyam), Vaikunta Gadyam and Nityam. The names of the chief disciples of Ramanuja may be learnt from the respective tradition of each reader, 

BHAKTI TO ACHARYA ESSENTIAL: 

It has been said, "The wise man should bring his guru to the light (of renown) and should guard the sacred mantra with great care; from the omission to bring his guru to light and by revealing the mantra, he declines in wealth (of knowledge) and in age (spiritual standing)." His bringing the guru to light and his omission to do so, it needs no saying, are due to the excess or deficiency of his devotion to his guru. 

From * Kata Sruti and 1 Jābala Sruti it is well-known that that all desired knowledge arises from supreme devotion to the guru resenabling that to Bhagavad. This is learnt also from the incident of Sanjaya seeing all things as if they occurred before 

| Seshasambita: 14-50 *NOTE: Kata Sruti: This wisdom concerning the soul cannot be obtained 

by the mere exercise of reason. Only when it is imparted by another (the guru), does it lead to the knowledge wbich is the means of attaining moksha. 

Katopanishad 1.1.9 Jabala says in the Srul: "It is only the Vidya or wisdom learnt from an acharya that gives proficiency * Chandogya Upanishad: JY -3 

INTRODUCTORY 

him, as the result of his supreme devotion to his guru Vyasa. From the episodes of Railwa (and others) it is evident that the guru who does not reveal spiritual traths immediately even to those sishyas who are of excellent character will not be adversely affec ted in his spiritual life. If, on the other hand, the guru reveals these spiritual truths to any and every disciple in the belief that the sishya who has sought him must be good, he will be adversely affected; for, in such cases, it is said that the sins of the disciple become also the side of the guru. This may be seen from the story of Brahma. Without careful enquiry into his fitnese) he revealed truths to Indra. As a consequence Brabma forgot his divine knowledge and had to be taught again by Bhagavan through the agency of Narada, Brahma's very disciple. In the sloka referred to above, the meaning that, by not bringing the guru to light and by improper bringing of the mantra to light, the man suffers decline respectively in wealth and in age is primarily in. tended owing to appropriateness and the support of Jabala and Kata Srutis. There is nothing wrong in interpreting the sloka as meaning also "He who omits to bring his guru to light and brings the mantra to light will suffer decline both in wealth (the wealth of spiritual knowledge ) and in age (spiritual standing)." It follows from this that a man should bring his guru to light by way of the overflow of his sapreme devotion to him under all conditions and that the sacred mantra should not, for the sake of any mate rial advantage, be revealed to the fickle-minded who do not possess all the qualities prescribed for a disciple. If the mantra is revealed to undeserving persons, its great value wbich is like that of & casket made of rubies containing & precious jewel will suffer and the guru's spiritual greatness will also be adversely affected. The word guru refers, by implication, to the earlier gurus also in the line of ascent extending up to Bhagavan. Or it may mean gurus in general. Similarly the word mantra refers also to the meanings of the mantra and other secret doctrines connected with it. As & rule or vidhi, it bas been laid down that, whenever a map medi tates on these secret meanings or mysteries, he should also medi tate on the lineal succession of gurus. It bas also been said: “As en 13expiation for having conversed with those that are forbidden as unfit (for conversation), we should meditate on the virtuous." By the words " the virtuous ", this sloka refers primarily to the. āchāryas. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

"Having sought the protection of my guru who has graciously taught me that Bhagavan is the Inner Self within me and having also bowed with devotion to the line of his gurus, I seek the refuge of the feet of the Lord, after bowing at the feet of that generous soul who appeared in Sri Perumbudur owing to his compassion ( for his fellow-men), (his guru) Peria Nambi, Alavandar (the guru of Peria Nambi, Manakkal Nambi, Uyyakkondar wbo taught the good path (of prapatti) to Manakkal Nambi, Nathamuni (the guru of Uyyakkondar), Satagopan (Nammalvar) (the guru of Nathamani) and Senainathan (the guru of Nammalvar) and then, of the gracious Lakshmi, sweet to the Lord as ambrosia. 

SANSKRIT VERSE: 

May these great spiritual teachers, Nathamuni and others, fill my heart here and now with delight, so that I may not be subject to the impact of the arrows of Manmatha (i. e. to the pleasures of the senses )--teachers who bring us blissful truths of varied kinds from Vedanta, who convey to us (like Bhagiratha) the celestial river of the compassion of the divine couple to be sought in full faith and who are foreigo to the paths of envy, error and decep tion! 

SANSKRIT VERSE: 

The blissful line of our gurus who are possessed of many auspicious qualities, who have brought down the arrogance of rival controversialists by the successive neighs issuing from Hayagriva who delights in sitting on the throne of their hearts, and whose triumphant banner fixed at the top of the mansion of the four

TAMIL VERSE: 

We that cling to the poble qualities and sweet words of the benevolent sage, Ramanuja, who adorns the world with his renown and who, like an elephant, knocking down plantain trees, refuted. the arguments of those that, with the help of their unrestrained logic, wrought great havoc in the straight paths of the * Brahma Sutrās - We (that cling to his words ) and are thereby blessed with spiritual fervour shall no longer (even) think of deeds that are evil. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

We, who were caught up in the stream of samsāra from time immemorial, and have, now, by a change of fortune, come to acquire a knowledge of our true spiritual nature, consider that Sri Yamunacharya (Alavandar) came into this world to protect Os from being sunk again in the mire of samsära and we will ever be attached to the feet of the sage (Alavandar) who triumphed over his opponents and blessed us with his writings. Never more shall we read the works of heretics. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

We shall come to new life again by bowing every day at the feet of the noble and generous Nathamuni, who to his (two) Sloving disciples who were like a trumpet and a conch (to proclaim the truth and to cow down the exponents of rival systems) taught the art of music so that they might sing the sweet strains of the Tamil

Lucky indeed are we in having an opportunity, in this world and every day, of meditating on the three mysteries (mantras) with great delight -- secrets which were taught to us with great earnestness for the removal of our dease ignorance by great souls endowed with compassion who sought the feet of the Spouse of the lotus-born Lakshmi as their sole refuge and gave me also those feet for our protection.

with His glance at a turn in the tide of fortune, he attains to a knowledge of his real nature ( 48 one entirely dependent on God and existing only for Him ). This becomes possible by virtue of the teaching imparted to him by his gurus and thas he succeeds in saving himself. 

THE HERITAGE OF THE JĪVĀTMĀ. 

How the Jivātmā lost this heritage. The individual soul (Jivatma) has been declared in the diffe rent sāstras as being dear to the Lord of Lakshmi even like the gem Kaustubha; be has been called the prince, the Lord's son, His disciple, His attendant, His dependant existing solely for Him *(sesha ) and His servant. The Lord is his s'eshi for whose pur poses (alone) he esists by bis very nature. T'he Lord is the ruler of the eternal Suris, who are ever free from ignorance. He is possessed of unsurpassed auspicious qualities; He loves us as He does the lotus-born Lakshmi. He is the Lord of men on earth and of the Suris in Heaven. As has been said “ The Lord of the Universe dwells in the Supreme Region of Vaikunta along with Lakshmi," " +Thou art ever with Lakshmi adorned with shiping bracelets". He dwells in the pure world of suddhasatva ( nitya vibhiti) along with His great queen and is seated on a couch, as described in such places as the Koushitaki Brāhmana, in a hall of splendour which is lit up with gems and stands on & thousand pillars, in the eternal and changeless city called by names like Ayodbya; for instance, it is said, "It is called Ayodhya and Aparajita and is beyond the world of svarga." The Lord is seated on the bed of the serpent called Sesha who is like an umbrella to the Lord when He moves about and like a throne whenever be is seated. He has been described "&g the Lord's abode, His bed, 

*NOTE:- A Sutra or aphorism in Purya Mimamsa says: “ That is called a 

sesha which serves the purpose of another (and that other is called a sesht) (e. g.) In a sacrifice, the grains of rice are sesha to the sacrifice which is seshi because they serve the purpose of the sacri

and His seat." Sesha, the serpent, is ever bent on serving the Lord in all places, at all times, and in all situations and enjoys rendering service of all kinds in varied embodied forms. As he is thus fulfilling the purposes of the Lord and has no other aims in life, he is, indeed, a real and unconditional Sesha and the name Sesha fits him in every way. The Lord shines on the bed of Sesha as the Supreme and ever-youthful Sovereign of Heaven. It is His gracious desire that all souls should enjoy His blissful state and attain their goal. The Jiva is thus entitled, by his. essential nature, to the service of His Master as his birthright in as high a degree as the eternal Sūris themselves who have the endless bliss of serving Him. But sunk in the sleep of beginningless Maya, he has fallen into the wilderness of matter (prakriti), has had repeated births in quick succession, has lost the primary aim of existence, has found no comfort or consolation, has lost the splendour of big real nature owing to evil desires and passions and is without a true knowledge concerning tatva (that which should be known for salvation and hita the means of attaining it). Well has it been said, "$ Trudging along the many thousand pathways of samsāra consisting of cycles of births and deaths, he bas become deluded and exhausted and is covered with the dust of tendencies left by impressions in the mind." 

The parable of the prince brought up by huntsmen. 

The condition of the Jiva in sainsära has been aptly des cribed in the following parable :- A certain king went out & hunting with the women of the harem and was keenly absorbed in the sport. The little prince lost his way even before he knew who be was and was brought up in a hamlet by tribesmen who found him wandering about (helpless). As he grew older, be identified himself with the people who brought him up and thought that he, too, was a savage tribesman, learnt their language as if it were his own and, like their own sops, ate their food and lived their life. Without knowing anything about the enjoyments, the 

Vishnu Purana: 6-7.10 

14 OH APTER 

code of conduct and the traditions of his birth, he found his good and his evil, his joys and sorrows, in extremely gruesome things totally different from enjoyments befitting & prince. Though there were some wise and sage-like men who knew him as a prince, he was not accessible to them and lived like a savage without even the means of being born in a better life after death, owing to life-long savagery due to erroneous notions. The story is told of two parrots born of the same parents. One of them was brought up by holy men and the other by tanners who ate cow's flesh. The former said, "I was brought up by sages and he was brought up by tanners. I hear, every day, the speech of the sages and he bears the speech of tanners. You have yourself seen the difference between iny speech and the speech of the other bird. Goodness and wickedness are the result of (good and bad) associ. ation (respectively)". 

Such was the condition of the prince who lost his real charac ter and acquired a different nature. Similar is the state of the Jiva who, by identifying himself with the body, loses his real character and degumes & different nature. In the case of the prince (of the parable) some generous benefactors who were aware of his real birth (in a royal family) made ap their minds to save bim (from savagery) by some means or other. They removed from bis mind bis false identification of bimself with the tribesmen and by discipline and training, physical and spiritual, enabled him to become gradually fit for princely enjoyments and the means of attaining them. They made him realise, both by precept and by example, what befitted him as a prince in matters connected with character and conduct and thus rendered him cap able of bating the mean and gruesome enjoyments of savage life and created in him the power of discrimination by which he could choose and prefer the supremely refined aims and enjoyments of bis princely station. 

Vishnupurana : 2-13-98 

INTRODUCTORY 

15 

The applicability of the parable to the Jīva, In the same way, some generous benefactors who are intro duced to the Jiva by parents and the like belp him realise that "the soul is neither God nor man nor beast nor tree, and that these diffe rences of body and shape are due to karma." They opable him to understand that the soul is different from the body and adopt the proper means to make him pursue the goal or sim suited to bis essential nature and to follow the path that would lead to it. They create in him qualities and modes of conduct found in men endowed with the splendour of wisdom and not in men who are so absorbed in their bodies as to forget their soul and they bring bim to a position in wbich he is capable of distinguishing between wbat should be rejected and wbat is worthy of adoption, Now in the parable, on seeing for themselves the prince's innate fitness, the transformation wrought in him by some worthy men and his intelligence, some teachers being directed by the Supreme Master who is all compassion and being themselves bigbly compassionate appear before him and reveal bis true parentage to him as also what is higbly desirable to one in bis station and the means of attaining it. It has been said, "God's love, good deeds done by chance, the gracious glance of God, freedom from hate, willingness to learn and the conversation of good men - these are six causes that lead to the acquisition of an acharya." Those good men in the parable would strive in every possible way to bring about & longing for re-union in the mind of) the prince and the king. So also with the Jiva. His gurus reveal to the Jīva the intimate relation existing between him and Narayana, the Lord of Lakshmi, who rules with Bis sceptre the earth surrounded by the turbulent ocean and the world of Vaikunta without even the least exception. Do not the sāstras say, "The soul is neither God nor men, neither beast nor tree. Its essential nature is knowledge and bliss and it is entirely dependent on the Supreme Being and exists solely for His parposes (Sesha)" and again, "The souls are indeed the servants by nature of the Supreme + Being ?" These gurus

try earnestly to help the Jiva attain the Lord and feel that his attainment of the glory of moksha would give them as much delight as the sovereignty of Vaikunta (Nitya vibhuti) and of the wbole earth (līlā vibhūti). They have as much love to him as the cow to its calf on the day of its birth when, out of loving kindness, it gives it milk. So with the help of words, neither excessive por defective, they desire to remove his ignorance, his doubts, and his erroneous notions. As stated in the sloka. "He s who teaches the trath concerning cit (sentient being) ucit (non-sentient matter) and Iswara and their essential character etc.", they (the gurus ) teach him the true nature of the Lord who is the rnler of sentient and non-sentient things that are ruled by Him, of their respective character and of their matual relations to one another, of enjoy ment or experience in samsāra (including svarga) and of release from that bondage and of the respective means for attaining them (one to be rejected and the other to be adopted), of the routes by wbich the soul travels to its destined abodes and of the obstacles, expressed and unexpressed, that stand in the way of salvation; for these are ipatters that should be known to every one desirous of release. 

All these things that should be known to every mumukshu are found concisely stated in the three mysteries or secrets' (mantras) which are, as it were, the quintessence of all passages treating of the Jive and Iswara and which contain the best part of all the main doctrines.

for us, certain great souls proficient in the knowledge of the five things that ought to be understood and likewise of the subtle doctor rine that the relation of the Jivatma to the Lord is that of the body to the soul, came to us out of compassion to save as from being lost (in that stream). 

(NOTE:- Konstubha: This gem is stated in certain treatises to stand allegorically for the Jiva. ] 

SANSKRIT VERSE: 

In the cycle of karma, avidya and others which succeed one apother, as in the revolution of a wheel, in the varied streams of Sausāra peculiar to each individual and beginning from time im. memorial, all systems of religious thought declare that, when the proper time comes, there is varied fruition resulting from past karina. At the time of this fruition, the Lord, who is the first Acharya, finds bis opportunity, catches the Jiva and bestows His grace on him. Sach Jivas are indeed rare and they become the l'epositories of all forms of wealth (like discrimination and free. dom from desires) extending up to the sovereignty enjoyed by the freed souls in inoksha (vizı, the enjoyment of Bhagavan and service to Him). 

[NOTE:-- and others : The word others refers to vasanas or impressions left in the mind in previous births, ruchi or tastes and aptitudes and prakriti Bambandha or association with matter.) 

(2) THE CHAPTER ON THE DETERMINATION 

OF WHAT IS BEST ? 

NOTE "The Three Mysterics" have been occasionally referred to in previous chapters. Sri Vedantadesika presumes that everyone of his readers knows what they are. It is just possible that some of them are not in the know of these mysteries. So a brief account may be necessary of these mantras. 

1. One of them is called Ashtakshara or Tirumantra. It consists of eight syllables in Sanskrit which are in the form of three words. The first word which consists of a single syllable is Om, which is made of three parts a, u and mor akara, ukara and makara. The second word is namo which, when there i s no sandhi, is namas. It means 'Obeisance' or adoration! The third word is Narayana which means " to Narayanaya". Narayanaya is the dative (the fourth case ) singular form of Narayana. The mantra, as a whole, means "Adoration to Narayana ! " or "I offer my adoration to Narayana." (This is the meaning appearing at first sight.) 

2. Another mantra or mystery is the “last" sloka of Sri Krishna's teach ing in Bhagavad Gita usually called the charama sloka. 

It means: “Having given up rites or activities as means to secure moksha, surrender thyself to me alone". (This is the first half of the sloka.) 

(This is the second half 

"I will free thee from all sins; despair not." of the sloka.) 

3. Yet another mystery or mantra is usually called Drayam. It consists of two parts; the first part means "I seek refuge at the feet of Narayana who is cver inseparable from Sri or Lakshmi". The second part means: "I offer my adoration to Narayana and Sri". 

These, then, are the "three mysteries or mantras" which are the best of what should be known and meditated upon. The fuller and more subtle meanings of these mantras are explained in latter chapters. )--Tr. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

What is opposed to the way of the Vedas is like poison; even in the Srutīs or Vedas, those parts which treat of the means of attaining the enjoyment of material goods (Prakriti bhoga) and 

WHAT IS BEST 

19 

of the enjoyment of one's own atma or self (purusha-bhoga) or (Kaivalya) are not salutary. Therefore the wise who are afraid of tbe cycle of births and deaths ( samsāra) seek the best essence extracted out of the ocean of nectar called the Upanishads wbich has been guarded with great care by sages (i.e.) previous acharyas for our benefit 

THE GREAT VALUE OF THE THREE MANTRAS: 

Among these three mysteries (mantras), Tirumantra or Ashtaksharu bas' been stated to contain everything within itself and, if it is known, the meaning of everything becomes known; the charama sloka, which says (in its first half) “having given up all rites and activities as means of attaining moksha, surrender thyself to me", establishes that the adoption of the single means taught in it, vis, self-surrender (or s'aranagati) would secure the benefits of all other means prescribed elsewhere; the Dvayam, aus has been stated in Katu sruti and elsewhere, is capable of making & man perfect in the discharge of all his duties even if it is uttered only once. Therefore these three mysteries alone are of value to the seeker after salvation. It has been said, “One should ignore what is of no value, what is only of slight value, and, likewise, what is valuable and even what is more valaable. It is only what is most valuable that one should prefer in the sastra, like ambrosia in the Ocean, 

THE ONLY PRAMANA IN REGARD TO) MOKSHA AND 

THE MEANS OF ATTAINING IT IS SASTRA: 

The ultimate goal or aim of life (purushärtha ) (namely, moksha) and the means of attainiog it are not capable of being understood from sense perception (pratyaksha) or (anumāna) inference. As stated in such passages as "It is from the 

1. Naradiya Kalpa 19. - ORAPTER 

2 Sastra that I know Janardana ", "Therefore 3 ia determining what*ought to be done and what ought not be done, the only autho. rity tbat should guide you is Sastra" and "Be who is well "versed in the Agamas or Vedas will attain Brahman", the only pramāna that exists for our guidance is sabda or what is revealed in the Sastras. In this context it has been said, “What ares to be known are many and endless; the time (at our disposal) is short; the bindrances are many; therefore prefer only what is valuable, like the swan that separates the milk from the water with which it is mixed." The word 'valuable' really means ' most valuable', because it refers to what is always and unconditionally valuable. The Sastras of those who are outside the pale of the Vedas (like Buddhists ) and likewise of heretics (like Advaitins) are not valu. able at all and are therefore to be ignored. In the first part of the Veda, the portion which treats of rites leading to the attainment of worldly goods is only of very slight value and hence not to be resorted to. That part which treats of the attainment of the good things of svarga after death, though it may appear valuable to somé as leading to fruits higher than worldly goods is of no use, as, in the final estimate, they are based on sorrow and have other objectionable features. That part, too, which treats of the realis& tion of one's own soul and the means thereof, though a little more valuable, is not of value to those who desire the enjoyment of the Supreme Self. To the man of discerning wisdom, the part of the Ved& which treats of the Supreme Brahman, the attainment of Brahman and the weaps thereof is the most valuable, and is there. fore to be preferred.

THE THREE MYSTERIES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT. 

Even there, the three Mysteries (mantras) which are, as it were, an epitome of the truths that ought to be known and of the means of attaining salvation, which are the distinctive, unique and exclasive doctrines (of our Visishtadvita system) are invaluable and therefore to be most preferred. As stated in the siloka " From the many and great sāstras, the wise man should choose only that which is most valuable as the bee takes in the honey from the flowers," the jiva who thirsts for moksha should prefer as invaluable these three mysteries (mantrās.) 

TAMIL VERSE: 

As if what has been already learnt is not enough, the eighteen subjects of study may confront us like burdens (on the intellect); but they add only to the number (and are of no use). Therefore the Acharyas of our system (Visiştādvaitam) have, with wise discrimination, given us what the Nitya-sūris whose wisdom never langnishes (literally who never wink") speak of in exalted terms. nainely, the 'eight' (Ashtakshara) and the two' (viz) the Dva. yam and the charama sloka, SANSKRIT VERSE: 

The basic mantra (moolanantra) called Ashtakshara shines conspicuously in the Upanishads (literally, the end of the various branches of the Veda). If there is any one endowed with discriminating wisdom who has understood from that inantra the truth about hia essential nature, and if he spends all his time in uttering the Dvayani wbich, even at a single atterance, can produce the fruition of the desire for the ultimate goal of life and if he has also absolute faith in the means of salvation taught with compassion in the charama sloka by Sri Krishna who, for his sport or Ia, became the charioteer, and, who is the crest jewel, as it were, of the Vedas - if there is any such person (at all) in the world, he will be the leader of all our hosts.

TO VISISTADVAITA. 

SANSKRIT VERSE: 

When Bhagavin is seen in the mirror of the 'Vyapaka mantras, which disclose His all-pervasiveness, one will see that the universe (which we perceive with our senses) is abaolutely dependent on Him for its existence and continuance and likewise for its activity and the fruit or result arising from it; since the universe is supported and controlled by Him and is also solely for the fulfilment of His purposes, one will understand that it is the body of the Primeval Creator. By realis ing this relationship of the universe being the body of the Creator, one is enabled to reach the heart of the Srutis, which were not composed by any one and which have the deepest significance. 

WHAT IS MEANT BY PRATITANTRA? THE MEANING 

OF SARĪRA - SARIRI BHĀVA: 

The word Pratitantra means a doctrine or feature which is peculiar and distinctive to a certain (pbilosophical or religious) system exclusive of all others. Here it may be asked what the doctrine that is most important and unique to our system of Vedanta is. It is the doctrine which maintains that the relation ship between Iswara and the world of sentient beings and non sentient things is that between the soul and the body. (Another is the doctrine that every word, whatever its ordinary depotation may be, such as 'cow' "man" and the like, refers ultimately to Iswara who is within them as their innermost soul). 

NOTE:-- *Vyapaka mantras: These are (1) Ashtakshara (2) Shadakshara, the mantra with six letters (Namo Vishnave with Pranava at the beginning) and (3) Dvadasakshara, the Mantra with twelve letters (Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya with pranava at the boginning) 

THE DISTINCTIVE DOCTRINE 

-

WHAT IS A SARĪRA AND WHAT IS A SARIRI : 

Iswara is called the inner self or soul (Sariri), because as long as they exist, He is, in regard to sentient and non-deatient substances (dravya), their sopport (adhara), their controller or ruler (niyanta) and their Lord or Master (Seshi) for whose purposes they exist. Sentient beings and non-sentient things form His body, since, with regard to Him, they stand as substances supported by Him, controlled by Him, and existing solely for the fulfilment of His purposes, throughout their existence. Iswara is called the Supporter and the Controller oz Ruler of all sentient beings and non-sentient things, because from His swarupa or essential nature and His sankalpa or will, they derive their existence, continuance and activities as * befitting each of these two (svarüpa and sankalpa). It may be asked how this could be. Just as Iswara is the abodo, asraya or üdhāra (support) of the attributes which define His essential nature (svarüpa viz. Satyam, Jnanan, Anandam and the like) and of the other qualities possessed by Him with His essential nature so defined (qualities like compassion and &ccessibility), He is also the inseparable and direct support, (äsraya or ādhara) of all substances (sentient and non-sentient) other than Himself. He is also the support, through these substances ((1.0.) indirectly), of the qualities that pertain to them. There are some who hold that Iswara is the support, through the jivas, of the bodies supported by the jīvas. Some Acharyas say (on the other hand) that both directly by His essential Dature and indirectly through the jīvas, He is the support of these bodies. 

ISWARA'S SUPPORT BY HIS SVARŪPA AND 

BY HIS WILL. 

In relation to Iswara,. all (substances ), sentient and non. gentient, are attributes that are inseparable from Him (Aprithak 

NOTE * 

As befitting each of these two - By His syarupa, He is the cause of their existence and continuance. this is being their support; by His Sankalpa or will also, He is the cause of their oxistence, continuance and activities, this is being their controllar. 

24 CHAPTER 

siddha viseshanas). Therefore their existence and the like depend entirely on the existence of their support (i. e.) Ioware. The exis. tenee of all things is also dependent on His will. Those of them that have only & temporary existence take their origin from a temporary will or sankalpa of His and those of them that are eternal (like Vaikunta and the sūris ) exist for ever by His eternal will. This distinction has been stated by one who is worthy of respect for his learning in the (following) sloka :-"The 'existence of all things is only by Thy will. Of these some are eternally dear to Thee and are bence eternal and even these eternal beings or things are entirely dependent on Thee for their essential nature." 

Since the continuance of a thing is merely the continuity of its existence, everything, (i. e.) existence and continuance, is dependent on His will. There are heavy substances that are stated in the s'ästras to be supported by Iswara's will. For instance, the following sloka says: "The Heavens,2 the sky with the moon, the sun and the stars, the different quarters, the earth, the great ocean - all these are supported by the might of the Supreme Being, Vasudeva.” It is stated here that, in regard to keeping these heavy things in their respective places without their falling away from them, the existence, continuance and activity of these things depend on Iswara's will. The word 'supported' (in the sloka) means is dependent on His will'. If it be asked how, when every substance is supported by His will, the essential Datare (svarupa) of Iswara can bave anything to do with them, the answer is that the will of the Supreme Being ordains that these objects should be supported by His essential Dature ( svarüpa ). Thas all tbings are dependent on Iswara's essential nature and also on Iswara's will. In the world (of daily life) also, we find that the body is supported by the essential nature (svarapa) of the soul or self and also by the will of the self. Since the body exists from

THE DISTINCTIVE DOCTRINE 

26 

the time of the entry of the soul into it and perishes or disintegrates when the soul leaves it, it is known to be supported by the svarupa or essential nature of the soul. In the state of dreamless sleep (sushupti) and the like, when the will of the self is dormant, the body continues to exist without any deterioration; so its existence then is clearly dependent on the svarupa of the self and not its will (or sankalpa). In the waking state, when the body is kept from falling, it is sustained by the will or sankalpa of the soul. When the existence of the body is dependent only on the svarūpa of the self or its essential pature, it is said to be supported (adheyatva) by the latter; and when the existence depends on the will or sankalpa it is said to be controlled and directed by the latter (niyāmyatva). 

WHAT IS THE MEANING OF SESHA-SESHI BHAVA? 

Iswara is said to be the s'eshin of all things, because they exist solely for the fulfilment of His purposes. They are His s'eshas, The following sloka explains how Iswara is is the seshin of all: * The Sutterance of the Upanishads is to the effect that the Lord takes in both sentient and non-sentient things for the fulfilment of His own purposes, by being the cause of their existence, their continuance and their control. In regard to one of the two (i.e.) the sentient being), Thou art both the end to be attained (upēya) and the means of attaining it (upāya). This is Thy essential nature and not an adventitious quality of Shine. Therefore, O Thou that hast Thy repose in Srirangam, I seek refuge in Thee without any selfish interest." 

THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE. 

Sentient beings and non-sentient things exist not for their own sake but for the fulfilment of God's purposes. Their nature is ever to exist for somebody else (i.e.) the Lord. In using them for His own purposes, His glory is manifested. This is being 

3. Srirangarajastavam: 

(Uttara Satakam) 87. 

26 CHAPTER 

.. 

Seshi. "But" it may be asked, "what does this sentient being gain by being supported and controlled by Him and by existing solely for his master ?" The answer is as follows: By having the Lord as his adhāra, the Jiva becomes an inseparable attribute of the Lord even like His own attributes, Jnana and sakti or power. By being the Lord's sesha and by havicg the Lord as his seshi, the jiva acquires a taste for an ultimate goal or end which is appropriate to his essential nature, for every being aims at & goal or end suited to the conception held by it about its nature. By being the sesha of the Lord and by having Him as his controller and ruler, he comes to know the specific means or upāya (viz Bhagavan) of attaining the goal or ultimate aim suited to his essential nature. This upāya or means (is the Lord Himself who is the only proper means for the attainment of this end and who) does not require any auxiliary aid for helping Him. From what has been said above, it follows that this sentient being has no other support, exists for no body else, and has no other protector than Bhagavan. 

THE PRESENCE OF THESE IDEAS IN THE THREE 

MYSTERIES OR MANTRAS. 

If it be asked how this idea is contained in the first mystery (i.e.) ashtakshara, the answer is as follows:- The word . Nara. yana' is a compound word which means either "Ho to whom Nārāh are a resting place (ayana )", in which case it is a posges. sive adjective compound (bahuvrihi samāsa), or " the resting place of nārāh (i.e.) mon", in which case, it is & determinative compound in which the first part Nārāh is in the genitive case (i.e.) nārānām f ayanam ( which is qualified by the genitive.) The compound word Narayana interpreted in these two ways establi shes His being the support (of everything) and of His pervading it. From this it would follow that the jiva, in his essential nature, has no other support and is pervaded by no other than Narayana The words Om and Namo which precede Narayanāya imply that the jiva exists for Narayana and is entirely dependent upon Him 

THE DISTINCTIVE DOOTRINE 

27 

for protection. It would follow therofrom that the jiva serves no other purpose than that of Narayana and that he has no other refuge or protector-than He. 

In Duayam which is, as it wore, & gem of a mantra and which discloses the activity or process of self surrender (prapatti) to the Lord, the first part reveals that the jiva has no other refuge than Narayana and the second that he exists for no purposes other than those of Narayana, while, in both parts, the idea of the jiva having no other support (adhara) is evident (from the word Narayana ). 

Similarly these ideas may be discerned in the charama sloka also, either directly and explicitly in the words themselves or by implication or parport arising indirectly from the meaning of the words. 

The charama sloka declares that Bhagavan is Himself the already existing and established means (siddha upaya) for attaining Him, for He is ever ready to help us to attain Him, and that, in order to secure His help, we have yet to accomplish or adopt a means (sädhya upaya), which is self-surrender (s'aranägati) to the lord. This sädhyopāya, namely, self surrender or saražāgati is performed by uttering the dvayam and the thoughts that we should bear in mind at that time are concisely disclosed in the Tirumantra or Ashtākshara as in a little mirror reflecting bigger forms. 

The (two) meanings of the first word OM (aum) are illustrated in Arjupa's chariot and in the (famous) sloka of the Rāmāyana which says:- Rama went first. Sita walked in the middle, and Lakshmana, bow in band, walked behind, following them. The word OM is constituted of three parts a, u, aod m; a, which is seen first, means Bhagavan, the Protector or Saviour, who is seen first in Arjuna's chariot, and m means the jiva, Arjuna, the object of protection who is seen afterwards; u moans, only; it may also 

4. Ramayana; Aranya kanda. OH APTER 

mean lakshmi. When u refers to Sri or Laksbmi, the two seshis, Bhagavan and Sri appear first and the s'esha appears after wards. In the sloka quoted from the Rāmāyana, first we think of the Saviour, then we think of Lakshmi and then of Lakshmane who is their s'esha. So also is pranava or aum; a, u and in refer respectively to the Saviour, Lakshmi who pleads for the jiva and then the jiva who requires their protection. The second word in Tirumantra, viz, namo or namah means "adoration" or "I adore", This brings out explicitly, by the word itself, the idea of the jīva being entirely dependent on the Lord. Since Bhagavan is pleased with those who serve His devotees (Bhagavatās), it is implicitly stated in the word namas that we depend also on Bhagavatas and are subject to their direction and control. Illustrations of these may be found respectively in the lives of the devotees, Bharata and Satrughna (the former of whom delighted in obeying and serv ing Rama and the latter in obeying and serving Bharata). 

The third word in Tirumantra is Nārāyanāya, wbich is the dative or fourth case of Narayana. (The word Narayan, has two meanings: (1) the resting place or refuge of naras or living beings) and (2) He wbo bas naras (living beings) as His abode or resting place. This means that the jīva depends for his very existence on Narayana and that Narayana's glory (vibhūti) cannot manifest itself without the jiva. It has therefore been well said: "I do not exist without thee, O Nārāyana, nor dost Thou without me". Nārāyanñya, which means for Narayana' should be copstrued along with some such word as syam or bhaveyam and the meaning would then be, “ May I exist for Narayana"! These meanings of the word Narayana may be seen illustrated in all created beings of Kosala (who could not bear their existence without Sri Rana and who departed this world along with Him, and in Sri Rama, too, who departed with them. 

The first word, Pranava (aum), signifies that m, the jiva, exists only for a (aya) and the second word namo that the jiva depends on Bhagavān. His existence is for Bhagavad and His 

5. Nanmukan Tiruvandadi : 7 

THE DISTINCTIVE DOCTRINE 

29 

devotees, to the latter of whom the s'eshatva extends as its ultimate limit, and he depends absolutely on Bhagavan and His devotees In the light of this interpretation, the third word Närāvanāya has, for its purport, the goal of the jiva, vis, kainkarya or service to the Lord and His devotees. This service may be seen illustrated in an active form in that of Lakshmand and in a passive form in the sandals * of Sri Rama which were an incarnation of Lakshmana or Adisesha and which left Rama's feet to go along with His devotee, Bharata. (In these instances) the service is such as would be pleasing to the s'eshi (namely, Bhagavan). 

All this elucidation and illastration of the meaning of Tirumantra were vouchsafed by Sri Appullar. The implicit and explicit meanings contained in Duayan and the Charama sloka should be understood on the same lines. 

IN REGARD TO BEINGS ENDOWED WITH INTELLI 

GENCE, SESHATVA MEANS DĀSATVA: 

In these mysteries Iswara is disclosed as the s'eshi (i.e.) as one for whom everything else exists. He stands in the relation of s'eshi to both sentient beings and non-sentient things in common, In relation to non-sentient things He is Seshi, because they exist for His purposes. In relation to sentient beings or jivas endowed with intelligence, He is s'eshī in the special sense of being Swami (i.e.) Master whom it is their duty to serve, and this is the manner in which we should anderstand while uttering the manträs. Our being sesha to the Lord we share in common with non-sentient things but we are s'eshas in the special sense also of being His servants (dāsāh). 

The ordinary relationship of Sesha and Seshin between the jīva and Bhagavan is disclosed in the first syllable of the Ashtak. shara, vis, aum where the a, the first member, is in the dative 

NOTE: Lakshmana is a partial incarnation of Adisesha and Adisesha serves the Lord as His sandals. His bed, and so on. Therefore the sandals' of Rama am, in a sense, the incarnation of Lakshmana. . 

30 CHAPTER 

case aya, though the termination has dropped. It means for a or Bhagavan'. The specifio form of being seshas which applies only to jivas (and not to non-sentient things ) and which is really being the servants of the Lord ( dāsas) and of His being the Swami or Master is revealed in the parport or implication. So also in the word 'Narayanaya' there is the general relationship of the seshin towards all things and the specific relationship of Swami or Master which obtains in the case of jivās. Here the goal of use. fulness to the Lord, which is the result of the general attitude of the s'esha, becomes the goal of service or kainkarya to the Lord, owing to the jiva being His servant or dāsa. Thus by being the s'eshin, Iswara attains a unique glory and as a consequence of His being the Swami or Master, this glory consists in the enjoyment of service which is His purushärthu. Iswara is responsible for the protection of His servants and has also the power to do so, whereas the jīva or Chetana is not responsible for his own protection por has be the ability to protect himself. This is due to Iswara being the unconditional (nirupadhika) s'eshi and the unconditional Director and Ruler. Owing to their being the unconditional sreshas and their being subject unconditionally to His control, it becomes, indeed, the responsibility of the owner to protect what belongs to Him and of the strong to protect the weak. Iswara, however, makes op Eis mind to protect the jiva only after making him adopt some means or upaya for winning His protection, (because the jiva is subject, according to the Sastra to the law of Karma). 

TAMIL VERSE: 

The Lord gave us our existence and is our support (dhāraka) as well; He is also the unconditional Ruler that directs and controls us. There is nothing that does not exist for the fulfilment of his purposes; He is also our Master for whom all things exist; He stands alone with no one to compare with Him. It is the earnest conviction of those who understand the spirit of the Vedas that we are the bodies and the unconditional (or nataral) servants of the

If, in the Kali yoga, there is any one supremely wise who can understand this unique and distinctive doctrine of the relationship between Iswars and the world being that between the soul and the body, which was taught by that sovereign sannyäsin (Sri Ramanuja) and which is like the dawn that dispels the darkness of ignorance , then in that place where he is, the tumultuous waves of logical disputation arising from the eagerness to establish the truths of other systems will subside at once.4.

In the '&' in Om and in the word 'Narayana' occurring in Ashtakshara, the supreme end of life (i.e.) Bhagavan, who is opposed to all that is objectionable or faulty, is indicated; in the in in om and in the part nära occurring in Nārāyaṇāya, the essential natare (svarūpa) of the jiva who is to attain this end is dis

He who understands the Ashtākshara mantra that reveals all these five and *Dvayam too, wbich is to the same effect--he will be consi dered by all as one who knows everything. 

THERE IS NO REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE WHO SPEAK OF FIVE THINGS AND THOSE 

WHO SPEAK OF SIX. 

In the words Nārāyana and in on, the relationship between Iswara and the jiva is revealed as that between the soul and the body. Having taken this relationship as the foundation or basis of the Visishtadvaita system, some investigated the five truths that should be known to every one who desires moksha. Others took this relationship also as one of the things to be koown and hence spoke of the six things to be known. If it be asked what the five

ITS SVARĪPA: 

Among these, the essential nature of Brabman, which is the object of attainment, is revealed in the first letter a in om and in the word 'Narayana' in Tirumantra and in the words Nārāyana with the adjectives 'Srünün' occurring in Duayam and in the words 'me' and 'I' occurring in the Charama sloka. It is in this way that they should be considered. Wbile doing so, one should thiok of His essential nature (svarīpa) as infinite jräna and infinite bliss ever inseparable from His consort, Lakshmi, who, in every form and in all situations, participates in all His actions. For there are many authoritative passages in support of this prescribed contemplation - 

“The Lord of the Universe is over with Lakshmi in Vai. kunta, the world beyond” (Here the reference is to the Supreme Lord (Para) in Vaikunta.) 

“This 3Narayana is always with Sri -- Narayana whose abode is the ocean of milk. He has now come to the city of Madhura leaving His bed (Adisesha)" (The reference is here to the Vyüha) “Thou art the God Narayana, the spouse of Sri and hast the Chakra is Thy weapon and Thou art omnipresent". (The refe rence is to the Vibhava or avatāra.)

Details concerning them may be learnt from the Pancharatra sastra and from tradition. Bhagavan should also be considered as having endless glories or possessions (Vibhiti). For there are passages like the following which describe His vibhutis

“The sanda of the Universe and whatever else is found within that anda are His vibhutis." 

These vibhūtis (possessions or glories) of God are of two kinds, sentient and non-sentient, and these again are of two kinds, some existing for His Lila or sport and others for His enjoyment (bhoga). This division into things for play (lila) and things for enjoyment (bhoga) is based on the difference in the rasa or delectation, though all of them have agreeableness (or änukiilgan) in common. Bhagavan should be considered as being engaged in the work of the Universe merely for His play or sport (lila), for it has been said as follows: 

" From

* All this is Hari's play (or sport)."

* SUMMARY. 

Thus Brahman, the object of attainment, is ever with Lakshmi : He is infinite jnana and infinite bliss, and is opposed to all that is imperfect and objectionable. He is possessed of countless auspicious qualities like wisdom and power. He has a celestial and transcendent form of auspicious nature. He has two vibhūtis (rula and nitya ) which are His body; He has, for His play or sport (lila), the work of creating the world, of maintaining and controlling it and the like. 

THE NATURE OF THE INDIVIDUAL SELF: 

Now for the individual self (Pratyak ātmā) which is to attain Brahman : 

We should know that the in.lividual self is in three categories : Baddha or those who are in the bondage of sansürer, Mukta, or those who have attained release froin sainsära and Nitya or those who are eternally free fron bondage. The seeker after salvation should also know the peculiar features which distinguish him as a seeker of the means of mukti, from other baddhas. 

The baddhas (or the bound) are those caught up in the cycle of births and deaths owing to the stream of beginningless karma, They range from Brahma to the blade of grass and are called kshetrajnāh. (Brabma, gods, men, beasts, trees, grass and so on ). 

The muktās (or released souls) are those who, by adopting the means (upāya ) prescribed in the s'ästrüs, have obtained the Lord's grace, permanently transcended the cycle of births and deaths, and have obtained unsurpassed bliss as a result of the uprestricted enjoyment of Bhagavan. 

The nityās (the eternally free) are those whose knowledge has never undergone contraction and who are, in this respect, like 

NOTE: This sumunarises Prapya (i.c.) the object of attainment, wiz. Brahman.42 CHAPTER 

Iswara Himself. "They " are.", it has been said, " of the same age as the Lord, eternal and free fronı all trace of imperfections," 

They have never been in samsāra and are engaged in eternal service to the Lord o.g. Adapta (i.e.) Adisesba, Garnda and Vish. vaksena. 

The characteristic attributes common to all the three of them are being atomic (in size) (anu) and being of the nature of knowledge (jnana), bliss (ānanda), purity (amalatvam) and the like. They are all seshas to Bhagavan and are entirely subject to His will. One should also understand what is distinctive and peculiar to one as a mumukshu or seeker after salvation. This has been (already) mentioned in the Introductory Chapter and will be described later on also. 

The essential nature of the jiva who seeks attainment should be thought of, while considering the letter in in om and in namas or namo in Tirumantra, and in the part nära of the word Närāyana, wherever it occurrs in the Ashtakshara and the Dvayam, in the first person singular form " I seek refuge" prapadye in Duayain, in the second person singular of the word " thyself" in "surrender thyself" (vraja) and in the word thec (tva) and in the sentence " despair not" in the charamasloka. 

THE MEANS OF ATTAINMENT. 

We will describe at length the means of attainment (upāya) and its auxiliaries and also the nature of the fruit to be attained in their proper context later. 

Among these two, the upaya or means of attainment is to be considered as indicated in Tirumantra in the word namas or namo and in the part ayana (resting place). in Nārāyanāya ; n Duayam in the first part and in the Charama siloka in the first half. 

71. Sri-gujaratna-kosa : 27 

THE FIVE TBINGS TO BE KNOWN 

THE GOAL OF ATTAINMENT. 

The Dature of the fruit to be attained or enjoyed is mentioned in the dative or fourth care (i.e) in Nārāyaṇāya in the Tiru mantra, in the word namah in the Dvaya, and in the charama 

siloka in the words "I will free thee from all sins." 

THE HINDRANCE TO ATTAINMENT, 

The bindrances to the attainment are the multitude of obstacles that stand in the way of our attaining moksha, such as ignorance (avidyā), karma and väsana or impression left in the mind by karma in previous births, 

The foremost of these bindrances is the punishment ipflicted by Bhagavan for disobedience of His orders contionally from time immemorial. This chastisement causes association with prakriti or matter with its three qualities (satva, rajas and tamas) and thereby contraction of knowledge. It brings about a connec tion between the soul on the one hand, and the body, the senses and the like which are specific modifications of matter (or prakriti) on the other. Further it makes the jīva subject to the sway of the body and the senses. To quote the words of the Alwar, “With the 'strong ropes of my sins, Thou hast bound me tightly with the body, covered the sores within the body (like flesh, fat and blood) with the skin and let me walk away from Thee." "With the body given by Thee at the time of creation, I have been wandering about to the satisfaction of the body." This chastisement often consists in placing the jiva in the body of animals which can have no knowledge of the Sāstras and cannot act in accordance with them. Even in births like those of men, it copfounds the mind with the views of infidels and heretics and, even in the case of those who escape this, causes, through the concealing agency of the peacock feather of primal matter (moola-prakriti) and its modifications, the bodies and the senses, (1) ignorance 

72. Tiruvoymozhi. 5-1-5. 

73. Tiruvoymozhi. 3-2-1 CHAPTER 

of the truth and (2) erraneous knowledge and so also (3) sub. jection to sepse-pleasures. As Sri Ramanuja says, "This ** (association with matter) causes obscuration of a knowledge of the essential nature of Bhagavan and also false knowledge. Besides it makes the jiva think that tbis association is delightful." As & consequence of this, it induces the jiva to disobey His orders and do forbidden things for the sake of petty pleasures. To quote again the words of the Alwar: "Is it right on Thy part to confound my soul and excite my five senses by showing me, who am & sinner, all sorts of petty pleasures?" One act of disobedience leads to further acts of sin. Well bas it been said, "Sin "committed again and again destroys wisdom and the man withoot wisdom begins further acts of a sinful nature." In consequence the Lord makes the jiva wander again and again through the cycle of life in the womb, birth, old age, death, and bell, as stated by Himself, "I throw them always into asuric births" By means of the scriptures of those who are actuated by rajas and tamas, which show the way to secure petty pleasures, the jiva is made to fall at the feet of petty deities who are themselves souls ( kshetrajna) fettered with similar cbains. “Those who are actuated by rajas" it has been declared, “worship gakshas and Rakshasas ; and those who are actuated by tamas worship the spirits of the dead and elemental spirits ( Bhūtagana)". The jiva is deloded into considering bimself as greatly benefited by the mean and gruesome enjoyments afforded by these deities in the same way as worms find a pleasure in dirt and filth. 

Even those who practise yoga are made to practise it in con. Dection with petty deities or in the meditations of such inanimate

things as *nāma being Brahman and are made to fall therefrom in the acquisition of minor results. Even those who are devoted to the soul or ātmā are made to meditate on their ātmā either in contact with matter or as separated from matter either as if it were Brahman or as the atma in its own essential datore. As the regolt of these four kinds of meditation, the jiva obtains petty enjoyments after which he falls back into samsāra. Even in the case of those who practise trae meditation on Brabman, and who meditate prima. rily on their own selves as having Brahman for their inner self or who think primarily of Brabman who has for His body their own selves - even they may be detained by the state of kaivalya or the enjoyment of their own selves, by the attainment of the It eight kiods of siddhi, by the attainment of the status of the vasus, or by the entrance into the body of Brahma and the like. Their (temporary) lapse from the highest aim or goal of life (namely, the enjoyment of the bliss of Brahman) is like that of & prince, whose coronation day has been already fixed, casting eyes on the servant maids who attended on hini while in prison. They are made to linger fondly over the body and the senses wbich are tbe result of past karma and those that are related to the body (like relatives) and the enjoyments connected with them. In this way they become subject to other pleasures than the final goal. Thus there are many forms of hindrance in the way of the attainment of Bhagavan. When a well thirty-two steps wide has to be leaped over, it makes no difference whether the man falls at the very first step or at the thirty-second step. In the same way wherever or at whatever stage the bindrance occurs, the jiva has not transcended samsūra, 

* NOTE:- In the Chandogya upanishad VII chapter, it is stated as follows:- *He who worships nama or names like rig veda, sama veda, Itihasa and purana as if they were Brabman will realise only very limited fruits such as can be reached with these namos". 

** NOTE: The eight kinds of siddhi: Anima (contraction of one's body to the size of an atom, mahima (assuming a huge form) Laghima (makiog one's body light) Garima (making the body heavy), vasitvam (mastery over self), aisvar yam (lordship) prapti the power of obtaining whatever one wants and prakamyam (perfect froedom of the will.) 

46 CHAPTER 

It is true the Gītā says that for those who practise skarnia. yoga, the effort will never porish or be in vain. What has been built up will, of course, remain built up, as it were, of stone, But we cannot say when the fruit will be attained, whether at the end of a kalpa or of a manvantaru or of a yuga. Even sages like Vasiabta, who ever acted in such a manner as to please God, had to wait long. Those who acted against the will of God like Vritra and Kshatrabandhu attained moksha without any such delay. So it is difficult to say which individuals have done meritorious deeds that would lead to moksha without delay. Similarly it is difficult to state who have done bad deeds leading to divine chastisement causing delay. 

SARAŅĀGATI THE ONLY MEANS OF GETTING RID OF 

THESE HINDRANCES: 

How can this chief hindrance which is of the nature of divine panishment resulting from disobedience of the Lord's commands and which is the root cause of this chain of suffering-how can this be removed? The author of Sri Bhashya (Sri Ramanaja) has declared that the only remedy for this bindrance is to obtain the favour of the Lord and that this can be done only by Saraṇāgati or self-surrender to the &Lord. This declaration is made by him, while commenting on the order in which the senses, the mind and the like have to be controlled as stated in Kata upanishad. 

All these bindrances to moksha are to be understood in whatever is contrary to what is ordained in the three mysteries (mantras) (e. g. the feeling that the jiva is independent and acts for bis own purposes which is opposed to the truths shown in the Ashtakshara), in the egoism, or sense of 'my' or 'mine' in the genitive mama in nanah (na + mama) and also in the words all thy sing' in the charama sloka. These have to be thought of, 80 that ope inay feel the suffering which lies in walking on the bot

sands of samsāra and desire to hasten towards the path leading to bliss. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Those who know these five have declared them in order that I may not despair in mind and in order that the darkness of igno rance may not confound me- the five namely - the Lord of the lotus-born Lakshmi, who stands as the one thing to be attained, the jiva who loves the lord and craves for His grace by seeking His feet, the means (or upüya) to be adopted by the jiva for the attainment, and the fruit resulting therefrom, as also the strong fetters of sin due to delusion or ignorance (which are bindrances). 

SANSKRIT VERSE: 

That which is to be attained is the Supreme Brahman who is the s'eshi of all; I am also a fit person to attain Him; the attain. ment should come to me as inheritance due naturally to me as to 

the Suris; alas, by ny egoism and the ignorance arising from it, I have lost it, but I have been taught that, by surrendering myself to the divine couple who are my s'eshis, I can now attain it. 

(5) THE CHAPTER ON THE THREE 'REALS' 

(OR TATVAS) 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The delusion that the soul is nothing but the body and the senses (prakriti) disappears when one has a knowledge of the distinctive features of sentient beings and non-sentient things. So also the disputes on such questions as the unity of the jiva and God will no longer continue, when the characteristic features of each of them are marked out. Our acharyas, whose wisdom never failed, teach us about the existence of three realities (Tatvas) classified in the s'ästrās as the experiencing subjects (bhoktū), the objects of experience and enjoyment (bhogyam) and He who rules over both of them (Iswara). 

CLASSIFICATION OF TATVAS OR REALS AND ITS USE: 

It may be asked why the achiiryas should state that the three tatvās or 'reals' should be specially prescribed for the study of those who seek moksha, when they form only & part of the six things that should be knowm, namely, the five truths arthapanchaka and the relationship of soul and body (which exists between God and the world). The answer is as follows: It is necessary to root out the delusion that the body is the atmü and that the jiva is independeant (of the Lord), as well as the view that there is no God, which is the cause of that delusion, for these are great obstacles to inoksha. 

The sāstrās, therefore, divide Reality into three classes ; the experiencing subject, the object of experience or enjoyment, and the Ruler who controls and directs them. Among them, non-beptient things which are the objects of experience are of three kinds (1) Prakriti or matter which has the three qualities of sutvam, rajas and tamas (2) Kala or time and (3) Suddha Satvam, the substance of which the transcendental region beyond matter called Vaikunta is made. The nature of (1) Prakriti 

THE THREE REALS

. 

has been thusk toscribed :-"It is 'pon-sentient (achetana). It exists (always) for others and it is eternal, but subject always to change or modification. It has three qualities satvam, rajas and tamas and is the field of action (karma) for the jiva". The nature of (2) Kūla or time is described thus :- " Bhagavan *Kala (i.e.) Time, which is the body of Bhagavan, has no beginn. ing nor end." "It takes the forms of such divisions es kala and muhoortha which are respectively 13 minutes and 1/30th part of a day (and is the cause of the modifications of matter). But it causes no change or modification in the transcendental world (Apräkritaloka) beyond matter". The nature of the transcenden. tal world beyond matter is such that it is made of s'uddha satvam. The world made of it is of the nature of jnäna and bliss. God controls time there ; time is not the cause of any change or modification in the world of suddha-satvam (as it is in the world of matter). Thus the nature of Prakriti, Kāla and suddha satva which belong to three classes of non-sentient things (achetana), has been described. 

NOW FOR THE EXPERIENCING SUBJECT OR JIVA: 

"The jivātmiñ is neither & god nor a man"; "He is ?Deither a god nor & man”. (That is: These distinctions are based only on the respective bodies, whereas the soul within has no such distinctions.) The jīva is of three kiods :- Baddha or the soul in bondage is called in the Gitü " Kshara" (because he is in contact with matter which is subject to change) All beings (from Brahma to the blade of grass) are 'Ksharas' or Baddhas. The mukta or the soul wbich has obtained release from contact with matter is no longer subject to change and is called akshara or Kootastha (because it is imputable). The third class

The third class of "Real' is Iswara who has been thus described :- He is all ;10 He knows all; He sees all; He possesses all strength, all knowledge, all power, all wealth : He is without fatigue, without lassitude, without fear, without anger, without desire and other such (blemishes). Thus has the nature of Iswara been taught, 

Thus the three realities consist of the Ruler and the Ruled (the latter including prakriti and the sentient beings) and our Acharyas (Sri Yamunacharya and Sri Ramanujacharya) have stated this concisely in the words "(Iswara)" on whom depend the essential nature (svarūpa), the continuance (sthiti) and the actively (pravritti) of the three kinds of sentient beings and of non-sentient things with all their differences". The three kinds of sentient beings are those that are in bondage (baddha), those that have obtained release (mukta) kod those that are eternally free (nitya). The three kinds of non-sentient things are Prakriti with its three qualities (satvam, rajas and tamas). Time, and Suddhasatvam. The essential nature (svarīpa) means the substance or thing which is defined by attributes peculiar and unique to it. Continuance (sthiti, means continuance of the thing or object in time. This is eternal for eternal things. In the case of non-eternal things, this continuance is subject to expansion and contraction in accordance with the will of Iswara. Activity or pravritti includes action and abstention from action. All these three : the essential nature (svarupa), the continuance in time (sthithi) and the activity (pravritti) are seen (by perception and other praniņas) to be ditferent in the case of each tbing or object,

THE THREE REALS 

. 

51 

When the pramānas or sources of knowledge (like peroeption and inference) reveal an object or thing, they disclose the essential Dature or svarüpa of the object, the attributes that define it, the (other) qualities of the object so defined and also its activities. The essential oature is always revealed as endowed with the attributes that define it. It is aot possible to speak of the essential nature of a thing (svarīpa) except in terms of the respective attributes. To speak of an object minus its attributes woald be as meaningless as to speak of a bare's horns. 

THE NATURE OF THE JIVA. 

Therefore the essential nature (svarūpa) of the jīva way be described as jnāna (knowledge), bliss (ānanda), (amala) being pare, and being atomic (anu) in terms of its defining attributes (i. e.) being of the nature of knowledge, being of the nature of bliss, being pure and being atomic. This reality, viz. the jiva is always sesha to Iswara (i.e.) it exists only for Iswara and it is un. conditional sesha only to Him. Thus its existing (always) for the Lord is affirmed (ayogavyavaccheda) and also its existing for no other than the Lord (anya yogavyavaccheda). This quality of being s'esha to the Lord, which is disclosed in the first word of Tirumantra, Damely on (aun), is of the nature of & rela tionship ( sambandha) and requires, therefore, a thing having that relationship and cannot be understood without it. So this s'eshatva may be called an additional quality of a thing, namely, the jīva, which has already been defined by its defining attributes. Here the definition of the jīva is that it is a thing which is sentient while being also atomic. Similarly the jiva may also be defined as a thing which is sentient while being also, by its nature, s'esha. So this quality of being sesha may also be called an attribute which defines the thing, vix, the jīva. Similarly Iswara may be defined as having sentience along with omnipresence (vibhu). He may also be defined as one that is absolutely independent of everything else, while being the unconditional seshin (i a.) one for whom all other things exist (unconditionally). The class of ñtmas which includes CHAPTER 

jivas and Iswara may be defined as those that are sentient and pratyak (i.e.) which are subjective and have inwardness. To be sentient is to be the possessor of koon ledge. To be subjective or inward (or pratyak) is to possens luminosity to oneelf. The atmä or soul is self-luminous and shines as I' without the help of the attributive knowledge *(dharmabhiita jnana). Since sentience and inwardness (pratyaktva) are common to both jīvas and Iswara, the jiva has to be defined as having, in addition, dependance by its very nature (on Iswara). In the Ashtakshara, in the dative of the first syllable (āya) a in aun (om), the jiva's existence for the fulfilment of Iswara's purposes is stated without any condition; therefore the jiva is unconditionally and absolutely dependent upon the Lord of Sri (Lakshmi), who is the universal Savionr. This state ment of the absolute relationship between the jivu and Iswara throughout the existence (of the former ) is called a yogavyavac cheda or denial of the non-existence of the relationship. The second syllable u ip aum (0m) in Ashtūkshara means 'only' and brings out the idea that tbe jīva exists for the purposes of only Iswara and denies bis dependence or existence for the sake of any others. This denial is called anya-yogavyavaccheda or denial of (the jiva's ) relationsbip with others. We will show later that this seshatva extends from the Lord to His devotees as well. The activity of sentient beings consists in their being the doers and the enjoyers subject to Iswara's will and purpose. Since this activity and this capacity for enjoyment are given to them by Him, they are for His purposes and not their own. 

BADDHAS : 

The difference between sentient beings that are in bondage and others consists in the former having avidyā (ignorance), karma, the impressions left by past karma (täsana) the inclina. tions due to them (ruchi or taste for worldly enjoyment) and 

*NOTE:- The soul is of the nature of Inana or knowledge (i.c.) its 

svarupa is knowledge. At the same time the soul has knowledge as an attribute and this fnana or knowledge is called Dharma bhuta jnana or attributive knowledge. 

THE THREE REALS

association with prakriti or matter. The differences existing mutually among jīvas in respect of knowledge, pleasures and the like may be seen in the groups of jivas ranging from Brahma to a blade of grass. 

These bound souls sapport bodies given to them by Iswara in accordance with their respective karma, both by their essential nature (svarupa) as jnāna and by their attributive knowledge (dharına bhūta jnana). The support given to the body by the essential nature (svarūpa) serves to make it exist. The support given to it by the attributive knowledge or dharmabhūtājnāna, while in such states as waking, serves to enable the body to be useful for securing the ends or goal of life and for adopting the means to secare these ends. In the case of the supreme devotee who has already adopted the means of attaining mukti, the support given by attributive knowledge makes the body aseful for the enjoyment of Bhagavan and for rendering service to Him. In the case of singers, this support given to the body is productive of adverse experiences. When the jīva leaves the body, the latter undergoes disintegration, The constituent substances of the body into wbich it disintegrates (such as the five elements) remain the body of Iswara. As regards continuance in time (sthiti), the specific character of souls in bondage, as distinguished from others, is continuous association with the body until mukti. As regards activities, these fivas in bondage have three kinds: punya, püpa and that which is neither of these two. 

MUKTAS: 

The difference between released souls and others is that the former have attained their essential nature in a manifest condition by the removal of obstacles. As regards their continuance in time (sthiti), their distinctive feature consists in this their essential Dature (svarūpa), which has become manifest, will continue to be 80 without any end. Among souls that have attained mukti or release, the mutual difference is their having attained the manifes tation of their essential nature earlier or later. The difference in 

54 CHAPTER 

their activities consists in specific kinds of service to the Lord chosen by each and prompted by love, which has resulted from the perfect enjoyment of Bhagavan gained after the loss of it from time immemorial. 

NITYAS: 

The specific and distinctive feature of the nityas (the eter. nally free) is that the manifestation of their essential nature (svarūpa) is without any beginning and also their absolute depen. dence (on the Lord): The specific feature of their continued existence in time is that their enjoyment of the *Seshi is begin. ningless. Since this is common to all nityas, there is no mutual difference between tbeir respective states of continuous existence in time. The difference in their activities consists in the continu. ous performance of specific kinds of service to the Lord from beginningless time which, though different, yet form a continuous stream of service. It has been said that such nityas is Ananta (Sesha ) add Garuda hold certain specific offices and perform specific kinds of service in due relation to them. If so, it may be asked, how it would be possible to reconcile this with the statement (made by Sri Ramanuja in the gadya) that nityas (the eternally free) and muktas (who have attained moksha) have all access to all kinds of service. The answer is that they are not barred from any form of service which is pleasing to them and is in accordance with the will of the Lord and that no one of them ever desires to render the forius of service which have been specially marked off for others. Besides the service rendered by any one of them is as pleasing to the Lord as that doue by others; therefore the service rendered by any one of them gives the same pleasure of service to all of them. There is no difference in the delight which results from the service as its fruit. Hence there is nothing unreasonable io stating that all of them have access to every form of service.

THE THREE REALS

DHARMABHUTAJNANA" 

(Attributive knowledge). 

To all these ātmās or souls, in the same way as their essential nature (svarūpa) is that of a substance, their attributive knowledge (dharmabhūtājnana) is also a substance. Its essential nature bas not been separately referred to in the passage because of its having been included as an attribute to the soul. 

(Note: Passage : the passage which refers to the three kinds of achetana in quotation 11 on p. 50). 

This attributive knowledge is luminous by itself to the soul which possesses it, while revealing objects. That is, when the attributive knowledge reveals, for example, a pot to the soul which possesses that attributive kaowledge, it reveals its own existence as well). To Iswara and the nityas (the eternally free), this attributive knowledge ia eternally all-pervasive. For others in the state of sansära or bondage, it is subject to varying degrees of contraction and expansion owing to karma. In the state of mukti, it is all. pervasive for all released souls, owing to perfect expansion and remains so throughout. The functions (pravritti) of attributive knowledge are as follows :- It discloses objects (external or in. terpal); while willing or making an effort, it directs the body (and tbe senses etc.); in the state of bondage, it undergoes contraction and expansion; it undergoes experiences (bhoga) which reveal objects as agreeable or disagreeable. Experience or Bhoga is the process of feeling a thing as agreeable or disagreeable. All objects, which are among the glories of Iswara, are, by their very nature, Agreeable and are enjoyed as being Agreeable by Iswara, the nityas and the souls that have attained moksha. To those in samsāra, however, these objects appear at different timus, and in 

• According to Visistadvaitinms, the self or atma is, in its essential naturo 

or svarupa, knowledge. It also possesses jnana or knowledge as its dharma or attribute." This knowledge is called dharmabhutanana or attributive knowledte 

(See p. 52 foot-noto) 

56 CHAPTER 

different places and in relation to different jivas as slightly agree. able, or disagreeable, or indifferent, but these variations do not belong to them by nature. Their slight agreeableness, disagree. ableness, or being neither of the two is the fruit of the past actions of the jivas awarded to them by Iswara, whose will is irresistible. The jīvas that are in bondage are subject to the experience of the fruits of their karma, both by nature and by auxiliary causes. By nature they are subject to it, because they are sentient beings entirely under the control of another (Iswara). The auxiliary causes are their having cowmitted offences against the Lord. In the case of muktas and nityas, although, by their nature as being subject to the control of Iswara, the experience of the fruit of action might be possible, set since they never perform any action displeasing to Him, there are no auxiliary causes for such experiences. Iswara, by His essential nature, is not sub ject to such experience or enjoyinent of the fruits of action, since He stands as the Ruler over all and with no one else to command Him. Nor are there any auxiliary causes in His case, as there is no one whose commands He may be said to bave disobeyed. 

The essential nature (svarīpa) of all ātmās, jīvās as well as Iswara, is being self.luminous to oneself. This luminosity of the self to itself suffers, even in the case of those in bondage, no contraction or expansion at any time. The attributive knowledge (dharmabhūtajnana) of all ātmās is laminious to its supporting self, while disclosing objects (like pots). A common characteristic of svarūpa jnana or the self and attributive knowledge or dharniabhūtajrāna is their both being of the nature of knowledge and being self-luminous (i.e.) being luminous without requiring anything else to light them up. Attriba tive knowledge has the additional characteristic of revealing or dis closing objects (vishayitva). The additional characteristic possessed by svarüpajnāna (or the self) is subjectiveness or inwardness (pratyaktva). Jnana or knowledge, (which is the character of both of them), may be defined as that which makes & thing laminous; that is, it makes either itself or something else fit for being spoken 

THE THREE REALS 

about and acted upon (vyavahāra). Self-luminosity is the capability of being luminous without the need of any other known ledge to illumine it. Attributive knowledge has visha yitva, because it discloses objects other than itself (like pots, cloths etc.) The subjectiveness or inwardness of souls or ätmās (pratyaktva) consists in their being luminous to themselves ; that is, the benefit of their luminosity is enjoyed by themselves The atma or self is the recipient of the benefit of every object being disclosed or revealed. Pratyaktva is only a special instance of this general, statement, for in it, the self receives the benefit of its own dism closure or revelation. A thing which does not possess this pratyaktva or subjectiveness does not also possess the common benefit of objects being disclosed. It cannot, therefore, be called sentient. Though subjective knowledge or the 'I' and attributive kaowledge, which is its attribute, are both luminous by themselves, yet they are also capable of being apprebended by other forms of knowledge (like that from sõstras), as being endowed with attri butes like being eternal. When one's attributive knowledge happens to be known or apprebended by one with the help of another piece of knowledge, the latter is called another piece of knowledge, merely because of the direction to wbich the attributive knowledge is turned. When we perceive an object, say a pot, dharmabhūtajnana contacts the object and reveals it to the soul or self; but when the dharnabhiitaj nāna itself becomes the object of knowledge, it is revealed to the self by a part of it. 

THE THREE KINDS OF NON-SENTIENT BEINGS : 

The three classes of non-sentient things are capable of being apprehended only by others, and not by themselves). Non sentience means being without the possession of knowledge. To be capable of being apprehended only by others means that their apprehension is not to themselves or for their own benefit. These two (viz. being without the possession of knowledge and the apprehension not being for their own benefit) are true also of attributive knowledge (dharmabhitajnana), which is thas a non sentient thing. CHAPTER 

Of the three classes of non-sentient things, mattor (Prakriti) and time (Kala) ere jada (i.e.) not luminous by themselves. There are some who hold that suddha-satvam is also jada. To be jada is to be without self-laminosity. Those who have studied such treatises as Pancharātra or the Lord's Sāstra would say that suddhasatvam is luminous by itself, as it is declared to be so in that sästra. It may be asked wby, if it is luminous by itself, it is not directly perceived by beings in the state of samsāra, with out having to be known through sästra only. The answer is as follows T'he soul whose essential nature (svarūpa) is knowledge and its attributive knowledge are both laminous by themselves and yet the former is luminous to itself and not to other souls, who have to know it with the help of their own attributive knowledge. Attributive knowledge, though luminous to its substrate, namely the soul, is not luminous to others. In the same way, the suddha. satvam inay be luminous by itself oply to Iswara, the muktus and the nityas and not to others. There is nothing unreasonable in this view. 

It has been said in the following sloka : 

“We 'bow to Hari and proceed to expound the s'astra called Nyäya-Tatva :- to Hari who sees, directly by perception and of His own accord, all things simultaneously." It may be asked how, to Iswara who sees all things with His attributive knowledge, suddha-satvam could be * luminous by itself, when it is illumina ted by the attributive knowledge of Iswara. The answer is as follows - Iswara's attributive knowledge apprebends all things includiog His own divine svartipa and yet do we not hold that His divine form is luminous by itself? So also it is possible that suddhasatuam is self-luminous, tbough it is apprehended also by the attributive knowledge of Iswara. This is true also of nityas. When lighting up an object (like a pot), attributive knowledge, it 

*NOTE:- A pot is not luminous, hecause it bocomes visible or is seen only when lighted up by the flame of a lamp. The flame of a lamp is luminous, because it does not require anything else to become visible. 

12. Nyaya-tatvam: Mangala słoka. 

THE THREE REALS 

bas already been said, is luminous by itself only to its sub-strate, Oamely, the self or soul. In tbe same way suddhi-satvan may be luminous by itself to those that have attained release in their new state. There is nothing inconceivable in this. The luminosity of attributive knowledge is obstructed at the time when it is not light ing up external objects (like pots ), by past karmu of certain kiads. So also the luminosity of suddhasatva. may meet with obstruction in the state of bondage and may not, therefore, be apprehended by those in sansära. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA, 

The luminosity of (attributive) knowledge is natural to it (svibhavika), after release from samsūru, but is obstructed some. times during bondage. So also in this case, (there may be obst ruction during samsära and luminousness after release)". 

Substances which are subject to inodification (vikūrī) are some times agreeable and sometimes disagreeable to the same individual and to different individuals. (Similarly suddha-satvam may be luminous to God, the eternally free souls and those souls that have attained release from bondage, while being non-luminous to those in bondage.) There is no contradiction in this. In matters as certained by the authority of the Scriptures, it is no use pointing out inconsistency based on analogy. If, without accepting this principle, we were to say that suddha satvain is said to be lumi. nous not in reality, but by courtesy, as it were, or figuratively (upachāra), it might become possible to argue that knowledge, bliss etc. are also true of the self or soul only figuratively and not in truth. It may be asked :-" How could there be, in a luminous object (viz. s'uddhasatvam), qualities like form and taste and classifications like earth and water and also modific tiops. Self luminous things like the soul and attributive knowledge do not, in general, have shape, tiste, smell and the like)"? The answer is as follows:- (All self-luminous objects are not alike but have diffe rences peculiar to each); for example, knowledge or self which is CAAPTER 

the substrate (1.e. the soul) and attributive knowledge, though both are luminous, are different from each other in other respects. Knowledge, wbich is the substrate, has subjectivity, while attributive knowledge is objective, and apprehends objects. So this objection can be given a coanter-check (pratibandhi) and cannot hold good in a matter where the authority of the Sastra must be accepted. Suddhasatvam, which is luminous, is included among the three classes of non-sentient things, because it has not the quality of sentience or being the knower. The activities (pravritti) of these three kinds of pon-sentient things are of the nature of varied modifications (pariņāma) in accordance with the will of Iswara. 

PRAKRITI. 

Among these, prakriti or watter is, in its essential datore, possessed of three qualities or attributes. Prakriti or matter is constantly subject to modification. When its three qualities satvam, rajas and tamas are evenly balanced, there is dissolu. tion or termination of the world (mahüpralayam) and when theso qualities are uneven in proportions, prakriti undergoes modifica tions into mahat and the like. The region of matter which is not modified and the region which has become modified have been classified by the Sāstras into twenty-four tatvās or reals - prakriti, mahut, ahankära, tanınätras (five), the elements (bhūtas) (five) and the senses (eleven) - the senses of knowledge (five), the senses of action (five) and the mind (manas). 

Sometimes they are spoken of as more than twenty-four or less than twenty-four in accordance with the terms or basis of classification. Tbe subdivisions of each of these classes of tatvas or reals, and the deities (abhimāni devatās ) presiding over or representing each of them should be understood by those who are qualified for their respective meditation. What we are primarily concerned with bere is their being different from the atmā or self. These may all be understood as weapons and ornaments of the Supreme Being, in the following way 

THE THREE REALS 

. 

61 

TAMIL VERSE: 

The self or soul is the invaluable gem, (koustubha); prakriti or matter is the mole on the Lord's body (Srivatsa); the tatva.or real called mahat is His club; knowledge and igaorance (jnana and ajnāna) are His sword and its sheath; the ahankāras are His bow and conch (tamasa ahankära is the bow (sārnga ) and sātvika ahankāra the conch); the mind is His discus (chakra); the ten senses are arrows; the tannātras and the bhūtas (the elements) form His vanamālā (vaijayanti) or gar. land of wild flowers; Garuda is the Veda and Sri Krishna (Kannan) the object of description in the Veda, is endowed with these and protects all from the top of Hastigiri". 

The distinctive features of each of these twenty-four reals' niay be seen in their respective definitions. Of these the twenty three reals which are effects and modifications of prakriti and also their effects and modifications differ from one another in their nature and these differences may be understood from a study of the puränas. 

ESSENTIAL NATURE, ACTIVITY ETC. OF PRAKRITI: 

Suddhasatvam's 

"Satvain or Suddhasatvam illuinines its own existence; it is different from the quality called sātvan" "The creator is beyond tamas;' "It is different from" prakriti and is revered by the gods". These and other passages declare the existence of a region (of s'uddha satvam) beyond tamas. Therefore the passages which say "It (Prakriti) is eternal and has no limits and is beyond all measure. It is endless and incapable of being mea. sured” should be understood as stating that moola prakriti or 

13. Pancharatram 14. Ramayana : Yuddhakanda: 114-15. 15. Jitanta Stotram : 2-21. 16. Vishnu purana: 2-7-25, 26.62 DARA 

OR AFTER 

matter is endless or infinite except for the region covered by the nitya vibhūti (the region of eternal glory). 

The activity or pravritti of matter (or prakriti) is to become modified with its three qualities duly balanced ( during pralaya), and with them as ageven after creation (srishti), for the sake of the experience of souls bound in samsarā, and for their release from bondage and so also for the delectation or tita of Iswara. It also acts in various ways, having assumed the forms of the body and the senses. Owing to the qualities of rajas and tamas in it, it conceals the truths concerning the reals' (tatvas) and gives rise to false or erroneous knowledge. While existing for the expe riences of the baddha during samsāra, it may also reveal the tatvas or 'reals. just as they are, when the quality of satvam in it is developed and may help in the striving for anoksha. All these contribute to the delectation or lilii of Iswara. 

Suddhasatvan is, in its essential nature (svarīpa), the seat or abode of that satvam which is unmixed with rajas and tamas. Its specific state in time or sthiti is eternal in the (permanent) halls and towers (of Vaikunta) and in the specific and permanent forms of Iswara and the eternally free. It is not eternal but tempor ary in such things as the forms that come into existence out of a temporary desire of Iswara, of the nityas and of the muktas. Its specific activity is to undergo modifications to suit their desires so as to serve as accessories for the enjoyment (Dhoga) of Iswara, the s'eshi, and as instruments for the service to be rendered by the seshas. 

TIME: Käla. 

Time or Küla is, in its essential nature, non-sentient or non luminous and all-pervasive (vibhu). It is eternal because its continued existence ( sthiti) is not limited by time. Its activity consists in its being accessory to creation and the like by such divisions as kală (1/30 of muhurtha ), kashta (1/30 of kala) and the like. 

THE THREE REALS 

. 

63 

All these substances (dravya ) are, in their essential satare (svarupa), eternal. Some of them are said to be temporary or transient, owiag to their assuming & new state or condition (avastha), which justifies their being called by & new Dame. As new states similar to those which have perished follow each other in continuous succession, they are said to be eternal in the sense of a stream or current of water (retaining the same form, though the water at any time may be different ). 

The essential nature (svarīpa), the existence in time (sthiti), and the activity (pravritti) of all these substances are dependent upon Iswara, because they have no existence etc, apart from His existence and without His will or desire. Therefore it is duc to Iswara's will that all substances are, by their very natore, agreeable. From this it follows that to Iswara, to the eternally free and to the released souls, they are all agreeable. To those bound in samsära, however, they appear as disagreeable or as only slightly agreeable at different times and to different persons in accordance with the karma of those persons. Even to bound souls, the essential Dature of their own self or soul is always to be agreeable, as such is the will of Iswara. It is indeed, because of this false identification with the self which is agreeable and also karma, that the body which is disagreeable appears agreeable to those who are ignorant. Since prakriti and its modifications are harmful owing to karma, the man who desires release from bond. age should abandon the attachment to them. To those that have attained moksha, however, these very things are agreeable and not to be rejected. All those things that are taken for one's own with the notion of 'I' and 'Mine' are barmful. They become agreeable, when a rpan has come to understand bis real nature and to realise that these things exist for the purposes of the Lord. We will ex plain this matter at length when we come to speak of the perfect and complete enjoyment of (the bliss of ) Brahman. 

ISWARA : The essential nature (svarūpa ) of Iswara on whom depends the existence of all thioge is truth (satyam), knowledge (ināna), 

64 

, CHAPTER 

infiniteness ( ananta ), bliss (ananda ) and purity (amalatvam ) because of attributes like being truth, being knowledge, being infinite, being blissful and being pare. These attributes define His svarūpa or essential nature. This truth is brought out by the Alwars in the following passages: "Thou "art light that never becomes extinct and is not capable of being measured" (where His essential nature as Truth and Kaowledge is revealed as also His infiniteness ) " Thon that tart perfect kpowledge and bliss" and “Thou "that envelopest all and art a Light greater than all other ligbts, being both knowledge ard bliss" "He is **the Pure". In these and other ways the Alwars medi. tated on Him. His other qualities, along with His divine and auspicious form and such other things, are attributes of His essen tial nature ( svarūpa) already defined by those attributes. Among these qualities knowledge, strength, lordship, valour, energy, splendour-these six are associated with His nature as the Supreme Being. Goodness, spontaneous love, and the like are qualities that make bim easily accessible to all. These qualities are, at all times, connected with His essential pature (svarüpa ). The statement that some of these qualities are associated with the Sapreme Person (Para), some with vylíha and so forth is only to show what qualities the Lord of all reveals to those who are devoted to any of these manifestations of His. (It does not mean that the other qualities are absent in any of these forms). Just as in the respective vidyas of the Upanishads, we are to meditate on certain specified attributes of Brabman, so also certain specified attributes are to be meditated upon in connection with particular forms of the Lord as revealed in Pūncharātra or the Scripture of the Lord. In the Para or Supreme Vasudeva, all the six "qualities

THE THREE REALS.. 

beginning with knowledge. are to be thought of. The sāstras sometimes say that the vyuhas (or emanations ) are four' and in some places that they are three. Wbere it is said that there are four vyūhas and that Vasudeva is one of them, since there is no difference in the qualities to be meditated on between the Supreme Vasudeva and the Vyžiha Vasudeva, it is tantamount to saying that there are three vyuhas. Those who hold that the vyähas are three state their view briefly in the following sloka :- "O Lord, 

Thy original form shone with these six attributes; then came three forms of Thine which had, each of them, & couple of these attributes." Their respective qualities and activities are epitomised in the following sloka :-- "O, Sovereign of Sriranga! As the Supreme Vasudeva (Para) endowed with all the six quali. ties, you are the object of blissful enjoyment for those that have attained moksha; as Sankarshana being endowed with strength and knowledge, you destroy the Universe and also promulgate the sāstras; as Pradyumna being endowed with lordship and virility, you create the Universe and make Dharma prevail; as Aniruddha being endowed with splendour and the power to overcome others, you protect the world and teach the Truth. In this way you divide yourself." 

The differences arising from planes like the waking state have been thus summarised :-"O Lord, * of **those that meditate on Thee, some are like those in the waking state, some like those that dream in sleep, others like those that sleep without dreams, and others still are like those that have fallen into a swoon. (In the first group, the senses function, in the second the senses do pot function, only the wind is active; in the third group oven the wind does not function; they only breathe; in the fourth group even the breath is suspended). In the same way, O Lord, Thou art in four forins and dividest Thyself into four forms and art meditated upon with attributes and weapons suited to each."

CRAPTER 

The twelve forms that begin with Kesava are' other forms derived from the vyūhas. (Bhagavan also wanifests Himself as vibhavas.) These vibhavas are thirty odd forms like Padmanabha. Among them Avatars like Mutsya and Kurma are specified in relation to some specific purpose. In these vibhavas or avatārs, Iswara conceals those attributes of His which He wants to conceal and reveals those attributes which He wants to reveal to suit the special mission which He has undertaken in them. Among them, there are varied manifestations which are countlpde. So has it been said, "The "forms of Krishna ere in numerable", Other forms similarly derived from the vibhavas can also be seen in the süstras. Sometimes the Lord enters into some jivas with His own specific form and into others with His energy (sakti) and accomplishes wonderful things. These belong to another class of vibhavas. The forms of the Supreme Vasudeva (Para), the Vyuhas and the Vibhuvas assume the *forms of the images and enter into the shapes of images (installed in temples), for the sake of devotees as desired by them. This ja archāva. tara: The Lord is (also) present in a subtle form in the hearts of all jivas. This form is called Antarpämi Avatāra, as medita tion on this form has been prescribed as the means which enables those who wish to enter into the meditation of the Antaryāmin or the divine all-pervading svarüpa of the Lord. It has been said of this meditation: "Those *who have attained success in Ashtanga yoga and who are desirous of worshipping the one who dwells in the beart are fit to mediate on the one (i.e.! the form in which He dwells in the hearts of all." Therefore this One (Hārda) is spoken as Antaryāmi. 

All these forms of incarpation are constituted of the substance called s'uddhasatvam and have no connection with karma or its fruits. They are therefore called pure creation (s'uddha srishti).

THE THREE REALS 

67 

These avatārs (vibhava, archa and Härda ) are all real; in them there is no coptraction or abridgement of jnana and the other attributes of Iswara; the bodies of these avatārs are made of Suddha-satvam; the reason for these avatars is only the Lord's will; their time of manifestation is the time when dharma has to be safe-guarded; their purpose is the protection of the good and the like; those who meditate on these avatars with clear know edge may attain moksha at the end of this very life without any future birth, by their successful adoption of the right means suited to their competency and capacity. All these truths have. been explained by the Gitācharya in five slokas beginning with: 

"Bahuni me 26A vyatītāni etc." Many are the births that I have gone through, just like you. 

This meditation on the vibhavas (or avatārs) creates sup reme faith or confidence (mahāvisvāsa) in the mind of the seeker after salvation who seeks prapatti as an independent means or upāya, by affording him a knowledge of the great qualities of the Lord who is sought as the refuge and this at the moment when he adopts prapatti as the means. So also the worship of Archāva.' tära (the image) will lead easily to moksha. Bhagavan Sounaka has said :-*" Having shaped a beautiful image of Vishnu with a lovely face and lovely eyes, out of gold, silver and the like in a manner that would be pleasing, one should adore it, bow to it, sacrifice to it and meditate on it. By doing so, one would enter into that form which is none other than Brabman and will have all one's sins dispelled." The Alwars, too, very largely dwelt on this secret doctrine about the Lord's avatārs and the distinctive excellence of the avatars in the form of archa or consecrated images and considered the Supreme Self (in Vaikunta) as their original cause. 

Iswara, who is in these varied forms, creates, maintains and destroys all, is also the giver of moksha and has such other acti

vities. These activities of His are dae to the over.flow of His bliss or ānanda. 

LAKSHMI 

Iswara is with His consort in all situations as stated in pass ages like : "Lakshmi, the mother of the world, is eternal and inseparable from Vishnu." This may also be clearly understood from the writings of Parasara and Parankusa (Nammalwar), who, for the help which they have rendered, have been spoken of by Alavandar with great regard in these terms: "I bow to the gene rous sage, Parasara, who composed that gem of a purāņa (Vish. mupurāna), wherein he discloses, as they are in reality, the truths concerning cit, acit apd Iswara, their distinctive pature, swarga, moksha and the means of attaining them" and "I bow my head at the two feet of Nammalwar fragrant with vakula flowers, for they are, to all those who are connected with me, mother, father, wives, 8008 and all forms of wealth and lordship." 

In this context, we bave to understand a difference in their activities or division of labour, as it were ; for the Lord is con cerned with the punishment (of the evildoer) and Lakshmi with pleading to Him for mercy on behalf of the sinner; the Mimām. sakas have declared that the object which is stated by analogy to have attributes similar to those of another object actually described must be different by that very circumstance* from that other object. So in this case, as it bas been stated by analogy or atides'a "Jast 28A as Vishnu is everywhere, so algo in Lakshmi, o best of Brahmins", there should be a difference between Bhagavan and Lakshmi. This difference should be understood as referring (here) oply to the difference in their functions or activities. This is the conclusion arrived at in the following sloka in Srigunaratna 

28. Vishnupurana 1-22-53 

28A. Vishnupurana 1-8.17 *NOTE:- By that very circumstance. Without requiring any other authority to prove it. The diffcrcot activities shared by Lakshmi and Har Lord are determined by their own will and not by difference in the outure of the two. 

THE THREE REALS. 

kosa; "Youth and other attributes are common to both of you; however the Lord has manly qualities, like independence, conquest of foes, firmness and the like; you have such feminine qualities as existing solely for the husband, compassion and forgiveness. Thus you two have taken diverse qualities." "It is impossible to understand the real nature of God", says Nammalvar in (1-3-6) So in a matter like this, yain assertion or insistence is aot proper, 

As has been said: "Some make * weak cases appear strong." Although it is possible to prove whatever we please with the help of our proficiency in logical disputation, we submit to the Authority of the sāstras. Therefore we should understand clearly the truth concerning the Real or Tatva that rules and the reals or tatvas that are ruled, only in accordance with the pramanas. We need not try to know all things but should try to know what is ex ceedingly useful. In matters which are only of limited use, we need not be so curious to obtain knowledge. The pilot tries to know just as much about the (vast) ocean 88 would enable him to steer the sbip along the right path. Similarly we bave to under stand necessarily as mach as has been said here. In order to obtain unshakable conviction ( about these truths), more elaborate treatises may be studied. 

OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE TATVAS 

OR "REALS': 

Here we have classified the Tatvas into three. So also some consider Iswara 48 the only real or Tatva, because all other reals are His attributes. Some have classified the tatvas into two as follow The ruler and the raled; the self and the non-self; the means and the end (upaya and upeya ). Some classify what should be known into four : the Saviour and that which is to be saved; that which should be rejected and that which should be accepted. Others classify what should be known ander five heada 88 pointed out before and others into six. In the Rahasyasāstras, 

. 

29. Mahabharata : Sabhaparva: 39–5. 

70 CHAPTER 

what should be known is stated to be seven. To all those who think in those varied ways, there are respective advantages accru. ing to the strengthening of their knowledge and their daily observances. 

What is said in the following sloka, is of coarse true: "A knowledge of the s'ästras can be obtained only with the greatest difficulty. Further it may upsettle the mind. Therefore having obtained a knowledge of Hari from the teacbing of the guru, a Inan should cease from all such activities." This does not mean that one should make no attenupt to learn the sästras. It only means that one should learn what is most important as quickly as possible and proceed at once to adopt the means learnt therefrom for attaining moksha, without spending too much time over elaborate treatises, which might cause delay in the adoption of the means. The man who has enough to eat without tilling the soil woald never think of tilling it. So also without wasting time over what is unimportant, we should, as soon as possible, adopt the means prescribed for moksha, 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

A clear knowledge of wbat is uselal, indifference to the three ends (dharma, artha, and kama) and being one in thought, word and deed - these constitute the elixir of happiness. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Our ancient acharyas who gave as the essence of the Veda have, out of compassion (for us), taught us clearly all about the three wonderful and varied tatvas, cit, ucit and Iswara in order to remove,' from our minds, the cruel delasion in regard to the body arising from karma and the notion that we are independent (of the Lord). 

THE THREE REALS. 

71 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

By the addition of a point here and the omission of & point there, there are countless systems of thought, each appearing beautiful with fallacious arguments owing to the endless differences due to 'ia' and 'is not'. These are indeed as numerous as the poems composed by the imagination of poets (some omitting an incident and others inventing an incident and so forth). Notwith standing this, the unparralleled vision of the truth about the tatvas) will make them all yepish at once into thin air. When the man is seen in reality, the delusion that he is an animal or & log of wood, sthāņu vanishes at once. So also when, with the help of the pramāṇas, Purushottama is ascertained as the Supreme Deity, the delusion that Rudra (Sthanu) or any other is the Supreme Deity is at once dispelled.6. THE CHAPTER ON THE TRUTH CONCERNING 

THE SUPREME DEITY. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Those who are not proficient in the Sastras say that there is only a single self, that all deities (like Indra, Agni and so on) are only one, that the three deities (Brahma, Vishnu and Siva), when properly understood, are alike and of equal rank, that these three deities are only one deity (in three forms) and that the Supreme Deity is other than these three and hold other such (erroneous) views, but those who bave discrimination entertain no regard for these (divergent views). The Upanishads, with one voice, and so also Mana, Vyasa and others, following the Upanishads, proclaim that Sriman Narayana is our Lord who has all (things and beings) for His body, that He (alone) can give mukti and that He is the object of blissful enjoyment for those who have attained moksha, 

WHY SHOULD WE DETERMINE WHO THE 

SUPREME DEITY IS: 

All 'reals' have been classified into matter ( Prakriti), the individual self and the Supreme Self or Iswara on the basis of the differences among them pointed out before. (From a knowledge of this classification alone), it is not possible to attain supreme devo tion to a single deity to the exclusion of all others, unless the truth as to who is the Supreme Deity has been gacertained as in the words of the Alwar: "She will not worship any god other than Bhagavan por dream of any such god". Further, to no one but the exclusive devotee of the Supreme Deity, is moksha possible of attainment without delay. So it is necessary to decide who is the Supreme Deity. 

CRITICISM OF ERRONEOUS VIEWS: 

In this context, the view that all things and beings) are the substance of Brahman cannot be accepted, since sentient and non 

ON THE SUPREME DEITY, 

sentient things are kaowa by the pramāņas.to be entirely different from one another. In the same way, the essential differences beton ween the jīva and Iswara cannot be ignored (and they disprove the view that they are one). Similarly the mutual differences among the gods are based on the pramūņas, because of their 8880. ciation with varied pleasures aod pains. Therefore, though the indwelling Supreme Self, Antaryāmin is one, the view that Brabma, Rudra, and the other gods are not different from Iswara and from one another cannot be justified. 

BRAHMĀ, RUDRA AND OTHERS ARE 

CREATED BEINGS: 

Those who are considered as the chief among these gods, namely, Brahma, Rudra, Indra and others are created beings subject to the law of karma, as can be proved by pramäņas. It has been said, "When 'all individual beings and even the aggregate jiva (Samashti) have gone into dissolution and when mahat has become merged into prakriti (from which it evolved), there is one remaining as the soul of the universe and He is the Lord Narayana." Again it is said, “The god Narayana is at the beginning; from Him arises Brahma", "Narayana is the Supreme Deity; From Him was born Brahma, the four-faced, and from Brabma arose Rudra, 0 goddess ", and further, it is stated, "Then you, "the irresistible, assumed the form of Visbou from that eternal existence (viz. Narayana) for the protection of all beings." From this it is clear that, by his own will, He incarnated as the middle one (i.e. Vishnu) of the Trinity. He who is expressed by the names, Visbau and Narayana, iş stated to have been the ultimate cause of the world in His previous and original state. It is

74 CHAPTER 

also said elsewhere, " There is no "being in the world that is eternal, either among those that move or among those that do not move, except that one Primaeval Purusha called Vasudeva." This declares that He alone is eternal. Therefore, other views such as the following: "The gods of the trinity (Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva), are of equal greatness"; "The three gods of the Trinity are only one", "Iswara is above and beyond the Trinity" "Either Brabma or Rudra among the Trinity is the Sapreme Lord "-these views stating equality, identity, the exis. tence of an entity superior to all the three of the Trinity and the supremacy of a different member of the Trinity, are against the pramāņas. That Brahma, Radra, and the like are created beings subject to karma may be seen in the following passages :-" Theo purusha or person created by Him (Narayana) is called Brahma in the world". "Having 'caused the dissolution of the worlds before, you lay on the waters of the great ocean and created me at first by your Māya (will).", " Brahma's name is Ka and I, Isa role over all embodied beings. We two were born from your limbs. Therefore you are called Kesava (Ka and Isa)" Further Brahma says, "I was born from His graciousness for some reason and you, from His wrath, for some other reason, in one of the earlier creations." The very words of these rival gods, which are, so to say, a deed of release written with their own hands, declare this truth. That Brahma and Radrs are subject to karma and attained their high status, because of having worshipped the Lord of all with special rites, may be seen from the following pags ages : -- "All the gods sacrifice to Vasudeva and all the gods bow to Vasudeva." "Brahma, "Rudra and Indra, together with all other gods and the great rishis worship the divine Narayana or Hari, the greatest of Gods ", " Meditating constantly on the

Lord, Brahma, Isana (Rudra) and others have not yet attained to # realisation of His nature. It is He whose protection I seek." And Brahma says :- " Having created me in the divine lotus in your navel sbining like the sun, you have assigned to me all the duties of creation (of Prajapati) and with this burden imposed on me, I worship you, the Lord of the Universe." And in another place, we find the following :- "Brahma, "born of the lotus, bav. ing worshipped Vishou for thousands of crores of yugas, obtained again the position of the creator of the three worlds. This is what we have heard." So also it is said :-" 18 Mahadeva (Rudra), who is called Viswaropa, sacrificed all things in a great yajna called Sarvamedha and then sacrificed himself also mentally", "Maha. deva sacrificed himself in the Sarvamedha and became the god of gode. The føresplendent Rudra, clad in the skin of the elephant, reaches all the worlds with his knowledge and shines with his fame". "Since in this "great sacrifice, he gave me my share of the offering, he has been authorised by me, in the Vedas and the Sutras, as fit to receive his share of the offerings." These gods, Brahma, Rudra and others are dependent upon the Maya of Bhagavad ((i.e.) Prakriti) epd are subject to the influence of the gunas (satvan, rajas and tamas). Their knowledge is also sub. ject to contraction and expansion. All this may be understood from the incidents of the loss of the Vedas and others and also from the following sloka :-"All the 17A gods beginning with Brahma, all men, and all animals are enveloped by the dense darkness of delusion arising from the whirlwind of Vishnu's Maya (Prakriti)," "The wise say that 'these (positions) are the rewards of those who follow the good path of Satva, namely, Brahma and the other creators, and the deities presiding over dkarma, makat and avyaktam"

THE OTHER GODS ARE THE SERVANTS 

OF BHAGAVĀN. 

That these (Brahma and Rudra) render service to the Lord, who is their inner self, with the help of the knowledge given to them by Him may be seen from the following sloka : "These two ", who are the greatest among the gods, are considered to have been born (respectively) out of His (Bhagavan's) graciousness and wrath; and they perform the duties of creation and destruc tion in accordance with the lines laid down by Him." They are not pure and are not objects for spiritual meditation (subhasraya), for it has been said: "Bhagavan **Hiranyagarbha (Brahma), Vasava (Indra) and Prajapati ... ... ... all these gods and others are impure, their births being due to past karma" and again, "From Brahma'l to the blade of grass, all beings that have their existence in the world have had their births as the result of karma and are subject to the cycle of births and deaths ( samsāra)" and further, “The man who has no attacbment (to the things of this world) should koow that every being including Brahma is impure as being tainted by the ripening of karma -- to Him, Vasudeva alone is the Supreme Goal or refuge." These statements have been made by Parasara, Sounaka, Suka and others. Brabma, Rudra and others have to seek Bhagavan's protection and Bhaga van has to seek no body else's protection. This is clear from His own words :"The godses are under the protection of Rudra, O King, and Rudra is under the protection of Brahma. Brahma is under my protection and I do not seek the protection of any one. There is no one that I need for my protection, for I am the refuge of all." These gods are among the great possessions (vibhuti) of Bhagavan, who is the Lord of both tilävibhuti and nitya-vibhūti,) --- for it is said, “Brabma" Daksha and others, Kala,

ON THE SUPREME DEITY: 

Rudra and the destroyer of Kala - all these are among the vibhutis of Bhagavan," where Brabma and Rudra are spoken of as being on the same footing as Daksha and others. 

THE OTHER GODS ARE THE PRAKĀRAS OR 

MODES OF BHAGAVAN. 

These gods (Brahma, Rudra etc.) are others like the modes or prakāras of the Lord of all who has all things as Hja body. This is clear from the grammatical apposition or co-ordi. nation (sāmānādkikaranya) in which they are used, just like other substances, in connection with such words as Narayana. (For example it is said that Rudra is Narayana, Brahma is Narayana, the earth is Narayana and so on.) 

That these are His bodies and that He is their inner self or goal is evident from these words of Brahma to Rudra :- "He is* the inner self of you, of me and of all those who are called embo died beings. He sees all but cannot be apprehended by any one, anywhere." These are s'eshas who exist solely for the fulfilment of His purposes and He is their s'eshi. This truth was expressed by the all-knowing Rudra himself in Mantrarājapadastotra, where he says, "Al beings are, by their nature, the servants of the Supreme Self. Therefore I am also Thy servant and, with this knowledge, I bow to Thee." 

BHAGAVĀN HAS NEITHER EQUALS NOR SUPERIORS : 

Thus Narayana is destitute, in every way, of equals and superiors. This may be seen from the following slokas :- "O best* of men, there is no one superior to (Narayana ) the god of the lotus-like eyes;" "There was no one superior to Him in the past nor will there be any one superior to Him in the future : “There is not god superior to Vishnu, O best of kings; " "There is sting

nothing more auspicious thao Vasudeva, there is nothing more pari fying than Vasudeva. There is no greater divinity than Vasudeva. No one who adores Vasudeva ever perisbes." "In all the three worlds, there was no one like Him ever born and there will be no one like Him born in the future." " There is no divinity higher than Kesaya." "He is the ** King of all kings, Vishnu, the great Brabman. We know Him to be Iswara. He is the Father, the Creator." Those who are lucky, even while in their mother's womb and have received, while in the state of being born, the glance of Madhusudana will become desirous of moksha; for His glance dispels rajas and tamas. Those who are looked at by Brahma and Rudra just before birth will become subject to the influence of rajas and tamas. This difference is brought out in the following passages - "He who is looked at by Madhusudana just as he is being born should be considered to a pure soul (sātvika) and he will ever think of the goal of moksha. Jf, on the other hand, a person is looked at immediately at birth by Brabms or Rudra, his mind will be overcome by rajas and tamas." 

THE ASPIRANT FOR MUKTI SHOULD WORSHIP 

ONLY BHAGAVĀN. 

That these gods are not to be worshipped by those who desire moksha (and that Narayana, the Lord of all, who is the cause of these gods, is alone the deity to be worshipped by all those who desire moksha, including these gods) may be seen from the follow ing slokas :- "To those who are sunk in the sea of samsāra and whose minds are overpowered by the objects of sense plea sures, there is no other refuge than the ship of Vishnu," "Those who have a disoriminating intelligence never worship Brahma, or Rudra or any of the other gods, for the fruit of their worship

is very limited,” “Hari alone is fit to be meditated upon, O Brabmins, by you who are noted for your satvam. He is always to be adored and I am the means for en. abling you to remember Hari.” If, in some places, these gods are spoken of as assisting in the attainment of moksha, it should be understood to mean that they, like Acharyas, assist by imparting knowledge and in such other ways. This is also the purport of the following passage ; " The man who is a devotee of the god of the sun (Surya) will, after seven more births, become a devotee of Rudra by the Sun's grace. He who ia a devotee of Sankara will, after seven more births, become a devotee of Vishnu by the grace of Sankara." And again :--- "He who is & devotee of Vasudeva will, after those seven births, become one with Vasudeva by His grace." In this context it has to be stated that devotion to Sarya and others leads gradually to devotion to Bhagavan, only in the case of those who are not subject to mental delusions about the Supreme Self and the Self's that are below it - such delusions de holding that they are all one or that the lower self is the Sapreme Self or that all these divinities are of equal power, and provided they are pot filled with the hatred natural to the asuric or demoniac Dature. This is evident from the sloka : "Those who* hold Parushottama as being similar to the other deities are to be con sidered heretics unfit for any kind of karma or rite." People who have such delusions in their knowledge (and worsbip) will meet with defeat due to the panishment inflicted by Bhagavan, although they have devotion to other deities. From the following sloka : "O mighty Radra, get Sāstras of delading import composed and by prompting men to slight effort, show the fruit of these actions as soon as possible"-froin this sloka, we may infer that, if there is success in achieving tangible fruits by following these false sastras, it is only for making men fall into delusion and thence into hell. 

If Bhagavan, whose will is irresistible, decides that some one deserves His punisbment, then that person will find no other god

capable of protecting him. It is said in the Rāmāyana "If a man has t'deserved death at the hands of Rama, neither the four-faced Brahma, who was born of no mortal, nor the three-eyed Rudra who destroyed Tripura, nor the great Indra, who is the leader of the gods, will be able to shield him in battle." If, on the other hand, a man seeks refuge under Bhagavan, even if all the gods and intimate friends of His, like Sugriva, the great king, propose to injure him, Iswara will protect him by over-coming wicked men like Ravana who should be overcome, and helping, by persuasion, such good people as the leaders of the monkeys who bad spoken against Vibbishana, as they deserve that course. For has he not said :-"To him who has sought my protection even once and begged of me saying, "I am thine" -- to him I afford protection from all beings. This is my vow" and is He not one who ever keeps bis word and sees that His vows do not fail ? 

THE BOONS GRANTED BY OTHER DEITIES ARE DEPENDENT ON THE GRACE OF BHAGAVĀN. 

If men seek the favour of other gods, they will soon obtain minor rewards which are like poison mixed with honey, for it is said, “Those who desire the fruits of karma or rites perform sacrifices to the gods and obtain the rewards of their actions in the world of men very soon." And again :- " From thema" they obtain the objects of their desire as ordained by myself". The Lord said to the gods :-- "This Brahma" is your father and mother and grandfather, and will, under instructions from me, grant boons to all beings, and Rudra, his younger brother, who had bis origio in my forehead, will, under instructions from Brahma, grant boods to all beings" As stated in these passages, these are dependent upon Bhagavan. It is said :-- "The rewards (obtained from these deities) are of

a very limited nature; " " In kalpas or ages when satva is pre. dominant, Hari's glory becomes great and, only in them, those who have successfully practised yoga in accordance with the sāstras will attain the supreme goal." Therefore, from these other deities, moksha cannot be attained even after a length of time. From the Lord of all, on the other hand, a man obtains unsurpassed wealth and the like, even as Brahma attained his high position after wor® shipping Vishnu for crores of thousands of yugas; and afterwards, like the man who bathes in the Ganga for physical refreshment and thereby obtains purification also from all his sins, he gets inci dentally freedom from sins; his rajas apd tamas decline and his satuam becomes dominant and, in course of time, he will attain moksha like Janaka, Ambarisha, Kekaya and others. But there is delay in such cases as may be seen in the following passages : "At the 48A end of many virtuous lives, the man attains spiritual wisdom and seeks my proteotion” and again, " Those who have attained success in crores of births will at length become well established here." "Those who have, in many thousands of lives, become purified of their sins by penance, meditation and yoga (samadhi) will acquire devotion to Krishna," When the desire for moksha has become ardent and when the man practiges 80 upāya which is within his power, there will be no delay in the attainment of moksha, for He has declared : "To those who have fixed their minds on me - to them I become the redeemer and save them quickly out of the sea of samsāra". To him who adopts prapatti as the independent means, there is neither delay nor absence of delay, except in accordance with his own desire These distinctions will be accepted by all who have regard for the pramānas and they have their effect by the will of Iswara which cannot be questioned, for has it not been said, " The lordship of Iswara is absolutely independent and brooks no questioning ?"

those who do not clearly vaderstand these principles in this way, the worship of other deities is prescribed in such passages as the following: "They may "be worshipped by men other than those who have discriminating intelligence," 

Those who worship these other deities without knowing that they are the bodies of Bhagavad are like a follower of Charvaka (a materialist who believes that there is nothing other than the body called the soul) who anoints the body of the king, his master, without knowing that his master has a soul. It is true that the soul of the king is pleased with the service done to his body. In the Bame way, A8 & matter of fact, the devotion to these other deities is really the worsbip of Bhagavan, 88 they are only His bodies. Notwithstanding this, the fruit of this devotion to the lower deities would be only partial and incomplete. (We may remember in this connection the sloka in the Gita) which says:- " Those who sacrifice with faith and earnestness to other deities -- they, too, sacrifice only to me, but not in the manner and according to the rules prescribed for it." Since the rite is perfornied in an irregular manner without the observance of all the rules, the fruit will be partial and incomplete, If, on the other band, a man, knowing that these other gods are only the bodies of Bhagavan, offers wor ship to them owing to a special desire for obtaining quickly the smaller goods of life, the fruit will be fully and completely realised in perfect measure. 

The Gita thas speaks of those who approach Bhagavan for minor fruits :-" The man" who has lost his wealth but seeks to re cover it, the man who wants to enjoy his own soul, and the man who wants to acquire prosperity” All these will have their reward in even greater measure." Of those who adore Bhagavad without any such desire for minor fruits and only for the sake of moksha, it is said, "Hari", who confers moksha, gives to His worshippers who meditate on Him, health of body, wealth, and enjoymente, in

addition to what they desire vis., moksha". These are, so to say, adventitious or incidental rewards (ānushangika ) aot sought by them. Sri Kulasekhara Perumsl, to whom such adventitious prosperity was vouchsafed, says in this connection:-"The 56A man who desires only Thee and does not seek great prosperity - pros perity comes and seeks him." Isandan also has stated this in his stotra thus "Those enjoyments which were formerly desired but could not be obtained come to us, of their own accord, without any effort or exertion on our part, like rivers flowing into the ocean, (although we do not desire them now)." (It may be asked why all those who desire only moksha are not blessed with the good things of this life ). (The answer is):- This is dae to the special form of meditation or vidyā practised by the devotee and the special desires of his earlier life. (Some. vidyās secure worldly prosperity in addition to moksha after death, while others secure only moksha.) 

The Alwars, too, have spoken of these differences between the Lord of all on one side and Brahma, Rudra and the other gods on the other side, in passages such as the following: “The gods* are only the food eaten by Bhagavan and vomited afterwards, (eaten during pralaya and vomited after creation); are there any (gods) who are not of the nature of this vomit?" "Narayana **created the god with four faces, and the god with four faces cre ated Sankara." "O Thou" that art the original bulb of the lotus of the navel, from which arose Brahma, Siva, Indra and the others who worship you with reverence.” “ Arjuna "saw on Siva's head, the flowers of the garland that he had placed at the feet of the holy Bhagavan which had measured the whole world, and anderstood clearly that Sri Krishna was the Supreme Deity Wearing garland of green tulasi." "Indra“ who rules over the gode, Brahma the god with four faces, and the great Siva with his matted locks of hair - (all these) meditate with earnestness and

sincerity on His lotus-like feet and go about praising Him." "He alone" is the Lord of Siva who is spoken of in high terms, of Brahma and of all others." "O Lord whose glory cannot be adequately understood even by him who rides on the unique bull and by Brahma," And again, "Neither the god who has the ball for his banner, viz. Siva aor Brahma, nor Indra nor any other knows the remedy for the disease called " birth" (i.e.) samsāra." 

This truth about Bhagavan being the Supreme Deity should be considered as present in the first letter a of aum in Tirumantra and in the word Nārāyana therein and in the word Narayana occurring in Duayam along with its attribute Sriman (along with Sri or Lakshmi) and likewise in the words 'me' and 'I' occurring in the Charama Sloka. 

For men other than those who have this conviction about the Supreme Deity, it is not possible to be in the state of having Bhagavan alone exclusively as their protector, a state such as is described in the following and other words of the Alwars: "There is 68 no refuge other than Krishda". "Whether you * weed out my suffering or whether you do not weed it out, I have no other means of getting it removed." "I know of no other staff of support for my soul". (We may see also) the ten stanzas beginning with: “If you do not withbold the suffering due to my karma", The Alwar* who learnt all spiritual truths directly from the Lord of all discerned the truth about the Supreme Deity in Tirumantra, gave up all devotion to other deities and became well established in exclusive devotion to Bhagavan, which extends to His devotees and also in rendering exclusive service to the Lord and His devotees. He gives expression to this in the following verse. "I cannot eo live in agreement with those who

hold that there is any other deity (than the Lord); I have also obtained the privilege of rendering service to Thy devotees." In the verse beginning with "The earth, water, fire, air, ether--having created these," the Alwar places (before himself) the three gods concerned in this controversy and, after a consideration of pramānas, ignores two of them and decides on the remaining deity who is Sapreme Light": "as His god having a complexion resembling that of a cloud." Perialwar also declares in the follow ing verse that the deity who is of this form and complexion is the Supreme Reality (Tatva) described in all the Vedas ; "If "you "meditate on the god who is of the colour of the ocean by attering the origin of all Veda, namely, the syllable aum with three mätras (metrical units) etc. etc." 

Having in mind the passage in Taittiriya which describes the Supreme Deity as being the Lord of Lakshmi, the Alwar under stands that this description excludes other gods and exclaims:-"I have seen Lakshmi and the form of the Lord shining like gold on which she rests." Beginning with this verse he concludes with the statement that " for wise men it is only Bhagavan who ever acts in conjunction with Lakshmi that is both refuge and goal." This be declares in the following verse :- "Our refaget is the goddess residing in the beautiful lotus covered with honey, who bas long eyes and sbines with a splendour which throws into the shade the lightning seated in the black cloud and who fascinates (with her beauty) the God armed with the discus and wearing the garland of tulasi on his broad chest." The conclusion has been arrived at that this couple (Bhagavan and Sri) are our goal of attainment and our refuge. 

This truth regarding the Supreme Deity was taught at great length by the great sage, Parasara, to his worthy disciple who was fit to receive the great spiritual secrets, in the following sloka -

“Io all beings, gods, men and animals, all that is masculine is Bhagavan, Hari, and all that is feminine is Laksbmi, O Maitreya, and there is no one other than they," Tbis sage, Parasara, obtained the knowledge concerning the Supreme Deity by the grace of Pulastya and Vasishta who gave him this boop :-"You will" understand the truth about the Supreme Deity." "What Was?" said to you by Pulastya will certainly become true." Our great Acharya, Sri Yamunamudi, also speaks of Parasara with the greatest regard in 'I bow to Parasara, the best of sages." And Nammalwar, who received the gift of knowledge free from all delusion and bhakti from Bhagavan and who occupies the highest place in the line of those who have performed prapatti, has stated the same truth (namely, that Lakshmi should also be considered along with Bhagavad as our refuge and our goal): "You have 78 epabled me to have a vision of Thyself and Thy consort (Lakshmi) with the sbining bracelets, standing together." 

We bave already stated all that should be said in this connec tion in our commentary on The Four Slokas (of Yamunacharya) with a refutation of the views of opponents and refer the reader to the same. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Our Acharyas have proclaiped, in so uncertain terms, that our eternal Lord with His Consort seated on the lotus is the Supreme Deity, so that disputants, proud of their knowledge of reasoning and argumentation, may not, each according to his own will, declare that the ultimate cause is this or that (Brahma, Rudra or Indra) thus causing dread to the Vedas* and trepidation to all devotees. 74.

(7) THE CHAPTER ON THE ASPIRATION 

FOR MUKTI. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Who, indeed, is there that will bear the bondage of samsāra -- who that has understood the revolutions of time, the nature of matter (prakriti) and its evolutes or modifications which cause contraction of knowledge, the evils attendant on the enjoy. ment of the pleasures of this world and of svarga, the experience of sufferings resulting from sia which resemble & pit of fire, the true relationship that exists necesgarily between himself and the Supreme Being, the region of divine bliss and also the nature of the body which is like a prison-house ? 

Thus, from the Sāstras which treat of the soul, a man should understand the principles and truths explained so far. He should know clearly that the soul or selt is self-luminous or luminous by itself, is a knower, doer and enjoyer having a body and that the goal is atomic, eternal, without parts or limbs, incapable of being cut, burnt, injured, dried up or otherwise affected and that its essential nature is such as not to admit of increase or diminution and that, in all these respects, it is different from the body, the senses and the like which are attributes of the self. With the conviction that the soul or self is capable of passing op into another world and taking up another body, the man learos, in a general way, that it is possible for him to have higher aims or goals than those found in this world. He is full of dread at the thought of falling into hell and the like or experiencing the sufferings of another life and abstains from those actions wbich are the causes thereof. He is also convinced that he is different from Iswara in that while be is supported and controlled by Iswara and exists solely for the fulllment of His purposes and is besides weak, atomic and subject to ignorance, doubts, errors, sufferings and the like, being the abode of impurities, Iswara, of whom his self is an attribute, is, in every one of these respects, absolutely the opposite. From this 

THE ASPIRATION FOR MUKTI

knowledge he becomes fit to desire the glory due to his essential nature (of rendering service to Bhagavan). He then realises the most important truths from the Tirumantra which is a concise summary of all that is needed. By an understanding of the signi. ficance of the third letter in its first word aum, namely, m, he realises that the self is essentially Jnana or knowledge in its nature (and has knowledge algo as an attribate.) By this realisation be gives up the notion of 'I' in regard to the body ((i.e.) mistaking the body for 'I') and of 'mine' in regard to those things that are connected with the body. Similarly from the dative or the fourtha case of the first syllable a where the dative termination has been dropped ((i.c.) from aya), we should learn that the Jiva exists for Iswara and thereby, corapletely and without any trace, give up the erroneous notion implicit and explicit in the words 'I' and 'mine' in regard to the following the aotion of 'I' in regard (even) to the soul as distinct from the body, that it is s'esha to oneself and the notion of 'mine' in regard to the attributes of the soul (such as this jnāna is mine). In this connection we should remember. (Bhattar's) sloka (written in the form of an imagi. Dary dialogue between Iswara and the Jiva which reads 46 follows:-) 

"Bhagavān: You are mine. 

The Jiva : I exiet (only) for myself. Bhagavān: Where is it stated ? The Jīva: Where is the opposite stated ? 

Bhagavān: In the original pranāna : the Veda. The Jiva: The opposite view is based on the strength of 

my own enjoyment of myself from begianing less time. 

Bhagavin: But protests have been recorded then and there. The Jiva : Where is it objected to ? and by whora?' CHAPTER 

Bhagavān: The protest or objection was made in such 

works as the Gita and it was made by me. 

The Jiva: 

Is there any witness ? 

Bhagavānı: The wise man. 

The Jiva : 

But he is an interested witness. 

Thus in this dispute between Bhagavan and the Jiva, the need arises for an arbitrator." 

With a knowledge of the meaning of u in aum, which means 'only', we should root out the notion of 'I' in thinking "I am the sesha of others (those other than Bhagavan) and the notion of *nride' in thinking, "Another (and not Bhagavan ) is my s'eshi." By an understanding of the negation contained in the middle word (viz. namo, na mama ) which declares that there is no such thing as independence for the Jiva, we should rid ourselves of the notion of 'I' in thinking that in respect of the means of securing one's own protection, one is wholly independent' and the notion of 'mine' in thinking that this act or activity for securing protection is unconditionally 'one's.' By the force of this very negation (na mama ), we should give up erroneous notions that may exist in regard to the fruit (of the upaya), which consists in fature enjoyment (in Vaikunta) extending up to the service of the Lord, which is the meaning of the dative in the third word (Nārāyanāya) - erroneous notions of 'I' in thinking on the analogy of other fruits enjoyed here (in this world), "I will be the independent doer” and “I will be the enjoyer subject to no one else " and "mine" in thinking "I do this for myself" and "I enjoy this for myself". (These notions of 'I' and 'mine' in varied situa tions should be completely rooted out by considering the meanings, implicit and explicit, in the several words of the Tirumantra.) Thus ope should become well established in right knowledge and should say to oneself in the words of the Alwars . " Having

'enjoyed the pleasures of sense and found them petty, I have now given them up and found relief." "The pleasures of the five senses in seeing, hearing, touching, spelling and tasting and, so also, the unlimited but inferior enjoyment of one's own self (ātmānubhava), which is not capable of being realised by the sepses, have been given up by me.” “When He is gracious, what is there difficult of attainment? I have had enough of dharma, artha and kama. They are petty." "The 'fruits obtained by these weak.minded men are temporary and end after & short time.' "Having come into this world which is not eternal and is full of misery, seek me as your refage." "Having heard of those who were mighty and valiant and of those who had immense treasures of wealth and who, after the lapse of some time, bave left nothing bebind them but tales of their lives, the wise man never considers as 'his', sons, wives, houses, land and the like, nor Wealth". "The 'world is all misery”. “Even in Svarga, since there is fear of a fall after the expiry of the ordained period, there is no bappiness". "It is only fools who banker after kingdoms, thinking that they are theirs. Men like me never long for them, because they are not intoxicated by the strong liquor of egotism the sense of 'I')." "From the mansion of Brahma downwards, O sage, these evils exist; therefore the wise never desire the attaia. ment of Svarga." "Above the mansion of Brahma, there lies the supreme world of Vishou, which is pure, eternal, full of supreme splendour and is called 'the Supreme Brabman. Fools, deluded by the pleasures of the senses and tormented by vanity, covetousness, arrogance, anger, perfidy and delusion never go to that world. Only good men without possessiveness and egotism, who remain indifferent to the pairs of opposites (like

pleasare and pain, heat and cold and the like), who have full control over their senses, and who are devoted to Yogic meditation go there." "In that world are beautiful vimanas (airsbips) which can travel as they please, Assembly halls, gardens of varied kinds, O king, and, likewise lotus tanks, full of pellucid water.” “ 18Com pared with that world of the Supreme Being, these lower worlds (of Brahma and Indra) are like hell." From these and other sayings, the Jiva should realise the seven kinds of evil inherent in the enjoyment of non-sentient things, viz. their littleness, their instability, their origin in pain, their being mingled with pain, their resulting ultimately in pain, their origin being due to a perverse egotism and their being opposed to the bliss which is his nature. He should also realise such of these evils as are inherent in the enjoyment of one's self, ātmānubhava. He should then realise, with clear vision, the unique character of the enjoyment of of the bliss of Bhagavan, wbich, in every one of these respects, is opposed to them. He would then attain the condition of "one who longs eagerly for the Supreme Being and who, consequently, is averse from things that are other than the Supreme Being. He would then abstain from activity whose characteristics Brahma is 16 said to have described (as leading to fruits other than Moksha ) and embrace renunciation whose characteristics are said to have been described by the 'sage Narayana (as leading to Moksha). It is only men of this type that can be described as competent aspirants for mukti. Even if a man knows clearly wbat is high and what is low among the tatvas and what is high and what is low among the aims and objects desired as the goal of life as explained above, if he does not adopt the upāya which can becore the supreme goal of life, after acquiring & distaste for other pleasures (vairāgya), he will be an object of ridicule like the dog whose tail does not hide its private parts nor drives flies and mosquitoes. His learning will be of no use to him. 80 has it been said :

THE ASPIRATION FOR MUKTI 

"Learning is "fruitful when it leads to purity of character and of conduct:" "The 18 Sastras have been enjoined by wise men for securing serenity of mind. Therefore only he who has attained serenity of mind should be considered as having a knowledge of all the sāstras". Therefore, "men "should conduct themselves in a manner which will be in keeping with their age, with the duties which they undertake, with their goal in life, with their learning, and with their birth, so that their appearance, speech and action are all alike" - it is only these that will secure the glory described in passages like the following: when & man performs bis duties, he is lauded by others. "The gods consider him as a Brahmin who is clad in whatever rags he can obtain, eats whatever food comes to him and has his bed wherever he can find it;" " The gods* bow to him (who is free from the pairs of opposites, who has no attachment to anything in life and who ever delights in doing good to all beings"). TAMIL VERSE: 

The wise man longs for Moksha, which is the supreme goal or aim of life, having conquered the senses by the grace of those acharyas who bave taught him of the eternal bliss of holding the feet of Bhagavan, who stands ever ready to redeem him, of the sea of samsara whose essential nature is to perish and of that which is good and that wbich is evil. SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

There may be born somewhere in this world some one who, being lucky and wise and desirous of obtaining release from samsāra, gives up the pleasures of external objects which are like honey mixed with poison and who, being averse, also, to the limited delight of realising or experiencing his self (atmānubhava), longs for the enjoyment of the infinite bliss of Brahman.

(8) THE CHAPTER ON THE CLASSIFICATION 

OF QUALIFIED PERSONS. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Even though the desire for moksha is the same, a distinction arises among those who practise the vidyās or forms of meditation prescribed in the s'rutis, &s a result of their respective qualifications or competence in regard to such vidyās as Madhuvidyā, Sadvidya and so on. In the same way, & distinction arises between the adoption of prapatti and other vidyās (which are of the nature of bhakti or devout meditation), as a result of an unseen power or destiny depending on past karma which brooks no questioning. 

(NOTE:Some aspirants for moksha are qualified for madhu vidya and others for sadvidya as a result of their respective competence or special forms of aspiration. So also some are qualified for prapatti, while others are for bhakti.) 

TWO KINDS OF ADHIKARIS: 

Among those who thus resort to the practice of the dharmas of renunciation 48 & means for the attainment of the supreme goal of life (namely moksha), there are two classes of qualified persons : those who adopt prapatti as the sole and direct means and those to whomh prapatti is auxiliary to the chief means, viz., bhakti. Both these are prapannas, ode adopting prapatti as an indepen dent means and the other adopting it as anga to bhakti. Both of them are also called bhaktas, because bhakti is the phala or fruit for one and sādhana or means for the other, 

NOTE: phala bhakti means bhakti which ariscs as the fruit of prapatti, whereas sadhana bhakti is bhakti which leads to moksha. 

Just 48, according to the passage, " Ablation is prescribed in seven forma", (1) the utterance of a mantra ; (2) the mental process; (3) celestial ablution ; (4) ablution by air and so on, are held as different and equally effective kinds of ablution in regard to those who are qualified for those respective forms, the forms known as 

8. "... CLASSIFICATION OF ADHIKARIS: 

Uktinishta (by one's utterance) and acharya nishta :(that done" by the acharya on one's behalf) and varieties of prapatti. UKTINISHTĀ: 

Of these, that done by one's utterance (uktinishta) is as follows: Those who have no clear knowledge of auxiliaries (anga), such as the determination to do wbat is agreeable (to the Lord), but who possess the qualification of knowing that, without, the Lord, they have no other means (a kinchanya) and who have. also the faith (viswāsa) that He will grant salvation if prayed to - they pronounce, before the Saviour, the sentence taught to them by their acharyas, wbich will be considered by the Lord as equivalent to perfect prapatti; they say: "May my salvation be Thy burden or responsibility !?" They are like the ignorant children of feudatory princes who seek the protection of the emperor by repeating the words taught to them by their parses. If a little boy who does not understand the meaning of words and sentences says, once, " Madam, give me food as alms", it meets: with immediate and favourable response in the houses of good men wbo are well.to do. In the same way, it has been said, The Lord, whose wealth Deyer suffers any diminution, however much He may give, will also grant whatever is prayed for". Since He is supremely rich and generous, even this utterance or ukti will never be fruitless. In the case of those who are ignorant and who depend entirely on this utterance, the compassion of the Lord, who is the refuge of all, cannot ignore even this mere atterance (as it cannot digest it); for it has been said, “Whatever may be the manner or form, you have attered the Duaya Mantra. Therefore your redemption is my responsibility." This trath has been stated by those who are well versed in the Sastras) in such slokas as the following: "Though* I am a sinner, it will not become Thee, who art the Lord of all, to neglect me when I atter the words stating that I seek Thy refuge." "This 'speech of mide expressing the thought that I seek refuge upder Thee is not attered 1. Tiruvoymozhi: 3.9, 3.

with all my mind and with all my heart. I can be saved only if even this were utterance will secure Tby compassion." "I longti to see Thee by merely uttering the words of prapatti - Thee who caust not be attained by bhakti." The state of one who performs prapatti by utterance (ukti), and that of one who depends solely on the acharya have both been described in the same sloka as follows:- "I have been made Thy responsibility by my acharyas who follow the way of dharma. I have also (myself) uttered the word seeking refuge. Taking this into consideration, 0, Lord of Srirangam, make me Thy burdep or responsibility" The word api (also) in the sloka indicates that any one of the two will soffice. ACHARYANISHȚĀ ; 

Of the two, the one who depends solely on the acharya is included in the acharya's own pradatti as part of it, for it bas been laid down in Sandilya Smriti and other treatises as follows: “He should also state thus: “This is Amy son, my servant, my disciple (who is to be saved)". It has been said: “There may be doubts concerning (the redemption of) those that serve Achyata, but there is absolutely no doubt about the (redemption) of those who delight in the service of His devotees". So, in the case of those who depend solely on the acharya, there is no doubt at all concerning the fruition of prapatti, by the principle of "How much more, then" (kaimutika nyāya). 

Mudali Andan said: "When & lion leaps from one bill to another, the little creatures (like hugs and lice) on his body are also taken over from that bill to the other. So also when the author of Sri Bhashya performed prapatti (the surrender of his responsibility or bhara), we "too bave been saved (by that act) 4A. Varadarajastava: 92

6. Sandilya Smriti: 1.95 NOTE: This is interpreted in two different ways by the southern school of Visishtadvaitins and the northern school. The former bold that since Sri Ramanuja bas already performed praparti, even bis followers of a later day who acknowledge him as their acharya will benefit by it and they need not perform praparti; the latter hold, on the other hand, that only those who were his sishyas then would benefit by it.

owing to our intimate connexion with him." We, too, have expressed this idea in Nyasa Tilāka as follows:- " The blind man walks on being led by one who is not blind; the lame man is taken (across the stream) by the boatman, being placed within the boat; the children of the king's servants enjoy the pleasures (of the palace), although they do not know the king. So also my acharya, who is compassionate, is capable of making me attain Thee, O Lord of Srirangam". It comes to this that the Lord of all will not be gracious enough to grant us the supreme goal of existence, unless prapatti is performed in some manner or other and by some one or other. 

The favour of Bhagavatas, residence in holy places and the like are not direct and independent means for attaining moksha. (It is true that we find such pissages as the following in the Sastras):-"Whether it be a beast'or & man or & bird - those who are held by Bhagavatas as their owo will go to the supreme abode of Vishnu for that very reason". “We, who live in your territories, should be protected by you, for you are our king, O ruler · of men, whether you are io the town or in the forests", "All the beings in Ayodhya which contained (many) good regions - whether they were beings that moved or beings that could not move - he enabled them (all) to acquire nobility of nature". The nobility was that of feeling delight in the company of Sri Rama and grief in separation from him. "The lo strength that lies in living in places where Thou hast temples is the strength that enables & man to attain moksha". (From these passages, it might appear, at first sight, that the favour of Bhagavatas or God's devotees and the fact of living in places belonging to the Lord would lead of themselves to the supreme goal.) But even here there is always some coonexion with either prapatti by one's owa utterance or prapatti through the acharya or bhakti or prapatti

wbich existed before or bhakti or prapatti wbich followed. It may he asked how this could be. (The answer is as follows:-) They will lead to bhakti or prapatti. In the case of one who has already adopted bhakti or upāsanā, they will promote the further development of the upaya or means. In the case of one who has performed prapatti as an independent means, they will promote the eagerness for service while in this world. It is in this way they render help. 

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BHAKTI AND PRAPATTI 

IN SECURING THE GOAL: Among these, he who has adopted prapatti as the means to bhakti is capable, like Vyasa and others, of other means or upāyas than prapatti and is therefore not absolutely helpless (akinchana ). Since he can bear delay (in attaining moksha), he is not averse to other interests (in life). He will attain moksha only at the expiry of the karma which has already begun to yield fruit (prärabdha), when he will have the intense thought of the last moment before death. Since the primary upaya or means (angi) wbich he has chosen is upăsana or bhakti, he attains the fruit thereof, namely, moksha, when it is performed fully and in accordance with the rules and injunctions prescribed for it. On the other hand, prapatti adopted as the primary or direct means (angi) is open to all adhikaris, is capable of averting all hindrances (to moksha), can further the attainment of all that is desired, is easy of performance, has to be performed only once, can bring about the fulfilment (of what is aimed at ) quickly and will not countedance any opposition or obstacle. Like the missile, Brabinastra, it will not tolerate the adoption of any other means or upāya for attaining the fruit. The man who has resorted to prapatti as the direct and independent means will have no hindrances at all in the way of his attaining the perfect enjoyment (of the bliss of Bhagavan). Therefore from the moment of the performance of prapatti, there is nothing in the way of his attaining moksha but bis own desire to live till the death

of this body so that he may enjoy such things as the rendering of service with this body to the images of the Lord (archa) to which he has an attachment. So his moksha has to await only the death of this body and will consist in the rendering, in Vaikunta, of perfect and full service which has begun even here in the performance of service limited by the conditions of place, time and the nature of bodily life (svarūpa ). The state of the prapanna who is prepared to continue in this world till the dissolution of the body is referred to in passages like the following: "What is there" wrong in us who go about here having already won the grace of being permitted tc serve Thee " "Leaving this bliss of "uttering Thy names, I do not want even the bliss of going to Paramapada and ruling over it." "Can' I indeed give up the hare and go in pursuit of the crow !" (That is it would be foolish to give up hare's flesh wbich is excellent as food and go after crow's flesh. So also the service of the image here in temples is superior even to the bliss of serving the Lord in Parama. pada). “My deep love to Thee, "O King, is always staunch. So also my devotion to Thee, O valiant Sire, is always firnı. Nowhere else can my mind turn". (In these words Hanuman expresses his love and devotion to Sri Rama and states that this love and devotion are greater towards Rama than even to the Lord of Paramapada). 

*Since the Supreme Ruler is the giver of all things, and since prapatti at His feet is capable of yielding all kinds of fruit, it becomes the means of securing whatever fruit is desired rer. pectively by these two (bhakta and prapanna ). The Sāstras say, "Ask any boon that you want, when I am in the range of one's vision, all (good) things will follow." "O Thou that hast 11. Tiruvoymozhi: 8-10-4

created all the worlds! Is there anything that is difficult to obtain, when Thou art pleased ? " " When" He is graciously disposed, is there any thing here that cannot be obtained ? " " What is there in this world or in the world above, O Dalbhya, that cannot be accomplished by those men whose minds are directed towards Vishnu ?". "The fruit is from Him. It stands to reason ". (Brahma Sutras 3 - 2 - 37). Bhakti or upasana is the means of securing the four kinds of objects that may be desired in accord. ance with one's aim as stated in the Bhagavad Gitä (7 - 16). "Four types of men who have performed meritorious deeds wor. sbip me. He who has lost his wealth and is anxious to recover it, he who wants to have a vision of his own self (ātmā) and to enjoy it (ātmānubhava ), he who wants to acquire wealth anew, and he who is & Jnāni, who desires to be for ever with the Lord and practises bhakti for attaining Him." Similarly bave not the great rishis declared that prapatti is also the means of attaining the four kinds of objects or aims as is stated in the sloka : "Only so long as one does not perform prapatti to Thee that canst destroy all sins, will there be the anxiety to recover lost wealth, only so long will there be the desire to acquire new wealth, oply so long will there be the absence of the enjoyment of one's self as something different from the body; only so long will there be the sorrow of samsära". From the words " that destroyest all sins” and the repetition of "only so long" repeated in every case with great consideration, it is made clear that the fruit which is desired by the man will all become his, in accordance with his desire and at the very time when he desires to have it. It is in consideration of this superior efficacy of praputti that it is stated (in Lakshmi Tantra 17 - 62) 29 follows:-" Those who practise Jnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga With & pure mind and those who perform karma which would discipline the soul in renunciation are not worth even one tep-millionth part of the man who has

performed prapatti. The difference in the kinds of service done here (in this life) by the prapanna is due to the difference in the desire of the prapanna apd that difference in the desire is due to the difference in the meritorious deeds of the past which have began to operate in this life (Prärabdha karma ). There will be no difference at all in the bliss that will be attained after casting off the last body. 

THE BLISS IN MOKSHA IS THE SAME FOR BOTH. 

Entire dependence on the Lord is uniformly the same for all. For it is stated in Vishnu Tatuam :-"Having understood his absolute dependence on the Supreme Person, he gets rid of the bondage due to past karma, attains peerless independence and enjoys bliss with him." It has been declared (by the Bhashyakara in the chapter on the Goal (Chapter IV of the Brahma Sutras) that this independence which is said to be acquired in the final stage of attainment (i.e.) moksha is * fitness to render every kind of service to the Lord without being subject to past karma. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Those who desire to attain the bliss of Bhagavad realise that the supreme aim of life is moksha and that there are two upāyas or means attaining it, one prolonged and the other quick which depend on their luck. They adopt one of these two upayas and find that, for getting rid of the hindrances caused by past karma, there is no other way than seeking the feet of Mukunda for refuge, 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Mukunda does not vouchsafe His abode to any one other than the prapanna. The prapanna is of two kinds, Damely, he who adopts prapatti as the sole and independent means and he who adopts prabatti as the auxiliary means to bhākti or upasana and this difference is due to difference in the fruition of their good 

• Brahma Sutras : 4-4-8102 deeds. He who adopts prapatti as an auxiliary to bhakti will attain moksha after much delay caused by the need to expiate past karma (in one or several bodies), but will have the happiness of devout worship in this world for a long time. He to whom prapatti is the sole and independent means will attain moksha quickly (i.e.) at the end of this life itself, but bis happiness of serving the Lord in this world will be limited and of short duration. 

(9) THE CHAPTER ON THE CLASSIFICATION 

OF THE MEANS OR UPAYA FOR 

ATTAINING (MUKTI). 

SANSKRIT SLOKA. 

Bhagavan is declared in the Upanishads to be Himself the weans (upāya) of attaining Him. The ways of bhakti and prapatti are indicated for winning His grace. The adoption of these *ways is the result of the great ripening of meritorious deeds (done in the past ) and, even for this, Bhagavan, who has the ability to create everything, is Himself the cause. 

NOTE:-*These ways: The commentary Saraswadini says that the Sans krit word Gati does not mean here ways or upayas but forms of knowledge. 

UPAYA AND UPEYA: 

The means or upāya to be adopted by them (i.e.) the seekers after mukti) is a special kind of expansion of knowledge. The upeya or object of attainment which can be realised by this ineans is another special kind of expansion of koowledge. Of these, the special kind of expansion of knowledge wbich is the means requires the belp of iostruments of knowledge (karana ) and has been prescribed in the Sästras. It has for its object Brahman who is always endowed with the five attributes like satyam, (satyam, jnānam, anantan, inandail, amalatvam ) which define His essential nature or substance ( svarīpa), along with the qualities Associated invariably with the respective vidyii or form of meditation. The object of attainment (upeya) which is & special kiod of expansion of knowledge does not require any instruments of knowledge. It is the natural heritage of the jīvātmii and has for its object Brahman perfect with all qualities and glori. ous possessions (vibhūtis). 

SLOKA: 

The principle of tatkratu states only that the qualities (and forms) meditated upon would not be exoluded in the attaiament. 

104 CH APTER 

it does not exclude other qualities (and forms ). Service to the Lord is also the object of attainment (upeya ) as it is the over-flow of the experience (of Bhagavan ) which is attained. 

NOTE:--- The principle of tatkralu or tatkralu nyaya is to the effect that in whatever form or maoner and with whatever qualities ons meditates on God - in that very form and with those very qualities will one attaio Him. Though service to the Lord is not specifically prescribed in a vidya, it will be attained after mukti. 

BHAGAVÃN IS BOTH UPAYA AND UPEYA: 

Iswara is the object of the knowledge which is the means, upāya, and is also the object of the knowledge which is attainment : He is the means or Upaya as being the giver of the (desired) fruit and, likewise. He is Upeya because lle is Himself the object that is to be enjoyed. In the case of the numukshu who has adopted prapatti as the sole and independent means, Iswara takes the place of other upriyas. In the case of others also (i, e.) those who adopt bhakti, Iswara whose favour has been won by prapatti (adopted as an auxiliary means to bhakti) intervenes and, standing in the place of rites and duties wbich are too bard for them in those situations wbich lie between the beginning of karma yoga and the completion of the (prescribed) neditation, brings about the removal of sins and the manifestation of satvam which can result from their performance. He sees to it that the meditation or worship which has been adopted as an upaya is so completed as to bear fruit. 

KARMA YOGA: 

Karma Yoga means the performance of certain kinds of karma or rites and duties as the resalt of knowledge acquired from the süstras in regard to the true nature of the Jivātma and the Paramātmā. The rites and duties consist of the following: (1) nitya karna or regular duties to be performed compulsorily (like the daily sandhya vandana) (2) naimittika karma or rites to be compulsorily performed on specific occasions (like the eclipse 

CLASSIFICATION OF UPAYAS 

105 

of the son or the moon) and (3) such kārya karmās or rites as are optional and as have been chosen to be within one's ability. Though these kāıya rites are ordained for obtaining certain specified fruits like svarga, they have to be performed without any desire for those fruits. All these rites and duties, 1, 2 and 3, have to be performed regularly and in accordance with the pres cribed rules by the Karma-yogin. 

This karna yoga has several sub-divisions described in the slokas beginning with "Some perform the rites or sacrifices (Yajna) which are of the nature of the worship of the Gods" (Bhagavad Gita IV 25.) They include such (items) as the adoration of the gods, the performance of austerities (tapas), pilgrimage to sacred places, giving in charity, and sacrifices. 

In the same way as, in accordance with the differences of competence, prupatti becomes the means of attaining mukti, either through bhakti or directly by itself and without the inter vention of bhakti, so also karma yoga, either through Jnāna Yoga or without it, becolues the ineans of having & vision of one's 

or ātmā with the help of yogic auxiliaries like yama (self-rest raint), niyama (observance of rites) and prināyama (the control of the breath). 

JNĀNĀ YOGA: 

Juiina Yoga is the constant and uninterrupted contemplation, by one wbo has conquered his mind by karna-yoga, of his svarīpa or essential nature or the self as being distinct from matter, (the body, the senses and the like) - bis svarūpa which is the mode or prakära of Iswara in virtue of its relation to Him as His body or s'arira. The self is the body of Iswara ( as bas been already pointed out) because it is supported and controlled by Him and serves His purposes. 

If a person has succeeded in attaining to a vision of his self ātmävalokana) by the practice of yoga preceded by karnia yoga 

106 CHAPTER 

and Jnana yoga and if he escapes the spare of being (perma. nontly) attracted by the pleasure of enjoying this vision which is 80 great as to create a distaste for all sense-pleasures - then he begins the practice of bhakti yoga which is (the direct) means for the attainment of the supreme goal of enjoying Bhagavan. While practising bhaktiyoga, the aspirant contemplates on Bhagavan as the Inner Self, or antaryāmin of his own self which is His body. The vision that he has (already ) acquired of his own pure self is then useful, for it is only through it that be reaches its Inner Self, just as the cloth within which a gem is tied up is first to be seen before the gem itself can be seen. In this way the vision of one's self serves as a qualification for the practice of bhakti yoga. 

BHAKTI YOGA: 

Bhakti yoga is the special forn of meditation which is of the nature of unsurpassed love and which has, for its object, the essen tial nature and the like (form, qualities, etc.) of Bhagavan who is not dependent on any one else, who is not subject to the aathority of any one else and who does not exist for the fulfilment of the purposes of any one else. Bhakti is of the form of a continuous stream of knowledge which is of the nature of uninterrupted memory like oil streaming down continuously; it has clearness similar to that of visual perception; it grows from strength to strength by being practised every day until the day of journey to Paramapada and terminates in the remembrance of the last moment. The performance of the rites and duties of one's varna and asrama is auxiliary to it (bhakti yoga ), as it dispels sins that Gause rajas and tamas, which, like weeds, impede the growth of satvam 80 pecessary for the expansion of knowledge. This bhakti yoga is also a means or sadhana in accordance with the specific desire of the sādhaka, for acquiring lordship (in this world or in svarga) and other fruits (like kaivalya). This is . calculated to strengthen the faith of the weak-minded as stated in the sloka ; "Worldly' benefits have also been mentioned as arising from 

1. Satvata Samhita 

CLASSIFICATION OF UPAYAS

NA 

bhakti-yoga. They produce confidence in the attainment of mukti (by verifying what is stated in the sastra from the example of these worldly benefits). This idea is expressed in the sloka in the Gita (7-16) which says: "Four kinds of persons worship me etc.” The superiority of the Jnāni which is stated there in the words, " Among them, the Jnāni is the best because he desires to be always with Bhagavan and is devoted solely and exclusively to Him" is thus described by Bhagavan Himaself com " Four *kinds of people are my men. They are all devotees (bhaktas). Of them they who worship me alone exclusively are the best, for they do not approach other deities. They perform the prescribed rites and duties without caring for their fruits and desire to attain me alone. The other three kinds of devotees desire ( worldly) fruits which have an end and they are subject to lapses. The wise man who worships me with sole and exclusive devotion attains moksha." 

Bhakti yoga which has thus been prescribed as the means of obtaining moksha has been called parabhakti. Love of the Lord which results from intimacy with sättvikas (and the scriptures ) and which produces parabhakti is also called bhakti, because it generates an eager desire to know Iswara with perfect clearness. It has been said: "Owing to smy devotion to the Lord and to my gurus, I have attained spiritual purity and come to know Janardana with the help of the süstras." (So parabhakti is born successively of a knowledge of the truth obtained from the sāstras which leads to karma yoga and the like). It (parabhakti) pro duces in its turn an eager desire and determination to see the Lord and makes the man cry out as follows- "O Lord, 'who art the abode of attributes like jnāna, be pleased to show Thy whole self 1" “Vouchsafe Thy grace so that I may see Thee": "May I see Thee some day!" By this keen desire alone, be wins the grace of Bhagavan who rewards bim with a perfect visual perception

of himself for the time being. This visual perception is called parajnana. From this perfect vision of the svarūpa of the Lord is born an excessive and unsurpassed love for the Lord similar to that felt by a man suffering from great thirst at the sight of & tank. This (excessive and unsurpassed love for the Lord) is called parama bhakti, Parama bhakti produces an eager desire and determination to enjoy the Lord without any limitations, as the bhakta feels that it is impossible to live any longer without this experience of the Lord as described in the Tiruvoymoghi 10.10-1 (where the Alwar cries out that he will not hereafter allow the Lord to leave him) and that he most become one with the Lord and declares all this with an oath that cannot be ignored by the Lord. It causes (likewise) an excessive eagerness in the Lord to give him moksha immediately and makes bim attain moksha after quenching his great thirst for anion. 

NOTE:- Bhakti leads through yoga to para-bhakti which leads to para-Jnana, which, in its tura, leads to parama-bhakti. 

BHAKTI AND PRAPATTI: 

(Prapatti stands in the place of para bhakti to the man who adopts it as the direct and independent means). Siace bhakti yoga is not suitable for those who do not belong to the three higher castes and (likewise) also for those in these three castes who are wanting in jnāna or ability or both and since it will not suit those who cannot endure any delay in the attaidment of its fruit (namely, moksha ) and are therefore extremely impatient, prapatti is prescribed as the sole and independent means of moksha for them. Since it will be the means of securing all desired objects, it has been prescribed in the place of para bhakti for those who know their limitations. Just as in the case of the man who practises the vidyās, para bhakti is followed by (certain) stages of attainment (like para jnana ), this prapatti will be followed by certain favourable results or states in accordance with the desire of the man who adopts it as the independent upāya. These states are to be considered as part of the fruits of prapatti. 

CLASSIFICATION OF UPAYAS 

109 

Thus prapatti and bhakti are said to be optional in relation to those who are qualified for them as they secure the same final goal or fruit. 

BHAKTI IS DIFFERENT FROM PRAPATTI: 

That the two are different from each other is evident from the adhikarana or section. "The Brahma Vidyas are different as their *names and the like are different ". Brahma sūtras (III-3.56). That there is option to choose any of them) is also evident from the section : " There is option (to adopt any of then ) because the result or (final) fruit is the same". Brahnia sītras (III - 3. 57). 

It may be seen that, as in upāsanās there are differences in mantras and the like (angas), there are, in Nyasa Vidya also, differences stated in the different branches of the vedas (Stīkhas) and in the different samhitas of the agamas. Just as obeisance (namaskāra) is divided into three forms, verbal, mental and bodily, so prapatti, too, is said to be of different kinds owing to the excess of one or other of these differences. It has been stated by some that, just as obeisance becomes complete when all the three, verbal, mental and bodily are combined, prapatti, too, becomes complete when verbal and bodily actions are combined with mental states or jnana. This statement of theirs should be understood as meaning that mental prapatti is full and complete and that verbal and bodily activities are, as it were, the overflow of the mental prapatti (jnāna). (It should not be taken to mean that prapatti is incomplete when verbal and bodily actions are absent). We have already stated that all these are productive of the desired result or fruit in accordance with the competency of those who adopt them, 

NOTE:--- * Commentators of Brahma sutras like Sudarsana Bhatta point out that this difference in names applies specially to nyasa, since it is a different word from 'contemplate', *meditate', and 'adore' which are used in connec. tion with the other vidyas and which mean thc samo thing, whereas nyasa has a different meaning (altogether). 

110 TAMIL VERSE: 

They are Brahmins who know the following :-- (1) Karma Yoga es suited to one's state (viz. varna, asrama and the like); (2) Jnāna Yoga adopted with keen intelligence on account of its beneficial results: (3) Bhakti Yoga adopted by those with an inner vision which is delightful and (4) Prapatti which yields immediate frait by the grace of God to those who are destitute of the quali fications (for the other three ) and who cannot endure delay in attaining moksha. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Karma, Jrāna, Upasana (bhakti ) and likewise saranāgati are the good ways prescribed in the Vedas for securing mioksha ; of these some are indirect and auxiliary means (namely, karma and jnūna ) while the others, bhakti and saranāgati are direct and independent upayas for mukti. Of these, some (i.e. karma and jnāna), have only one form (that of being in. direct and auxiliary means ); bhakti has only one form (that of being the direct and independent means for mukti, while saraņā. gati or prapatti has two forms, that of being an indirect and auxi. liary means as leading to bhakti and also that of being the direct and independent means or upāya for obtaining mukti. The wise (who know the s'ăstras), having understood well the difference among these upayas due to their having this single or twofold nature, delight in the last words (charamasloka ) of the charioteer who is the Saviour of all, (i.e.) they prefer s'aranāgati), 

(10) THE CHAPTER ON FITNESS FOR PRAPATTI. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Fitness (for Bhakti or Prapatti) consists in a combination of desire (for the fruits of a course of action and of ability which is threefold. This fitness of man is differentiated as consisting in conditions prescribed for the yoga of eight angas or auxiliaries (bhakti yoga) and for the yoga of six angas or auxiliaries (pra. patti). That Bhagavan is the refuge or Saviour of all has been declared in the sruti and confirmed in the smritis In adopting this righteous path viz., prapatti, there is competence for all as in the matter of speaking the truth and such other injunctions as are ordained in the Vedas (for all men , without any difference of caste or ūsrama). 

(Those who are not of the three higher castes are probibited from the performance of certain rites and duties ordained in the srutis, but this probibition does not apply to such injunctions 88 "speak the truth ", and " look upon your mother as divine" eto. which are also ordained in the Vedas. So also prapatti, though prescribed in the Vedas, is open to all castes ). 

THE MEANING OF COMPETENCY OR ADHIKARA: 

It is necessary that one should know the special qualifications and the like required in a person who intends to adopt nyasa vidya (prapatti) without any desire for the other upayas in the quest for the goal that is desired. Competency (adhikara ) consists in 

NOTE 1: Ability which is threefold - The ability to understand the meaning of sastras: the ability to perform what is ordained in them and the competence as laid down in the sastras according to caste, qualities and the like. 

NOTE 2:- Bhakti Yoga: Bhakti Yoga is called the ashtanga yoga, because its eight angas are yama, niyama, etc. Praparti is called shadanga yoga, because its six angas are such as anukulya sankalpa, prathikulya var ianam, mahavisvasam, akinchanyam, etc., to be described later,112 CHAPTER 

the attribute of desiring the end on the part of the person who adopts an upāya for the sake of a certain desired result and also ability to adopt it. Ability means the capacity to understand the meaning of the sāstras and the capacity to perform what is ordained therein and, likewise, fitness or competency in accord. ance with what is prescribed in the sästras, such as, caste, quality and the like (ächāra - samskāra). This competency exists al ready (before the adoption of the upāya). To the man who has this competency, what is stated to be th: object to be obtained by the means, is the desired result or fruit. Upaya is the means prescribed or ordained for securing that fruit or result. The person who has become desirous of mukti (mumukshu) and who adopts the special upūya for moksha called direct and independent prapatti should have, in common with the upāsıkı ( who has adopted bhakti), a knowledge obtained from the süstras of such things as the relationship (between Jivātnī and Paramitma as that between the body and the soul) and he should have in addi. tion, the special qualifications of akinchanya and ananyagatitva ; ākinchanya means the absence (in a person) of the ability for other upāyas. Ananyagatitvam means an aversion to all other interests (than voksha) and a turning away from all other refuge than Bhagavan. The latter is implicit in the former, namely, aversion to all other interests. This may be seen from such passages as the following :-"Wise 'inen never worship Brahma, Rudra and others who are called gods, for the boons that they could grant are limited." 

If, without an eager and impatient desire for immediate mioksha, & person who wants euch things as the continuance of the body (or the continuance of the worship of archūvatūru) adopts prapatti for the sake of moksha, his mukti will be delayed in proportion to these other interests, 

1. Mahabharata: Santiparva: 350-36 

10 

FITNESS FOR PRAPATTI 

113 

ĀKINCHANYA AND ANANYAGATITVA: Ākinchanya and Ananyagatitva are conditioned by the ignor ance of and inability to adopt other upāyas on the part of the person adopting this means, as also his inability to endure delay in attaining mukti. His turning away from other saviours than Bhagavan is conditioned by bis conviction of the absolate depend ence on Bhagavan alone, which is common to himself and to others (including other deities than the Lord), as is stated in the sloka : “ Just as, O 'Bharata, tips of grass are entirely subject to (the force of the wind, even so are all beings subject to the sway of the Lord ", and it is conditioned also by his aver sion to other interests than mukti, 

THE PRAMANAS IN SUPPORT : The nature of the specific competency for prapatti is evident from the following authoritative passages and from spiritual tradi tion : "Having been abandoned by his own father (Indra), the gods and the great sages, be, (i.e.) Kakasura, wandered about the three worlds and finally took refuge under Rama alone", "I am the abode of all trapegressions; I have no means or upaya to save myself and I have pothing else to attain besides Thee"; "I seek" the refuge of Thy feet, O Saranya (Saviour): I have po other upāya and nothing else to attain than I'bee": "*Finding that there is no npüya for leaping over samsara even in all the endless future, etc." : "I'who am aware that there is no upāya for me in all the thousands of crores of kalpas other than performing prapatti at Tby two lotus-like feet", and, “I who have no other refuge and no other saviour etc." 

PRAPATTI IS OPEN TO ALL: If such qualifications exist, prapatti is certainly open to all as an upaya, since there are no restrictions to it such 88 caste. 2. Mahabharata: Udyoga Parva: 30-29 6. Sriranga Gadyam 3. Ramayana: Sundarakanda: 38-33 7. Vaikunta Gadyam 4. Ahirbudhnya Samhita: 37-30

(1) Inability to adopt such upāyas as Bhakti yoga, (2) ignor ance of the required knowledge; (3) prohibition by the sästras of the adoption of such means and (4) ipability to endure any delay in attaining mukti :- these four, occuring either singly* or in combinations of two, three or four, by virtue of adrishta (re sulting from meritorious deeds performed in the past) are qualifications of varied kinds for the performance of direct and independent prapatti to the Lord of Lakshmi and good men resort to it with these qualifications and free from all doubt for the attainment of mukti. 

NOTE:— * Those who have only one of these four are of four classes, those who have any two of them are of six, those who have any three are of four and those whonbinave all the four form one. 

(11) THE CHAPTER ON THE CLASSIFICATION 

OF ACCESSORIES OR ANGAS: 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Prapatti to Bhagaven which is of the nature of tharanyäsa (the surrender to the Lord of the responsibility of one's protection) is ordained in such sāstras as the Vedas as having certain distinc tive accessories or angas, which are of a certain specific nature and of a certain specific extent and it is to be necessarily perform ed and only once to Bhagavan, who is the celestial ocean of mercy who controls the whole universe from within it and who is already bent on the destruction of samsära. 

THE ANGAS OR ACCESSORIES OF PRAPATTI : 

The accessories or angas of this vidyā (nyāsavidyā or pra. patti) are the following: the intention or will to do (thereafter) whatever is agreeable ( to the Lord), the avoidance of whatever is displeasing (to Him!, helplessnese (kärpanya), supreme faith, and supplication or seeking His protection. 

It has (sometimes) been said that saranagati is 'of six kinds : intention to do whatever is pleasing ( to the Lord) (anu külyasankalpa), the avoidance of whatever is displeasing to Him (prātikūlyavarjanam), the faith that He will afford protection (mahāvisvāsa), begging His protection (goptritvavarana), the surrender of the self (ātmanikshepa) and the feeling of helpless ness (kārbanva). It is stated to be six-fold in this and other passages by the inclusion of the angī, namely prapatti or self surrender among its angas or accessories as in the word ashtanga yoga. 

NOTE:-(Ashtanga Yoga is really dhyanayoga. It is said to consist of yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dhyana, dharana and samadhi, Samadhi which is the angi is included among its angas or accessories ). 

1. Ahirbudhoya Samhita: 37-18 

116 OBAPTER 

That one of these is angī and that the others are angas are evident from the following sloka and (this does not require any argument) : * Nyasa or 'self-surrender which has the word nikshepa for a synonym bas five angas and is called also sannyāsa, tyāga and saranāgati.” In the Ahirbudhnya Samhita, it is stated as follows:--- "The prapatti2A that I perform to the Lord is itself eternal fruition to me: I desire no other fruit than this. This absence of the desire for any other fruit (than prapatti) is itself considered as the chief anga. The desire for the fruit is opposed to this." This other anga (described in the Ahi. Samhita), Eqmely, the absence of any desire for alterior results or fruit is essential in the surrender of the self for the sake of moksha, (and not in every form of prapatti). The giving up of all attachment to the fruit or consequence and also of the thought of one's doer. ship is common to all forms of renunciation such as karma yoga, This thought or reflection should therefore be entertained by the person desirous of moksha, at the time of bis surrender of His self to the Lord with all the angas. 

1 & 2. ANUKÜLYA SANKALPA AND 

PRĀTIKULYA VARJANAM: 

Among these angas, the essential condition for the will to do what is pleasing (to the Lord) (änukülya sankalpa) and the avoidance of what would be displeasing to Him, (prätikulya. varjanam) is the knowledge that the person existe solely for the Lord of Laksbwi for whom all things and all beings exist and should therefore do whatever would please Him by performance and by abstention from performance. From this it follows: that "by the determination to do whatever is pleasing and the other (the avoidance of whatever is displeasing) one would avoid transgressiog the command of the Lord.

ANGAS OF PRAPATTI 

117 

(3) KĀRPANYAM: 

Karpanyam , or helplessness is meditation on one's akin chanya and otber attributes (like ananyagatitvam) described in the previous chapter, or the freedom from pride to which it gives rise. These generate a feeling of wretchedness or helplessness. In any one of these ways, it would serve to beigbten the compassion of the Saviour (saranya ) and would be useful later on for the promotion of the knowledge that there is no other upāya. For it is said :- "Kārpanya" is abstention from seeking any other upāxe" 

(4) MAHAVISVASA: 

Supreme faith or maha visvāsa is necessary for the perform ance of prapatti free from all doubts and it leads later on to freedom from all care or anxiety. For it is said. "From the faith that He will protect arises the performance of the desired upāya." 

(5) GOPTRITVA VARANAM : 

Though moksha is the appropriate goal of our essential nature, (svarüpa), yet when it is sought as the desired end (purushürtha), it has to be asked for, just like other desired objects not so approp riate. Supplication for protection is necessary since the thing (vix. moksha) would be given oply to one who asks for it. No good thing is ever given without its being asked for. Therefore moksha will not be purushärtha, unless it is asked for by the purusha. That is why it has been stated as follows :-"No protection would be given when it is not sought", and "A Suppliancy or seeking the Lord as Saviour is to make our mind known (to Him)." 

Since these five are of use at the time of the performance of prapatti, they are essential for the surrender of one's self, atma nikshepa.

ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRESENCE OF 

THESE ANGAS IN SARANĀGATI: 

These angas that are essential for prapatti may be seen in the words of the good Trijata to the Rakshasis advising them to seek refuge under Sitadevi. "Enough of your cruel words." This states the avoidance of what is displeasing. " Use 7A only conciliatory language". This states implicitly the intention or will to do what is pleasing, since the utterance of speech is impos. sible without being preceded by mental resolution. “Terrible 78 dread has, indeed, befallen the Rakshasās from Rama." By des cribing the state of helplessness in which they stand, this shows their äkinchanya which is a qualification (for prapatti) and it reveals their kārpanya also, for, by reflecting on their helpless. Dess, they would give up their arrogance and the like, which leads to kārpanya, one of the angas." She7C is capable of protecting us, 0 Raksbasis, from this great danger", which is elaborated by Hanaman into " She is 70 capable of protecting these Rakshasis from Rama". This shows the great faith or mahavisvāsa that she will protect, for even when the Lord is intent on punishing ODS (for his or her mis-deeds ) she can turn bis mind from anger. "Let us beg Sita7€ (to protect us). This is what I consider proper. Though you threatened her before, beg of her now; O Rakshasis, do not ask whether she will protect. Sach talk is vain." This is supplication for protection. The surrender of the self, ātma nikshepa, which is the angi and which has these five as ita angas is intended in the word pranipāta (obeisance ) which states the cause that produces the graciousness, in the sloka: "Sita, the 7-daughter of Janaka, is surely bent on showing her gracious. Dess to those who do her obeisance". Therefore the statement in the yāstrās that Nyasa has five angas" is seen in its complete. ness here (in the prapatti of the Rakshasis ). The Raksbasis dia

not reject this advice and even this (mere) acquiescence (namely, non-rejection ) made Sita become their refuge owing to her ex treme love and graciously say:- "I will be your refuge." That these words were from the very heart and ultimately bore fruit has been declared by the great Parasara Bhattar renowned for his learning and wisdom in the sloka: “O Mother Maithili, by the protection which you gave to the offending Raksbasis from Hapuman, you reduced Ram& and His council (Sugriva and others) to a lower position, (for Rama protected Vibhishana (who had committed no offence) and Kakasura (who had offended) when they were able to ask for protection whereas you pro tected the Rakshasis while they were in the very act of offending, and even when they did not themselves beg of you to do so, (at the intercession of Trijata)," In this surrender, by Trijata, of the reg. ponsibility (for protection) of herself and of others connected with her, the Raksbasis who were related to Trijata by birth and who had won her affection, were included. So also the four Rakshasas wbo came along with Vibhishana were included in the upāya adopted by him. In that context also where protec tion was granted (by Rama ), it is possible to fit in the angi and the angas. And it is in this way - Since (Vibbishana) tells Ravana who is determined to continue in bis evil career, “Let "Sita be given back to Rama", and "Let us give Sita Devi to Rama and live here, O King, free from all anxiety," Vibbisbapa's intention to do whatever is pleasing (anukiilya sankalpa ) is dis closed. This wholesome speech caused anger in Ravana's mind in the same way as milk tastes bitter to the person suffering from (excess of) bile. The intention to avoid what is displeasing (prātikulya varjanam) is revealed in bis coming (to Sri Rama) having given up all attachment to Lapka in accordance with his words, "I seek 18 refuge under Rama having given up (wy) sons and wives", and "Lanka", friends, and all kinds of wealth have been

abandoned by me," (These words were uttered by him) after Ravada cursed bim saying: "Shamels on thee, O thou that bringest disgrace to our race." He then came to the conclusion that there Was no use of giving him advice any more, that he should not enjoy any further the glories of being with him and that he should not even stay in the place where he was. Vibhishana's kūrpanya or feeling of helplessness is stated in his words beginning with, “The wicked Ravana" and in his saying that he has no other course left open owing to his enmity with the all-conquering Ravana and in his declaring a short while after: "I am the younger brother of Ravana and have been put to disgrace by him; I have sought Thy protection, o Thoa Saviour of all." His supreme faith (mahāvis. vāsa) which made him approach without fear and say: "I havella songht, as my refuge or upaya, Raghava who is the protector of the whole world " is indicated in the words “ Vibbishana who was great168 in wisdom" as being the cause (of this faith). The world "great " which qualifies " wisdom" is intended also to show his supreme faith; his supplication for protection (Goptritva varanam) is conveyed in the words, “I have sought Raghava ", for it is included within them. Besides the indirect suggestion of the supplication for protection, his speech, "Offer me ( Vibbishana) to bim at once " shows the surrender of his self (xitmanikshepa) done with the help of those who could promote this surrender (ghatake). The word Nivedayata, which here means "offer to Him" would be of no use, if it were interpreted as 'inform'. 

These ideas can be found either briefly or at length in all other contexts of prapatti and in all deposits of property on trust with others in ordinary life. When depositing, with a capable person, property or wealth which one is oneself unable to keep safe, has it not been seen that one intends to do what is pleasing and to give up the intention to displease that person ? One believes that the person ( 80 trusted ) can keep it safe and will do so if required, tells him of one's inability to take care of it and begs him to be its 15. Ramayana: Yuddha Kanda: 16-15 16A.

custodian. Then one leaves it with him and sleeps care-free, with.' out any fear and with one's arms on one's chest. 

THE PRESENCE OF THESE ANGAS AND 

THE ANGI IN DVAYA: It may be asked how these angas are to be understood in the mantra called Dvaya which reveals the meaning of the action (prapatti) to be performed? The answer is as follows:--Doubts might arise whether the Lord of all (1) who is omniscient and omnipotent, (2) who rewards in proportion to the karma (per. formed by one), (3) who does not require any help or assistance, (4) who does not take action immediately like mipor deities and (5) who is destitute of equals and superiors-- (1) whether the Lord who is of such a nature could ( at all) be accessible to those who have committed unlimited transgressions (2) whether He would grant fruits beyond all measure to those who have committed un. limited transgressions which are hindrances to their attainment, (3) whether He would give (these blessings ) in return for insigoj. ficant actions (on the part of the persons concerned), (4) whether - he would grant them without delay and (5) whether He would be absolutely indifferent to the status of the suppliant. To remove these doubts one should know that the Lord has certain features like (1) helpful recommendation (purushakāra) from Lakshini, (2) the relationship of the Master to his servants, (3) attributes and qualities like love (to His creatures ). (4) the will or deter-, wipation (to redeem them) and (5) His own satisfaction in savidy then. These features of the Seshi (Bhagavad ) which are Deeded, respectively, for the upaya or means and for the attain. - went lie insbedded, as it were, in the words Srimat (with sri or. Lakshmi) and Narayana (the refuge of all men ) and these fea. , tures will not, in reason, be available for salvation if there is no · determination on the part of the Jiva to do what is pleasing: (itruukiulya sankalpa) and the avoidance of what is displeasing · (prātikulya varjana). This should be considered as referred to in those two words in Duaya. These words which show that the master has these features reveal by their appropriateness (the need :122 CHAPTER 

for) the determination to perform what would please Him and the avoidance of what would cause displeasure. 

These five, pamely (helpful recommendation from Sri, the relationship of the Master to His servants, His attributes and qualities, His activity in redeeming and the satisfaction (prayojana) He receives have, respectively, the following specific properties: (1) inability to refuse, (2) impossibility of dissociating (Himself from His servants), (3) the unconditioned Dature of His grace, (4) the absence of the need for accessory help and (5) His feeling that the gain of those who are below Him is His own gain. If it is asked how the doubts (about salvation by prapatti) stated before are removed by these specific properties, the answer is as follows:- (1) Though He is omniscient and omnipotent, He can not ignore recommendations of certain kinds and will pardon all faults which stand in the way of His accessibility in the same way as a king will pardon the faults of servants of the zenaną (on the recommendation of the royal ladies). He will appear as if he is unaware of these faults and be easily accessible. (2) Though He rewards in accordance with one's karma, he will become gracious owing to the performance of prapatti, which is some thing like an apology for greater things, a vyāja or gesture, and grant oven that fruit which is beyond all measure and wbich is one's natural right like an inberitance, on account of its being due to the relationship of master and servant. (3) Although He has all objects of desire and does not require any help or assistance, He looks upon the little action (prapatti) performed by one as if it were an act of supreme help to Him because of His supreme and anconditioned compassion; for He is like a generous emperor who is easily won over by even little tokens of homage. Thus he becomes grateful and acts ( accordingly). (4) Thoagh He does not (in general) act quickly like inferior deities and rewards those who adopt other means laid down in the süstras only after (Home) delay, yet when a man who has no other protector or refuge has performed prapatti, He grants whatever is desired at the very time when it is wanted, as He did in the case of Kakasura and Vibbishana, by 

11 

THE ANGAS OF PRAPATTI 

128 

His mere will wbich is accompanied with generosity and which does not require any other help or aid. (5) Though He is destitate of equals and superiors, He has such attributes as independence and does what is desired by His dependants for His owo satisfac tion; 80 He grants (their request ) without any consideration of their status or rank as ( Sri Rama did) in the case of all creatures in Kosala and in the same way as a man feeds his parrot and his child alike with milk. Thus the doubts (regarding the efficacy of prapatti ) arising from analogy with everyday life are removed also by the same analogy. Therefore there is nothing to binder prapatti from being the upāya for the desired object, as ordained in the sāstras. Supreme faith or Mahāvisvāsa is not possible for one who has not understood, from the special grace of a good ācharya, these five, namely, helpful recommendation and the like, qualified by such attributes as have been mentioned before. This is how it bappeds: The man finds that he is unfit to adopt such upayas as karma yoga and the like on account of his great sins resulting from Iswara's being unfavourably disposed towards him. His condition is such as is described in the following siloka : "Shame on me that have neither purity, nor modesty, neither compassion por shame; for, O Supreme Person, I desire to aspire to Thy service which even such great yogis, es Brabma, Rudra and Sanaka find far beyond the reach of their meditation." Thus he has a bankering for attaining an object that is hard to attain; but for securing it, he adopts an upaya which does not involve physical strain, expenditure of money or length of time and which is easy of performance, since it involves only a single mental act or even a single utterance with only a general under standing of the meaning of the words as a whole. With this easy upāya he desires to attain that supremely great object (namely, moksha ) and that, too, when he wants it. He knows that, by birth, conduct and the like, be is unfit to enjoy that fruit, like & lødog which is upfit to eat the offering made to the gods, and yet he longs to attain this glory not only for himself but also for those

124 CHAPTER 

who are connected with him. Embar has, therefore, illustrated the difficulty of having such faith by saying that to expect this man who dreads bhaktiyoga to have this supreme faith (regarding the efficacy of prapatti') is “to ask a man who pleads inability to pay a bundle of sesamum stalks which would yield & kalam of seeds to pay instead a kulam of oil". 

In this connection Appullar stated that the man who, like the gopis, has little discrimination bat kaows that the Lord is easily eccessible and who seeks Him as having this quality has greater faith than the man who thinks only of the Lord's supreme great ness and remoteness and avoids Him; for the latter is called in the Gita the worst of men (narādhama) as the birth of his know. ledge has only led to bis ruin. The greatness of this supreme faith born of % knowledge of such things as helpful recommendation (purushakāra) from Lakshmi, the essential nature of this faith and the feeling of helplessnugs are to be seen respectively in the preposition pra in prapadye (in Dvaya ), the root pad in pra. padye occurring with the word s'aranam and in the first person singular in prapadye. 

In Sarasāgati Gadya, Sri Ramanuja explains the implica tion contained in the first person singular (prapadye) as meaning "I tbat bave no other refuge". In Duaya the words Saranan prapadye express supreme faith in the Lord's protection. There fore the supplication (or prayer for protection ) is implicit in the words which express supreme faith in the upāya (though not actually stated in so many words ). It has been said " I am the abodetof transgressions; I am without any other neaps of pro. tecting myself, I have nothing else to attain than Thee." "Be pleased 19A to be my upāya. This thought of prayer is called saranāgati. Let it be performed to the Lord.” Further " this word s'aranam 198 is employed to mean any one of the followiog : upaya, house and protector; here it means only upāya." The

THE ANGAB OF PRAPATTI 

195 

Lord of all, besides being the protector in the general sense, as stated in all sāstras should, in the case of the prapanna, be thought of steadfastly as being an upāya, since he has accepted the responsibility of protecting him and stands therefore in the place of other upāyas. Besides, the Lord should be thought of as an upaya in order that this adhikari (namely, the prapanna) who has surrendered the responsibility for his protection to the Lord may remain steadfast without seeking other upāyas. 

The word upāya standa for "the means to secure an end" and this means may be either seatient or non-sentient. It has been said:-"Among the angas to prapatti are the faith that He will protect and the supplication or prayer for protection " " The Lord20 who controls everything, though He is omniscient and always compassionato, expects & prayer for protection, since He has to look after the process of samsāra". Since the upāya or means in this case is a seatient being (namely, the Lord), and the prayer for protection (or goptritva varaṇam) which is appli. cable only to sentient beings is necessary here, the word saranam in Duaya, which means upūga, inaplies also the prayer for protec tion. Since the word sarcınan cannot have two meanings when it is used only once, (we should understand that) in the Duaya, the steadfast thought of the Lor being an upaya which is peculiar to the adhikārī called prapanna is brought out by the word saranan itself and that the prayer for protection wbich is common to all adhikaris is understood by implication from the meaning. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Our kind Acharyas have taught us the way of seeking, as an upāya, the Supreme Being who is (ever) ready to help us in our state of helplessness, when we are without such upayas as bhakti yoga which give rise to doubts (concerning our ability to adopt them with success). They have taught it to us so well that we 

20. Lakshmi Tantra : 17-78. 

126 . 

sball never commit the mistake of begging, for deliverance from the sorrows of samsāra, the (other) gods who are bound by karma and are therefore like ourselves and who are not related in any way to us. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

In the Scriptures (vouchsafed to u8 ) by Bhagavan bimself (e. in the Pancharātra Āgamas), this yoga called prapatti is proclaimed as having five or six angas and as requiring to be per formed only once. In this yoga, absention from trapsgressions results from two of the angas, namely, ânukilya sankalpa and prātikulya varjana. It may be goderstood (also ) that from one anga, namely, kūrpanya, one feels that there is no other upāya. From supreme faith, another anga arises firmness of mind. By another anga, namely, goptritva varanam, is generated the Lord's will to save. In this yoga, namely, prapatti, and also in its angas, the thought that all these are dependent upon the Lord should arise from a knowledge of the truth (tattva) (that the jiva is s'esha to the Lord and that all be does is really done by the Lord and that for His own purposes. sāttvika parityāga). This last thought is common to prapatti and all other upāyas for securing moksha, (When saranagati is performed for the sake of worldly goods, this last thought, sättvika parityāga is absent.) 

(12) THE CHAPTER ON THE PERFORMANCE 

OF PRAPATTI WITH ITS ANGAS. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

When & desired object is incapable of attainment by oneself and by other upāyas, prapatti is the placing of the responsibility or burden of securing it in somebody who is capable of doing go with a request or supplication. It is declared to be the specific thought such as (the following): "This object should be accom. plished (for me) by you without my making any effort of my own hereafter." 

THE NATURE OF THE ANGI: 

In this upāya ( consisting of angł and angas ) to be adopted by the seeker after moksha, the angī is the surrender of one's self or ātmā with a clear anderstaadiog tbat, neither in the prapatti nor in the fruit thereof, one has any independence; it should be in the same way as one would surrender a jewel belonging to another to that person bimself to be kept safe by him and to be worn by him. 

That is ;--- one should realise that, in relation to the Lord of all who appears in the base and the suffix of the first letter in the pranava (i.e.) a which means Iswara and the suffix of the dative or fourth case which has been dropped (ie) aya (for the Lord of all) as the protector of all and the seshi of all, one has no interest or connection at all in the activity of protecting one-self or those related to one-self and also in what results from the protection of oneself and those related to oneself, either as depending upon one. self or as bringing about some results for oneself. It is the specific form of thought that one is s'esha to the Lord and is entirely de. pendent apon the Lord - in this, the most important feature is surrendering the responsibility of protection (bharanyasa ) to the Lord. 

128 OHAPTER 

THE MANNER IN WHICH BHARANYASA 

SHOULD BE PERFORMED: The manner in which this form of mental realisation contain ed in the injunction "One 'should surrender one's self to me" should be effected is as follows:- The person should realise this within biniself: viz., "I am absolutely dependent (upon the Lord); I am His s'esha and exist only for Him. My s'eshatva does not belong to anybody else and has no dependence on any. body else. Therefore Iswara who is the seshi and who is inde. pendent should protect me for the fulfilment of His own purposes. As is said in the sloka : "Even my self!A or ātmā does not belong to me; (if & man should consider what does not belong to him as his, he could consider the whole earth as his )'; my soal does not belong to me, it does not belong to anyone else (than Bhagavan), I do not belong to myself, por can I say that any thing belongs to me unconditionally. As stated in the sloka -" The embodied being who is like a lump of clay and is entirely dependent on the Lord) is not able to protect himself; how can be protect others ?', I am incapable of protecting myself and those who are said to be mine, independently (of the Lord) or for the sake of myself as the main person interested in it." Just as the wise Uparicharvasu Balways felt that bis soul, bis kingdom, bis wealth, his wife, and his vehicles were all for Bhagavan, we should also say, "I and what is mine are His. The responsibility of protecting these is also that of the Lord who is the universal Protector" for it is said : " the surrender of the responsibility for one's self and of what is one's is called ütmanikshepa." " There is no one other than Bhagavan who is capable of affording protection ". The fruit of this protection should also be considered primarily His, for it bas been said, "Ärmas nikshept consists (also) in giving up all rela. tionship to the fruit resulting from His protection and surrender ing it (vix the fruit) to Kesava "who is the chief beneficiary". 1.

PERFORMANCE OF PRAPATTI 

129 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

To all seekers of moksha (whether bhaktas or prapannas), the surrender of one's svarüpa or self and the rest (i.e) the fruit in common. To one who has no other upāya ((i.e.) prapannā) and is therefore akinchand, the surrender of the responsibility of protection (bharanyása ) is an additional angi. To all prapannas, whatever may be the object desired by them, the surrender of the responsibility is cominon. To those prapannas who are desirous of (only) moksha, the surrender of one's self or svartipa and also of the fruit arising therefrom is an additional (requirement). 

IS WARA IS THE PRINCIPAL BENEFICIARY : 

If it is asked how, when the Jiva who performs prapatti as the upaya for the sake of some gain or fruit is the person interes. ted in the fruit, Iswara becomes the chief beneficiary, the answer is as follows:-Iswara becomes the chief beneficiary, because, just like the modifications of acit or matter, the benefits (purushär. thas) granted by Him to cit (jiva) are pleasing to Him. Being the seshi of all, He is the chief beneficiary. To a man of culti vated tastes, who is not in need of anything, the delight in melting dolls made of metals and shaping them into ornaments and wear. ing them in admiration of their beauty is not different (in kind) from the delight enjoyed by him in keeping & sentient being like a parrot in a cage and feeding it with milk and seeing it fly accord ing to His pleasure. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA 

Tuerefore, ātmasamarpanam (the surrending of the self to the Lord for protection) means here the realisation of the self as existing solely for the purpose of the Saviour and that to such an extent that the self feels no further responsibility, whatever, for its own protection and this should be accompanied by the knowledge that the fruits of such surrender are not one's own.

The purport of the sloka in Alavandar's Stotra (52) which says "Whatever I may be in the body, the senses and the like, and whatever may be the qualities of my Dature, I who know that I am Thy sesha hereby surrender myself at this very moment at thy two lotus-like feet" -- the purport of this sloka is as follows: 

If a man has (somehow) come into possession of a cloth bag with the king's seal op it, he would return the bag (to the king), even though he does not know for certain the nature and character of the gem contained within it, in the hope that the king would take it back. So also even those who have not the intelligence to know, with perfect clearness, the nature, character and state of the soul as distinguished from the body may surrender their self or soul with the little knowledge that they possess. If they do so, even for that much, Bhagavan will be prepared to remit the punishment for the theft consisting in making away with one's self (i. e. clain ing it as one's own) from beginningless time. This idea contained in the sāstras is what (Alavandar) has in mind. In the next *sloka (53) it might appear as if he revoked the surrender (made before); but its meaning is only this : Even when & person is bent on sorren. dering his self without a knowledge of such things as the nature of bis self, if he surrendere it with the notion that it is his owo, like the presentation to a king of something belonging to oneself, it would not completely put an end to the crime of having stolen one's self. It does not mean that Alavandar considered his self. surrender made in sloka 52 in accordance with the injunctions contained in the sāstras, as having been made in ignorance. 

So from these two slokas, it is clear that the essence of the sāstras which priiparily prescribe bharasamarpanam as in the words of Alavandar (60) "The responsibility of protecting me is also Thine", consists in saying "a mania “It is not mine" and getting rid of the feeling of ope's connection (with everything), though one may not have & true and discriminatory knowledge about such things as the essential nature of the self. 

NOTE: "However O lord, what can I surrender to Thee, O Madhava, when I know that I and whatever belongs to me are always thine. As I have notbing of my own, I have nothing to surrender, I am only giving Thee what belongs to Thec",

THE MEANING OF THE ANGI IN DVAYAM : 

Thus in the first part of the Dvaya which deals with the upaya or means, the surrender to the Lord of the responsibility (for one's protection) accompanied by the thought that one is s'esha to the Lord and exists only for Him is to be understood in connection with the verb (prapadye) joined with the word s'aranam which treats of the upaya preceded by supreme faith ( mahavisvāsa ) and which contains within it, in an implicit form, the sapplication for protection. 

Thus (from what has been said in this chapter and in the foregoing chapters ), although these six (the five angas and the angī) may be understood separately, while considering, in detail, the meaning of each part of the sentence, yet they constitute only a single mental act while anderstanding the whole sentence, just like the understanding of other sentences having several parts. Therefore, in accordance with the s'astras, this principal action with its angas is performed only once. 

PRAPATTI IS A MOMENTARY ACTION. 

An archer's action in discharging an arrow for bitting a target may be constituted of several separate acts (like observing the object, taking the aim and discharging the arrow) and yet it is all accomplished in a single moment. Similar is the act of sarren. dering (to the Lord) the responsibility of (one's) protection. This is evident from the sruti itself. (The sruti says, "* Pra nava (aum) is the bow: the soul or self is the arrow; it must be discharged at Brahman, which is the target, with great care and with keen concentration ". 

That this surrender of the responsibility of protection (bhara. samarpana) should be chiefly thought of while uttering the 

. 

* Mundaka Upanishad II-4132 OHAPTER 

mantras of prapatti is clearly stated as follows in Satyaki tantra by the Saviour Himself, who undertakes the responsibility: "With this mantra one sbould surrender one's self to me. The one who has surrendered to me the responsibility of doing what should be done will become one who has done one's daty." 

A BRIEF STATEMENT OF WHAT BHARASAMARPANA IS: 

In (the performance of) this (angī), the conclusion regarding the adoption of this upāya with its angas is as follows it consiste in the act of surrendering the responsibility for the protection of one's self preceded by the following:--the giving up of the thought that one is the doer (for it is the Lord that does everything), the giving up of the thought of 'mine' (that there is anything belong ing to oneself), the giving up of the fruit of the action, the giving ap of the thought that he himself adopts the means for obtaining that fruit; these must be accompanied by anukūlya sankalpa, pratiktlyavarjana and the rest and, likewise, reverent bowing down to the succession of gurus and with the utterance of Dvaya. The surrender of the responsibility for the protection of one's self carries with it implicity the surrender of one's Svarupa or self and the fruit or gain arising from it. 

The giving up of the thought that one is the doer will result from the realisation of one's entire dependance on the Lord throughout the existence of the soul. This will make one know that this doership has been vouchsafed to one by the Lord Hiinself. 

The giving up of the thought of "MINE' (mama) and of the fruit (of prapatti) will arise from the knowledge that one, as well 88 what belongs to one, exists, by one's very nature, solely for the fulfilment of the purposes of Bhagavan alone. 

The giving up of the upaya for attaining the fruit (moksha) will result from & knowledge that the prapatti performed by a man for winning the grace of the Saviour cannot directly and immediately be the cause of the main fruit, namely, moksha, that 

PERFORMANCE OF PRAPATTI 

198 

prapatti is non-sentient and, therefore, incapable of possessing the will to grant the fruit and that only Iswara is the upāya for this fruit (moksha). Since Bhagavad who, out of the love natural to Him, has been the primeval cause of everything from the time of giving the man the body and the senses to the time of his utter. ing the Duaya-since Bhagavan is possessed of the will accompanied by the desire to show His grace and is the immediate and direct cause of the final fruit, vix moksha) and since he also stands Himself in the place of the prescribed upāya in the case of the man who is incapable of (adopting) other upāyas, He alone is the upāya for the fruit. The authority for this conclusion is the nature of the object, (namely, Bhagavan) es understood from the s'āstra which reveals the Person who has that nature and this authority cannot be challenged by reason. 

NADATHUR AMMĀL'S SUMMARY OF THE MEANING OF 

PRAPATTI : 

The following is a summary of the performance of prapatti with its angas as given by Sri Nadathur Ammal: 

"I have been wandering in samsära by doing, from beginning less time, what is displeasing to Thee. From this day onwards, I will do what is pleasing (to Thee). I will not do what will displease (Thee). I have no capital with which to attain Thee, I have made up my mind to seek only Thee as the upāya. Be Thou my upāya! Hereafter, either in the removal of what is evil or in the attainment of what is good, I have no further responsibility from now onwards". In this the determination to do what is pleasing and abstinence from what is displeasing have to be stated only once as accessories or angas to the upāya. His acting later in accordance with this determination to do what is pleasing etc. will be the result or fruit of the upāya and will last as long as bis self lasts. If, in accordance with the words of Sri Ammal, we take the avoidance of what is displeasing as meaning only the determi. nation to avoid what is displeasing, it is evident that it has to be made only once (i.c at the time of prapatti). It is true that it has 

134 OR APTER 

been said :-"I have dissociated myself from sids which cast one into samsāra." (But it may be explained in this way :-) The avoidance of what is displeasing may meen either having no connection (at all) with it (i...) giving it up or the determination to avoid it. In either case, this is, at the first iostant, an anga and the actual avoidance is the result or fruit of prapatti which follows afterwards. This holds good also in regard to visvāsa or faith. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Doing what is pleasing (to the Lord) and avoiding what is displeasing (in one's life after prapatti) are the result of meritorious deeds done in the past, and also the determination made at the time of performing prapatti. 

Therefore wise are they who perform prapatti in order to render faultless service during their life-time and to attain moksha after casting off the body resulting from prärabdha karma, 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Our princely Acharyas, who wear the crown of proficiency in the Vedas, have placed us for protection under the feet of the Lord, who, from beginningless time, has resolved, in His great compassion, to save us; they have done so in order that there may be no further responsibility in ourselves (for our protection), by saying to us, "Do not forget the truth that the Lord, who is the sool of the world, will protect you who are related to Him as s'esha (existing solely for His purposes)," 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The horse, the chariot and the charioteer -- the end of the Vedas (the Upanishads) shows that the three tattvas, cit, acit, and

Iswara are related to one another respectively like the thres mentioned above and have always had varied activities in accordance with their respective nature. In connection with these activities, all the three are of the nature of being the material) causes; two, cit and Iswara, are of the nature of doers, and ope (1.) Iswara is alone independent (of all others). Therefore the jiva, kbe responsibility for whose protection bas been undertaken by Iswara who is the Master, is carefree and has no further responsibility of his own in the matter of his protection. 

(13) THE CHAPTER ON THE MAN WHO HAS DONE 

WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE (1. E.) PRAPATTI. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA. 

When Bhagavan, who is omnipotent, who knows all things and who is, by His nature, full of love for us, has accepted the res. ponsibility (of protecting us ), there is nothing more remaining to be done by us here for it; let us therefore fix our souls in that boundless sex of supreme bliss and feel the satisfaction (of having attained our object) by becoming rich in rendering service to Him, poor though we may have been before. 

THE PRAPANNA HAS DONE WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO 

AND HAS ATTAINED HIS GOAL: 

(1) The man who has adopted this upāya (prapatti) has, from the time when he adopted it, nothing else to do for attaining the fruit thereof. (2) What he had to do has been done by per forming prapatti once; (3) (Bhagavan) who is independent (of all others), whose will is irresistible and who is the one that rewards us with the fruit (of our actions) saya, "Do not grieve t," Owing to these (three) reasons, the prapanna would become care-free at the thought of having surrendered bis bhara. Since the Lord of all who has been accepted as the upāya*, wbich is ever present as stated in. "Seek refuge under me alone", has said "I will release Thee from all sins", and since the Lord can (always) be trusted and since He is capable (of acting according to His word), he would bave no doubts or fears in regard to the realisa tion of his object. So he (the prapaia) would rejoice at baving given up even the slightest trace of other aing or objects and also with baving given up other upüyas along with upayas which are subsidiary to them. Like a poor man who has received a great treasure with little effort, he would rejoice at the prospect of the

supreme goal (of life ) which he is to attain. It has been said: "Hel who has sougbt, in every possible manner, the refuge of Narayana who is the Saviour and the guru of the world is not the servant of the gods, of the rishis, of animals, of men and of the pitris. He is in no way their debtor". In regard to such jivas (kshetrajnas) as have taken the names of Prajapati (the Lord of creatures ) and Pasupati (the Lord of beasts, vis. bound souls), he is able, like one whose promissory note registered in the un. written Vedas under certain conditions (upādhi relating to caste etc.) and requiring service as interest for the principal ( borrowed by bim from them) has been fully discharged (torn off). There fore when he has to pronounce their names in the performance of *such compulsory and regularly recurrent and occasional rites 46 the five great yajnas (Panchamaha yajnas), he would realise that these dames refer really to Isware (Bhagavan) etymologically: as has been stated by the sages in passages like :-" Those who worship the pitris (the spirits of their fore-fathers), the gods, the Brahmins and Agoi - they (in reality) wore bip only Vishnu, who is the Ioner Self of all beings." When the kiog's servants place a garland and a jewel on the coat worn by the king, their object is not to please the coat but to gain the favour of the king. 

The same idea has been expressed in such places as the chapter called Yajnagrahara in the Mahabharata* (Ch. 349 Santi Parva) and in Hastigiri Māhātniya. In the Brahma Sutras algo (1-2-29), it is said : "Since words like Agni refer directly also to Brabman, Jaimini is of opinion that there is nothing unreasonable in it". Such words as gods and pitris have no connection with the coats called gods and pitris and by the full significance contained in their 

NOTE:- The idea is that Prajapati, Pasupati. Agni and others are only like the coat of a king and that, within them, there is the Inner Ruler, Immortal, who alone is Parameswara or the Supreme Ruler. 

1. Bhagavatam: 11-5-41 2. Mahabharata: Santiparva: 355-24 

• Mahabbarata: Santiparva: Chapter 349: "The Great Padmanabha receives the quintessences of all the offerings made in sacrifices" and when the gods asked Brahma who was performing a sacrifice to Bhagavao be replied: "Neither by me nor by any one else who wants to cross the sea of samsara are you adored with sacrifices. It is only Bhagayan who receives our offerings**. 

188 

SRIMAD RAHASYARTAYASARA 

CHAPTER 

parts (i.c.) etymology or derivation, they stand for Iswara (Bhagai van), in the same way A8 words like Narayana do. In pronouncing such words (Prajapati, Pasupati, Agni), the prapanna would realise that there is no violation of his sole and exclusive devotion to Bhagavan, in the same way as, when the pare Bacrificers (s'uddhayaji) who live in Swetadvipa pronounce the word Narayana (Nārānamayanam), they do not go against their exclusive devotion to Bhagavad by using the word NāraBhagavad has willed to accept him as His servant to render service in accordance with his varna, asrama, occasions (like the birth of a child) and qualities (like being a Vaishnava). Therefore by service to Him who is the Ruler and the Seshi . service which consists in obedient performance of His commands and permissions as understood from the Sāstras, the prapanna would do his little bit of service like the freed souls who understand the mind of the Lord by direct perception and be like the muktas; he would be extolled, according to the Sastras and those who stand by them, as one who, by the completion of the upāya (prapatti), has done his duty and who, by the completion of his aim in life, has attained satisfaction. 

Sri Ramanuja has conclusively described the prapanna's reflection on his satisfactory fulfilment of his duty thus in his Saranagati gadya :-"Therefore rest happy in the assurance free from all doubt that you will know me, see me, and attain me As I truly am". This is what it means:-"We were wandering in samsāra owing to Bhagavan's punishment inflicted on us for transgressing His commands from beginningless time. By the compassion of Bhagavad ever waiting for an opportunity (to save us), we came into the reach of the kind glances of our good acharyas and by repeating after them their utterance of Duaya, we have completed our prapatti. There is no further means needed for obtaining the Saviour. Therefore He will pardon (all the sins) which were the cause of the punishment. The Lord of Sri (Lakshmi) who is the seshi of all and who is capable of purity. ing His devotees and obtaining their service, will, for His own glory, protect us. With this faith, the prapanna would be free 

13 

ONE WHO HAS DONE ONE'S DUTY 

139 

from all care or anxiety or responsibility." (This is the purport of Sri Ramanuja's words in the Gadya). This idea is the conclu. sive meaning which is surely contained also in the Saviour's words "Do not grieve" (in the charama sloka ). 

THE MARKS OF ONE WHO HAS PERFORMED 

PRAPATTI : 

Since one of the qualifications for the performance of prapatti, is sorrow or grief before prapatti, if he had no grief before, he would not have the necessary qualification for performing prapatti. So by the principle "when there is no cause, there is no effect," bis npaya (prapatti) will not be effective. If, after the performance of prapatti, he grieves owing to want of faith in the words of the Saviour, it would follow by the principle "When the effect is absent, there must have beeu absence of all the required materials (or causes)" that his upüya is incomplete (owing to want of full faith) and that the benefit or fruit will be delayed inasmuch as it will require the cowpletion of the upāya. The man who was formerly full of grief and who is now free from sorrow in accor. dance with the words" Do not grieve" may be considered to have done what should be done (i.) prapatti in the proper manner, 

TAMIL; VERSE: 

Our spiritaal leaders whom the Lord of Sri that dwells on Hastigiri has taken into His protection after endeavouring for & long time to find out what boon He should confer on those who loved Him. they are like kings and gods (to us), for they have, ever in their minds, the abode of the Lord of the eternal süris and they are like Paramahamosas, because they have completed all rites that have to be performed, (or like swans in their purity or in their capacity to separate the essential from the non-essential). 

140 SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Bharanyāsa (or the surrender of the responsibility of protec tion) has been made (at the feet of) Bhagavan (Hari) for reach ing beyond samsāra. So also actions that can produce only limited pleasures have been given up just like forbidden actions. The sustenance of the body will continue in accordance with past karma (which has begun to operate). 80 nothing need be done for it. Thereafter (i.c) after prapatti the bounds* imposed by the Lord's command are scrupulously observed by wise men, (merely because it is the Lord's command.) 

NOTE:-* This means that the nirya and naimittika karmas which are ordained by the Lord in the Sastras have still to be performed after prapatti, as, otherwise, there would be transgression of His command. 

(14) THE CHAPTER ON THE MARKS OR SIGNS BY WHICH ONE CAN RECOGNISE THAT ONE IS 

IN THE PROPER STATE OR NISHTA. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA. 

To a man whose understanding is firmly and properly fixed on (a koowledge of) bis essential nature, on the upāya adopted by bim, viz. brapatti and on the ultimate aim of life (purushürtha), & recognition that he is steadily fixed in this state gives more delight (even) than his approaching moksha. For by the might of this knowledge, he is able, with a disciplined mind, to close up the chasms lying before him (as obstacles) which are deep and hard to fill and which are as immense as the sky, 

I. Signs or marks regarding nishta in Svartpa 

How can a man kaow that he has firm faith or mishta (in regard to the knowledge of svariipa?) The answer is as follows: (1) when he is treated with such things as contumely by others, he would be free from sorrow or depression owing to the knowledge that these faults pertainiog to the body and the like (ugliness, low birth etc) have no connection (at all) with his essential nature, (2) It bas been said:-"When one man' reviles another, the sin of the reviled person passes on to the reviler". So towards these fools that are to receive his sin by their derisive talk, he (the prapanna) should feel over-whelming campassion as stated in such slokas as the following - "If other created beings harbour enmity and show hatred, the wise man pities them saying, "How wrapped up they are in great delusion!" and "One should very much pity the fool who does evil to himself by violating the süstras and straying from the right path and who is, therefore, like firewood destined for the flames of hell.” (8) The prapanna 

1. Mahabharata: Aswamedhika 

parva: 110-64. 

2. Vishnu purana: 1-17-82. 3. Ayurveda ?142 CHAPTER 

would feel grateful to these revilers as being benefactors who remind him, by their censure, of faults which have been described in Alaya dar's *sloka and in such verses as those of Tirumangai Alvar as fit to be reflected on in connection with oneself. (4) The prapanna (who has the nishta in svarvpa) would understand that all souls are dependent on Bhagavan owing to their essential nature, that all jivas (kshetrajnas) are under the sway of past karma and that these revilers of his (therefore) revile him by the prompting of lewara, who is independent and is the seshi of all and who enjoys the līlā which follows from past karma in the relations between him and his revilers. He would therefore feel no aversion to them: (5) He would rejoice that his past sins which have begun to operate in this life are now being worked out in part. If he has these marks or characteristics as clarified in the explanation of the meaning of the first word (pranava) and the middle word na mama (namo) in the Moolamantra, the prapanna may consider that he has realised his difference from acit or matter, that he possesses knowledge which will enable him to act beneficially towards all beings, that he feels his being destitute of upāyas of any kind, that he knows his existing solely for the fulfil ment of the purposes of Bhagavan and is entirely dependent on him and should therefore do what is pleasing to the Lord, who, by His very nature, is impartial, who rewards (or punishes), each according to his karma, and who is the independent s'eshi for whom all else exist and that he understands that bis good can arige only from the will of another (ie) the Lord, as has been pointed out in the s'loka; “Where am I'who am so full of evil thoughts? Where is the possibility of my seeking what is good to me? 

NOTE:- Alawandar's sloka: 62. "How can I ever cross the sea of Sorrow and render service at Thy feet - I who have transgressed all the regula tions of the sastras who am mean, fickle-minded, cavious, ungrateful, arrogant, lustful, deceitful, wicked and sinful?"

Direot me to do 

Therefore, O Thou, that controllest the gods! whatever is good for me, O Madhava!" 

II THE NISHTĀ CONCERNING UPAYA : 

II, in him, these features that follow are found, the man who has performed prapatti may infer that he is in the proper state in relation to the knowledge concerning the upāya (1) He under. stands that, for bim, there is no protection from himself or from others and that Iswara is bis only Protector : (2) Though he is confronted with causes of fear even to the extent of death, he does not bewail his state and feels satisfied as at the approach of what is desirable, for it has been said: "People are 'generally afraid of Death because they have not done what they should have done ; those who have done what they should do expect Death as if he were & welcome guest" (3) He has the perfect confidence of having found a Saviour. Sita Devi taught this by her example. "The beautiful Sita, resting on the arm of Sri Rama, was not afraid at the sight of the elephant, the lion or the tiger (when she was with him in the forest)" She said to Ravana:-O Thou '(Rakshasa) with ten heads that deservest to be reduced to ashes! because I have not obtained Sri Rama's permission and because I have to cherish my tapas as a pativrată (a wife devoted to her husband), I do not burn thee to ashes by the flame (of my chastity) and likewise, "if Rama who can destroy the forces of bis enemies fills Lanka with his arrows and take me away from here, it will be in keeping with bis character." In respect of the object for which he has made bharanyasu, the prapanna is without any further) effort of his own (to save himself). In that matter, he realises that the removal of what is evil and the attainment of what is good are in the Lord's hands alone. If he has these features, it may be inferred that he is steadfastly fixed in the upāya which be has sought and which is the means of obtaining all the benefits desired

by him, which is prescribed as an upaya in the first half of the Charama sloka, which is to be thought of in the first part of Dvaya and which is implicit also in the middle word of Tirumantra (namo). 

III THE NISHTĀ CONCERNING PURUSHĀRTHA: 

It has been said: "Of the three, your birth, continuance and perishing, why should you be anxious only about your continuance? In the same way as birth and death come of the uselves (without any choice being left to you), your continuance in life also will not depend on anything done by you" and again: "The "goddess of Lak. shmi comes, of her own accord, to one who does not exert himself in any way. Another man who makes efforts does not obtain even the food (he wants). This is in accordance with past karna". The prapan. na whose anderslanding is firinly fixed in the purushūrtha would not feel anxious in relation to such things as the maintenance of the body.which are directed by Iswara in accordance with particular acts of past karma that have begun to operate in this life. He would reflect that, even if he grieved or felt anxious about these things, pothing would bappen except according to the will of God, as stated in the following passages:- "Though he "flies in the air, or enters the lower world, called Rasatala, or wanders about the whole earth, a man will not obtain what is not ordained for him" and again, “Whatever work is done in the world is work done by me. So others propose but I dispose." When things not forbidden in the yāstras come to him without any seeking of his and by the will of God, the prapanna realises that the debt which has resulted from past karma that has begun to operate is now being discharged. Therefore he enjoys them withont trying to avoid them. For it has been said in Parāsaragita and elsewbere - "House-bolders should receive whatever comes to them without any exertion on their part. As regards their dharmas, on the other hand, it is my opinion that they should, in all possible ways, exert themselves

145 

and fulfil them”, and so also, “The "wise man should not be apxious about his food. He should think oply of his dharma. Man's food comes to him along with his birtb." Liko-wise it has been stated in Ajagaropakhyāna :-"I do "pot avoid enjoymente wbich come to me of themselves and which are also in keeping with (my) dharma nor do I seek any enjoyment which can be had only with painful effort." 

The prapanna who has attained nishta in purushärtha has neither pleasure nor pain, when he meets with or fails to get objects asually desired other than moksha, as taught in the follow ing slokas :-"When one of these two, pleasure and pain, arrives, one should not feel delighted on seeing pleasure nor feel sorrow when one sees pain", and "The man who meditates on the feet of the Lord is not elated at the possession of wealth, nor does he feel dispirited when what he possesses is lost." He has, on the other hand, a great longing for service to the Lord which is suited to bis essential nature and which is the supreme aim of his life. This urgent longing for the object to be gained will make him cry out as in Alavandar's Stotram und in Sri Ramanuja's gadya, "When, when sball I see, face to face, Bhagavan Narayana? When shall I press his two lotus-like feet on my head?" When such conduct and feeling are seen in the prapanna, it may be inferred that his mind is firmly fixed in regard to the supreme and infinite goal of existence which is indicated, as (an infinitesimal part of) the sea is by the finger, in the dative Nārāyarāya in Tirumantra, in the dative Nārāyaḥāya and in the word namas in Dvaya and in the sentence "I shall release thee from all sing" in Charama sloka, 

Thus by observing these signs in himself, the man may realise that he is well established in the state of a true prapanna in regard to his essential Dature (svarupa), bis upūya and his supreme aim (purushärtha) as stated in the slokeI am a self, not & body; I am the s'esha who exists only for Lord; I have

146 

· no possessions of my own; I have songht His protection with the desire to render service to Him" and as understood also from Tirumantra and the like. To the prapanna who has seen in himself these sigos, there will be no causes of fear confronting bim other than offence to those who know Brahman, which might occur (88 & possibility) on account of his living in the midst of enemies (the body and the senses), nor sources of delight other than the service which suits his essential nature. (This may be seen in the case of Sita devi) of whom it is said, "Sita' does not look at these Rakshasis; she does not look at these trees full of flowers and fruits. Her heart is fixed on one alone and she sees only Sri Rama". If by chance, these (other canses of fear and sources of delight) come before him, he will have neither fear por delight. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Those who have become well-established in their knowledge of the three things shown in the Tirumantra (namely, svarüpa, upāya, and purushārtha) will never agree to do what is improper and will do only what is proper. They are really wise men who find, in thevoselves, these attitudes and actions and they may be called eternal sūris living on the earth.

In the interval between this life of worldly enjoyment and life after moksha - ( an interval) which may be compared to a mingling of the state of sleep and the waking state ---some destiny has placed prapannas for a time and they pass the rest of their lives wearing, on their heads, the garland of their nishtă in regard to tatva, upāya, and purushärtha, which has been vouchsafed to them by the Lord.

(15) THE CHAPTER ON THE MANNER IN WHICH ONE SHOULD CONDUCT ONESELF 

AFTER PRAPATTI. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The prapanna, with his eyes fixed on the absence of his own responsibility (bhara) in regard to both what is seen in this life and what is to come hereafter, follows, until the fall of his body, a course of action which is faultless and agreeable ( observing the code of conduct prescribed for his varna and his asrama) and for the sake of delight (in the enjoyment of the auspicious qualities of Bhagavan ) frequently studies Vedanta with good men, teaches the sweet and noble utterances (of such as Alvars ), always and also listens to them. 

THE CODE OF CONDUCT SUITED FOR A PRAPANNA: 

The man who has thus done what he should do and insers his proper attainment of nishta (in svarūpa, upāya and purushärtha) should follow the line of conduct described hereunder as long as he lives, like a farmer who, out of a big field fit for use in the adora tion of the Lord, gives up a large part and reserves only a small fraction of it as enough for his needs. This adhikari, Damely, the prapanna, who has given up his connection with many things and is still connected with certain things (like the body) should follow & line of conduct wbich would be most delightful like the successive services rendered by released souls (in heaven). This line of conduct is an end in itself; it has been prescribed for him in the sāstras as required to be done (in certain specific divisions of time); it is a form of service connected by links to the service wbich is to follow immediately after and is the means of winning the favour of the Master and is also its effect. The following passages indicate this line of conduct; - "I read" the books which describe the attributes and qualities of Bhagavan; I listened

to other people reading them, I bowed to Him, I worshipped Him always and performed service to Him and thus saw to it that my time was not spent in vain". "Men should get rid of their sorrow wbich is as deep as the sea on account of past karma surrounding the soul, by meditating on those passages which reveal the Lord's qualities. If they should not do so, by what other thought can they get rid of their sorrow wbile in samsāra p" "We should, without intermission render service to the Lord in all places and in all circumstances and at all times". "If the Lord is so gracious as to eaable me to spend my time always with the passages which describe His qualities in my mouth, with His form alluring the eye and other senses in my mind, and with flowers fit enough for His form in my hands - if I find this grace, what is there uppleasant for me wbile living here? "I wasó born to seek flowers that are hard to obtain in order that they may be placed at the Lord's feet" “May I, the sidner that I am, press the tender feet of the Lord wbich are gently pressed by the incomparably beautiful Lakshmi and the other, viz, the goddess of the Earth!” “Tbis is the only object that I desire – that the Lord should take me into His service for His own satisfaction". "We will 'render service, O Lord, only to Thee". "If the Lord 'will be so gracious as to let us gently press His feet in the place where He sleeps'' "My fingers will keep couni wben I utter the names of the Lord." "The days of my starvation are not those on which I do not eat - (they are) the days, if ever they occur, on which I do not constantly meditate saying "nāmo Nārāyana" and the days on which I do not approach Thy feet with the three Vedas wbich are (as it were) freshly blossomed flowers".

"My mouth 18 does not praise any one but Him", "My "shoulders do not bow to any one but Him", "I 18 will not look upon my soul which belongs to the Lord as my own, nor will I remain in the company of those mean persons who think so," "May 'Thon be so gracious as to make me over meditate on Thee ", " When will u? these two eyes of mine delight in looking at the forehead of the Lord where the two gems that shed light shine dispelling dark ness?" "I do not long for birth accompanied with wealth that (only) makes the flesh grow but pray to be born as a bird in the Venkata Hills".

These are the ways of service after prapatti which are in keeping with one's essential nature (svarūpa) in spending the time. 

THE PRAPANNA SHOULD SEEK 

SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE: 

Further the prapanna should not remain complacently ignorant of what should be known to one in that state, in the pre sumption that he has already done what should be done. In the state of perfect enjoyment of the Lord, knowledge and love are (both ) essential. Therefore in accordance with the sloka, "One *should never beg of the Lord anything but knowledge and love for His holy feet. The man who begs (for other things ) will surely perish ", there is nothing improper in desiring knowledge and love of the Lord. It has been said :- "The Lord of the yellow raiment has incarnated as the guru to teach the Veda." So the prapanna should learn from such gurus possessed of exclusive devotion to the Lord and having a clear knowledge of (the truth ). He should obtain clear knowledge from them by following the injunction contained in the sloka - "Bow to "$ your guru, place your doubts before bim and render service to him, (then) learn from him the true nature of the self. (Your) acharyas will teach you the truth concerning the self." He should have his knowledge readered clear and pure, for (the poet) says, "Even a man "that is dull becomes intelligent by seeking the company of the wise. Muddy water becomes clear and pare by being mixed with the lather from soapnut." It has been said, "He whose 80 knowledge of the truth (concerning Bhagavan ) extends up to the enjoyment 25.

of the Lord all those who fall within the range of his eyes will be purified of all their sins." So the prapanna should live in close contact with such as are well established in this knowledge. As stated (in the Gita):- "In a stank which is intended for all and for various purposes, one should take only as much (of the water) his is required for one's purposes", the prapanna should deter. mine what he should choose, from among their ways of life and conduct, what is in accordance with his varna, bis asrama, his gotra, his character and the like and conduct himself in keeping with that deterwination and should walk warily last be should fall into the pitfall of thinking of bis own superiority and the inferiority of others, which might arise from his conceit while observing this code of conduct. 

Even if, as it occurred to such as Nammalyar and Natha munigal, he is blessed with the special grace of the Saviour so as to enjoy the rise of such benefits as the vision (of the Lord), he sbould feel sure (that it is not due to aay merit of his own) as said in, "I do not* know wbat is good and what is bad”, and "Even if I know what is good and what is evil, I cannot obtain what is good and avoid what is evil" He should see to it that his be. ing destitute of all upāyas (Akinchanya) which is due to his svarüpa, his maintenance (sthithi) and his activities (pravritti) being entirely dependent (on the Lord) does not suffer any change or loss. He should remember his atter helplessness (kärpanya ) as described in the sloka “I Ham the abode of all transgressions, I have no means of protecting myself and I have nothing else to attain than Thee", and in such verses as "I have not been observing the code of the disciplined life, nor bave I keen intel ligence", "What *can I do? "May my * misery be put an end to by Thee ! If thou dost not do so, there is no one else to protect

"We are such " ignorant women belonging to the race of cowherds as eat in forests while grazing the cows there", "I bave "given up the rites pertaining to Brahmins of worshipping the three fires after ablutions", "I was not born into any of the four castes wherein one is fit to follow dharma", "I am ignorant and of low birth", "I "have no one to seek for support". "Even if s Thou dost not remove from me the sufferings due to karma, I have no other refage than thee," "I have not " practised karma yoga; I have not understood the real nature of the disembodied self (i.e) I have not performed Jinayoga, por bave I bhakti towards Thy holy feet.” (In these Tamil verses and Sanskrit slokas, the feeling of helplessness is well depicted and the prapanna should realise his owo helplessness by remembering such Verses). 

Owing to the knowledge of his own unfitness from time imme. morial and the loss of the Lord's service which resulted from it, which may canse excessive disgust, the prapanna should not fall into despair which makes one lament in the words of the Alvar saying, “The nature of the man in samsāra is sach that be identifies himself with the perishing body and calls it "I"; from it arises alao evil conduct and from it arises again the body that is foul". (Without falling into despair ), he should hearten himself with the succeeding words there :- "O" Lord of the immortals, Thou wast born into all castes and even from the wombs of animals in Thy eagerness to protect the Jivas!" He sbould comfort himself

with the words of the Saviour who appears in front to save bim - the words which are wholesome and sweet like mother's milk (such as * For the protection of the good and the destruction of the wicked and so also for the establishment of dharma, I am born again and again in every yuga." He should bathe, as it were, in the words (of Bhagavan) which reveal the secret of the avatārs and take courage (from passages like the following) :- "Whatever a man may have been in the past, it be lives a righteous life in his old age, it will do hina good; his evil deeds in the past will do him no harm" and "A man nugy have been wicked in his past life; he may have fed on anything (however impure ); he may have been ungrateful; he may have been a sceptic; ia spite of all that, if he earnestly seeks the protection of the Lord, who is the cause of the world, know that that man is faultless owing to the Lord's greatness ", " In one half of an instant, a jiva commits a sin which cannot be expiated even in the course of ten thousand kalpas of Brabma. But Thou pardopest him if only he gives up the thought of sioning (again), even though he has transgressed. How wonderful this is !" "The past." is past, what can we do concerning it? The wise man should think of erecting the dam. even when the water is flowing," " It is good to die after per. forming prapatti to the Lord at least in the dying moments" 

In accordance with this principle, the prapania 'should not lament for what is past and without running away at the thought of bis past unfitness, he should make himself fit for the future by reflecting on the present fitness which has resulted from the infi. nite greatness of the Saviour which brooks no questioning, like those who construct a dam for the water that will come up in the future; he should not stray from the path of performing the commands and permissions of the Lord which are in keeping with his present state as & prapanna.

ing the Lord should be rendered fit (to enjoy Him) by means of pure food and service and directed towards such (spiritual) expe riences as are available and turned away from the desire for uawholesome objects, like cows that are turned away from steal. thily eating the crops. 

When people are waiting for the boat in order (to cross the stream) to go to a place of their desire, some of them may avoid playing chess or other game with stakes, as it could not be stopped whenever desired but may be engaged in playing the game without any stakes so that they might be in a position to give up the game (when the boat bas come). Though they play merely for the enjoyment (and not for money), they move the pawos (on the board) in strict accordance with the rules of the game. In the same way (though the prapanna does not expect any profit ont of it) he performs gladly the rites commanded and permitted by the Sapreme Ruler, which are really services to the Lord, in accordance with the specific time and place at which they are ordained for performance. (In performing them), be should resemble not those who drink milk for relief from excess of bile, but like those who have got well easily and quickly with the help of a medicine and who drink milk with pleasure (not as a cure for disease ). 

SERVICE TO ARCHĀ: 

While rendering this service, the prapanna should do such acts of service as are in keeping with the respective relationships between him and the Lord and with the Lord's supreme majesty and easy accesssibility; he should do these acts towards the images (archa) into which the Lord has incarnated for the sake of some devotees with exclusive devotion to Him; for it has been said : "He who "believea in the eternal forin and supreme majesty of the Lord -bim, O Poushkara, the Lord approaches," "In the same way as the water of the ocean taken up by the clouds and let fall

(as rain ) becomes fit to be enjoyed by all, Bhagavan whose image has been installed by devotees becomes fit to be served and enjoyed by others". "The six "qualities like Jnana are found in transcendent measure in the mantras and in the images (archa ). They are described in the mantras, and the qalities are found in Bhagavan, since He has, out of His compassion, chosen to abide in these images". This shows the fullness of perfection, "He who looks upon the Lord residing in the image as Purushottama and beholds Him (again and again) from the pedestal of the foot to the crown on the headbis five deadly sins (Mahāpātaka) are destroy ed quickly: Is it necessary to state that minor offences, too, perish ? This shows how supremely purificatory the archa is. And again it is said ;- "If mens of clouded intellects happen to see Bhaga van abiding in the archit even by mere chance, all the evil tendencies in them, such as the following, perish :- the thought that the body is the self; the false potion arising from it that he Bees the soul by perception; false conclusions arrived at by falla cious reasoning, false inferences resulting from wrong premises, false interpretations of scriptural texts and want of faith in the Sāstras." Thus the worship of the image (archa ) is a panacea for all mental diseases arising from a false understanding of cause and effect. 

The prapanna should meditate on the Lord's placing Himself at the disposal of those who seek His protection in a manner which cannot be understood by the mind or described in words, for it has been said, "Whoever wants to see me and in whatever form - to him I reveal myself in that very form." The same thing is stated also (in the Tamil verse) "He assumes the form desired by His devotees.” He should also meditate on the allaring beauty of the Lord of which (the Alvar) says "The eyesel that have seen the Lord will refuse to see other things."

done so, the prapanna should render service suited to the respect. ive relationships between him and the Lord (such as master and servant, father and son) and to His supreme majesty and easy accessibility, in accordance with the following verses :-"One** should render service to the Lord like a chaste matron to her beloved husband, like a mother to her suckling, like a disciple to his acharya and like a friend to his friend. The Lord of Lakshmi should always be looked opon as a master, as a friend, as an ācharya, as a father and as a mother", "One should serve the Lord with as much fear as one would approach a king who is youthful, and an elephant in rut. In the same way as one would entertain a welcome guest who has come to one's house, one should worship the Lord with devotion, reinembering His easy accessibility.” “One should treat the Lord with as much affec tion as one would a beloved child". 

Like Bharatalvan who conducted himself like & servant of a king before (Sri Rama's ) sandals and of wbom it is said, "While the sandals6 were ruling, Bharata placed, before them first, whatever business had to be transacted and whatever valnable tributes were brought and then accomplished whatever had to be done in the manner in which it should be done", — like him the prapanna should render service as to a king, with materials earned righteously. He should look upon this service as & wedded wife would look upon the careful custody of her sacred wedding - thread and the like. He should have the conviction that he has attained this ultimate aim of life, which begins from service to Bhagavan and extends up to the service to His devotees, by his relationship with his good Acharya : for it has been said: "Kshatrabandhu, the great sidner, and Pundarika the virtuous, both attained moksha by having Acharyas" So also has it been said (in Tamil) :- "Our ācharyastale like bees which place as at the (flower-like holy feet

of the Lord, who is our Master and who renders help to the eternal sūris" and "If ** Vishnuchittar ( Perialvar) who was born in the city of Villipattur and who was perfect in the qualities of the spirit, by some means in his power, make the Lord appear before us, we can see" (That is to say - without the grace of Vishoucitta, the ächürya, they cannot do anything themselves). The prapanna should feel grateful at the thought of the expansion of knowledge which the achiiryas have wrought in him and of such things as the service (of the Tord and His devotees) whicb have resulted from it. He should behave towards thein as towards the servants (of the palace) who light the lamps and keep them barning on the night before the coronation of the prince (as a token of their rejoicing). He should feel grateful also to the Lord at the thought of His innate compassion which is the common and primary cause of all these and wbich, in the state of mukti, removes the dreaded possi bility of a break in the enjoyment of Bhagavan wbose independent will cannot be questioned. For it has been said:-- "The Lord ** makes us climb up to Vaikunta through the centre of the sphere of the sun whose rays dispel darkness and He removes the ladder that helped to climb, so that there may be no coming back", and again, "If one goes to Vaikunta after performing prapatti by utteriog the words 'Namo mürana', He will not let one come back to the world of samsāra, even if one should furnish security for going back to Vaikunta". (Nammalvar) says: "The firm "feet of Nare. yana whose praise is upsarpassed" (the feet being firm, those who have caught hold of them can never slip down); and again "Bhagavan" is our Father who takes away from His devotees their future births, leads them to Vaikunta, helps the manifestation of their svarūpa or essential nature and sees to their ever remaining under His feet even like the lines on the soles (of His feet)", and further, "The Lord" looks after (our) welfare by taking as to His feet and by preventing our fall therefrom".

should feel gratefal to the Lord of Lakshmi, the s'eshi, whose will is ever absolute and who, even after moksha, shows the same compassion as during samsāra. (The Alvar describes this compas sion in the following words);- "By Thy" grace and the grace of Thy Spouse wbo lives in the lotus, I served at Tby temple of 

old" 

WHAT THE PRAPANNA SHOULD DO WITH HIS MIND, 

HIS SPEECH AND HIS BODY: 

About this code of conduct (of the prapanna) we will now state what is considered as the essence in regard to what should be avoided by the three senses viz the mind, the speech and the body and also in regard to what should be observed or followed by them: "Between poison (Visha) and the objects of sense (Vishaya) there is a great gulf of difference, for poison kills only the man who eats it, whereas objects of sense kill even at their mere thougbt." It has been said also, "Is it "fair on Thy part to delude my soul by showing before sinful me the various pleasures by which the senses allure me to my suffering ?" Therefore in order that the desire for the ultimate object of life may not languish, the most important among those that should be forgotten is the enjoyment of sense pleasures. In order that one may not become ungrateful, the chief thing that should be thought of is the assistance given to us by the acharya from the time bis glance first fell on us. In order that we may not lose the sense of helplessness, the chief thing that should be avoided in speech is the expression of our excellence. In order that one may not forget one's conviction in the upāya, the chief among the things that should be uttered is Dvaya; 48 (the Bhashyakara says) "?one should ever utter the Dvaya with an understanding of its meaning ". In order that Bbagavan who is entitled to receive our service with pleasure may not become dis. pleased at heart, the most important among those that should be

avoided by all the three senses is offence to those that know Brahman; 28 Andal says, “ We will never do what ought not to be done". In order that the ser of our supreme aim in life may not dry vp or become shallow, the most important among those things that should be done is service to the acharya and other devotees of Bhagavān as ordained in the Sastras and #8 forming the outer limit of the service of the Lord. 

This code of conduct which should be followed after prapatti and which is an end in itself should be considered in those parts of the three mysteries (mantras ) which indicate the benefit or fruit that results. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Our holy men who know the songs of the Tamil Veda with their meaning and who have discharged all their debts (to the gods, the pitris etc.) by the performance of prapatti accepted by Sri Krishna of the beautiful Dwaraka, enjoy, with delight, even in this world, that service which the mīktas and the siris perform without intermission and with eagerness in the world yonder. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Like a beloved wife who, in a big jewelled mirror, well-polished, sees her loviog husband by the side of her own image - her loving husband who has come behind her and stands beside her, and is at once transported into the ecstasy of love and enjoys his presence with the scattering of flowers that spread their fragrance all round - (like that beloved wife ) good men, whose wealth consists in their prapatti, see the Supreme lord in the great mantra (Tiro. mantra) which has frequently been meditated upon and enjoy Him with loving service similar to fragrant flowers. 

77. Tiruppavai: 2 

(16) THE CHAPTER ON THE FARTHEST EXTENT 

OF OUR ULTIMATE OBJECT IN LIFE. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

In the world of everyday life (a king sometimes uses his dependents and ornaments to serve the purposes of those who are dear to bim like bis sons, wives etc.) and in the Vedas, it is declared that all the gods make their offeriogs to the devotee. Even 80, the Lord of Lakshmi uses sentient beings and non-sentient things to serve for ever the purposes of those who have won His regard, because He is independent and is their Master. So, for us whose minds have been disciplined by the teaching of such as the prince of sannayasins (viz. Sri Ramanuja), the service of the Lord extends as far as the service of those wbo are dear to Him (Bhagavatas). 

• 

REASONS FOR RENDERING SERVICE 

TO BHÄGAVATĀS : 

If it is asked here how it can be stated that the service of Bhagavan extends up to the service of His devotees (the Bbaga vatas), the answer is as follows:- It has been said in the Vedartha Sangraha: "He is the s'esha whose svarība or essential nature is such as is chosen on account of the desire to promote the glory of another and that another is the s'eslii." So in regard to the Supreme Ruler of all, the Jiva who is the sesha is bound to pro mote His glory. That glory will depend on the nature of the s'esha, whether it be sentient or non-sentient. It may be asked, "What is the glory that the jiva is capable of conferring on the Supreme Being? With his body and the like, he can copfer only such glory as non-sentient things do. So this service is common to him and acit. The special glory that he can be the cause of promoting must be by ineans of his intelligence or chaitanya, * When the

jiva acts against the spirit of the sõstras, Iswara, who is the Ruler and the Dispenser of punishment, enjoys only the delight or delectation of lila and thus attains atisaya glory. It has been said: " Bhagavan, 'who has all beings as His body, rejoices when a jiva does what is good and does not rejoice when the action is evil." When a man acts in accordance with the stāstras, he gives thereby delight to the Lord and thus does not let his generosity and other qualities run to waste, but promotes the glory of the Lord so that He extols binn as in the words :-"All those are", indeed, generous". In the same way as the muktas (released souls) and the nityas (the sūris ) promote the glory of the Lord by direct percep tion of the Lord's will and by acting in such a way as to give Him bhoga or enjoyment, the prapanias, too, can give rise to a special kind of bhoga or enjoyment to the Lord and thus promote His glory as stated in the following sloka:-"When shall I*always be Thy servant, look upon Thee as my Master and in this way give Thee delight?". The prapanna learns the Lord's will from the sästras (though not directly ) and renders service to the Lord. 

THE LORD IS PLEASED AT THE SERVICE RENDERED 

TO HIS DEVOTEES : 

When a man gives rise to Iswara's lila rasa by actions opposed to the sāstras, it will end in his ruin. If, in the state of bondage, he acts according to the Lord's will as revealed in the sāstras and, in the state of moksha, by direct peroeption of the Lord's will, he will not only promote the Lord's lilū rasa and bhoga but incidentally attain his own desired objects. When the Jiva acts on any occasion consciously, since his desired fruit, incidental though it be, has to come from the will of the lord, the latter has to be ascertained from the s'astras which disclose that the service rendered to His devotees is most delightful to him. 

3. Alavandar Stotram : 46 

1. Mahabharata: Santiparva: 199-25 2. Bhagavad Gita: 7-18162 The following authoritative texts may be studied in this connection: "Of all forms of homage, the homage paid to Vishnu is the best, but superior even to this, is the excellent homage or adoration offered to Vishnu's devotees", "I have great affection to those who are devoted to my devotees. Therefore should one render devout service to them." "Devotion to me is of eight forms: (1) love to my devotees without any thought of their faults; (2) rejoicing at the adoration offered to nie by another; (3) delight in listening to stories concerning me; (4) a change in the voice, in the eyes and in the body, while listening to such stories; (5) trying to offer adoration to me; (6) freedom from hypocrisy in one's relations with me; (7) meditation of me at all times; (8) and not considering me as one from whom worldly benefits can be bad - if bhakti (which is of these eight forms) is found in a mleccha, he should be respected as the best of Brahmins endowed with jnana and bhakti; he is a real sannyāsi, he is a wiso man and he may be taught (the scriptures) and from him one may learn the truth. He is fit to be adored even like myself.", "They are 'my bhaktas or dovotees who do not show devotion to any other deity, who love those that are devoted to me and that have SODE ht me as their upaya", "I offer adoration also to those who offer adoration to that yajna varāha, who is of boundless splen. dour", "By *see king the protection of those who seek the Lord as their refuge and by rendering service to him who is devoted to the devotee, that is in turn) devoted to the devotee of the Lord - by doing so, men are released from all their sins." 

When we study these passages, (it beomes clear) that, of all forms of service which a s'esha of the Lord may reader, that rendered to the Bhagavatas is the most important and is the most pleasing to the Lord, in the same way as the fondling of the prince is most pleasing to the king.

In this matter, if we examine the path of the pramānas, Iswara, who has the Bhagavata es His body, is the object of worship as is declared in the sloka: "Those who worship the pitris, the gods, the Brahmins and Agni -- they worsbip only the Lord who is the inner self of all creatures". If, on the other hand, we consider the thought of the Prakari who says "He 18 dear to me also" and who is ever at the disposal of the man that is exclusively devoted to Him on account of His love for him, as bas been said in the sloka : "Among them the jnānī ig my very self" the Lord would be pleased at the service rendered to the Bhagavata, as if it were service rendered (directly) to His own inner self and not as that done to His body. 

In addition to its causing plassure to the s'eshi, the relationship of the jiva to Iswara as His s'esha is also mediately through the Bhagavata. Therefore his service to the Lord may also be mediato through the Bhagavuta. This may be explained as follows: 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

To the Supreme Being who is always with Lakshmi and who looks upon His devotees as His very self, the attribute of being & seshī may be both by being a seski along with Lakshmi and by being a seshi mediately through the devotees". (That is, those who look upon themselves as s'eshas to His devotees sro, mediately through these devotees, s'eshas to the Lord Himself). A king who is independent and who takes & pleasure in acting as he pleases places the ornaments and garlands worn by himself round the necks of his servants and of his elephants and horses. (Tiruppapalvar says):-- "The Lord who "is spotless and who has mnade ine the servant of His servants". (So does Narada say): "I, Narada, have come here with an eager longing to see you. To men like me, O Brahmin, those who are bkaktas of the Lord are masters" and again (Tirumangai Alvar says ); - "I will not 18 9. Mahabharata: Santi parva

remain in the company of those who think there is any other deity deserving of adoration thao Thee; also what I have accepted with delight is the duty of serving Thy devotees". According to these passages, since the jiva is absolutely subject to the will of the Lord and since the service of the s'esha is due also to those who are favourites of the Lord, our being a s'esha to the Lord extends even to the Bhagavatas and should last as long as the self lasts. Our being s'eshas to Bhagavatas arises from their being devotees to the Lord and pertains to our essential Datare. It arises also from their qualities and knowledge, which cause & desire in us to serve them. (As Lakshinada says) "I "am his younger brother (by birth); I have become his servant by his qualities". (That this relationship of being & s'esha is due both to our essential nature and to (our admiration for) their wisdom and character) is also indicated (respectively in the two phrases(1) "bhaktas of the lord and to "men like me" (in the speech of Narada quoted above). Perialvar, the (great) commentator of Kalpa siitras stated (in this connec tion):- "These who are 15 the servants of Bhagavatas and who utter the names of Bhagavan are entitled even to sell us". This is the purport of the middle world in Tirumantra, namely, namo: na mama (not for me). If we reflect on this purport, our beiog sesha to the Lord is both mediate (through the Bhagavatas) and immediate (direct to Him). Accordingly, the service that should be rendered by the sesha is also (both ) mediate and direct. Therefore it is the farthest limit of the service of the prapanna to perform, as much as it lies in his power, service to the Bhāgavata, since it is part of the duty of one who is s'esha to Bhagavān. So this outermost region of service to Bhagavatas should be kept properly cultivated so that it may not become fallow land full of weeds. 

. As stated in the following slokas in Poushkara samhita, "It is 16 not wrong for a wedded wife to honour her husband and to honour his servants, whether in his presence or in his absence."

and "Anong? the Lord's retinue are two classes: those that are dear to bim and worthy of His trust and those who are not. To the former class belong the nityas, the muktas and the Bhagavatās. 

To the latter class belong Brahma and the other gods who are subject to the sway of past karma. The seeker after raukti should not adore the latter;" the devotee who is exclusively attached to the Lord and whose dharma resembles that of a chaste wife would therefore do well to act according to the will of his Lord. Since the relationsbip of s'esha to Bhagavatas arises from no other cause than the knowledge of our being sesha only to the Lord and to no other, this service to Bhagavatas is not improper, (because it does not arise from other causes like the desire for wealth or power ). 

BHAGAVATĀS ARE SESHAS TO ONE ANOTHER: 

If it is asked whether this relationship of being s'esha to Bhügavatās is due to one's nature or whether it is adventitious (due to upādhi), the answer is, that it is both natural and adventi. tions. In as much as it lasts as long as the self lasts and will continue also in the state of inoksha, it may be called natural. 

Dives not Koorattalvan s2y) :-"When shall I join the eternal siiris who are always eager to be s'eshas to one another p" (This relationship of a sesha will continue even after release from bondage). It may be said to be adventitious also (due to upādhi or conditions), as it arises from a knowledge of one's relationship to Bhagavan. 

If so, it may be asked, "If both are Bhagavatas, would it not be inconsistent that they should be both s'esha and s'eshī to each other?" The answer is as follows:- There is nothing inconsistent in this, as it is possible for the same person to render help to another and also to receive help from him. (In the performance of a sacrifice), the sacrificer who performs it for the sake of some gain or benefit (phala) is the s'eshi but when he is considered as the doer of the sacrifice, he is s'esha in relation to the sacrifice. 

17. Poushkara Samhita : 

18. Vaikunta gadya : 77 

166 CHAPTER 

So also when each of the two Bhagavatas is bent on promoting the glory (atisaya) of the other, without either of them expecting that glory, they become s'eshas by their being the cause of the promo tion of the glory of the other; they are also seshis inasmuch as they are the recipients of the glory (atisaya), though they themselves may not desire it. Since they have been directed by Iswara'd will to promote each other's glory, the relationship of being sesha to Bhagavatas is, in the case of both, based on sästraic authority. 

The relationship of being a servant (dása) to Bhagavan and Bhagavatās owing to an appreciation of their qualities or character adds to one's delight or enjoyment and promotes one's own exaltation. In this, Iswara, by His omnipotence and His will which accompanies it, enables all Bhagavatas to become seshis. Taking their desire also along with His own will, Iswara makes them seshas to Bhagavatas. Since both the Bhagavatas stand in the relation of seshis to each other as having been fit to be directed by the Master to do His will, both of them attain their true and essential nature (svarüpa). They attain the ultimate limit of their purushärtha or goal of life, since they attain the relationship of being s'eshas, which they are eager to have and also the privilege of rendering service to the Bhagavata which follows from it. Since Iswara delights in having directed them to become seshas and s'eshīs to each other, Iswara attains the state of being an Iswara or ruler and of being an enjoyer. Since they realise clearly that this relationship of being seshas and s'eshis to each other contri. butes to the enjoyment (bhoga) of Iswara, they attain the faultless and ultimate limit of purushärtha By those who have done what should be done (prapannas), who understand this subtle truth and are convinced of it, the grace of devotees who are exclusively and supremely attached to the Lord will be desired as an end in itself - devotees who are free from the following stains : the desire for transgressing the Lord's commands, excess of doubt, connection with other deities, enjoyment depending on one's own effort and enjoyment for one's own self.

SERVICE TO BHAGAVATAS

TAMIL VERSE: 

We that accept the code of conduct prescribed by the Lord, whose auspicious qualities fill, with astonishment, Bhāgavatas who have understood the meaning of the Vedas - We conduct ourselves in such a way that we do not deviate from the righteous path ordained in the eternal Vedas in rendering service to His good devotees with extreme reverence to them. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

With our words which emit a fragrance that would be eagerly desired by the lotus which arose in the pond of the Lord's navel, we do not beg of the Lord the pleasures of this world and of svarga which are like straw nor kaivalya nor even moksha. We oply pray that we should have the grace of the pure and firm-minded Bhagavatas, who are like the chaste wives in the royal harem, for their grace is like the dawn which beralds the day of the splen. dour of moksha, 

(17) THE CHAPTER ON THE ORDINANCES 

IMPOSED BY THE SASTRAS. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Having laid, on Mukunda, the responsibility for his protection and become free from sin like those released from samsāra, the prapanna walks along the path laid down in the stāstras until his release from bondage, since (unlike the mukta) he cannot read the mind of the lord directly and since the path has been ordained for us by the command of the Omnipotent Lord and since, by straying from that path, he will immediately bring, on himself and on others, ills of various kinds. 

THE PRAPANNA SHOULD HAVE THE SASTRA 

FOR HIS GUIDE: 

(It has been stated so far that) owing to his relationship as a s'esha, the prapanna has to render service to Bhagavan and to Bhagavatās. Now it may be asked whether this service arises from his desire and in accordance with the sāstras or from his mere desire without any reference at all to the sāstras. The answer is as follows; To the man who is in this world full of the darkness of ignorance, the sāstra is required as a lamp (to show the path that he should take). So the service that he is to render should be according to the s'āstra; in matters where the s'āstra gives an option or alternatives, he may follow his own discretion. "How ja this", it may be asked. When Sri Ramanuja was about to leave this world, he observed his foremost disciples grieving exceedingly, He called them to his side and commanded them on pain of offence to Alavandar not to think of taking their own lives owing to their sorrow at his death. "They will (if they do so) have no connection with me”, he said. On hearing this, they were filled with sorrow and begged that they might be told what they should do thereafter. This was Sri Ramanuja's reply: 

17 

ORDINANCES OF SASTRAS 

169 

SRI RAMANUJA'S ADVICE: 

"If a man has become a prapanna, the salvation of his soul or self is the responsibility of Bhagavan, and he himself has nothing to do with it. If he thinks that he has anything to do with it, bis surrender of responsibility (prapatti or ätma samarpanam) must have been false or insincere. The maintenance of the body depends upon his past karma, and he should not feel anxious about it. If he feels anxious about it, he is a sceptic or nästika. Therefore neither in regard to his spiritual welfare nor in regard to his bodily welfare, has he anything more to do. If so, it may be asked whether the man might go about doing whatever he liked with his three kinds of organs, mind, speech and body. The answer is that doing so is not in keeping with his svarība or essential nature. It is true that he has nothing (wore) to do with regard to the upāya or means, but he should direct these viz., mind, speech and body to the rendering of service which is the goal of his existence. There are five kinds of service which be can render for the rest of his life: (1) to study the Bhashya and to spread the knowledge obtained therefrom; (2) if the man is not qualified for it, to study the writings of the Alvars and spread their knowledge; (3) if the man is not competent to do it (i.e.) No. (2), to serve in holy temples sanctified (by the Alvars), by cooking food, by making chandanam, by lighting lamps and by weaving garlands (for use in the temples ); (4) if not competent to do (3), to meditate on the meaning of Dvaya;; (5) if not competent to do (4), to seek the good will of some Sri Vaishnava who is well disposed to bim and would look upon him as bis follower and spend his life with bim, 

PITFALLS IN THE PATH OF THE PRAPANNA: 

The man who is qualified to live in this way has to avoid pitfalls in front of him by behaving carefully in three matters. "They concern - (1) those who are suitable or favourable (anukula) (2) those who are unsuitable or unfavourable (pratikūla) and (3) those who are neither the one nor the other. The suitable are 

170 CHAPTER 

Sri Vaishnavas, the unsuitable are those that are the enemies of Bhagavan; those who are neither the one nor the other are those in samsära. The prapanna will rejoice at the sight of the suitable (anukila) as at chandana, flowers and the like and as at moonlight and the southero breeze and (other) beloved objects. At the sight of the unsuitable (pratiküla), he will be full of dread as at the sight of the serpent and the fire. At the sight of those who are Deither of these two, he will behave as at the sight of wood or stone and treat them (with indifference), as if they were straw. If they are agreeable, he sh uld impart the knowledge of truth to them ;, otherwise, he should pity their sad fate. It is the inclination for wealth and sensual pleasure that stands in the way of such behaviour. If, owing to the desire for wealth and sense pleasures, & mon should treat & Sri Vaishnava with disregard or contempt, he would provoke the wrath of Bhagavan in the same way as & man who treats the prince with disrespect in the presence of the king would provoke the king's anger. If, owing to the desire for wealth and sense pleasures, a man should remain subservient to those who are unsuitable, he would provoke disgust in the mind of Bhagavan in the same way as a queen who, while her lord is an en perur, begs alms of the mean and unworthy would provoke disgust in the king's mind. If & man should treat with respect those who are neither the one nor the other, the Lord would have no regard for him, as his knowledge serves no useful purpose like that of one who cannot distingaish between a gem and a piece of stone", 

SRI RAMANUJA'S ADVICE EXPLAINED: 

Io connection with this code of conduct prescribed by Sri Ramanuja for the prapanna, we have to remember that the pursuit of wealth and sense pleasures which are against dharma bave already been probibited altogether (for all including non prapannas) es in the following slokas:- "One should not*, in any circumstances and even in critical times, accept any gifts, pot 

1. Sandilya Smriti: 3-18 

17 

ORDINANCES OF SASTRAS 

171 

even # cowrie, from an unchaste woman, a eunuch, an out.caste (patita) or an enemy." "They are dear to me. they who are born blind to the imperfections of others, who are eunuchs in regard to the wives of other men and who are dumb in the matter of censuring others." So the injunction contained in the Bhashyakāra's words (really) means that even in regard to the acquisition of wealth and sense-pleasures which are not opposed to dharma, the prapanna shoald not deviate from his proper state in regard to these three classes of persons, the suitable, the upsuitable and those who are neither of these two. That those who are suitable should not be treated with disregard is declared in Sandilya 

with disregard; so also Bhagavan does not like those who do not treat bis bhaktas with due respect." That those who are unsuitable should not be associated with, is declared in the Mahabharata : “Those who hate Kesava, the Supreme Being, and cannot, meditate on Him - to them and to those who 388ociate with them with respect, there will be no benefit at all from bathing in the holy waters". So also it it said: "One should not Associate with fools, with those who are addicted to sin, with those who are crael by nature, and with those who criticise adversely the sāstras of Bhagavārı (Pancharatra). Association with them will pat an end to bhakti". That those who are neither the one nor the other should be treated like straw is well known from slokas like the following:- "Omen of the world, from this day onwards, you are what you are and we are what we are. You are in quest of wealth and sense pleasures; we are in quest of Narayana (80) there cannot be any companionship between you and us. We are the servants of the Lord; you are the slaves of the senses". The words that the prapanna should walk warily (lest he should fall into pitfalls) indicate that the (five) services ordained as essential by the Bhashyakara (in his words quoted above) stand in the same category as services like Sandhyāvandana which can be

5. ?172 CHAPTER 

learnt only from the sästras and that, for that reason, these five, too, should be done in accordance with the injunctions prescribed in the sāstras, in order that they may become real and proper services. It may be asked: ("How can bis (Sri Ramanuja's) words be interpreted to include also those rites and duties that are prescribed in the sāstras and that these five services which he has specifically mentioned should also be done according to the sāstras?") The answer is that it is clear from the Bhashyakūra's words "If he should go about doing as he likes, it would be against his svarība or essential nature." As Alavandar puts it, "Whatever agrees not with the sāstras is Āsuric in nature; those ections that are opposed to the sāstras are inconsistent with his Dature which is godly". Further it has been said by the Lord who is entitled to our service - "The 'struti and the sinritis are indeed my commands. He who transgresses them violates my commands. He does injury to me. Though he may be devoted to me he should not be called & Vaishnava". Sri Ramanaja's meaning is that, since the Master bas also made this declaration, the prapanna should serve in accordance with the sõstras as long as he lives in the body. In his Gītārtha Sangraha. Alavandar says : - "From the? karmas pertaining to one's varna and äsrama to bhakti yoga, one should perform everything, directed by love alone (of the Lord). One should give up the notion that these are upāyas or means (for attaining one's ends). One should place the upāya without fear on God; (i.e) one sbould realise that Bhagavan is alone the upāya)". It is obvious that 'by love alone' excludes the notion that it is an upāya owing to the word 'alove' and this idea is elaborated in "having given up the notion that these are upāyas or means". It is true that, that the love (of the Lord) is indicated as having & wonderful power of inspiring one to service prescribed in the sāstra. But in the words "from the karınas pertainingto one's varna and asrama", it is shown that the nature of these karmas has to be ascertained only from the süstras.

17 

ORDINANCES OF SASTRAS 

173 

This ordinance imposed by the sāstras is well known from the following slokas in the chapter on prapatti : " In order that there may be no violation of dharma, for the protection of the family, for kezping ignorant men in the right path by setting them an example, for the preservation of the nuoral law as defined in the sāstras, for diy (Lakshmi's ) satisfaction and for the satis. faction of the Lord armed with Sarnga who is the God of all gods, the prapanna who is wise should aot even think of transgressing the ordinances of the Veda". The evil that would result from the transgression is described immediately afterwards as follows : “Even a king's favourite, who, because it serves no purpose of his own, destroys the bund of a river dug by the king's orders, which is of great use to the world, is beautiful in itself and causes abundance of crops, - even be will be impaled for having done so ); So also though he may be dear, tbe man who violates the ordinances of the Vedas is do favourite of mine inasmuch as he violates my commands.” If, having offended the Lord, the prapanna does pot seek pardon, it will produce, before he attains mukti, some evil or otber in accordance with his specific qualification. 

That apart, there is no greater bell (for the prapanna) than the displeasure caused to Bhagavān. This displeasure of Bhaga van will disappear if he obtains pardon. (As the Gita says) Iswara, by His very nature, is full of love to all. So till His displeasure disappears, it will give the prapanna excruciating pain. If the man has no such pain, bis devotion to the Master and his desire for rendering service after moksha have to be doubted. 

Since this violation of the Lord's command is opposed to the Lord's pleasure wbich is our final goal as stated in the sloka : "When shall I, Thy servant, look upon Thee alone as my Master and

give the delight by rendering service ?" the observance of the ordinances of the sāstras bas to be understood in those places in the three mysteries (mantras) where the removal of obstacles is referred to. In the case of those who have not completed their adoption of brapatti) the upāya, the observance of these ordinances will remove the hindrances or obstacles to the completion of prapatti and win for them the grace of the Lord. In the case of those whose adoption of the upāya is complete, it will win the favour of the Lord by removing the causes that might bring about His displeasure (in future). 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The paths indicated in the sāstras deal with acts or rites of two kinds: obligatory and permissive. The former have to be done for avoiding the Lord's punishment and the latter for obtain. ing the respective benefits. 

Even when a permissible act is performed, if there is violation of the prescribed method, it becomes an offence or violation of the command. Therefore transgression of the rule prescribed in the s'astra is nowhere countenanced. 

When the same rite is prescribed both for avoiding a trans gression and for obtaining a benefit - in that rite, there is a mingl. ing of competency (adhikara) according to scholars. When the same karma or rite is prescribed as nitya (obligatory) and also kamya (for the sake of a benefit), the act or rite performed for the specific benefit will serve (also) as the performance of the nitya (by that single performance). 

In rites (karmas or services) prescribed for the attainment of certain benefits, the benefit will not be obtained, when the service is not performed, but there is no transgression. Such is the opinion of competent scholars. 

ORDINANCES OF SASTRAS 

175 

TAMIL VERSE: 

By following the four Vedas (and the Smritis and other sastras) in which the Supreme Being who measured the three worlds with His feet has ordained what is right and what is wrong, we have attained the state of service similar to that of the eternal sūris who are full of the love (of God). To us who live in the dark night (of samsāra), there is no other light than that of this moon (viz. the sāstras) to dispel the darkness that grows denser and denser at every step. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The wise man learns what is in accordance with the will of the Ruler* who is the originator of the Universe; from the Srutis ; from the Smritis ; and from the traditional practice of elders ; from the promptings of his own reason in the case of the man with a pure heart; from good resolutions not departing from dharma; and also the traditional practice of the family, of the fcharana and of the country. Sometimes he tries to understand the Lord's will from the commands of those who are competent to direct him and also from omens, sigas, dreams and the like.

(18) THE CHAPTER ON THE ATONEMENT 

FOR OFFENCES. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

This embodied being (the Jiva) obtains the grace of Madhava by the result of past karma (luck), for the removal of his sins -- the grace of Madhava which, by its purity, delightfulness, boliness and efficacy is like the (holy) Mandakini whose waters are clear, sweet, always pure (white) and efficacious. (That is, he becomes a prapanna ). If, in spite of this, he still makes bis body unclean by wallowing in the mire of the stream of wretcbed sense pleasures, his company is avoided by the wisa (but this would not stand in the way of his attainment of noksha after death). 

THE PRAPANNA IS NOT LIKELY TO OFFEND; 

IF HE OFFENDS, HE SHOULD PERFORM 

PRĀYASCHITTA. 

Since the prapanna has, by nature, the sole character of a s'esha to Bhagavān and since he delights only in rendering service to Hin in accordance with the ordinances of the sastras, it is not at all likely that, in other situations than those that are dangerous, he will offend against the Lord, as it would be opposed to his adopted state of being the exclusive servant of the Lord. If as a resalt of past karma which has hegan to operate (prārabdha) and onder adverse conditions of place, time and circumstance, slight offences (against the Lord) take place through inattention in the waking state or (without his knowledge) in dreamless sleep (sushupti) and other soch states, these offences will disappear without causing any stain. If, at the time of prapatti, he did not beg, with dread of them, for the removal of such sins as lead to further sins, since he is still in close association with prakriti like one who lives under the same roof with a serpent, it is just possible tbat, owing to his deficiency in spiritual qualities, certain lapses 

ATONEMENT FOR OFFENCES 

177 

which are inconsistent with his state as a prapanna night, as in the case of weak-hearted Rishis, even occur with his knowledge. If sach lapses do occur, the Lord of Lakshmi, who, by His very nature, is his well-wisher, stands ever ready to save him. There fore these lapses in his actions will only be momentary like lightning; he will quickly reflect on these lapses from his state as a prapanna, feel ashamed at them, repent of them, and perform the proper atonement (prāyaschitta) that is suited to his competence. The following slokas explain the point-"If there is 'offence, the atonement that is to be done is only the performance of prapatti again. If, after performing prapatti for the sake of moksha, & man should perform karma yoga and the like with the thought that these are upāyas (to moksha., it would also constitute an offence. In order that this offence might disappear, prapatti alone should be performed again". "Whether a 'man commits an offence knowing that it is an offence or does it without knowing it to be one, the only atonement (präyaschitta) that bas to be performed is to beg in these words :-"Pardon the offence". So also Sita says: 

“'It is well known that Sri Rama knows what Dharma is and is fond of those who seek refuge under him. Seek bis friendship if you desire to live. Propitiate Sri Rama who loves those that surrender themselves to him and, with a pure heart, see that I am returned to bin." 

THE PRAPANNA WILL NEVER GO TO THE WORLD 

OF YAMA EVEN IF HE OFFENDS: 

When, owiog to hard-heartedness due to past karma operating now (prārabdha), the prapanna does not obtain pardon by atonement, he will not go to the world of Yama (but receive panishment in this very life). For it has been said :- "Seeing'

And Again : - "O Thou with lotus-like eyes, O Vasudeva, O Visbau, O Thoa that bearest the earth, O Thou that art armed with the coach and the discus, be Thou my refuge" - those that atter these words - leave them at a distance for they are not sinners", and further, "Those that perform® prapatti to Vishnu, the God who is armed with sārnga, never go to the world of Yama, for naraka is not their dwelling place." As stuted above in such treatises as Vishnupuräna and Vamanapurāna and the passages in the strutis on which they are based, they do not go to the land of Yama, but they are punished with the blindness of an eye, or the lameness of a leg, or some such thing and thus relieved of their burden (of sin). (They will be punished in this life itself here) on the analogy of one (who is dear) being punished with the prick of a thorn iostend of being stabbed with a spear. The Supreme Lord, being possessed of forgiveness, kiodness, com passion and over-flowing love, relents in His anger and protects the prapanna after a light punishment in this very life for his offence. An emperor, who is to be duly served, punishes his attendants (like those who carry the umbrellas ), the servants of the barem like the hunchbacks and the dwarfs and so also the princes, in proportion to their offences and (algo) to such things as their closeness to Him. (He punishes them) for having committed offences, in spite of his affection to them due to their relationship and His goodness. (He padishes them) so that they may obtain pardon for their offences and know that, in future, they may not offend (in the same manner). The punishments are such as the following: averting his face from them, whipping, getting them driven out, keeping them outside the gates and suspension for a short time. Similarly Iswara punishes the prapanna, as Sri Rama

did in the case of Kakasura by making him lose an eye and thus protects him. 

Directing those that are gentle to obtain pardon (by atone ment) and punishing those that are tough by natare for the sake of correction are of the nature of the Lord's forgiveness, which is & consequence of their prapatti that preceded it. One should therefore feel grateful to the Lord for this correction. To emphasize this point, some said that the Lord would pardon even those sins that are committed deliberately. (They did not mean to say that deliberate offences would be pardoned without any punishment). 

PRAPATTI WILL NEVER BE IN VAIN : It should not be thought that, because sins committed delibe rately after prapatti and not atoned for would be followed by their consequences like that part of prārabdha karma which is of the nature of sin, the prapatti performed before would not yield mok sha. When asafoetida is applied to the root of a tree for making it wither, the tree is sure to wither sooner or later, according to the nature of the soil and other conditions; (but there is no doubt that it will wither; it will do so, perhaps after a little more time). So also in the case of these prapannas who have committed sins deliberately, there will be difference only with regard to the delay in the complete release from samsūra. If they desire to have mokshu at the end of this life and cannot brook delay and if the period of their life-time is not previously fixed, there will be delay in moksha by the life-time being extended. To those whose period of life-time is already fixed, praputti will certainly boer fruit with. in that time. 

DISCUSSION OF THE VIEW THAT EVEN DELIBERATE OFFENCES COMMITTED BY A PRAPANNA WILL 

NOT AFFECT HIM ADVERSELY. It may be asked “Even after Sita Devi promised protection to the Raksbasis by saying "I will 'protect you," when these 

7. Sita's words: Ramayana: Sundara Kanda: 58-90 

180 CHAPTER 

Rakshasis offended her again deliberately, were their sins pot for. given when Sita Devi said, " I forgive their offences as I cannot bear their sufferings" and "Whether they deserve punishment for their sios or whether they huve not committed any sins (deserving of punishment), you should pardon them because of your gene rous Dature -- There is no one that is above fault"? The answer is as follows:-* Even here, the Raksbasis were afraid that Hanuman was about to punish them severely and were afterwards saved from it. So there was, as in the raising of the sword (to strike & person), a slight punishment (fear) and (then ) forgive Dess. Therefore, when it is sometimes stated that even sips committed deliberately by a prapanna, would not cling to him, the statement bas no authority in support of it. It is also some times stated that the prapanna need not atone for his sins even when he has committed them deliberately, and that, even if he has not atoned for them, there will be no punishment by way of teaching him a lesson. It is sometimes maintained also that when such offences have been committed, there will be no delay in the attaidment of the supreme goal even for those who are impatient of delay and that there will be no inter mission or diminution in the services which have come to a man as the result of meritorious karma in the past bearing fruit in this life. These propositions maintained by some (should not be taken as literally true); they are made just to glorify the attributes and qualities of the Saviour and the power of prapatti. Otherwise there would be no meaning in the continued tradition of the observance, by previous prapannas, of the code of conduct prescribed for the prapanna, in the sāstras which prescribe methods of atonement for sins in the case of prapaniias, and in the texts which say that there will be delay in the attain ment of moksha for those who did not perform prapatti indicating the time when they wanted to have it and are also impatient of delay while sipping deliberately. Though it is said as a general

181 

statement, "I will "A release you from all sias", since it is qualified by & passage standing as a special case: "This atonement consists in the performance of prapatti once again", it is evident that the atonement for sins committed deliberately after prapatti is the performance of another prapatti. It cannot be argued that this passage prescribiog another prapatti is only for those who did not perform prapatti to cover also those subsequent sins that might be committed deliberately. This argument would carry weight, only if there were an explicit statement that prapatti might be performed to cover also future sins of & deliberate nature. (There is none such). If a man knows that the original prapatti may be made in such a way as to cover also future sins of a deliberate nature, there will be no one who will care to give up this easier method and thus the text prescribing a further prapatti will find none to adopt it. A general statement ceanot contradict & statement made for a special or specific case (for the general statement covers only all cases except those specified in the special statement). If we hold that a general statement can sublate or contradict a special statement for specific cases, it would follow that, even in the case of one who adopts the upāya of bhakti or upāsana, subsequent sins committed deliberately would cause no 

stain. 

It is evident from the authority of the following sloka that those who are exclusively devoted to Bhagavan (whether they be bhaktas or prapannas ) will not fall under the sway of Yama : "Whatever" may be the family into which they are born, wherever they may live, those who love Bhagavan will never go to the world of Yama." There is general agreement also that the same sin will meet with either heavy or light punishment as its consequence, according to the differences of caste, character and the like. This is also consistent with what obtains in the world in cases like the offepoes committed by princes 

- 

9-A Bbagavad Gita XVIII - 66. 10. ?182 CB APTER 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

In cases of deliberate offence, the punishment is not 88 severe as before (prapatti) nor is there a high degree of grace. To the prapanna the punishment is light as in the case of the sons of kings. 

Therefore to avoid even this light punishment which would follow as the consequence, & further prapatti ia ordained. In the case of those who are looked upon as learned and righteous, and who are also capable of atonement, atonement in public, in accordance with their ability, is proper wben the offences have been committed in public. This is for the sake of setting an example to the rest of the world. If it were not done, it would be a trans gression of (the Lord's) command stated before. The violation of the command is injurious in two ways. When the waiting woman is suspended from service, she loses what she obtains (from the service ) such as scents and has to experience also dread (of punishment). 

It may (now) be asked :-"What if the original or first prapatti is made on one's own initiative (without the sanction of the sāstrās ) so as to cover also deliberate sins of the future ?" This is (easily ) answered by a counter-check :-"What if bhakti or upāsana is performed so as to cover also future acts of delibe. rate offence? What if prapatti as an anga is performed so as to cover such acts ?" If it is stated that in these two cases (of counter-check) also, it may be held that future sins will not cling, it will be heresy opposed to what is stated in Sri Bhashya and elsewhere. It is also opposed to the code of conduct observed by such (holy men ) as Ushasti* who were steadfast in the contem. plation of Brahman (Brahmanishta). There is no special ordi Dance to contradict the general statement that when a "sin is

committed and the man feels romarse, the atonement or the prāvaschitta is to meditate on Bhagavan. Therefore the rule that, unless the occusion has arisen, there can be no application of a remedy (to cover a future possibility) holds good and stands adcon. tradicted in the case of offences committed deliberately after prapatti. Since the prayaschitta or atonement is prescribed only for & sin that has already been committed, if & man dreads the possiblity of future sins committed deliberately, he should perform atonement in the form of a prapatti for the sins of the past life which have now begun to operate and which are the cause of these (possible) future sins. For has it not been said, "Bhakti ' adopted as an upāya can destroy all sing except those sins of the past that have begun to operate in tbis life. On the other hand, prapatti (or sūdhya bhakti). is superior to bhakti and can destroy even those sins of the past that have begun to produce their conse quences in this life?" It has also been said :- "The 18 sins com. mitted in previous births afflict a man (in the present life) 28 diseases. They can be got rid of by medicines, charitable gifts, japa, offerings to the fire (homa) and adoration of Bhagavan". (It is indeed stated here) that, even by japa and hona, the sins of the past which have begun to bear fruit in the present life can be destroyed. (Such being the case, there is no reason to doubt that prapatti can destory such sids). Therefore if a man perforing prapatti in dread of the possibilities of future sips which might be caused by the sins of the past, these can be got rid of and no such future sin will be deliberately committed. 

From such episodes as that of Sandili in which even Garuda who has been described in Alavandar's Stotranz' as Bhagavan's servant, friend, vebicle, seat and device on the banner, committed an offence against the righteous Sandili and had to undergo the evil consequences of it until he obtained pardon from her -- from such episodes, it is evident that even for those who are in immediate contact with Bhagavan, even slight offences against the righteous are productive of evil consequences. (It may be asked whether 

12. Vigaheswara Samhita 

13. Alavandar: Sastra; 4 

184 CHAPTER 

nitya sūris like Garuda could commit offences at all). The answer is that, if the eternal sūris incarnate like Bhagavan, they have to act the part of those who are subject to the sway of karma and perform alogement for offences in order to promote the good of the world (by setting & proper example). 

So, in order that one may not lose the grace of God and thereby incur the need for further prapatti or light punisbment, a way must be found to root out the possibility of futura offences. In general, the root cause of all offences is want of discrimination (aviveka). Of this want of discrimination, the most important is that which causes the delusion that the self is identical with matter (the body ) which is non-sentient and ever subject to modification and has such other qualities and, likewise, the delusion that the individual self has the attributes and qualities which are peculiar to Iswara, such as existing in itself, independence, and not existing for any one but itself. The sharp-edged saw that cuts off this want of discrimination is a clear knowledge of the nature of one's self which is neither redundant por inadequate. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

When the cause, nanely, the delusion that the self is the body and that the self is independent (of the Lord) and other such delusions disappear, the offences which arise from the desire for wealth and for sense pleasures are (completely) rooted out without any special effort. 

The prime cause of all these, namely, the possibility of future offences and the delusions which cause them is sin committed in past births which has now begun to yield its consequences. There fore it will be aloned, for by the performance of prapatti at the beginning so as to cover that sin also or the performance of a further prapatti for the purpose. Of these sids which have to be atoped for, the Bhashyakāra (Sri Ramapuja) bas pointed out that offences done to Bhagavatas stand in the front rank like those

188 

done to the wives of a king -vide his commentary on the Satra : "The 24fruits of mukti too, cannot be said to be attained at any fixed time; for they can be attained only if there are no obstacles". 

(Sri Ranapaja's commentary is as follows: Though the fruit of upisana or bhakti is mukti, still the time of its attainment is uncertain, because of the presence or absence of obstacles. It may be asked whether there could be any such obstacle in the case of one whose karma or upisana which gets him mukti is far stronger than all other karmas. The answer is:- Even in his case there may be obstacles of the nature of offences done in the past to those who meditate on Brahman). 

Such being the case, although there may be resemblance between oneself and such persons as Parasara, Vyasa, Suka, Sounaka, Nathamani and others, who were distinguished by their caste, character, conduct and the like in such matters as devotion to Bhagavan and the attaioment of the supreme goal of life, they should not be treated with disregard. There are differences due to the will of Bhagavan as seen in the condition of each object among things which are the property of Bhagavan such as cows and cowherds, tulasī and chanpaka, cowdung and musk. Such points of excellence and inferiority, which are likely to cause envy, should not make one think of treating superior persons with disregard, 28 stated in Rahasyamınāya in the section treating of the origin of envy. It is true that particular actions and abstention from such actions have been prescribed in the case of Bhagavatās as due to conditions of caste and the like as stated in the Brahnia Sutra (2-3. 47) " That there is permission and probi bition (in respect of castes ) is due to their relationship with their bodies as in such things as fire" (Fire from the house of & Vedic scholar is fit for use, that from the crewation ground is anfit for use. So also, though the soul is pare, a man becomes fit or unfit for certain specific matters owing to bis soul's contact with the

body). In spite of these ordinances, we should also consider such passages as the following : 

"Even a man of bad conduct sbould be considered a good man if he worships me without expecting any other benefit. He should be treated with respect." "The chandala" who has devo tion to Bhagavan - to think even by more chance, of this chan dāla, to talk to him and to treat him with respect - these purify the man who does 80, 0, Brahmin " " Whether the devotee of Bhagavan be a südra, a huntsman, or a man who eats dog's flesh, the man who looks upon him as identical with other men of those respective castes will go to hell." "Therefore one should do i8what one can to please the devotees of Bhagavan. By this, Bhagavan becomes favourably disposed to bless one. There is no doubt about this." So also has it been said (by the Alwar) that those who are the devoted servants of the Lord are his masters in all his future births and that the moment he made up bis mind to render service to the Lord's devotees, bis past karma was destroyed and that he would never think of giving up this service. In the same way it is our duty not to fail in reverence towards the Lord's servants. Even if there is only this mental reverence, it would amount to the sesha's service to the Lord who is perfect and self-sufficient. The thought that " This man is of the Lord” is itself capable of doing good. If there is any deviation from this path, one should tremble in fear as if one has entered into the jaws of Death, as it has been said: ** Whatever" is crooked (in conduct) leads to death ( sainsāra): whatever is straight leads to the attainment of Brabman". (When there bas been such deviation from right conduct) one sbould at once beg pardon of these devoted servants of the Lord as

exemplified in the following: " Since* you have offended, I see no other atonement for you than to be Lakshmana's pardon, with folded hands", end again "If I have 8 offended you in any way, either on account of over-confidence or love, this fault of your servant should be pardoned by you: There is no one who is above committing an offence", and further, "The "harsh words that I attered to you after hearing the speech of Rama who is over. whelmed with grief - these words should be forgiven by you". We should reflect on the manner in which Sugriva, the great king, and Lakshmana apologise to each other in these slokas and we should get reconciled to the devotees of the Lord (whom we have offended), as if the split that occurred has been glued up without any trace of its being seen. 

rred has word (whoms and we 

Even if one who knows the tattva has deliberately entered on & course of conduct unfavourable (to the Lord), the Supreme Ruler will pardon him, if he performs prapatti subsequently. This may be seen from the following episode :- When Brahma saw Rudra in Badarikasrama aiming bis arrow at Bhagavan who bad incarnated as the son of Dharma, be explained matters to Rudra and stopped him from the fight. "Rudra *s then apologised to Narayana who was his Lord to win His favour. He also per formed prapatti to Hari, the Creator of the World, The Supreme Ruler, the giver of boods, became gracious, controlled His anger, became pleased and associated there with Rudra". 

Whether a man has offended Bhagavatas (in this life) or whether some Bhagavatas bate him owing to his wicked deeds in past lives though he has committed no offence in this life, he should obtain the pardon of Bhagavan by obtaining the pardon of such Bhagavatas by some means or other : This is evident in the

188 CHAPTER 

passage which describes the characteristics of a Sri Vaishnava : "He is a devotee of Vishou who, on bearing harsh words uttered by a Bhagavata, prostrates before him and begs his pardon." If a man does not do so, he will pass beyond the reach of the grace of the Lord and will lose also what is essential to his nature as a Vishnubhakta, namely, his being a sesha to Bhagavatas and, like wise, his qualities of self-restraint and patience; for it has been said :-“Those who are Brahmins (Bhagavatas absorbed in the contemplations of Brahman) they are myself. There is no doubt about this O, King; when they are adored, I am adored; when they are pleased, I am also pleased. He who hates them bates me also." "Though the Brahmina strikes bim, curses him and utters cruel words to him, he who does not bow to him as I did (to Bhrigu) - be is a singer. He will be consumed by the wild fire of the Brahmin's anger. He deserves to be killed and punished. He is not mine." To lose these (bis being a s'esha to Bhagavatas and his self-restraint and patience) is itself, in his case, being killed and punished. Topdaradippodi Alwar*, who realised and enjoyed his relationship of being & s'esha to Bhagavatas, which be considere ed as his distinctive feature, has described how miserable it is to be outside the pale of the Lord's grace as follows:- "My Lord has not said: “ This is a lado deserving of my affection". How wicked are my sins!" 

The word Brahmin occurriog in these slokas has a special significance, as has been said in the sloka: "He whoso knows, aright, the truth concerning Bliagavan, who is called Vishnu that measured the world ( with His feet) and is also called Vasudeva he becomes a Brabmin". Even if it is used in its general sense, since the offence to the Brahmin is condemned, much more worthy of condemnation would be the offence to a Bhagavata or devotee of Bhagavan. 26.

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

All sing are destroyed, in four equal parts, by repentance, by abstention, by the endeavour to perform atonement and by the completion of the process of atonement. To those who feel remorse and repentance, whether the prapatti is performed in a previous kalpa or in a later kalpa, there is no difference in the prapatti to be performed although (there is a difference in the nature of sins compitted). Similiarly whether the sins be serious or venial, the performance of a single prapatti done at & time will completely destroy at once (all sins). 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Those who dread, at heart, the formidable sins that bear fruit at present and seek refuge at the two lotus-like feet of the Lord who measured the worlds will be freed from all karma which flourishes like weeds. In order to prevent the occurrence of future offences, the boney-like grace of our Lord prevails over the want of discrimination (aviveka) which gives rise to them. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA. 

The Lord pardons, on account of prapatti, all sins com mitted before prapatti except (some among) those which have begun to bear fruit in this life and also those sins which are committed after prapatti unintentionally. Likewise He pardons ( also) all prārabdha karma except the portion of prārabdha whose con sequences he has agreed to bear. In the case of the prapanna, it is not at all likely that sins will be committed subsequently with deliberation. Even if such (subsequent ) sias occur, they will be destroyed by atonement; if, on account of wickedness, no atone ment is performed, the sios will be expiated by punishment and the Lord will (then) take the prapanna to Himself. 

(19) THE CHAPTER ON THE PLACES SUITABLE 

FOR THE RESIDENCE OF THE PRAPANNA. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

The place where it is possible to concentrate all one's attention on such things as service at the feet of Bhagavan and His adorit tion, or the place where one can find some one or other whose wind is exclusively and staunchly fixed on Bhagavan - that is the place of abode for prapannās as it is almost equal to Vaikunta. Many places that have been prescribed (for abode ) by the sages gene rally have this fitness (in these two respects). 

THE PLACE SUITED TO THE RESIDENCE OF 

THE PRAPANNA: 

As an end in itself, the prapanna is desirous and eager to live, the rest of his life in a manner that would be inoffensive and agreeable to the Lord. He is exclusively and supremely attached to the Lord as described in the sloka :-- The 'devotee who is exclusively attached to Bhagavan is not to be described or desig Dated as belonging to a certain village or a certain family, but as belonging to Bhagavan, for Bhagavan alone is everything to him. 

THE PLACES INHABITED BY BHAGAVATĀS ARE 

THE MOST SUITABLE. 

If it be asked what is the proper place for his residence, the answer is as follows:- Holy regions like Aryavarta bave now, owing to the nature of the Yuga (Kali) become unfit for abode, owing to the rites of varna and asrama getting mingled. There fore the proper place for residence at present is any place where the practice of the dharmu of the four varnas is well established. Even among these places, those regions which are. inbabited by Bhagavatas are to be chosen by (the prapanna) desirous of moksha. It has been said :-"What 'austerities must they have

practised (in their past lives) - they who live in places where there are devotees that adore, with folded hands, Sri Krishna, who has a complexion similar to that of a black cloud, and that look upon Hiin as their protector ?" Though it is stated " In Kali, O, 2A Maitreya, men deluded by heretics will not adore Visbnu, the Lord of the World, the Ruler who created all things", we are also told about places where Bhagavatas live in Kali Yuga : " In Kali 'Yuga, there will be born, here and there, noble souls who consider that Narayana is the supreme object of attainment. They will be born in numbers in Tamil Nad on the banks of the Tamraparni, of the Kritamala, of the Palar, of the renowned Cauvery and of the river which flows westwards and again : "Those who drink the waters of these rivers, O, king, become pure ia mind and greatly devoted to Bhagavan who is called Vasudeva". As stated in these passages, it is these places inhabited by Bhagavatās, that are suitable for the residence of the prapanna in this Kali Yuga. In Sri Narayaniya the devas and the rishis said, "When & dharma stands on & single leg ready to go elsewhere, how are we to live, O Lord? Please tell us this”, Bhagavan replied as follows: "You should live in places where gurus of good character and possessed of self-control are held in reverence and where dharma has not undergone any deterioration. The places which should be chosen by you, O best of devotees, are those where flourish the Vedas, yajņas, austerities (tapas), truth, control of the senses and the slaughter of animals only for the sake of dharma (sacrifices). Adharma will not touch you with its foot". 

THE HOLY PLACES WHERE BHAGAVĀN IS WORSHIPPED IN TEMPLES ARE 

SPECIALLY SUITABLE: Among them, the boly places where Bhagavan bas chosen to be present as archā would be proper for the prapannas' 2A. Vishnupurana: 6-1-50

residence. He should live permanently in one among them which is suitable for his service to the Lord). As an example of holy places where satva is predominant, Srirangam is indicated in the following passage . "Until the 'fall of the body, live in peace here in Srirangam itself." That only the holy places of Bhagavan are suitable for the residence of the wise man has been stated by the great sage (Vyasa) in the context of the places of pilgrimage in Āranya Parva, thus :- "The place where the Supreme Being, the God Narayana who is eternal, dwells -- that is sacred; that is most holy; that is the place of the sacred water that purifies; that is the place fit for austerities; that is the place where the divine seers and the siddhas and all others perform penance", and (in another context) elsewhere, we find -" There is a mountain called Gomanta, 0, king, which is full of all the minerals. On that mountain dwells the lotus-eyed Lord Narayana, the Lord of Lakshmi, who is sung in hymas (there) by those who desire moksha." Bhagavan Valmiki also bas stated :- “This mountain, Chitrakuta, which resembles Himavan, the king of mountains, is possessed of glory, for Sri Rama born of the race of Kakustha dwells on it like Kubera in Nandana." The word subhaga in this siloka refers to the glory of that mountain as one to be visited for having been the residence of Bhagavad. In the Satvata Sastras also, the holy places where there are the spontaneous inanifestations of Bhagavan, those that were established by siddhās and those founded by devotees and the degrees of sanctity attached to them are described separately and it is also stated there that those who dwell within the bounda ries of these holy places will attain a special boon at the time of their laying down the body :-"The wind" of man wbich is under the sway of the foul senses is always surrounded by impure influ ences. It is, however, purified in the last moments by residence in the abode of Narayana."

PLACE OF RESIDENCE 

193 

Therefore as stated in the sloka :-"A man should live in a place where there is a temple of Vishnu and do some kind of service (there). If he is unable to perform any service, he should At least abstain from what is forbidden"; the prapanna would do well to live in a place sanctified by the presence of Bhagavan and Bhagavatas and capable of promoting satva guna. 

It is true that it is said: “ The places where a man in full control of his senses lives — that place has in it Kurukshetra, Naimisa and, likewise, Pushkaram." But this should be taken to mean that, when & righteous man lives in some insignificant place, because of his inability to live elsewhere, that place becomes sanc tified by his residence. This is illustrated in the episode of Sandili.* 

Therefore the statement in the following sloka :-- "The man " who performs prapatti by uttering this mantra at the very time when be attains this knowledge -- that man attaios moksha wherever he may die losing his consciousness whether it be in & holy place of pilgrimage or the house of one who eats dog's flesh" - this statement that there is no special place prescribed for death, should also be understood in the light of what has been said above, as pointing out that this will be no bindrance to the attaio ment of moksha.

invincible and incomparable Sri Rama worshipped, the temple or vimāna which is the refuge of Vibbishana, the ally of Sri Rama, the temple or vimāna, which secures all sorts of benefits unattainable elsewhere, the temple or vimāna which has the shape of pranava, the temple or vimāna which destroys all sins, however insurmountable they may be that temple of Srirangam is indeed full of the nectar of grace which never satiates. 

(2) The mountain which reveals to us the two feet of Sri Krishna, the mountain where wicked sinners get rid of both their puiya and papa, the mountain which is renowned as being indeed moksha itself, the mountain on which flow holy streams with pellucid walers, the mountain that is extolled as the abode of all righteous actions, the mountain that secures all the enjoyments of Paramapada (the region of dazzling gold), the mountain that is longed for by the eternal săiris and the people of this earth - that mountain is only the mountain described in the Vedas and famous as lhe Venkata Hills. 

(3) Hastigiri (Kancheepuram ) where dwells Sri Rama who, with bis might and with his arrow discharged from his beautiful bow in the great battle-field, sbook down the bunch of ten heads of the Raksbasa who was powerful in the use of missiles and where dwells also Sri Krishna, the great friend of man, who ate the rising batter kept by Yasoda, after churning the abundant curd into which the chura was pressed – this Hastigiri cuts off the sins of devotees leaving no trace of them behind. It does, of itself, the work of the Lord's chakra and lets the latter remain as a mere ornament to His hand : 

(4) That place on the earth where dwell (the devotees of the Lord), who long for the world above (Paramapada) which is the famous residence of Narayana, the Lord of Lakshmi, born of the lotus full of honey (pollen) - that place is as'sacred as the Himalaya surrounded by forests, the Ganga, the Cauvery, the sea, the holy cities (like Ayodhya, Mathura, Kasi and Kanchi) and Sri Vaikanta all in one. 

PLACE OF RESIDENCE , 

195 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The place which is not to the liking of the minds of those who taste the nectar of the stories of Bhagavan (Vaikunta) - that place does not shine in the world, merely because it is called Kasi, (Kasi: that wbich shines); it does not become a (suitable) place of residence merely because it is called Ayodhya; it does not save us from our sins merely because it is called Avanti (Ave to protect); Kanchi is not excellent because of its name; nor is Madhura considered & seat of excellence merely because it is called Madhura. So also other cities do not become worthy merely because of their nanes, (if they are not to the liking of those who delight in the ambrosia of stories concerning Bhagavan (Vaikunta ). 

(20) THE CHAPTER ON THE DEPARTURE OF THE 

SELF (FROM THE BODY) 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The Lord merges the aggregate of the senses in the mind, the mind with the senses in the vital breath (prāža), the vital breath with these in the self or soul, the self in the subtle elements (Sakshina bhutas ) and the self with these elements in Himself (the Supreme Self) very soon. So far, the process of the soul's departure is common to both the person who has realised Him and the person who has not realised Him. Thereafter, the Lord leads the sell through different veins ( nūdi) which lead either to the (dark) path of smoke or to the shiping path of light (archirādi) or elsewhere in accordance with the qualifications (of each individual). 

NOTE:- The soul of the man who has realised Brahman is said to be led through a vein issuing out of the head into the shining path of archis along which it passes into immortality in Vaikunta. The soul of the man who has not realised Brahman is led through other veins into the dark path called dhuma or smoke. He will be born again in samsara. 

"Having 'given up all upāyas, and having given up also all desires including the desire to enjoy one's self, I seek as my refuge, 0, Lord, Thy feet which measured the world." When with these words, the prapanna takes the feet of the Lord, the Lord takes him by the hand, which, it has been said, is the only support of the prupanna: "The hands of the Lord who is called Janar dapa and who has been bought with the price of bhakti is the only support for the prapanna." The Lord who has been called "the king PA of kings of all (beings)" and who is the possessor of the two glories, Lila Vibhūti (in this world) and Nitya Vibhuti or eternal glory in Paramapada, (having taken bim by the hand)

fixes him in a place of His own liking and the prapanna leads his life there, being held in as high regard as an anointed queen and following such occupations as are consistent with his exclusive and supreme attachment to the Lord. 

DELAY IN THE ATTAINMENT OF THE GOAL : 

Among prapannas, there may be (some ) wbo, on account of certain specific evil deeds done in past lives which have begun to operate now, may become subject to such lapses as the follow. ing :- (1) They may display the feelings of 'I' and 'mine' (ahankāra and manakīra) (2) as a result of these (feelings) they may commit offences; (3) they may display & taste or desire for other objects than the Lord; (4) owing to this desire they may contact other deities; (5) they may be weak-minded; owing to this (weak-mindedness ), they may desire to adopt other upāyas. There may be others who, owing to good deeds done in past lives which have begun to yield their fruits in this life and owing to the specific nature of the request for benefits made at the time of prapatti, have never swerved from the service of the Lord. It may be asked what is the nature of the delay in the release from samsāra in the case of these two classes of prapannas. The answer is as follows: 

(1) In this matter, prapaninas will never have the feelings of 'I' and 'wine' in any deep-seated form such as the Charvü. kas (materialists) have. Even people who walk warily sometimes stumble; so also prapannas may, on rare occasions, show these feelings; but these improper feelings or potions will disappear by later wisdom originating in reason. (2) In the chapter on the atonement for offences, we explained how, if offences are com. mitted, they will last only until the time of winning pardon or the undergoing of panishment and how the offences will be expiated within the required tine. 

In the case of those who performed prapatti without indicata ing any definite tine (for the attainment of moksha), it is said as 

198 CH A PTER 

CHAPTER 

follows: "The man who has performed prapatti to me and who has not abstained from sins committed frequently, attains me late after wearing out all his sins." 

(3) "Since the prapanna is bent op attaining mioksha, he is not likely to have any long-standing desire for other benefits. Like those who have both Brahna bhāvana and Karma bhavana, (Brahma, Radra and the like), they might entertain a desire for other benefits along with the desire for moksha; if so, Iswara, who is their well-wisher, will not grant them those (so called) benefits ( as they are not for his good); for it is said :-"Even when the bhakta prays for it, Iswara does not permit him to do what is not good to himself. Does not the mother prevent her child that longs to fall into the fire ?" It is said also :-- " He whom I want to bless -- his wealth I take away from him. His relations will then desert him. He will become miserable. If, in his misery, he still clings to me, I confer on him such blessings as are unattainable even for the devas." The same idea is found in the story of Kunda dhāra. Sometimes Iswara creates in the prapanna a distaste for these other things by making hinu realise that they are trivial, tran sient and mingled with pain. Sometimes, as in the case of Soubbari and Kuchela, he gives them the benefits desired by them, but makes them feel an aversion to them afterwards. 

(NOTE:- Kundadhara : A certain man who was devoutly attached to Kundadhara begged him for wealth. Kundadhara, instead of grapting wealth, saw to it that his follower should become attached to dharma). 

Thus the man who performed prapatti indicating the time when he should attain moksha, will have acquired an aversion to other benefits than the Lord within the prescribed time. In the case also of the man wbo did not indicate any such time while performing prapatti, there will be delay, as bas been stated in the sloka: - "The man who is desirous of performing such karma as is a

means of obtaining other benefits (than God ) enjoys pleasures unmingled with pain, and at last acquires a distaste for them (and the spirit of renunciation ), after which he reaches the abcde of Bhagavan. In accordance with this, the delay in his attainment (of the supreme goal) will be only until the birth of aversion to worldly objects. 

(4) In regard to contact with other deities, the Ruler of All will bring bim back some day or other into the company of those who are staunchly and exclusively devoted to Bhagavan, correct his lapse until he gets ashamed and thus remove his deviation from the right path. 

If, in some, this contact with other deities becomes permanent, it may be inferred that the adoption of prapatti as an upaya was incomplete in their case. It may also be understood that they may have such things &$ Naraka in future. In & man of this descrip tion, the fragmentary prapatti performed to Bhagavan may, at some time in the future, attain completion and become effective. 

(5) In those who performed prapatti after the rise of full and great faith, there will not be any weak-mindedness nor the desire to adopt other piyas. If these - viz., weak-mindedness and the desire to adopt other means -- are present, it is to be inferred that their former faith was not strong enough. The Lord of All will correct these men also until they acquire great faith and make them perfect prapannas. 

In the case of those in whom no such lapses occur, there is no possibility at all of delay in the attainment (of the snipreme goal). There will be delay for them only as long as they desire it. They will attain moksha at the time when they desire to have it. The Adhikūrī who has attained the true state of a prapanna will always be the favourite of the Supreme Ruler, who is the Lord of Lakshmi, as pointed out in the passage. "O, Thou, Lord of

Srirangam, that delightest in those idle* men (prapannas ) who stand outer-most (as being incapable of karma yoga, jnana yoga or bhakti yoga )". 

In the case of this prapanna, the Lord who is the uncondi tional seshi of all, who is independent of all others and without limitations of any kind and whose will is irresistible, withholds bis desire to punish, which is the cause of all fears, at the very first ponent in which he utters the sentence expressing prapatti, in the same way as at the beginning of the meditation in the case of the upāsaka or bhakti yoga nishta, who has adopted prapatti as a means to bhakti, of wbom it is said. " When the evidya com. mences, the destruction of former sins and the absence of contact with subsequent sins (occur), for so the srutis say". The Lord makes up His mind (at that very instant) to bring him and those who are bis followers into the company of the eternal sūris and, pot satisfied with having done only this, He devours, as it were, all the heaps of sips committed by those who have sought Him and does not reveal any trace of them outside and feels also that He should stomach even more of these sins). He removes the sins of his followers too, even when they are committed deliberately, by His will to grant the prapanna His blessing. In virtue of this, they will expiate their sips by repentance and the like. It is said: "He ('the Lord) hastens to give Paranapada to the man who is fit for mukti". The Lord pities the prapanna for the delay wbich he has chosen and hasteps to create in him an impatience of delay (in attainment). He produces in him an eagerness to attain the goal as illustrated in the following (verses ) :- * 10 Hereafter I do pot want to be born in this world of ignorance" and "Do not deceive me as Thou didst before. I swear by Thee and by Thy 

NOTE:-. They are called 'idle', because, after praparti they do not seek any other upaya. They are said to stand "outer-most" because, being unable to adopt karma yoga, jnana yoga and bhakti yoga, they have adopted the upaya prapatri) which is prescribed in the Charama sloka of the Gita.

queen whose beautiful locks of hair shed their fragrance like a gar land on Thy chest - I swear that I must be taken to Parama. pada." Having made him so eager and so impatient to obtain the goal, the Lord decides on giving him Paranapada as desired by him at the end of this life, which has come to him as a result of past karma: So bas it been said :-"Our Lord" is the greatest benefactor that confers Vaikunta on those who have performed prapatti, when they happen to die". The Lord* has already seen to it that the fetters of gold and iron which bind bim to samsāra namely, his pāpa and puriya, past and future, as also the karma wbich has begun to operate, except that portion of it which he has agreed to expiate (during this life) are cut off without any trace being left at all. It is said :- "The sins 1% of the past and the sios committed after prapatti vanish like cotton thrown in the fire." So when the time for leaving the body has come, the Lord causes bis meritorious deeds (purya) and his sins (pūpa) to be divided and distributed among others, namely, those who were bis well-wishers and those who did evil to bim, respectively, as the consequence of the good and the evil wrougbt to him by them. For it has been said:-- "The man "who is about to attain mukti leaves his purya and pāpa to bis friends and foes respectively and attains Brahman as the fruit of bhakti yoga". and again "The sins 15which are notorious in this world add which, oppressive like Yama, make a man sink into samsära left the man about to attain inukti without making the least noise and entered into plants (vix, his foes )". The authors of the Smritis have expressed the truth contained in the Upanishads in tbe manner stated above; 

· THE PRAPANNA MAY DIE AT ANY TIME, DAY OR NIGHT, IN THE BRIGHT OR IN THE DARK 

HALF OF THE MONTH : ETC. In regard to those who are desirous of other benefits than moksha and who have not fulfilled completely the means of attain. 

* NOTE:- Even punya karma which would lead to swarga is a fetter (though of gold ), because it stands in the way of moksha. 12. Tiruvoymozhi: 9-10-5

ing moksha, it has been said in the Smriti, and in the science of the celestial bodies, in the context of the departure from the body that 18"Day-time, the bright half of the bonth (Sukla paksha) and the Uttarayana are favourable times for those that die". But (as the prapanna has adopted successfully the proper upāya) there is no such rule for him in regard to the time of death. For it has been said about him ;-"It is not right to say that the man who dies at night will not attain moksha, for the association with karma lasts only as long as the body lasts ", and again " For the same reason, the views is not right that the man who dies in dakshiņāyana will not attain moksha." Whether in the day of man or in the night of man, whether in the day of pitris (s'ukla paksha ) or in the night of the pitris (krishịapaksha ), whether in tbe day of the gods (uttarāyana ) or in the night of the gods (dakshiņāyana ) - at the time appointed by the Lord, He makes him ren ember all his previous thoughts and desires (for moksha) and like a king who is gracious and who cuts off the fetters of the prince lying in the prison-house, the Lord takes him along with Him. He causes some occasion or other suited to the time, for the soul's parting from the body without regard to auspicious or inauspicious time. 

THE PROCESS OF THE SELF LEAVING THE BODY: 

Then the Lord makes the ten external senses like speech merge in the mind and the mind with the senses of action and of knowledge, wbich are thus eleven in number, merge in the vital breath (prāna) and the vital breath in the self. Then at the moment of the shaking of the bone in the back called vamsa, the Lord cburns out the subtle elements from the gross body (sthila deha) and contacts the self with the subtle elements (sūkshna bhiita) and then comforts the self so mingled with the senses, the vital breath and the subtle elements by keepiog it by the side of Himself in the form that He has assumed in the heart; for, by

nature, He is its friend and well-wisher. After giving the self rest and relaxation, the Lord sees that the self passes out of the body. So far, the process is the same both for the man who has realised Brahman and for the man who has not. 

THE PATH OF THE JOURNEY AFTER DEPARTURE: 

(In regard to this passage of tbe self froin the body), it has been said as follows: "The Jiva who abides in the beart like a lamp bas innumerable veins (nädi). They are of many colours:--- white, black, violet, bloe, golden yellow, yellow and red. Among these veids (1ādīs), which are of varied colours, there is one which proceeds upwards. The individual self (Jiva) who passes through this vein breaks through the sphere of the sun and, having passed beyond the world of Brahma, reaches the highest state. One bundred other rādīs also go upwards. The Jiva who goes out through them attains the bodies of the devas and reaches their worlds. Some nädis of various colours go downwards and they are dim. The Jiva who goes out through them is born in samsāra in this world, without any choice on his part, in order to experience the fruits of his karma. (Since the nädīs are like rays proceeding from the heart which is like a lamp, they are called rays (rasmis). 

The Lord sees to it that the self of the prapanna does not go out through any of these rādīs which lead those that are thieves of themselves, (i. e.) who do not realise that they belong to the lord) to svarga and naraka (hell) and are therefore like the routes along which thieves take their victims. He makes the prapanna's self enter the Brahma Nīdi, which is beyond the hundredth among those nādīs that go upwards and which leads to the shining path called archiradi, and helps it to start with the support of the rays of the sun. 

When Kooratbalvan (Sri Vatsapkamisra) wes in his last momente, bis tongue was parched with the fatigue (of the moment) and (unable to speak or atter any words) he caught 19. Yagnyavalkya Smriti: 4-166-169 

204 CHAPTER 

hold of Sri Ramanuja's feet. At that time Sri Ramanuja whispered the Dvaya Mantra in his ear. The other disciples, who were there, said to themselves with mental depression :- "How can we hope to get this blessing ( Dvaya being whispered in the ear by Sri Ramapuja)? What shall we do?" Sri Ramapuja understood their fears and said, "Do you not know the true character of Alvan? When he is in this condition (unable to say anything owing to the parched throat), what I did was only like placing a little camphor and a piece of sugar-candy (in his mouth, to make it wet). I did not whisper the Duaya in order to make the upüya complete with its accessories". The disciples were relieved on hearing this. 

NOTE:- The idea is that the prapanna will attain moksha. even if he is unconscious and unable to utter the Dvaya or other mantras. 

Therefore as has been said in the following two slokas: " The man who has performed prapatti, whether he dies in a holy place or in the house of one who eats dog's flesh, will attain moksha even if he dies unconscious," and, "The 1279n who, wben his mind is in its normal condition, when the body is not shattered, and when the elementary constituents of the body (dhatu) are in perfect equipoise, meditates on we who have the world as my body and who ani pot subject to births due to karma w when tbat man lies like a log of wood or a piece of stone in his dying moments, I think of (him) my devotee and lead him to attain the highest state", and as has been stated also in the Tainil verses , -- "O, Lord *that reposest on Adi Sesha in Srirangam, a man seeks refuge under the strong in order that he may obtain their support when he is in distress; though I am not like Tby devotees who know how to seek Thy help, yet I approach Thee, since Thou wert gracious even to the elephant; when the langoor of the dying moment has come, I may not be able to think of Thee. Therefore I entreat Thee, even now, that, at that time, Thou shouldst come to my rescue," -- as bas been said in these passages, the prapanna 

20. Varaba Charama Sloka : 21. Perialvar Tirumozhi : 4-10-1

THE DEPARTURE OF THE SELF 

205 

need not seek the remembrance (of God) in his last moments (by any effort of his own ). 

THE LAST THOUGHT : 

The statement:-"At *the time of casting the body away, you will be in full possession of your intelligence owing to my grace; you will have a vision of me and will have all your previous memories and desires (for moksha )" -- this statement, too, bas to be interpreted in a manner that would not be in copflict with the verses cited above. This is how it should be interpreted. Some acharyas interpret as follows:-"The statement made in (Saranagati Gadya) applies to those prapannas who, wbile performing prapatti, begged also for the remembrance of the Lord) in their last moments." This interpretation cannot be ac cepted for the following reason :There must be some-last thought or other at the time of casting off the body and this thought must have some object or other. If the object that is thought of were other than the Lord, it would become dangerous, for it has been said. " Whatever object one thinks of at the time when one leaves one's body -- that alone will one attain (after death)", So we have to conclude that) if the inan has performed prapatti as an independent means (whether or not he begged for the remen. hrance (of the Lord) in his last moments while performing prapatti,) he will get that remembrance as stated in the Gadya. This is the interpretation favoured by some ūcharyas. In the verses from Sanskrit and Tawil quoted above (where the last remembrance is not declared to be necessary), what is meant is that the last rene obrance is not prescribed for the prapanna as something to be effected by his own effort as an upaya. In the eighth chapter of the Gitä, and in the sloka which says :-"That Bhagavan whom the yogis keep in their minds by an effort at the time of leaving the body-keeping that Bhagavan in mind, Bhishma gave up his body. Was he got one who attained the fruit of bis bhakti or upāsana ?" (The last remembrance comes as 22. Saranagati Gadya: 

24. Mahabharata : Santi Parva : 46143 23. Bhagavad Gita: 8-6 

206 

URI CHAPTER 

PTUR 

an upaya for those who adopt bhakti as the means and it comes by their own effort); but in the case of the prapanna, the remem. brance comes out of the Lord's grace alone. " Kevalam madiya dayaya" are Sri Rananoja's words. Wbat does this last remembrance' mean? When speech and other activities have be come itppossible, the remembrance or thought which arises in the mind before the mind, too, ceases to function-this is the last remembrance. Those who stand by cannot know it. Sri Ramanuja's commentary on the Brahma Sutra: “It is geen " that the mind functions even after the senses have ceased to do 80", means only this, that the miod's functioning may be inferred by some sign or other. It may also describe his own experience in some states of ill-health and the like. Therefore this last remembrance is a thing that could be known only to the man who becomes a mukta and to (the Lord) who gives him moksha. 

After this, the self, whether it be of the yogi or of one who is pot a yogi, takes repose by the side of the Supreme Being who is in his heart (Harda) and is in a state similar to that of dreamless sleep (sushupti). 

It may be asked whether the description contained in the slokās and Tamil verses quoted above (Nos. 20 and 21)-such as being like & log of wood or like a piece of stone, and loss of all remembrance or consciousness may not be a reference to this state of sushupti. The answer is that if so, there would be no special consideration for the prapanna ( which certainly there is). 

Thereafter (i.e. after repose by the side of the Supreme Being), the self or soul attains perfect knowledge being awakened by the Lord (who is wise) and who says that "the Jiva gets knowledge, ** memory and forgetfulness only from Him." Lighted by that know ledge, it enters into the Brahma Nadi. Thence a forward Time is one eternal day for the self.

THE DEPARTURE OF THE SELF 

207 

TAMIL VERSE: 

To the prapanna (who is a devotee of Sri Ranganatha) who departs from the body which is an transient as lightning and who is to journey from the central Brahma Dadi, along the beautiful and shining path (of archiradi), which is free from all impediments, the place of his departure is itself an auspicious place, the day of his departure is itself an auspicious day, the omens and signs that are then seen are all auspicious, whatever they may be. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Like a father who descende into a well full of slushy mire to take out his son that has fallen into it, the Lord, (in His līlā), abides in the cave of the heart (dahara) and at the time of our leaving the body, He helps us to enter the rūdī which is beyond the hundredth, so that we may start on our journey to the city that was not built by any one.

Fire (archis), day.time, the bright half of the month sukla paksha), Uttarāyaṇa and the year, thence Vayu, Surya, Chandra and then Lightning, Varuna, Indra, Prajapati or Brahma -- having traversed this path in the order given above, the self crosses the river Viraja; then follows the wonder that defies (all description in words. 

THE ROUTE CALLED ARCHIRĀDI : 

Thus the Lord who lives in the heart add who is full of love (for the Jiva) starts with the self who desires mukti and who bas entered into the nädi in the head from out of Brahmapuri, pamely, the gross body, by the Brahma Nädi, which is, as it were, the main gate (of that city). In this He resembles & king who walks to and fro with his charming child in bis arins.

As has been said in the following verses :- "The self' passes through a beautiful opening in the centre of the sphere of the sup." "The "self makes an opening in the sphere of the sun, whose rays fill his chariot". "He goes through the middle of the sphere of the fiery sun", "The Lord' helps him to climb up by a ladder to Vaikunta through the sphere of the sun whose hot rays dispel the darkness and then removes the ladder," - (as described in these verses), the Lord sets the self on the path called devayına and leads him Himself with the following to guide bim, namely, archis or fire, day, the bright half of the month, Uttarayana and the year, Vayo, Surya and Chandra and Lightning: with Lighto. ing who is called also amunava and his companions, Varuna, Indra and Prajapati, the self is belped on its way.

says :- " With these guides who are immortal, he reaches Vaikunta and casts off this beaatiful prison bouse of samsāra." 

NOTE: Fire, Day, Suklapaksha, Uttarayana and the year arc, of course, inanimate; but the deities presiding over them (abhimani devatas) are the guides here referred to.) 

ENTERTAINMENT ON THE WAY: 

The Lord has said, “I remember my devotee and lead him to the supreme goal." In every one of these regions on the way (which belong respectively to Surya, Chandra etc.), the self enjoys all those delights which are described at great length in the sāstrās of Bhagavan (Āgamis). Thereafter it arrives at & region wbich it has long been eager to see and which has been described as follows:- "When 'shall I see with my own eyes the world called Vaikunta? It sbipes brilliantly, it is always with Bhagavan who is possessed of the six attributes, like jnana; it can never be attained by those who are not devoted to Vishnu; it is free from the three qualities of prakriti or matter (sattvam, rajas and tamas). It is full of the eternal sūris who divide the day into five parts and render the service to the Lord appropriate to each; it is also full of released souls who are like the eternal sūris. It has presence chambers, balls, and mansions. It is beautiful with forests and gardens; it has broad and deep wells, lakes and groves which adoro it. It is free from the sufferings due to prakriti; it is fit to be praised by the devās. It shines like ten thousand suns sbiping at once; it is constituted of pure sattvam unmingled with rajas and tamas," 

As soon as the self arrives at this region, it casts off the subtle body ( sukshma s'arira) which was kept on merely for the sake of the journey and not for experiencing the fruits of past karma: it casts off this subtle body like a boat which is set adrift after the crossing of the river and when the self has crossed the

river Viraja, the Lord endows the self with a body that is super - sensuous and not constituted of matter or prakriti; it is helped to reach the lake called Airammadiyam and then to approach the asvattha tree called Somasavana and is then welcomed by five hundred celestial damsels (apsaras) with garlands, ointments, fragrant powders, raiments and ornaments. The self is then decked by them with adoraments suited to Brabraan and the fragrances, flavours and splendours of Brabman are made to enter into it. It is then received by the eternal sūris. As the Alwar says. "The eternal sūris with crowns on their heads coupe ia groups to receive these self's or souls who are esteemed as the ser vants of Govinda in successive generations. They take the self to the tower with high walls which is adorned with banners. The self is then led to the entrance where the gates are kept by guards called Indra and Prajapati and receives super-sensuous (aprākrita) honours befitting a king. This is described in the three verses beginning with 10.9.9.-"As soon as they (the muktas) arrive at the gate, the guards who are eternal sūris say:-" The devotees of Bhagavan are oor wasters. So please enter our abode". "The sūris, who were there, wondered at the blessing vouchsafed to these released souls arriving from the earth. They considered it their own good fortune that these souls entered Vaikunta and wasbed their feet and beautiful women received them with treasures, fragrant powder, the pürnakumbha and the lamp. Then these souls lived ( for ever with the eternal sūris enjoying endless delights." 

Thereafter the self is led into the enchanting assembly in the hall (mantapa) set with gezin. As has been said in these slokas: "I do to not know how long I have spent my time in vain with this prakriti being subject to her sway. How can I remain associated with this prakriti, which takes the excellent forms (or bodies of the devās), the middling forms (or bodies of men) and the mean

I will become one with Him and I will not be one with this non - sentient prakriti. It is in the fitness of things that I should be one with Him and not with this prakriti", and "When shall "I see, with my eyes, Kesava who is black as a cloud, whose eyes are broad and who is playing with Lakshmi in the gardens? and "When shall we all see Sri Rama with his complexion black as a cloud and with bis long arms, - Kama wbo is firmly set in sattva, who has taken & staanch vow to protect those that seek his help and who is bent on relieving the sorrows of the world? Just as the rising sun dispels the darkness of the whole world, Sri Rama will dispel all our sorrow the moment we see him" - as stated in these slokas, the Lord reveals to the mukta His blissful form so that be may get rid of all his sorrows, enables him to acquire bis essential nature (with the *eight great qualities), takes him to His feet and by säyujya with Himself - which means equal enjoyment - places him in the midst of His eternal servants (nitya süris) who enjoy eternal bliss and who (henceforth) are of the same class as be. 

Then the Lord blesses him with the grant of all such services as were desired by him and as are agreeable to Himself, having previously removed all hindrances and enabled bim to attain, bis essential nature, in a manifest form, and without any limitations of place, time and circumstance, so that these services may last es long as his soul lasts. The Lord embraces the nukta wbo has arrived just now and treats him, without the slightest difference, in the same manger as He treats the sūris, who are eternally free from all imperfections and who are like friends of the same age among themselves and with the Lord The Lord is immensely delighted at the bliss enjoyed by this eternal servant of His wbo is

* NOTE:-- In the Stotram and the Gadyam Sri Alavandar and Sri Rama nuja cry out, as it were, saying :- When shall I go to Vaikunta and see the Lord face to face and be His devoted and eternal servant? 

ARCHIRĀDI IS NOT THE ONLY ROUTE TO MOKSHA OR VAIKUNTA. THERE ARE OTHER ROUTES AS WELL. 

As in the case of such meditations as Madhu Vidya which are the means of attaining moksha after obtaining positions like those of the Vasüs, “The pore" quality of sattva makes the self attain Nara yapa who is of the form of Apiruddha. The Lord who is of the pure nature of Aniruddha leads him himself to the Supreme Vasu. deva (Para Vasudeva)," and again: "Koow, *0 best of Brabmins, that this is the truth. Tbose who bave become free from punya apd pāpa, who are devoid of karma which is like fuel kind. ling the fire of samsāra and who walk along the route to the world of Vishnu - to them the sun who dispels the darkness of all the world is said to be the doorway." "This world is sustained by the SUD. With their material body burnt up by the sun, they become invisible as they bave no bodies and are of the nature of the soul wbich is atomic in size. They then enter the god Aniruddha. Having remained in the body of Aniruddha (for some time) and leaving it, they reach Pradyumda remaining now as only mind. Leaving Pradyumna, they enter into Sankarshana who is the deity presiding over Jīvas (abhimani detata). Along with them proceed those who have perform.ed Jnāna Yoga and Karma yoga. Having become free from the three qualities (sattvam, rajas and tamas), they enter into the Supreme Being who is the abode of all, who resides within the Self and who is free from all imper fections. Know that Vasudeva is the abode of all (vāsa) and that He is, in truth, impjanent as antaryāmi ip all. Those who bave

subjected themselves to spiritual disciplines, who have perfect control over their senses and who have attained peace of mind enter into Vasudeva, considering Him as the only object of attaia ment." 

(As in the case of Madhu Vidya) and in these passages cited from the Mahābhārata, it has also been stated that there is another route for muktas :-- "They go from here to Svetadvipa, and reach gari who has the Universe as His form. Then they reach Hari in the form of Aniruddha who is in the ocean of milk. From there they go to Pradyumna, who is the Lord of Brahma and of all others. Thence they proceed to Sankarshana, the eternal Bhagavan. To those who want to have, for ever, the bliss of Brahman, who have attained success in being staunchly and exclu sively devoted to Bhagavan and who perform the worship of the Lord in the five different periods of the day -- to them this is another path (leading to moksha). In the section (devoted to Pancharatra in Sri Bhashya, it is said also that "those who attain mukti give up the worship of the incarnational form (Vibhava), proce 

ed thence to the worship of the Vyiha’and finally after the worsbip of the Vyüha, attain the Sapreme Being called Vasudeva." These refer to particular classes of those who attain mukti. Similarly certain specified routes are laid down for those who attain mukti after remaining for a wbile in the Satyaloka, the world of Brahma. These also apply to special cases such as krama mukti (release by gradation). It is not our object to describe these differences in the routes to mukti, which are diverse for diverse souls, as their know. ledge is prescribed only to the respective udhikäris. 

THE MEDITATION ON THE ROUTE. HOW USEFUL 

TO THE PRAPANNA 

To the man who has adopted bhakti or upāsana as big upaya, the meditation on the path to mukti bas been prescribed as an anga to be performed daily. But to the man who has adopted 

16. Jayat Samhita: 

17. Sri Bhashya: 2-2-41 

214 prapatti as the means, there is no such need. Still, at the time of adopting this upāya, since he should know what his goal is in order that he may be competent to adopt the upāya, the meditation may help to remember the supreme goal. It becomes an end in itself, as it produces a keen delight in knowing that, very soon, the supreme goal begged for at the time of prapatti will be attained. In this respect it is like counting the days before the ensuing wedding. The prapanna will attain the desired object even by a cursory knowledge (of the path) (though the details are not known to him.) 

Of this meditation on the path to mukti, the state of Sita is an example (of whom it is said):"It looked 18 as if Sita was driving in the chariot of her mind drawn by her desires which were like fleet horses, towards Sri Rama, the greatest of kings, who was aware of his nature that always insisted on protectiog those that sought bis help". 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Agoi, Daytime, Suklapaksha, Uttarāyana, the year, the interveping Vayu, Surya, Chandra, Lightning, Varuna, the king of the devas, (Indra) with his uw brella (sigpifying rulerskip) and Prajapati – by these the soul of the mukta is entertained on the way with delights and thereafter it enters the abode of bliss. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

We become exhausted by frequent a acept (to svarga) and descent back to the earth along the path of the Pitris (the path of smoke) like the water-pot going up and down the well by the rotation of the water-wheel. (We become exhausted likewise) by incessant journey, to and fro, along the route to hell.

(22) THE CHAPTER ON THE FULL AND PERFECT 

ENJOYMENT OF THE BLISS OF BRAHMAN. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Led by his guides (archis and others) to the Lord of Lakshmi who is possessed of varied glories in the region beyond tamas (i e.) prakriti and having attained Him, the mukta has bis essential nature in fall manifestation and realises bis inseparable connection with the Lord and as a consequence, acquires the *eight attributes (of freedom from sin and the like) and without any question of his returning again (to samsāra ), he attains, in regard to enjoy. ment, perfect resemblance to the Lord. 

THE NATURE OF THE BLISS OF BRAHMAN : 

If it is asked what is this full and perfect enjoyment of Brahman by the mukta who has traversed the path (described before), the answer is as follows:- He will in all places, at all times, and in all situations, have, for his unsurpassed joys, the supreme Ruler with His countless forma, attributes, glories and activities without missing any of them. This is thus described (in the following verse):-- "She 'will never, in the least, miss (the sight of) Bhagavan whose eyes are as beautiful as the lotus and who is the Lord of the world." (Since the Lord enjoys His own forms, attributes, glories and activities Himself), there is perfect similarity between the mukta's enjoyment and the Lord's. There fore (the srutis) speak of perfect similarity. 

The Lord's svarūpa is delightful as may be seen from the following passages. "He is all knowledge and all bliss". "The Pattainment of Bhagavan is a remedy for the disease of (samsāra). It is of the nature of joy which is unsurpassed and confers joy on others. It is an end in itself and lasts for ever". Other things are

enjoyable in this way: If the king is the queen's joy, then all objects and instruments of his enjoyment as well as the places where he finds delight are alike objects of joy to her. Similarly the mukta finds joy in all that pertains to the Lord. That the Supreme Ruler who has all forms, attributes and the like is an object of enjoyment is evident from the srutis and the smritis. This idea has been expressed in the section on Bhima in the Brahma Sutras. The svarüpa of Bhagavan is called Parama. pada, because it is the ultimate and supreme object of attainment being of unsurpassed agreeableness. Since the perfect enjoyment of the svarūpa of Bhagavan happens only after reaching & most delightful region far superior to all others, that region is also called Paramapada. The essential nature or svarüpa of the Jira, which is the recipient of this joy in the attainment of Bhagavan which is also among the glorious possessions (Vibhūtis) of the Lord and which has, for its attribates, jnana and änanda, is also (sometimes ) called Paramapada. Along with the others, these three bave, in common, only the feature of being the object of attainment. 

It has been said above that such things as Bhagavan's svarūpa, attributes and forms, the region of eternal glory (nitya vibhūti) wbich is constituted of pure sattvam and his own suurüpa are objects of delight to the mukta. It may be asked, “This may be trae. But by sense perception (pratyaksha) and other sources of knowledge, the objects in this world of lilä vibhuti are found to be disagreeable and are declared by the sõstras also to be things to be given up, How then could they viz. the objects in lila vibhūti be objects of delight to the mukta ?" The answer is as follows:-- ** There is nothing inconceivable in this. What appears disagree. able to the man suffering from (excess of) bile is felt as agreeable when the bile bas decreased. Again when the prince is in the prison house it is disagreeable. But when the emperor is pleased to set bim free and to place him by his own side to enjoy like pleasures, the prison bouse may appear agreeable as a syinbol of

his father's glory, although it has not undergone any change. It is said in the Rāmāyana : --" To be with you is inoksha for me; to be without you is hell to me;" again, "To me "living without Sri Rama, the great warrior, in the midst of these Rakshasis, of what use is life, or wealth, or ornaments?" In Tiruvoymozki 4-8 it is said :-"As the Lord does not care for me, it would not at all matter if I lost all that I would otherwise prize highly, viz., my beauty, my mind, my modesty, the sheen of my complexion, my intel. ligence, my charnu, my bracelets, my girdle, my body and my very life." As illustrated in the passages cited above, the objects of this world (Lila Vibhuti), which appear disagreeable or only slightly agreeable, when the jiva is not blessed with union with the Lord, may appear supremely agreeable, when he has become a nukta enjoying without intermission (the bliss of) Bhagavan. There is nothing inconsistent in this. The same object may be disagreeable or only slightly agreeable to a mao bound to suisūra, while to one released from the bondage of karına, it is agreeable. This is the nature ordained for then by the will of God. 

. That Bhagavan, the Lord of Sri, who has, for bis prakira or mode, all things whose agreeableness is dependent on His will, is the goal of attainment is implicit in the words in the dative or fourth case (Närāyaṇāya) in Tirumantra and in Draya. The service referred to before is the overflow of love born of the perfect enjoyment of Brahman and the Bhashyakara las explained it in several places in the (Saraṇāgati Gadya ).

Some jivas attain, ia such worlds as those of Vishnu, the privilege of living in the same world as Vishnu (sälokya ), some jivas attain proximity to the presence of Vishnu (sāmipya ); tome attain forms similar to that of Vishnu (sārūpya): these, too, are sometimes called muktas by courtesy (upachāra), since they are very near the ultimate goal (but they are not really muktas in the true sense of the word). This idea is set forth in the following sloka - "Some live in the worlds of Vishnu; others approach very near to Vishnu; others, again, &cquire forus resembling Vishna's; yet others attain sayujya with Vishnu. This, alone, is called moksha." This sloka declares that only säyujya in Paramapada is moksha. In the same way as a hund red and the like are included within a thousand, sälokya and the like are included within sāyujya. The truth of this statement may be seen in the following sloka : "I do not at all"A beg for moksha which goes by the names of sālokya and sarūpya. I long, O Lord that hast taken a vow (to protect those that seek Thy help) - I long, O Thou with long arms, for sãyujya with Tbee." Sayujya means the relationship between two who are united in communion (sayuk). One might be sayuk with another, although only in the common enjoyment of a certain pleasure. Here in regard to the mukta, the object of enjoyment is Brahman with His prakäras or modes. Since Brahman and the mukta both commune with each other in the enjoyment of that bliss, the inukta is called sayuk (with Brabman). 

In this connection, it may be asked why, in one of the pass Ages of the Veda, the two words, sayujya and särshtitha are employed (in the same sentence ), when they mean the same thing, namely, communion in the enjoyment (would it not be reduntant to use two words when one would be enoagh?). The answer is (that there is a difference in meaning between the two words ), and it is as follows: 

12. Bhagavatam 

12A. Jitanta Stotram 11-26 

22 

THE ENJOYMENT OF BRAHMAN 

221 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Sūpujyam between the two (Brabman and the mukta) means that there is no difference sc far as the objects of enjoyment are concerned : särshtita (between the two) means that there is no difference in the degree or intensity of their enjoyment. (Two wen Day bave before them the same object of enjoyment and yet one of thein may enjoy it more intensely than the other). 

It is true that the mukta has nothing to do with the work of creating, maintaining, destroying and such other things in regard to the world (Jagad Vyāpāra). But just as the father wbo cultivates the field and the sons and others who do not cultivate it enjoy alike the fruit from the cultivated field, Iswara who is engaged in the work of the world (Jagad Vyāpāra ) and the mukta wbo only witnesses it have the same degree of enjoyment in the joy arising from that work. The author of the Brahma Sūtras bas stated at the beginning of the section : "(The 'mukta's enjoy. ment is ) exclusive of the work of the world" and concludes it by saying:" The "resemblance or equality (sāmyam) between the mukta and Brabman is only so far as the enjoyment is concerned, as stated in the srutis, and also by inference linga". Sakatayana has also stated as follows:- Those who meditate on Brahman say that sāyujyam consists in the sameness or equality of enjoy. ment". 

REFUTATION OF THE ADVAITIC DOCTRINE OF 

IDENTITY: 

To those (viz. Advaitins) who maintain that the word Sayujyam, means oneness or identity with Brahman (aikyam), the derivative or etymological meaning of the word, sãyujyam, is at variance, as also the texts* in the sruti wbicb declare that

2) Without any blemish or stain he attains perfect resema blance (paraniam samyam). 

222 CHAPTER 

Brahman is different from the jivas. Besides, their view is opposed also to the strutis which declare that the mukta will attain perfect resemblance (sāmyam) to Brahman and that the mukta will be like Brabman. The author of the Gita has conveyed the same idea in :- "They will attain my likeness (sādharnyam)": 

The Maharshi (Vyāsa) has also expressed this idea at great length in the discourse between Vasishta and Karala and concludes by saying that this is the supreme truth - "The jiva released ** from bondage (i.c.) the mukta, attains the Supreme Being and acquires attributes similar to those of the Supreme Being. He too becomes free from all imperfections when be reaches Him. Hav. ing attained the Omniscient Brahman, he, too, becomes omnisci. ent. Having reached Him who is free from the bondage of karma, he, too, becomes free from karma. Having attained Bhagavad who is free from suffering and sorrow, he, too, becomes free from them. Having reached Him who is blissfal, he, too, becomes blissful. O best of Bharatas, having attained Bhagavan who acts by His will alone (without being influenced by karma), be, too, acts merely by his will. He becomes resplendent and having attained Bhagavan who is without the qualities (of prakriti) he, too, is without those qualities. Having reached Brahman who is without the body and the senses constituted of matter (Prakriti), he, too, becomes free from them. Having attained the Supreme Being wbo is independent of karma, he too, becomes independent. I have thus described the truth to you, O great king, just as it is in reality. Haviog accepted this teaching with a mind free from discontent (asīīya), meditate on Brahman who is eternal and free from all imperfections and who is the (ultimate) cause of the world". 

In the passage cited above, the mukta is called 'independent' (svatantra ), because he is free from the influence of past karma. The Bbasbyakara (Sri Ramanuja) has explained the meaning of 

15. Bhagavad Gita : 14-2 

16. Mahabhrata : Santi parva: 

*313-426-31) 

22 

THE ENJOYMENT OF BRAHMAN 

223 

the word Svarat (literally the independent king) as being not subject to karma'. 

Thus since in the srutis, the smritis and the sūtras, resemb. lapce between the mukta and Brabman (sāmyam) is explicitly stated, those places in the texts which seem to speak of identity (aikyam) between the mukta and Brahman in the state of release from bondage bave to be explained in a manner that would not be inconsistent with the srutis which declare difference between the jiva and Brahman. The word aikyam or (identity ) in such pass ages should be construed in the same manner as in the sloka : "The aikyam between16A Rama and Sugriva arose 0, Lady, in this way.” (Here aikyam means friendship, identity not of self's but of interests). 

If it were not construed in this way, it would be in conflict with thousands of authoritative passages like the following: 

(1) “When the person who is twice-born (dvija) sees that he is different from the Supreme Being and that the Supreme Being is different from himself, he becomes free from bondage and will see for ever (Bhagavan who is) the 26th real. The Supreme Being is one and the jiva who is the 25th real - is another. Since the Supreme Being is within him (the jiva), good men call them one The Supreme Being, O, king, is different from the jiva, and the jiva, who is the 25th real, is different from the 24 reals. Therefore good men do not consider the jīva, who is the 25th real, as being identical with the Supreme Being. So in dread of birth and death, they perform, 0 Kasyapa, karına yoga, acquire thereby purity of mind, and then perform jnana yoga, and then meditate on the Supreme Being as the supreme object of attainment. 

(2) Purushottama's is different from both the baddha and mukta. He is called the Supreme Being. 

16A. Ramayana: Sundarakanda: -5-51 17. Mahabbarata: Santi Parva:

18. Bhagavad Gita: 15-17224 CHAPTER 

(3) He who is within the jiva as his Inder Ruler -- He is eternal: He is free from the qualities of prakriti: He should be known as Nārāyaṇa: He is the soul of all and is called Purusha by the Vedas. The consequences of past karna do not cling to Him, in the same way & water does not cling to the leaf of the lotus. The jīva who is inferior to the Supreme Being becomes subject to hondage owing to past karma and attains moksha by meditating on Brahman". 

(4) "Just' as fire in a ball of (red-bot) iron seems to be one with the iron, though it is really different from it, so the Supreme Being pervades the world and is inseparable from it". 

Therefore the perfect resemblance of the jiva (parame sīmyam) (to Brahman) is only that arising from jučna and bhoga (enjoynept) and the like. Iswara has, for His definition, the following attributes which are like the umbrella and the chamara (insignia of royalty):-- being the canse of the world, the conferring of moksha on jīvas, being the support of the world, being the controller of the world, the ope for whom all thiogs and all sentient beings exist, the one who has everything for His body, the one who is denoted by all words, the one who can be understood from all the Vedas, the one wbo is the refuge of all the world, the one who should be adored by all those who want moksha, the one who grants the fruits (of all actions), the one wbose essential nature is ownipresence, Jnana and ānanda (bliss), the one who is the spouse of Laksbnii. These are peculiar to Him and are His distinctive features. The mukta's distinctive attributes are the following : being sustained (by Iswara); being controlled by Him, existing only for the Lord (s'eshtave), being atomic (anu) and such others. 

THE MUKTA WILL VEVER BE IN SAMSĀRA AGAIN :... 

If it be so, it may be asked whetber the mukte who is not in. dependent (of God) may not, for some reason or other, incor the

possibility of & return to samsāra. The jiva's dependence on Iswars has been stated in the sloka :-“For Kepabling a man to get the good things of life, and for taking away from him the ills of life, there is no one other than Purushottama who is compe tent". The answer to that question is, "There will be no such possibility, for has He not Himself declared :- "Those who *per form bhakti yoga with great devotion and those who have perfor. med prapatti which is considered as & superior form of penance (tapas) will obtain säyujya and will for ever render service to me. They will always be free from the ills of samsāra". Ever in the state of desire for mukti, the mukta had an aversion to the enjoyment of non-sentiment things (matter) and also to the mere enjoyment of his own self (kaivalya). This aversion is now well established in him; for as he sees all things having Brahman as their inner self, there is no possibility of his enjoying his own self 48 separate (from everything else), and as he sees by constant perception (pratyaksha ) the imperfections of all other objects (than God), there is no possibility of his returning to samsāra of his own free will. As his knowledge of the three tattvas, cit. acit and Iswara and of what is good and what is evil, which he acquired before, has now attained expansion without any break or contrac. tion, there is no possibility of his ever going back to samsāra owing to ajrāna or ignorance. The knowledge which formerly in samsāra deepened into the form of love called bhakti and which he acquired by his distinctive knowledge of the specific pature of Bhagavan bas, now, in the state of mukti, become ripened into the form of supreme love, because he has now & vision of all aspects of Bhagavan's distinctive nature of which even the sastras are incapable. Therefore Iswara's great love for him as stated in the sioka : "The jirānī ig** dear to me (How dear he is to me cannot be described even by me, Ominscient though I am)" - Iswara's love for bina is so overwhelming that its flow is irresistible and that its current reaches even those uplands which are connect 

23. Bhagavad Gita: 7-17 

21. Parama Samhita: 22. Parama Samhita : 

226 OB APTER 

ed with him oply in distant relationship. Therefore it cannot be stated that, though he is free from karma, there is the possibility of his retarning to samsāra by the will of Iswara who is independent (and all-powerful). Since the mukta is no longer subject to the injunctions of sastra, there is no possibility of his violating the Lord's command in the state of mukti. He cannot do anytbing opposed to the will of Iswara as the Lord's pleasure is now his pleasure. Therefore the ultimate goal or attainment called moksha, which is of the nature of perfect and full enjoyment of Brahman and wbich extends into service, has now become eternal for him (i.e.) it will last as long as his soul lasts. Consider ing all this, the Sitra-kära said: "There is no return (to samsāra) - Do return, for the Scripture says 80." 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Having reached the dazzling region of Paranapada and approached the Lord crowned with fragrant tulasī, who is ever delighted in doing what is good to all beings, and having obtained our share in service (to them), we shall ever live under the sound ing anklets of the assembly of our achāryas and enjoy delights which will never change and which will spring (from within us) to our great joy. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

May varied forms of service which are the overflow of the blissful enjoyment of Brabmap arising from the greatness of His qualities and glorious possessions which are blended together like honey and milk - may these forms of service in which there is a conflict of hundreds of unwearied desires (to render service ) and which are easy of attainment for such as seers and sūris - may these manifest themselves in my mind!

important in the stāstras (vis, the three mantras or rahasyas), having obtained a clear and acourate knowledge of his own self and of the Supreme Being and conquered his attachment to other inte. rests in life, having acquired a knowledge of what is appropriate for the different kinds of adhikaris, and realised the pature of the two upayas (bhakti and prapatti), having become troubled (in mind) (at bis inability to adopt other upayas) and performed bharanyāsa with all its angas and thus done what he ought to do, performing here in this world the adoration of the Lord (and His devotees ) without faults and in accordance with his state or nishta and in the manner prescribed in the sāstras and having (thereafter) cast off (both ) the gross (sthila) and subtle prak. riti (body), some one there may be who enjoys Bhagavan eternally.

THE VISĀKHASTAMBHA AS DESCRIBED IN THE SATVATA SAMHITĀ AND 

THE LAKSHMI TANTRA. 

In the region of eternal glory (nitya vibhiiti), there is a huge column constituted of suddhasattvam. It is a special form in which Bhagavan appears there. This column or pillar is called Visakha yoopa. The column consists of four parts called, respectively, jāgrat, (the waking state ), svapna (the drean ), sushupti (dreamless sleep) and turīya (the fourth stage, coun ting from below upwards. In the part called jāgratsthina, which is somewhere above the base of the column, there are four divine forms on the four sides called, respectively, Vasudeva, Sankar shana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha facing the east, the south the vest and the north and shining like branches around that part of the column. This collection of four forms is called Jāgratvyiha. The activity of this vynha is the creation, maintenance and destruction of the world. The four forms are bright in colours, white, red and the like. They have also arms or weapons. Above this part of the column is the part called svapnasthāna. Here, too, there are four divine forms Vasudeva, Sankarshna, Pradyumna and Apiruddba shining like branches, as before, to the east, the south, the west and the north. This collection of four vyuhas in the second part of the column from below is called svapnavyuha. These four forms have no activities like creation and maintenance, but have only the will to do so. Their colours, too, are not so bright as those of the lower vyuha. They have weapons but no banners and other accessories. Above the svapnasthana, which is the second part from below, is the third part or sthāna called sushuptisthāna. Here too there are four divine forms with the same aan es as in the two other parts already described and in the same order. This collection of four forms is called sushuptivfüha. These forms have neither activities nor even the will or the desire to acte

They have just the experience of their owa bliss and nothing else. In the form of Vasudeva which is like å branch of the column shooting on the eastern side, there is no such thing as a body with limbs and the like and it shines with all the six qualities. The other three forms, Sankarshane and the like on the other three sides bave & body with hands, feet and the like. But they have no weapons; on the palms they bear lines resembling the concb, and the weapons. These forms have no colours. The uppermost or fourth part of the column (Turīya sthāna) has also similar four forms with the same names as in the former parts. This collection of four is the Turīya vyūha. They have no bodies with limbs and the like but resemble the Vasudeva form of the sushupti vyžiha. They have no activities, no will, no weapons and no lines on the palm resembling arms. All the six qualities shine in the form called Vasudeva and the other three have, each, only two of these qualities. The panes jāgrat, svapna, sushupti and turīya are given to them on the analogy of these states in man in the ordinary world, according to the greater or the lesser activity found in each. The turīya state is like that in a swoon when even the breath is suspended, whereas in the sushupti state, the man just breathes in or breathes out; in the svapna, bis external senses cease to act, only the mind is active, in the jāgrat state, both the mind and the external senses act. 

These four parts with four vyūhas in each correspond to the four stages of development that may be found in the worshipper who meditates on them. On the lowest stage of meditation, there is no full control of the external seoses and the mind; in the second stage of development, control of the external senses has been attained but not of the mind; in the next stage, the mind, too, has been controlled and the man who meditates is seen just breathing in and breathing out with no other activity or sign of life; in the last or perfect development of meditation, he is like one in & swoon, not even breathing in or out: 

PART II The Discussion and clarification of Doubts 

and Disputed Points 

(23) THE CHAPTER ON THE CLARIFICATION OF WHAT IS MEANT BY THE UPAYA 

THAT IS ALREADY EXISTENT. 

(SIDDHOPAYA) 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The Supreme Person who knows all things, at the same time, by direct perception (pratyaksha) and without any aid or instrument (in the form of sense organs), who is the boundless and divine ocean of mercy, protects the world, with the daughter of the ocean (Lakshmi), being omnipotent. Having accepted the responsibility of saving those who follow the right path, He is the upāya that is already existent. 

(NOTE: By Siddhopaya, the author means Bhagavan who is the upaya already existent for those who perform prapatti. By Sadhyopaya he means such upayas or means as bhakti and prapatti which socure the Lord's favour so that He may act as the Siddhopaya). 

RECAPITULATION OF THE CONTENTS OF 

THE FIRST PART: 

We have already described below how the jiva ( Kshetrajna), who has been wandering in samsāra from beginningless time, becomes averse to it by the mercy of God which is awaiting an opportunity (to help him), how he understands from the right sästras (the truth about ) the tattvas, the means or upāya and the ultimate goal or aim of life, and how he becomes eager to attain moksha. (We have already described how he adopts ( owing to this desire for moksha ) an upaya or means (bhakti or prapatti) which is in accord with his fitness or competency, how he thereby does what should be done, how, having realised his state as a 

232 CHAPTER 

prapanna or bhakta, he readers faultless service in accordance with that state and in accordance with the s'astras, for the remain. ing term of his life here. We have already described ), how, after the fall of the body, he reaches a region free from the touch of matter (prakriti) by journeying along the shining path begion. ing with archis and bow he attains there the supreme end, namely perfect service which is the overflow of the unlimited enjoyment of Bhagavan. 

THREE CAUSES BY WHICH THE LORD'S 

GRACE IS WON: 

There are three main causes for the removal of the will of the Lord imposed on men as a panishment for past sins, owing to which the jīvas who are subject to the sway of past karma have no clear knowledge concerning the upaya that is already existent (namely Bhagavad), the upaya by which His favoar is secured (Sadhyopāya) and also the potency of these upāyas. They are as follows:- One is the speech that comes from the lips of Lakshmi: If one asks, **May this Saraṇāgati by mine!" Her reply is **"Let it be yours; everything will be obtained by it alone." Next is the grace of the good ūcharya and the third is the obser vance of the tradition of the righteous. The queans (vyāja) by which the grace of the good acharya can be secared and the benefits arisiog therefrom may be understood from the episodes of Parasara, Maitreya, Sanjaya, Asvalayapa and others. 

NOTE By the advice of Vasishta, Parasara put a stop to the perform ance of a satra (sacrifice) which was aimed at the destruction of Rakshasas. Pleased with this, Vasishta and Pulastya blessed him for his forbearance with a kpowledge of the sasiras and with the gifts necessary for the composition of a purana. 

Maitreya studied the Vedas, the dharma sastras and the Vedangas from his guru and, by his grace, obtained a knowledge of Vedanta by wbich bo realised how the origin, maintenance and destruction of the world occur and how there is nothing other than Vishnu. *Sri Ramapuja: Sarapagati gadya 

23 

HOW TO WIN THE LORD'S GRACE 

233 

Sanjaya says:- "By the grace of Vyasa, I listened to this supreme Yoga, the most secret of all, from Krishna Himself the Lord of all Yogas". Aswala. yana learnt the Rig Veda by his devotion to Sounaka. 

The observance of the tradition of the righteous consists in this :-- 

Full of the quality of sattva, and entering his career of disciple. ship in the right manner and with perfect attention and concentra. tion of mind, one should learn from the good acharya who is without any expectation of renown, Wealth or honours and who is under the sway of compassion, the truths concerning the tattvas and the means or hita, which have come down in regular succession to the present day from the Lord of All, who is the first āchārya of all. While imparting instruction, there should be no unnecessary elaboration and no skipp ing over points that require clear exposition. The instruction received is such as follows:- Madhava' (the Lord of Lakshmi) is both the father and the mother of all the worlds. O, best of men, seek refuge under that Saviour by sāraṇāgati". To those who are faithful and pious but who are not competent to enter on the difficult study of the stāstras, which mighty, owing to tbeir diffi. culty, unsettle the wind, this instruction by the guru is alone important. To others, the study of the sāstras with the proper exercise of reason is legitimate for their own clear understanding and for convincing those who are deluded by the specious argu. ments (of rival thinkers ). 

FORMS OF INFIDELITY: 

It has been said, "He who understands dharma prescribed in the Vedas and the smritis with the help of arguments not opposed (to the spirit of) the Vedas and stāstras - be alone knows dharma, and not others." Those who have not understood dharma by the proper exercise of reason will become rationalistio 

1. Mahabharata : Aranya Parva; 

192-56 

2. Maou Smriti : 12-106284 CHAPTER 

(and sceptical) and will misinterpret the true meaning with specious arguments inconsistent with the Vedas; it has been stated that "by the followers of Kanada (Vaiseshika logicians), the followers of Sakya (Buddhista ) aod the heretics, the dharma ordained in the Vedas has disappeared." 

This misinterpretation or denial is of two kinds that con cerning the glorious possessions (vibhūti) and that concerning the One who possesses these glories. That concerning the One who possesses the glories consists in denying the existence of the Supreme Ruler, the Lord of Lakshmi, or declaring some other deity as the Supreme Ruler and relegating the real Supreme Ruler to the category of His possessions (vibhiti). The misconception or misinterpretation concerning the glories consists in tbis : denying the existence of these glories (oc objects created by God) or considering these vibhūtis as existing but as independent of the Lord by denying their relationship to Him, or declaring that they are dependent on oneself or others, 

ASSOCIATION WITH WICKED MEN SHOULD BE 

AVOIDED: 

Any one of these forms of denial might occur in the case of a weak-minded man who has performed prapatti, on account of association with those who are not fit to be associated with If such a misconception should occur, it is worse* "than the great sin of taking back & thing that has been given away (io cbarity)". That sin will deprive a man of the merit acquired by all previous gifts made from the time of birth onwards. Bat this is worse, for the object of the gift was itself acquired by stealth from 

the person to whom it was given later, and then the person is robbed of what was given to him. Therefore, of the many causes of delusion, association with rationalists (and sceptics) is most to be avoided. This has been declared in passages like the following: 

3. Atri Smriti 

4. Sandilya Smriti 

23 

AVOID ASSOCIATION WITH THE WICKED 

235 

“These who are heretics opposed to the Vedas, those who do things forbidden in the sāstras, those who are like cats (deceiving others ), sceptics, rationalists who depend only on reason, those who are like cranes ( ever injuring others who are near them) - these should never be honoured even with words "; 80 it is said also:-"A map #suffering from starvation may beg money of a king, of his own pupil, and of the men whom he has helped to perform a sacrifice ( yajna); But one should never beg of those who are dissemblers, rationalists, beretics and men with the nature of cranes." Again, “One should associate with good men (i.6. men who know God.) Whether in dispute or friendship, one should associate only with them; one should never do any of these things with the wicked (those who do not believe in God), “Give up the company of the wicked; associate ever with the good; do whatever is righteous, both in the day and in the night, remember always that you yourself and those who are related to you are not immortal.” And again, "Far better is it to dwell in à cage of flaming fire than to commit the crime of dwelling with sceptics, who do not countenance any thought of Souri (Bhagavan)." 

Conversation with rationalists makes men foolish in spite of their seeiog, 'as their 10 knowledge is lost by specious reasoning.' (this association with rationalists ) removes men from every one of the four classes which Iswara calls His own, in the sloka : “My "people" are of four classes and they are all known to be my bhaktas." It would take them away from the group of men whom Sri Ranganatha calls "lads who are worthy of His love." It wonld throw them into the midst of those who are outside the range of Bhagavan's love as declared in: " There are 2A wicked

men who do not seek my protection by performing prapatti; they are of four classes : fools, men who are vile, men who have lost their knowledge by specious reasoning and men who are of the nature of the Asuras." 

Even men with supreme faith that have sought the protec tion of the Supreme Ruler who is the Saviour of those that have no one to protect them - even they, we *know. become deluded by association with others; though they are not cast away, they have afterwards to be corrected by good achāryas. 

Have not the great sages declared :- "If there is were only one sāstra, it would be possible to acquire knowledge free froin doubts. Because there are many sāstras in this world, it is exceedingly difficult to obtain knowledge that is true" and again, "The Lord " dwells in all who are free from doubt. The Lord of Lakshmi never dwells with those who are full of doubt owing to the exercise of free thinking." 

It is true that it has been stated: "In those "A who have bhakti to Purushottama, there is no apger, no hatred, no covetous. Dess nor impure minds", but this is applicable only to those individuals who are perfect in the possession of spiritual qualities. In the case of those who have yet to ascend to that high spiritual level, it is well-known that their minds may become deluded. Thus it has been said "We bear that the gods (devas), in dread of the diminution of samsāra among those who are devoted to Govinda, become their enemies, (i.e. try to hinder devo tion)" and again, "To "truthfulness in speech, there are a hundred hindrances; to tapas or the performance of austerities, the bind. rances are & thousand; and bhakti to Govinda meets with ten

thousand biodrances". Here we will first speak of the doubts (or misconceptions) that are likely to arise in regard to Siddho. paya, the upaya, namely Bhagavan, that is already existent and consider the way in which these doubts may be cleared. 

( HEREAFTER THE AUTHOR STATES POSSIBLE DOUBTS AND MISCONCEPTIONS AND 

TRIES TO REMOVE THEM ): 

Doubt (1):- No upāya is necessary on the part of the jiva : 

(1) Iswara who ignored a man from beginningless time bas Dow concerned Himself with him (for his protection ). This is not due to any action or work on the man's part, but only to the Lord's omnipotence. If it is not so, how is it that when the Alvar asked "The Lord has" Dow made me realise Him and placed Himself within me. Why is it that He allowed me formerly to stray from Him?," no reply was given except that "the cloud 18 which adorned the measureless sky thundered in music". The implication is that there is no answer to this question except that it was the Lord's will to do so. Therefore why should we perform or adopt any upaya (for securing His protection)? Some say, therefore, that, of His own” accord, and at the time when He chooses, the Lord saves us and that the Lord bestows His grace on His servants and protects them when He is pleased to do so and that no endeavour of any kind is incumbent on os. 

This doubt may be cleared as follows :- Although Iswara is omnipotent, He makes the man adopt some gesture, some means (vyāja) or pretext on his part and, in consideration of it, protects him in order that the faults of partiality and cruelty (vaishamya, nāirghrnya) may not stain Him. The Alwar bimself has declared this truth in :-"I seid 20"Tirumaliraojolai" and immediately, the Lord of Lakshmi filled my mind with His presence." (The Vyaja, 

17. Tiruvoymozhi: 10.8-9. 18. Tiruvoymozhi: 10-9-1, 

19. Tiruvaymozbi: 1-7-5. 20. Tiruvoymozhi: 10-8-1. 

238 CHAPTER 

endeavoar, or gesture, here, is the utterance of the word Tirumal. irunjolai by the Alwar). It may be asked "This vyāja, too, is adopted by the Lord's grace. Why did He not make the person adopt it before ?" The answer is as follows:- The souls of men have streams of karma flowing from beginningless time. These streams of past karma produce their respective conseqnences at different times and Iswara has to bestow, on each individual, the rewards or punishments that are in accordance with such karma. If He were to do otherwise, He would be tainted with partiality (and injustice). Iswara did not make the person adopt the vpāja before, as the time for the ripening of the fruit of the karma bad not yet come. Therefore, from the effect we have to infer the cause, as stated above. If this view be not accepted, no follower of any system will be able to answer the question why a person acquires ( at a certain time) such things as eagerness for moksha which did not exist before. That these are dae to the varied nature of the streams of beginningless karma is the common explanation for both those who believe in Iswara and those who do not. Iswara's independence and omnipotence consist in His determi. nation to protect the jiva when He chooses to do so, on the adoption of a vyāja or some form of upāya (endeavour) (or even an apology for upaya ) and in there being no power to prevent Him from doing so. 

If this is so, it may be asked how we are to explain the verse of the Alvar cited before, when be put the question why the Lord did not choose to save him before and received ao soswer and also the texts according to which the Lord is the unconditional Saviour: Our answer is as follows:--The Alvar attaches great importance to Iswara's omnipotence and compassion and ignores the vyāja or vyājas adopted by binosolf, by which special meana he secured the Lord's compassion, when he says. "For Thy neglect of me in former times and for taking me into Thy favour at present, I see no prominent causes other than Thy omnipotence and compassion. But, if owing to Thy omniscience, Thou hast seen any such cause, favour me with a knowledge of it". The Lord gave no reply and 

28 

THE NEED FOR UPAYA 

899 

thereby the Alvar revealed to the world that the primary or promi. bent causes were only His omnipotence and compassion. This does not mean that there was no subsidiary cause or vyāja on the part of the Alvar. From this it follows that the primary cause for making the jiva an instrument of His Lila is Blis omni. potence (svātantryam) and the subsidiary cause thereof is violation of the command of the omnipotent Lord wbich has been flowing like & stream from beginningless time. Now the primary cause for making the jīva an instrument of His bhoga (in Paranapada) is the Lord's natural compassion. The subsidiary cause (sahakāri karana ) is the vyaja (bhakti or prapatti) which extinguishos the Lord's punishment (hitherto) acting as a bindrance or obs. tacle. Bhakti and prapatti which are adopted as vyaja to secure Iswara's favour, are, themselves, the result of His compassion due to special acts of merit. These reveal Iswara's omnipotent and compassionate nature. The prapanna should bear in mind this attribute of the Lord, His being free from partiality and cruelty (vaishamya and nairghrnya) and bondage and moksha being depen. dent on the violation of His command and the adoption of the vyāja, respectively, as they are all based on pramānas. Thus it becomes bis duty to lead the life of staunch and exclusive devotion with firm faith in the compassion of the omnipotent. This is the (real) meaning, 

The omnipotence of one who has no compassion is dangerous to others; the compassion of one who is not omnipotent is not helpful to others and may also cause pain to the one who feels compassion. But the compassion of a person who is also omnipo tent can accomplish whatever is desired and will bring delight to him and be the cause of immediately relieving the distress of those who seek bis help and of giving them what they long for. 

In regard to incarnations, it has been said, "In" the distresses of men, Sri Rama is greatly distressed". (It may be asked how this distress can be reconciled with the delight spoken of above ). 

21. Ramayana: Ayodhya Kanda: 2-40 

240 OB APTER 

It means only this: that this distress ie only in order to give delight to those who are worthy of His grace. In the case of wicked men with the nature of Asuras, the distress assumed by the avatār is to make the evil-doer become deluded into thinking that he is not Iswara's incarnation. The great snges have declared the truth of what has been said so far in the following vlakas: "It *is Bhagavan alone that rules over time and death over those that move and those that do not move. I am stating the truth to you; the Lord of all the worlds, though possessed of omnipotence and omniscience, begins to act (during incarnations ), as if He were only a weak tiller of the soil. In this way, by His association with wonderful powers, He deludes the world, bat those who seek refuge ander Him are never deluded", and "Sri Krishna, who had large eyes, removed the burden off the earth, deluded the whole world and has now gone back to His own abode," and again "He imitates *A the actions of those who bave the bodies of men, but the fila of the Lord of the world is dependent only on His will". Therefore in the stories of the avatārs or incarnations, the distress is only of the nature of play.acting and that, too, has compassion as its cause. It is of the nature of Tilā or sport to the Omnipotent. Have we not seen hunchbacks and dwarfs often taken into protec tion by kings wbo do not expect any return from them? It is a matter of ma or play to them and, at the same time, the conse quence of compassion. That is why it is said, "The Upanishads ** state that the Lord of Sri creates, maintains, controls and does such other things in regard to sentient and non-sentient things, only for His own sake. It is therefore, 0, Lord of Sriranga, Thy nature to be the means of salvation (upāya ) for the jiva and also the object of attaioment. Therefore I seek Thee as my upāya without any thought of my own interests." 

Since Bhagavan is the seat of the activity for the good of others, He is the Saviour of those who seek refuge under Him and 22. Mahabharata: Udyoga Parva: 23. Vishnupurana: V 22-18

23 

THE NEED FOR UPAYA 

since He places Himself in the place of other upayas (like para bhakti) (in order to protect them), He is also the upāya. Since He is the seat of the fruit of the activity of protecting (namely, His delight), He is the seshi and consequently the object of attain. ment. That His being all this is due to His essential datare (svarūpa) is understood from the pramānas or authorities which help us to know Him, Of the principal qualities of Iswara, such as juara (knowledge) sakti or power and compassion, knowledge and power are qualities which come into play for both punishment and favour, whereas compassion comes into play (only) in conferring favours. Compassion, here, means, the inclination to do good to others. Bhagavan's compassion comes into play in all the following in the creation and sustenance of the three kinds of sentient beings (baddha, mukta and nitya), in keeping them in activities pleasing to the Lord, in the eternal enjoyment of the eternal sūris, in seeing that those who have obtained release from bondage do not return to samsāra, in the creation of all things (like mahat, ahankära tanmätras, etc) in lilā vibhuti (i.e.) in this world, in the pure creation called Ais avatär untainted with matter, in propagating a knowledge of tbe sāstras and in causing through them a knowledge of the tattvas and of the means of attaining inukti, in creating an eagerness for moksha, in enabling & person to do ineritorionis actions which would become the vyāja or upaya for causing the eagerness for moksha, in prescribing upayas suited to the nature of each individual for wiping out the punishment for violation of His commands, in being accessory to the mind being prompted to adopt the wpāya, in removing any obstacles that might stand in the way of the man who has adopted bhakti as the upāya (upāsaka) in standing, in the case of those who are destitute of other upāyas (1.6.) prapannas, in the place of these upayas and protecting them from all danger, in ignoring countless offences of a serious nature committed by the jīva from begioningless time, by being gracious to bim on account of the vyaja or upaya performed by him and releasing him from samsāra 80 that he may enjoy endless bliss, in bestowing moksha 

242 CHAPTER 

immediately on those prapannas who are impatient of delay, and, in the case of those prapannas wbo are not impatient of delay and who have forgotten to beg for a life free from sin (after prapatti), in creating repentance for any offences committed by them owing to past karma which has begun to operate (prärabdha ) and inducing the person to perform the necessary prāyaschitta or expiation suited to his competency; in the case of those who are too hard-hearted to perform prāyas. chitta, in preventing their entrance into the world of Yama and loss of the benefit begged for by them by seeing that they are punished for these offences (committed after prapatti) in this life itself with sufferings (like blindness and lameness ) - in all these the Lord's compassion is the principal and common cause. 

Iswara, who is endowed with compassion as described above, is called Siddhopaya or the upāya that is already existent; thus it is said:- “Those "Brahmins who know the first part of the Veda and those who know the latter part of it, which treats of the Sapreme Being - they state that Sri Krisbna is the eternal dharma (i.c.) the upaya that always exists." Bhakti and prapatti, which are adopted as the means for making Him gracious are called sādhyopāyas (ie) upāyas to be adopted for securing His grace. 

THE CONTENTION THAT THERE IS NO INJUNCTION 

TO PERFORM PRAPATTI AS AN UPAYA: 

(2) The injunction to perform prapatti is contained in the words, "Seek refuge under me *alone". Some say that it is not an injunction to perform prapatti and that this prapatti should be considered as an attribute of the person specified. We answer 88 follows 3. This attribute cannot be held as that of the person 80 concerned or qualified, as it does not satisfy the definition of an

adjectival attribute.* This statement is therefore contrary to pra. mâna or authority. If this were not 80, while Iswara is the upāya for bhakti, the sāstras which prescribe certain forms of medita. tion and the like might also be considered as speaking of the attri. butes of the person concerned and not actions to be performed. 

THE ROLE OF SIDDHOPAYA AND SADHYOPAYA 

(3) Therefore the exaggerated statement of some that prapatti is not an upaya is only to be taken as stressing the impor tance of Siddhopāya (1.6.) Iswara who is the existent upaya (and not to state that prapatti is bot an upāya ). Siddhopāya is of prime importance, because if, by proper propitiation, the punish ment of the Lord is cancelled, it becomes belpful for the enjoyment or experience (of Bhagavān) which is natural to the Self (in its purity). If it is asked how this happeas, the easwer is as follows: When the gem is cleansed of the dust (enveloping it), it shines with a natural radiance, but this natural radiance is due only to the will of Iswara that ordains its having radiance. So also the expansion of knowledge and other attributes which the mukta acquires are due to the will of Iswara, which ordains them. Like. wise, in the case of the eternal süris (their eternal possession of certain attributes is due to the eteroal will of the Lord). Learned men expressed this idea briefly in the sloka : "All 28things have their being in accordance with Thy will; among them some are ever pleasiag to Thee; chey are eterool; Thy noble attributes which are, by nature, subject to Thee illustrate this truth to us". Therefore, though Siddhopaya or Iswara who is the existent upāya is all-important, the mesos of obtaining His grace, otherwise called sadhyopāya, has also to be adopted. This is not 

: * NOTE: "He who desires svarga should perform the Jyotishtoma sac rifice". Here, who desires svarga is an attribute or adjective of the person and the injunction is that he should perform the sacrifice. In Mam Ekant Saranam Vraja, the praparii has to be performed after hearing the vidhi or in junction; it did not exist before, like the desire for svarga in the example cited. Therefore, it is not an attribute; besides vraja is a verb that prescribes an action.

CHAPTER 

at variance with the statements of former acharyas as seen in Tiruvoymoshi (10-8-9), cited before. 

The sloka which says: "The Lord *who took the necessary meads or upāya for making me live, while yet in my mother's womb - is He now asleep or is He now dead in regard to the means to be adopted for making me live after being born ?" - this is sometimes quoted in support of the statement that the Lord is alone the upāya and that the jiva has to do nothing at all by way of upāya or vyāja. It should be taken only as meaning that we should not seek any other protector (and not to forbid man from any form of endeavour). Otherwise one will have to give up evon such endeavours as bave to be made for obtaining food. 

Likewise the following s'lokas:-" The embodied being is like a larop of clay subject to the will of another and unable to help bimself. How, then, cao he protect another?," and " The jiva "lis ignorant and absolutely helpless in matters concerning bis pleasures and pains. He goes to svarga or naraka being directed by Iswara, who rules over all," and also, *"Inscratable is Bhagavan He cannot be ordered by any one. He can go wherever He chooses. He has all beings under His control. Like a child playing with its toys, He plays with beings (and enjoys His lila)" -- in these slokas, what is intended to be stated is only the jiva's entire dependence (on the Lord) and Iswara treating bim in accordance with his karma. (They do not prescribe the giving up of all endeavour on the part of the jiva ). If this interpretation is not accepted for the verse in Tiruvoymochi (quoted above ) and for these slokas, there will be conflict with all sästras and also inconsistencies with what has been said before, 

So far we bave dispelled certain misconceptions that may arise from a consideration of Iswara's omnipotence and the compassion which is natural to Him. We will now proceed to clear doubts 29. Vishnudharma:

294-19 

28 PRAPATTI NOT INCONSISTENT IN THE SESHA 245 

w 

which might arise from a consideration of the peouliar relationship ( that exists between the jiva and Iswara ). 

(4) THE CONTENTION THAT BEGGING FOR 

PROTECTION IS INCONSISTENT WITH 

QUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE SESHI. 

There are some who deny the need for sādhyopaya or the means or endeavour for winning the Lord's grace, by stressing the point that He is the seshi for whom we exist and to whom we belong. (They argue as follows): "Iswara is the seshi and we are like His suoklings as expressed by the sages to Sri Rama: "We "are like babies in the embryo", who ever hoard of a suckl. ing doing anything other than crying for mother's milk, such as paying wages for it? Would it be consistent with the essential nature (svarūpa) of the jiva to perform the surrender of the self (atma samarpanam), to ask for protection, to have full faith in His protection and such other things ?". 

We meet this objection as follows:- The great søges and the author of Sri Bhashya observed, in their own lives, the injunction about self-surrender by begging for the Lord's protec tion with faith preceding it. They have cited sāstras in support of this (traditional) practice and have handed it down as instruc tions for successive (generations). Therefore though Iswara's relationship as the seshi is eteranl, He will not protect the jiva who is subject to the influence of past karma, unless the jiva adopts some form of sādhyopaya or endeavsar (for winning His grace). This truth has to be accepted by every one who holds by the s'āstras. If the sästras are given ap (as authorities), there will be no Iswara at all to stand in the relationship of the s'eshi (to the jiva ). 

It was stated previously that, owing to His being the sosht, Iswara is bound to protect the jiva and that the jiva being the sesha is neither called upon nor able to protect himself. What was said there is (not inconsistent with what is said hore). 33. Ramayana : Aranya kanda : 1-31 

246 OHAPTER 

There, with an illustration from ordinary life, the relationship between the protector and the protected was shown to consist in the protector being bound to protect and being capable of doing 80. It was not meant to show that the Protector would protect in every case, whether or not there is endeavour on the part of the jiva to win His grace by propitiation. If that view were taken, it would mean that all souls should be eternally free from bondage. If it be maintained that, in the matter of protection, the Lord, being omnipotent, chooses to save some and not others, then it would mean that the Lord is partial to some and cruel to others. 

Those who maintain these propositions merely on the basis of reason cannot say that the knowledge of the relationship (of the s'eshin and the sesha ) is alone required for securing protection and that no request for protection need be made. For have we not seen that non-septient things, cattle, deer, birds and the like and suckling children are protected, though they have no know ledge of this relationsbip, just as they do not ask for protection ? If it be held that, though we have seen (such instances ), yet the knowledge of that relationship is required on the authority of the stāstras, we answer that, if so, by the very authority of the stāstras, the special kind of knowledge consisting in bhakti and prapatti will also have to be accepted (As necess 

ary). 

If it be held that what is required for protection is that, while being protected, there should be, in addition to the relationship, no attempt to prevent protection, we answer that, in that case, the Lord should grant moksha to all in such states 88 dreamless sleep (sushupti), (where there is the relationship and no attempt on the part of the jiva to prevent protection). If, on the other hand, it be maintained that there should be no attemapt to prevent protection in those mental states in wbich one is capable of doing so, we answer that we have seen protection of evea non-sentieot things wbich are jocapable of preventing it and of even such sentient beings as cattle and sops wbich attempt to prevent it. 

23 UPAYA NECESSARY EVEN FOR THE SESHA 247 

From the sloka : "Those that whave nathas (lords or protectors) in the world do not perform their daty of protecting themselves. It is their Natha or lord who pats forth endeavours on their behalf, just as Sibi and others did the duties which should have been performed by Yayāti " - from this sloka, it should not be thought that endeavour on the part of those that are to be protected is not required at all. For the word Natha is from the root nath and means, bere, the begging for protection and nāthavantah in that siloka means, by the force of the termination (vat or mathup) those who have a protector. So the word nāthavantah in the sloka suggests, by the etymological meaning of natha and by the termination (mathup) which shows the relationship (of seshin and s'esha) that is necessary for the state of being carefree, the prayer for protection and the act of self. surrender. Otherwise there should be (as said before ) rnoksha for all and other such objections. If it is said that the word näthavantah ia that sloka should not be interpreted as having & suggestion of all the meanings (referred to), we have to state that analogies taken from ordinary life should not be pressed too far in the s'astra on moksha, for they would be at variance with actual and explicit statements made in the sāstra). 

We shall now explain the real purport of the words of trust worthy authors where the apparent meaning would seem to be that, while Iswara is the Protector or Saviour of all, we are not required to put forth any endeavour for our protection. Their real meaning is this. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

When self-surrender bas been performed for the sake of & certain object, there should be no repetition of that performance for the same object, (The need for the adoption of the upaya or endeavour in the form of prapatti at first is not denied ). Even before prapatti, the jiva could not act independently of the Lord. 

34. Mahabharata ; Aranya Parva : 121-2. 

248 CHAPTER 

There is no injunction for an endeavour at a later time also for protection, when once the surrender of the responsibility for protection has been made in 8ccordance with pramūnas. For even in that act of the original prapatti, the surrender of the responsibility for one's protection was made possible by Iswara, out of consideration for some meritorious act performed by the jiva as a result of the ripening of past karma flowing like a stream without any beginning. Since even this prapatti was the Lord's doing, we sbould not be under the impression that we are protecting ourselves. We should feel that the Lord who, we are taught in the Moolamantram, is the Protector of all that He made us adopt a certain means and became propitiated thereby so the to protect us. The (following) sloka conveys the same idea: * My Master Himself makes me surrender myself to Him, as I am His s'esha and am ever subject to Him. (I surrender myself to Him) with the help of the intelligence given to me by Him and am now free from all responsibility in regard to my protection as He bas taken that responsibility on Himself". 

This is the form prescribed for enabling us to meditate on Bhagaven without the faults of the desire for renown, gain, honour or benefit, and of attachment to the fruit, the notion of one's being the (independent) doer and having an upāya. Therefore such things as the prayer for protection are like the child's act of suck. ing the mother's milk and the grace of the Lord flows like mother's milk (after the propitiation). From this it follows that (in stress ing the need for the jiva's endeavour), we do not minimise the primary importance of Siddhopāya, namely, Iswara, who is the existent upāya. 

So far we have dispelled the misconceptions that might arise from a consideratiod of the peculiar attributes and the peculiar relationship (of s'esha and seshi) which aro revealed in the word Nārāyana, 

23

(5) LAKSHMI IS AS MUCH THE UPAYA AS 

THE LORD HIMSELF: 

Hereafter we shall proceed briefly to remove certain misconcep tions which arise from the relationship of spouse that is expressed in the word Srimat (having Lakshmi) as existing between Sri and the Supreme Ruler who has consecrated Himself for the sacrifice or yajna of saving all. As stated in the following siloka, "It is said in all religious systems and in the Vedanta that Bhagavan acts as the Saviour only in the company of Lakshmi, who is the very embodiment of compassion". (The phrase, 'religious systems' here refers to the four Pancharatra systems). 

There are some who hold that, in the former part of the Dvaya, the word Srimat is an upalakshana* ( an accidental sign by wbich the thing is distinguished and not a permanent attribute (or viseshana), whereas in the latter part, the same word means & permanent attribute of Narayana. (If this were true, it would follow that the words 'I seek as my refuge' saranam prapadye would apply only to Narayana and not to Sri or Lakshmi who, in that part, according to them, is not meant to be taken as an inseparable attribute but as only an accidental mark to distinguish Narayana, Since in the latter part, Srīniat is, according to them, an inseparable attribute (vīs'eshana), it would follow that the dative and the namah would apply to the attribute and the substan tive, vix, Srī and Bhagavan. (It would then mean that Lakshmi is not to be sought as the upaya but that adoration and service are due to her as well as to her spouse, Narayana ). 

In this (wrong) view, when the same word Srimat is found in both the parts (of Dvaya) and when there is no objection to interpreting it in the same way, in both the places, the adoption of an interpretation which is at variance with the well-known view 

* NOTE: Upalakshana; In "That is Devadatta's field where the crano was sitting before", the crane is an upalakshana or accidental feature to identify tho field with. It is not a permanent attributc or viseshana of the field. 35. Lakshmi Tantram : 28-14 

250 

BRIMAD RAHASYATRAYASARA 

CHAPTER 

of the ancient acharyas and with the tradition connected with Nammalvar, the chief of all prapannas and which would give two different interpretations to the same word in the same sentence has no justification. For in the following sloka it is said :- "O Lakshmi, with a face delightful like the moon! When (we) try to study Thea as distinct from Bhagavan, (we feel) that Hia svarūpa or essential nature and His being the Ruler over all are the consequence of the greatness, which is His, by His bejag ever with Thee. Thou art, therefore, the part (or attribute) by which Bhagavan is understood as being of such and such a character. Since Thou sad Bhagavan are thus (inseparably) united, the Veda does not speak of Thee separately". 

It may be asked whether, if we take Srimat as an inseparable attribate of Narayana in the first part of the Dvaya also, it would not follow that there are two upāyas viz., Narayana and Lakshmi, and whether this would not be at variance with the texts which say that there is no other upāya than Bhagavad. We counter this objection by asking whether, if we take Lakshmi as the inseparable attribute, as you hold, in the second part of Dvaya, it would not follow that there are two objects of attainment, namely, Bhagavan and Lakshmi and whether this would not be at variance with the texts which say “There is no other interest or object of attainment than Bhagavan". 

If it is now asked: "In that case what is the objection to taking the word Srimat as only an accidentally associated mark (upalakshana) by which Bhagavan is distinguished in both the parts of the Dvaya, the answer is as follows:--Certain qualities, certain forms ( vigrahas) and certain activities are necessary for Iswara being the upāya. Likewise certain other qualities, certain other forms and certain activities are ever associated with Iswara as the object of attainment. These necessary ( things ), also, would be at variance with Iswara being the only upāya and the only object of attainment respectively. So they, too, would have to be 

36. Sri Gunaratoakosam : 28. 

23 

SIDDHOPAYA INCLUDES LAKSHMI 

251 

considered as accidental features and not inseparable attributes, but this would be against the view of these critics who hold that Iswara is the Protector or Saviour only in virtue of (such attributes as) His omnipotence and His compassion. So they cannot concede that these qualities are only accidental features (upalakshana) 

They might argue that these qualities, forms and activities are inseparable attributes (viseshana) and not accidental features (upalakshanas), because they are useful for the purpose of protection. We reply that the same may be said ( with justice ) of Lakshmi's relationship as spouse, both in the first part of the Duaya and in the second part of the Doapa. (i.e.) (She, too, is useful for the respective purposes ). The respective uses of particular things or beings are in acoordance with their nature and may be understood from the pramānas and from tradition. The use of a thing or of a being is determined, of course, by its nature. 

The usefulness of this attribute Srī in Srimat, both in the part dealing with upāya and in that which treats of the object to be attained by that upāya bas been described by Nammalvar in the following verses :- " Lakshmi whop7 abides in the ever-frag rant lotus will destroy the karma of jīvas (i.e.) those karmas wbich act as hindrances to Bhagavan becoming the upāya" and "I will 803 weep Thy temple with the help of Thy grace and that of Lakshmi who abides in the lotus." (So also ) Bhagavad Valmiki declared in The Rāmāyaṇa, the earliest of all kavyas, which is the very essence of the doctrine of saraņāgati"This Sita bis cap able of protecting us from the great danger (confronting 08), O, Raksbasis" and "She ''is capable of saving the host of Rakshasis from (the anger of Raghava)". Such authors as Hiranyagarbha and Kasyapa declared: “We should“ meditate on Lakshmi, who can grant 08 all the benefits that we desire, who can take as safe out of the sea of samsāra, who becomes easily gracious and who

can make us happy." Sri Bhagavan Sonnaka has given this pre. cept. "The man" that prays for the attainment of Bhagavan, who is the purport of all words, should perform prapatti to Lakshmi also." The great sage Parasara wbo received the know ledge concerning the truth about the Supreme Deity from boons granted to him by Vasishta and Pulastya has stated "Thou art, O Goddesses, *the knowledge concerning the soul, the giver of moksha, the object of attainment." Even if, in this sloka, the conferring of moksha be looked upon as an adjective qualifying the knowledge of the soul, it has to be considered as her glory or vibhūti on account of the appositional use (sämānādhi karanya ). The Lord of Sri has himself proclaimed in connection with the meditation on Bhagavan as the Lord of Sri in Sri Satvata Sam hita -"Those *8A who meditate on Bhagavad seek the protection of Lakshmi and with that they easily cross the sea of samsāra which is constituted of these three qualities". Apart from the s'āstras treating specially of Sri, thege sõstras which do not pertain to any special sect or cult are of great authority. 

Alavandar, too, has stated:- "The whole world depends apon the glance of Sri, for its support." and again "Without ** the grace of Lakshmi, the beloved spouse of the lotus-eyed Lord, we cannot have those glorious experiences which one might desire in this life (sansära), nor the experience of our disembodied self, nor the enjoyment of Bhagavan in moksha". The author of Sri Bhashya, in his Vaikunta Gadya, says that she commande Adisesha, Vishvaksena and other attendants to render such service to Bhagavan as is -guited to the time and the circumstance, and that the service to Bhagavan, which is the supreme goal, should be rendered in accordance with her commands.

* NOTE: The sloka says: Thou art the knowledge concerning the self or atma vidya: Lakshmi is in apposition with arma vidya. The meaning is that atma vidya is one of her vibhutis or glorious possessions. Since arma vidya cao confer moksha, it follows that Lakshmi can confer moksha. 42. Soudaka Samhita

too, sings his praise of Lakshmi in slokas beginning with these words: "The "bounds of Thy greatness. O, Goddess, are not known to Bhagavan nor even to Thyself". These words are an elaboration of what is contained in the sloka :- "May Lakshmi * confer happiness (on us) --- Lakshmi, looking at whose face, and with Her will as His aid, the Lord creates, destroys and sustains all the worlds, and grants also such things as svargā, naraka (hell) and moksha. Since the two are engaged in the same work and experience the same kind of delight, the Lord cannot feel happy if he performs the tita of the work of the world without her participation in it," Bhattar, also, bas commented on the word Udara (generous ) used in the Sruti (viz., Sri Stiktam) as ap adjective for Sri in this manner:-"How generous Thou art! O, Mother, to the man who merely raises his hands folded in worship to Thee, Thou grantest wealth, the enjoyment of his disembodied self and even parmapada and yet Thou feelest ashamed that Thou hast not done anything adequate for him." Peria Jeer, too, has brought out all these ideas in his commentary 00 Sri Saikta. Thus, from what we find in the Sruti, Smriti and tradition, (the reader) gifted with insight can under stand that the attribute expressed in the word Srimat in Duaya has its uses, just like such things as forms (vigraha), in accordance with its own nature. 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS: 

You (critics who do not consider Lakshmi as an inseparable) attribute or viseshana of Narayana in the first part of Dvaya) maintain that such things as the qualities of the Saviour (compas. siop etc) are attributes and not mere upalakshana, even though they cannot undertake the responsibility (bhara) of protection and cannot have the will to protect (being only qualities and therefore non-sentient). Why do you object to the idea of Lakshmi being the attribute (viseshana) and Narayana being the substantive 

49. Sri Gunaratnakosam : 58 

47. Koorattalwar: Sristavam: 8 48. Koorattalwar : Sristavam :254 CHAPTER 

(viseshya), when this divine couple have the same pleasure or relish in all actions and when they are both seshis, when there is the authority of the stāstras for it? In such vidyās or forms of medi tation as that of Pratardana, although the Supreme Being is the object of knowledge, we admit that sentient beings like Indra can be attributes of Bhagavan just like non-sentient qualities. Similarly in this vidyā called prapatti, the Omnipresent Lord is the object of approach with His Spouse and with such things as His quali ties in accordance with what is stated in the respective mantras. 

We have already stated that what is understood from the pramāṇas should not be set aside by mere logic or reason. There fore, just as we accept the Lord with His Spouse, as the object of attainment in accordance with the wish of the Saviour, there is no objection to the Lord with His Spouse being the upāya as well. 

Just as Bhagavan with particular qualities (like omnipotence and compassion) and particular forms (vigraha) indicated, res pectively, by the words Nārāyana and charanau, (the two feet) which are attributes of Narayana forms a single upāya, so also Bhagavan with Lakshmi, who appears in the word Srimat as an attribute in the eternal relationship of being His Spouse, may with. out any impropriety, be considered as a single upāya. If it is said that we should give up all the attributes of the upaya in order to make the upāya single, the dharma of being an upaya (i.e. upa. yatua) will have to be given up also. 

It should not be thought that the substantive (here Bhagavan), when it gains some excellence from the attribnte (here Lakshmi), should be considered as previously wanting in some excellence. Well has it been said in the sloka :- “Thou art, O 6 Lakshmi, the property of Bhagavad by Tbine own will; hence, though His supreme excellence is due to Thee, His greatness is not dependent on any one else. A gem becomes valuable on account of its radiance. It does not thereby become in itself worthless; its 

50. Srigunaratnakosa: 31 

SIDDHOPAYA INCLUDES LAKSHMI 

255 

value, which is natural to it, does not diminish thereby, because its greatness is not due to anything else," In the same way as the substantive, (namely, Bhagavan) gaids excellence from its attribute (visēshana), namely, Lakshmi, the substantive, too, has its owa Datural excellence. This is illustrated in the sloka in the Rāmāyana :-"Jast" as radiance cannot be separated from the sun, I cannot remain separated from Raghava". Brightness is the natural quality common to radiance and the sun. 80 also Sri Ram& and Sita bad, in common, auspicious qualities not dependent on any one else, as described in the sloka :-"We bow to "Bhagavan and Lakshmi, who have in their very nature, all auspicious qualities, who are the causes of the world and who are beyond all comparison". 

There is nothing improper in stating that the substantive and the attribute give excellence to each other as indicated in the following: "That *splendour which is Sri Rama is beyond all ineasure, for the daughter of Janaka is His". "Though she is always with Thee, Thy Lakshmi astonishes Thee every day as if she is new; she is in every way fit for Thee by her attributes, her forms, her sportful activity and her interest in protecting others". “Thy Sri LA “Thou artsB the Sri of Sri" and "The Sri of evens Sri " - these expressions show how Sri and the Lord of Sri are excellent in themselves and add also to each other's greatness. 

By the authority of texts in the Sruti (such as "He is the Lord of the Universe", "The Spouse of Vishnu who is the empress of the world", and "The syllable ma indicates that the jiva is the servant of both "), and by the authority of the following sloka, "The world of sentient and non-sentieot beings is s'esha to Lakshmi, (i.c.) it exists for Lakshmi: She and the world are s'esha

to Bhagavan, who is Her seshi. Notwithstanding this, the control of the world is common to botb: the two together are seshi, in relation to the world". By these authorities it was determined by Somasi Andan in Shadarthasamkshepa, that both form always & single s'eshi. In the case of certain special offerings (havis) en joined in the Karmakanda, the offering is made to two deities like Agni and Vishou as if they were single. So also in this offering of the soul called prapatti, the two may, without any impropriety, be the single recipient. As stated in the siloka, "Youth Hand certain other qualities are common to Thee and Bhagavan; however you have divided other qualities between you for your enjoyment and (that in this way) :- Bhagavan has manly qualities like independence of others, control over enemies, firmness and the like and Thou hast such feminine qualities as gentleness, exist ing only for the husband, compassion and forbearance"; the wife is ever dependent on ber Lord and in the performance of yajnas or sacrifices, only the yajamāna is spoken of (as his wife who participates in the performance is implicit, as it were, in the word yajamāna, even when one yajamana is referred to). So also in regard to the teaching of the s'āstras, the mention of a single person does not mean the absence of the wife who is, as it were, inseparable from her spouse. In the verse :-- "Bhakti 5 and prapatti are forms of knowledge which have, for their object, only Bhagavan, the Lord of Lakshmi, who abides in the lotas agd 80 also the knowledge called the perfect enjoyment of Brahman has only Him for its object" - in this verse this is realy the mean. ing, viz., that Lakshmi, being included in Bhagavan, no separate mention is made of her. This may be seen also in the passage: "Since Thousand Bhagavan are thus inseparably united, the s'ruti does not speak of Thee separately". 

Nanjeeyar heard, from Kadambi Achan, what the author of Sri Bhashyam had declared and summarised it thus:-"In places 

58. Srigunaratnakosa : 28 

56. Srigunaratnakosa : 34 57. Mudai Tiruvandadi: 67 

SIDDHOPAYA INCLUDES LAKSHMI 

257 

where Bhagavan is referred to, it should be understood that Lakshmi is also referred to". 

" Those whose object is only moksha and who have no other aim,or interest, worship Lakshmi in her situation as laya (on the chest of Bhagavan) and as bkoga in the image of the spouse standing by the image of Bhagavan. But just as we bow before certain images of Bhagavan (like Sastanakrishna), which bestow primarily the benefits desired in this world, there is, for even mumukshus, no impropriety in such actions as bowing before the image of Lakshmi installed in a separate shrine and worshipped for certain worldly benefits (adhikarārchā), just as we should bow before our mothers, since in all images of Lakshmi (wherever they may be) her being the Spouse of Vishnu is an established fact, 

When such authoritative doctrines are seen in the words of those who are disinterested, those who are still so obstinate as not to give up their wrong notions, are in a state described in the following slokas:- "The fool" who clings firmly to what he has learnt before, the man who is igaorant of dharma, the man who will not have his doubts cleared by those grown old in wisdom - this man will come to grief like a blind man falling into a ditch", and “ To 6 those who are weak in intelligence, who are wicked, who have been bitten by the serpent of specious reasoning and whose senses have become deluded -to these men, truths appear different from what they (really) are", 

In the investigation of the real meaning of the word Siddho. pāya, the following passages should be remembered:- "There is al nothing other than these two. The niales are Bhagavan and the females are Lakshmi". "Just as Vishnu is in all things, so also is she, O, best of Brahmins,". "The heart of this lady is fixed on Sri Rama and his heart is ever fixed on her. Therefore it is that

she and Sri Rama who is the embodiment of dharma continue alive for even the fraction of an hour." "Both Bhagavan and Lakshmi aro omnipresent, since they are inseparably united, they are spoken of as one tattva or real." Therefore, since they form a single soshi, since they are ever of the same wind, since they are intimately attached to each other, and since they are inseparably connected with each other in their svarüpa or essential nature, and in their rūpa or forms, those who are established in sattva should understand the meaning of the word Nārāyana with its adjective Srimat in such a manner as will not be at variance with the inseparablo unity of the tattvam (Bhagavan ) with its attribute (Sri) so well expressed in the sloka :- "Tby ** essential nature svarūpa and the forms that Thou takest and the svarūpa and the forms assumed by Bhagavan are in close embrace with each other." 

( The author summarises the gist of the chapter in a qumber of slokas as follows:--) 

The Lord of Sri, who is the embodiment of compassion and who secures, for them, all the benefits desired by men is called Siddhopāya, because He is already an existent upaya. The ways of securing His favour are such as bhakti and prapatti and these are called sadhyopāyas, because they can be adopted and accomp lished by those who desire the respective benefits. When the Sadhyopaya flows with high mounting waves and increases the flood of compassion of the seshi, who is the siddhopāya, the latter breaks through the flood of filā which is also Hia. By (that very flood of compassion) all bindrances to His service, such as even the former will of the Omnipotent, disappear like dams built of fine sand. Though the acts of propitiation (like bhakti and prapatti ) are prescribed in the sāstras for securing the fruit, yet Siddhopaya is considered as of prime importance, because the Lord alone is capable of granting moksha, since bhakti or prapatti being non-sentient, cannot give the fruit directly and 64. Abirbudhoya Sambita: 4-78. 65. Chatussloki: 4

since Bhagavan alone can act directly. To those wbo have adop ted prapetti &s the primary and independent means, it is specially ordained that they should rest on the Omnipresent in order that they may know that their own endeavour perishes instantly after prapatti. Therefore with what aim, the surrender of responsibility bas been made to Siddhopāya - for that aim, the man should make no further endeavour and depend only on the Siddhopāya, In the definition of prapatti in the mantra for prapatti, in the injunction concerning it and in other passages and so also in Sri Bhashya and the like and by tradition, Brahman is declared as the upāya. Just as we admit that certain (holy) places and the like which exist already are called dharma productive of spiritual excel. leace, so also it is said by those who understand the truth that Sri Krishna is the eternal dharma (or upāya ). This Siddhopaya is to be thought of in the three mysteries or mantrās in such as the syllable a in aum etc. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Narayana, with His Spouse Lakshmi, who is staunch in being every kind of relation (to us ), who is the sea of compassion that dispela ignorance (and delusion), who shines sustaining all (things and all beings ) with His mere will, being the Supreme Lord with out a second and who takes compassion on us on account of ( $ri), the nectar born of sweet nectar - Narayana with Sri is the firm refuge of all who seek His protection having no other support. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The treasure (of gold - vix. Bhagavan), which is not seen 

is witbio them, because they are guided by heretical systems which have not the benefit of the traditional knowledge of our spiritual teachers -(the treasure which they fail to perceive) even though resting on it night and day (as in sushupti) -- the treasure which is proclaimed in the strutis to be itself the means or sādhana for its attainment - that boundless treasure will make its presence (felt) among those who are pure of mind. 

(24) THE CHAPTER ON THE CLARIFICATION OF WHAT IS MEANT BY SADHYOPAYA OR THE UPAYA THAT HAS TO BE 

ADOPTED. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

It appears to us, from the srutis, smritis and the words of gurus fortified by reason, that the Omoipotent Lord being propi. tiated by yajnas (sacrifices ), gifts made in charity, offerings made in the fire (homa ), adoration, surrender of reponsibility (bhararı yasa ), constant meditation (bhakti yoga) and the like in accor dance with one's competence confers benefits op men. This is also what religious tradition prescribes, 

THE NEED FOR THE CLARIFICATION OF WHAT IS 

MEANT BY SĀDHYOPĀYA: 

A man may have a clear koowledge of Siddhopaya (viz. Bhagavan) who is omniscient, omnipotent and supremely com. passionate, who, along with His Spouse, is the s'eshi of all and the Saviour of the whole world: he may even have become perfect in his averseness to sainsīra , by seeing that what is considered agreeable by unintelligent persoas is really disagreeable as stated in the sloka: "Health' gives (only) potency to the senses; wealth (only) creates enemies; long life makes one suffer bereavement of relations, What is there in these things that can delight a man?", He may have acquired an eager longing for the attainment of the Supreme Being as stated in the sloka :- "He who loves Bhage van, the Supreme Being, has no love for anything else"; be may have the feeling of urgency in regard to moksha as stated in the sloka :- "By payiag a beavy price in the from of virtuous deeds, this boat of a body has been bought. Before this boat is broken (or becomes leaky), hasten to crose the sea of sorrow'. In spite

of all these, if he does not clearly anderstand (all) about the sadhyopāya, prescribed in the injunction, “Seek refuge under me alone" and in the sentence which expresses the action, "I seek refuge" (in Duaya), which is the means of extinguishing the punishment inflicted by Bhagavan which biads a map to samsāra and which resulted from beginningless and continued violation of His commands - if he does not understand it, there is no way of propitiating and winning the grace of the Supreme Ruler, who is the Siddhopāya. Tberefore we will remove misconceptions that might arise concerning (1) competence therefor (2) the nature of sadhyopāya and (3) the accessories pertaining to it. 

COMPETENCE: PRAPATTI IS OPEN TO ALL (CASTES): 

1. There are some who will ask: " This prapatti is a dharma prescribed in the Vedas. If so, how can it be said that every one (of all castes) is qualified to perform it?" The answer to this question is given on the authority of the Svetasvatara Sruti, which says that the Supreme Ruler is the Saviour of all. This truth is confirmed by expository passages like the following: “Take me to Raghava who is the Protector of all the worlds”, and in slokas like:--"You should seek the protection of Vishnu who is fit to be approached by every one, who is easy of approach, who can never go wrong and has no one to compare with Him and who removes the suffering of those who perform prapatti". It is confirmed also by passages in the Sätvatasamhita (2.9), wbich says that all the three castes beginning with the Kshatriyas and ending with the Sudras who have performed prapatti, are competent to adore the four vynhas, without mantras. So also is 

"The man born even into low castes who has performed prapatti once to Bhagavan -- that man is protected by Bhagavan from the ills of samsāra oven though he is a patricide or a matricide." 

4. Ramayana: Yuddha Kanda : 17-15 

262 OB APTBR 

It is true that upāsana or meditation (in accordance with the teaching of the Upanishads ) has been deterioined as fit (only) for the three higher castes in the section Apasīdra; bat speaking the truth which is given as an injunction in the Vedas is enjoined for all castes; so also prapatti is a dharma common to all and may be performed either with Vedic mantras or with mantras found in the Tantras in accordance with the person's respective competence, without any violation of propriety. We have heard, in the s'astras, of even such beings as crows performing prapatti. The Saviour Hintself bas declared: "Women," Vaisyas and Sndras that are born of sippers - wboever they might be -they attain, O Partha, the highest state if they seek my protection". Here seeking of the Lord for protection by bhakti or prapatti is stated to be common to all. Even in the matter of upāsana or meditation (according to the vidyās in the Upanishads) thougb the beginning can be made only by men in the three higher castes, the end of the course can be attained by men in the bodies of any caste. This is stated in Vishnudharma in the following sloka :-"Though Dharmavyādha and others belonged to low and gruesome castes, yet since, in their previous births, they had practised bkaktiyoga, they continued it in their latest life and, having completed it therein, attained their goal like *Sramani.” 

* NOTE: (Sabari) or Sramani was of the caste of hunters and attained mukti by bhakti to Bhagavatas and Bhagavao. 

Thus upāsana or bhakti yoge should be commenced only by the three higher castes. But there is no such restriction in the general statement about the competence for prapatti. Further in the special statement about the qualifications for prapatti, it is definitely declared that every one is fit to adopt prapatti. The special qualifications requisite for prapatii have already been described by us. 

Therefore birth in the three bigher castes or the absence of it is do competence for prapatti, when anaccompanied by the 6. Sri Bhashya: 1-3-9

PRAPATTI IS NOT MERE FAITH

inability to adopt other upayas. The only qualification that is essential is ākinchanya, inability to adopt other upayas). This may be seen from the Tamil verse: "I was not born into any of the foar castes to enable me to perform dharma", and from the sloka: "O Thou Saviour! I was born into a family renowned in the world for their fame, their purity, their practice of yoga, their knowledge of the truth concerning matter (prakriti) with its three qualities and the jivas and for their steadfast attachment to Thy lotag like feet, and yet with a mind inclined to sin, I am sunkin samsāra: and am going down." Therefore it is beyond doubt that com petence for prapatti is open to persons of all castes who have & knowledge of the Saviour and of saranāgati and possess also 

MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OR 

SVARUPA OF PRAPATTI: 

2. The statement of learned men that the saranāgati re ferred to in Duaya means only faith in the two feet of Narayana being the only upāya for the attainment of Narayana with His Spouse this statement should be taken to mean only that faith in saranāgati in the mind of the person and faith as an accessory to prapatti are very important. (It does not mean that faith alone is enough). So also the words of the author of Sri Bhashya .--"Pra. patti is faith; it is prayer accompanied by a faith that Bhagavan will grant whatever is desired on account of a single act of prayer" come these words of the Bhashyakūra emphasise the importance of faith at the beginning and then declare in the words of Bharatamuni which define prapatti that prapatti is a prayer (for help) with faith (in the person whose belp is sought). (It has been shown already that) sarrender of self is the angi and that the others (like kärpanya) are angas (i...) Accessories. "Nyasa bastol been declared as having five accessories or angas." Therefore these words of the Bhashya. kara that prapatti consists in prayer (for help) which might mean % Tirucchanda Viruttam: 90. 

10A Lakshmi Tantram: 17-74. 10. Alavandar: Stotram: 01.264 " CHAPTÁR 

that the Lord expects only the prayer for help should be understood only as empbasising the importance of one of the angas (namely, the seeking of the Lord's protection ), for it is said "The 108 Lord expects the expression of the desire for protection". This is only one of the angas (and not the angi). (The Bhashyakara should not be taken as stating that the prayer alone will do). In the shorter gadya also (Srirangagadya), Sri Ramanuja makes the prayer with faith preceding it and concludes with the words namostu te (v.e.) "I bow to Thee". Further be uses the word s'aranam which means seeking (the Lord) as upāya. From these two, it is evident that self-surrender is present. That the word namas in namostute means surrender of self is well-known from such passages as the following:-- "I bow" to Bhagavao to whom, having surrendered his self which is what is meant by namaskāra, & man gets rid of his suffering and enjoys whatever he desires." In Sri Vaikunta Gadya the surrender of self preceded by prayer is explicit. Therefore (since Sri Ramanuja states in Vaikunta - gadya: "Praying for protection), the person should surrender his (or her) self to Bhagaven after bowing to Him,") it is clear that surrender of self is different from the prayer for protection and is the angī with the prayer as an anga. It has therefore to be concladed that in the words: "One should" surren. der one's self by attering this mantra", and "the surrender" of one's self and of what belongs to one's self", the angi which is garrender of self, is declared as a vidhi or injunction. 

If this were not accepted (as true), it would lead to constru ing the sentence "Saranāgati is of 1A six kinds" in its apparent meaning and thinking that the five accessories or angas of prapatti Bre, every one of them, a form of prapatti or angī, in the same Way as we conclude that there are seven different kinds of ablution (snāna) from the sentence :- "Ablution 188 is said to be of seven kinds".

24. 

PRAYER ALONE IS NOT PRAPATTI 

. If it is argued that the angas are not considered to be angis on account of the statement: “One 13Cshould perform prapatti with its five angas or accessories," then by the force of the same argumentandin accordance with the statement "Nyása is tabaccom panied by five angas", we should, in reason, correct such state ments as "Prapatti is prayer" and "Prapatti is faith", and hold that " Nikshepa or surrender is the augi", and that the rest are 

(only) angas, 

Even if we judge by the principle that, (when there is a diffe. rence in the statements ), that statement which is made in a larger number of contexts should be accepted as true, it would be evident, from a study of the chapters on Prapatti in Sātvika Tantra, Lakshmi Tantra, Ahirbudhriya Samhita, and the like, that Nik shepa or self-surrender is the angi. Even in the sloka :-"Thou 18€ Halone, shouldst be my upāya. It is this idea of prayer that is called saranagati", it is indicated by suggestion in the word upaya coming along with the word 'alone' that what ia referred to is bharanyāsa or surrender of responsibility which is the main theme in that context. Even in ordinary life, an accessory is often spoken of as if it were the main thing in order to emphasise some one aspect or other. The word ülambha, which means 'killing' is employed to mean also 'yāga or sacrifice in a wider sense; so also in "seek refuge" in the Charama sloka and the like, the verbs signify the sacrifice of the self or ätma yiiga, which is usually ex pressed by such words as vyāsa, nikshepa and tyāga (surrender), This is in keeping with Vedic usage. 

What is called Väga is a special form of thought indicating that a particular offering (havis) is made to a particular deity. Ātrayāga or the sacrifice (or surrender of self) is (likewise) a special form of thought indicating this : « My soul, which is the most delicious of offerings (havis ), is for Sriman Narayana. We

have already stated (on page 137) that in this surrender of selt, the nature of the action to be performed which is common to all .who desire benefits of whatever kind is the surrender of the res... 

ponsibility for protection. SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Here in the surrender of selt for the sake of moksha, since there is to be made an offering (havis), owing to the injunction regarding the manner in which the offering should be made, there is an additional feature for the man who is destitate of other upāyas, namely, the surrender of the responsibility for the pro tection of the self. Therefore by sach authors as Rama Misra (Uyyakkondar) god others, when they want to speak of the surren. der of responsibility (bharanyasa), a single aspect of it, namely, the abstention from his own activity on the part of the prapanna has been used to indicate prapatti. As in the world of ordinary life, when the surrender of responsibility has not been made, abstention from one's own activity will not result thereafter merely from the request for protection. He who sees the subtle feature that is common to these three, namely, being destitute of all upayas for protection, surrender of respsasibility and the prayer for being the upāya --- be alone sees. (That sabtle feature wbicb is common to all the three of them is refraining from all activity of one's own for one's protection. Since there is this common feature in all the three, the other two are sometimes used to denote bharanyāsa). 

Thus the surrender of one's responsibility for the protection of one's self is the main injunction that is made in all sāstras treating of prapatti and it has five accessories. (Such eminent authorities) as Sri Vishnucbitta, Vadibamgambuvaha, and Varadacharya have succinctly stated (this truth). 

THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ONE IS SESHA TO THB 

LORD IS NOT IN ITSELF PRAPATTI: 3. There are some who say: "When a man has understood the truth regarding the tattvas from the sästras, has be not realised his relationship as sesha to Bhagavan ? Further, in 

24 KNOWLEDGE OF BEBHATVA IS NOT PRAPATTI 287 

the staka, "If you desire to attain the highest state and to adopt the upaya for it, remember that Hari is (your) master and that you are His servant and that this relationship exists for ever by the very nature (of thiags), (in this sloka) -- is not the meaning as follows:- "If you desire the highest goal of life and the means of attaining it, you should understand clearly that you are the servant and that Iswara is the master and that this relationship exists by nature"? They ask "When this is so, is there an action (besides the thought of the relationship) enjoined called ätrasamarpa. nam". This question does not deserve any consideration, just like the dictum (of the Advaitins) that, by the mere kaowledge of the text of the *sruti, moksha can be attained. 

*NOTE: 

Texts like "That Thou art" and "I am Brahmap". 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS: 

To the man who prides himself op having stolen from Bhagam van the gem Kaustubha (which is the symbol of his soul) and who is the prince of all sinners (ie. the greatest of all sinners) the surreader of responsibility (bharanyāsa) (to the Lord) has been enjoin. ed as an expiation. The thought that he is the sesha of the Supreme Being, which qualifies the prapanna, serves also to prevent the theft of the soul (atmapahāra) in the future (1.6.) after prapatti. 

The map first understands from the săstras that his self which is a Real (Tattva) has the attribute of being & s'esha. Then with this oompetency and with the accessories pertaining (to prapatti) and also with the specific idea of the particular benefit desired, be surrenders the responsibility for the protection of bis soul (to Bhagavan) bearing in mind bis relationship as a sesha. This surrender of responsibility which is enjoined as an upaya for the remission of the punishment resulting from endless sins is indeed what is called ātmasamarpana (the surrender of the self ). 

14. Vishnu Tattva: 

268 

SRIMAD RAHASYATR 

CHAPTER 

When it is said that moksha is attained by a knowledge of the truth, it should be understood as meaning that it is only by way of leading to the adoption of an upaya. This is evident from the authority of the injunction (vidhi) contained in such paseages as "Worship** me" and "seek 18cefage under me". 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

The instruction which states:- "From knowledge arises moksha", shoald be understood in one of two ways:- Bhakti preceeded by jnana or knowledge leads to moksha or from jnāna or knowledge, wbich is of the nature of bhakti, results moksha (for bhakti is itself a form of knowledge). 

Similarly the knowledge of the relationship of being a sesha to the Lord which arises from a study of the s'āstra is common to all forms of activity for moksha, by refraining from the worldy life, like bharanyāsa and upasana or bhakti, Since the activity of the s'esha, pamely, service, is the extreme limit of the goalof attainment, it is certainly not possible to adopt any of the upāyas enjoined for moksha, without adderstanding the relationship of sesha to the Lord. Even if a man adopts the dharmas enjoined for the attain. ment of moksha without knowing this relationship of being a s'esha, these dharmas or upāyas themselves will (in course of time) produce that knowledge of the relationsbip and will become the cause of moksha by making the adoption of the upāya perfect and complete. So the atmasamarpanam that is enjoined for perfor mance is not the mere knowledge of the relationship of being & s'esha; if it is asked wbat, then, it is, the answer is that it is the surrender of the responsibility for one's protection accompanied by such things 88 the knowledge of the relationsbip of being & s'esha. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA. 

The contention that the particular kind of knowledge called prapatti results merely from the sentences or passages of the 15. Bhagavad gita: 9-33 

16. Bhagavad gita : 18-66 : 

24 PRAPATTI IS NOT MERE REFRAINING FROM ACTIVITY 269 

västra, that it is, on that account, called siddhopaya and that it is not an upaya to be accomplished by a certain activity -- this con tention also is refuted by the injunction or vidhi (saranam vraja). 

It it is argued that s'arananı vraja "geek protection" merely means “Know this truth (that the Lord is the Saviour)", the answer is that it is opposed to the natural and obvious meaning of the words. It would also be against the plain and explicit rules or vidhis for the performance of prapatti as in the sentence: "Per. forn this prapatti accompanied by its five accessories or angas," If it is held that what is intended in the Charama sloka is merely this, that Iswara is the upāya for moksha and that no activity is enjoined in this siloka for the man who wants moksha, it would mean that it is merely the teaching of a truth that is needed for bhakti yoga, which is the subject treated in that context. (The Charaına sloka would then cease to have anything to do with prapatti), 

REFRAINING FROM ONE'S OWN ACTIVITY IS 

NOT IN ITSELF PRAPATTI: 

There are some who hold that prapatti is merely refraining from one's own activity for protecting one self and that what is enjoined for its accomplishment is only the abandonment of all dharmas or upāyas. The answer to this view is as follows:- Even though it is abstention, this abandonment of all dharmas is itself an activity or dharma of the person for his own protection (and this would be inconsistent with their own words). Further this view is in conflict also with the passage (quoted above) enjoining the performance of prapatti with its five angas. 

The view held by some that the regarding of prapati as an. upaya or as an auxiliary to Siddhopāya (for moksha ) is opposed to the doctrine that the Siddhopāya, namely, Iswara, is the only upaya, that He is already an existent upāya, that He is the Sap. reme Sentient, that He has supreme compassion, and omnipotenge and that He is independent of all others -- this view is at variance 

270 CHAPTEK 

with the srutis and the smritis. It is not based on any general proposition such as: "Wherever an auxiliary condition is required, there cannot be a single upaya" and "Where an accessory is required, there is no independent doership"). Since there are these objections and others, this view is based on fallacious reasoning. If it were considered sound reasoning, it would mean that, even in upāsana, whatever is accepted as auxiliary should be rejected as unnecessary. 

If it were further argued that even upāsana is not a means or upāya, it would be inconsistent with what has been stated else where by those who hold this view, for wbile commenting on the passage, "Having given up all dharmas, seek refuge under me", they interpret the word dharma as upasana or upāya for the attaioment of moksha. If they contend that in order to remove Arjana's haughtiness, Sri Krishna prescribes unnecessary burdens and uses the word dharma to mean what Arjuna, in his delusion or inability to understand the real purport of the teaching, considers as necessary upāyas in the phrase "all dharmas", (the answer is as follows):It is stated (io Yagnyavalkya Smriti 1-8):-- "The adora tion of the Lord, personal purity, control of the senses, aon-violence, giving in charity, repeating the Vedas, other Vedic rites - among all these, having a vision of the Supreme Being by karına yoga jnāna yoga and bhakti yoga is the highest dharma". Again it is said - "Among all dharmas, the dharmal which consists in the adoration of Vishnu is the highest, for He protects His devotee as if he were His own body"; and farther, "There is no other karma" enjoined in the Vedas for the expiation of sins than the adoration of Vishnu". If those well-known dharmas which are described as supreme sad which are activities for moksha of the Dature of abstention from worldly action, are stated to be no dharmas, much more 80 would the dharmas prescribed for worldly ends cease to be dharmas, and none of the sāstras would carry

24 

BHAKTI OR PRAPATTI QUITE NECESSARY 271 

any authority or weight. Those who hold those views would then line up with atheists and heretics. 

It may be asked: (The words in the Gita are): "Give np all dharias". In order that the meaning of the word all may not be contracted or reduced in application, since the seeking of the Lord's protection is also denoted by the word dharma just like upāsanas, should it not also be given up, in as much as it is also an upaya or sādhana? Similarly to consider prapatti 4s & sādhana, or upāya or an auxiliary condition is at variance with the words in the Gita: "Give up all dharmas or upāyas.". We ask in reply :-"(What do you really mean?) If you mean that we should adopt the upaya giving up the thought that it will directly and by itself lead to the end in viow, it applies also equally to bhakti yoga. If it is meant that we should give up the thought of prapatti being a dharma even for winding the grace of the Lord, we answer, “In that case, you will have to give up even the thought that Siddhopaya, namely, "Sri Krishna, is the eternal dharmale or upāya ", in order that the meaning of all in all dharmas may not suffer reduction of application. 

If it is argued that what are to be abandoned are all dharmas other than the one described in this passage - (namely, the Charana sloka ), the same answer might be given in support of the performance of saranūgati which is prescribed in this very passage: (sarasam vraja). 

A further doubt might arise as follows:- “Upāsanas, as upāyas, require that they should be originated or started; upa. sanay have to be promoted to higher and higher perfection; upa. sanas require the fulfilment of auxiliary conditions - Not so, this upāya, namely Bhagavad. He does not require to be originated or increased in intensity por does He require any auxiliary help or means of approach. He is eternal, has neither growth nor decay and has always such qualities as full and perfect compassion which 

i 

18. Mahabharata: Aranya Parva: 71-123. DARA 

CBAPTRR 

are of His very pature. Without any means of approach, He is ever existent as an upaya and is of irresistible might: Of what use, then, are bhakti and prapatti in His case ?" The answer is that they help to obtain remission of the punishment which is the cause of samsāra and which has been ipflicted for beginciogless and successive acts of offence. When these upāyas are adopted for other benefits (than moksha ) (for instance, svarga), they generate favourable dispositions (in the Lord) suited to the attainment of the respective benefits, just like Jyotishtoma and the like and thus serve as aids. In the case of the man wbo desires moksha, they, as vyāja or sādhyopāya, cause appeasement in Siddhopāya so as to cancel the punishment and then to remove the contraction of knowledge and the like due to that punisbment, 80 that Siddhopaya or the Lord confers (on the person) benefits extending up to perfect service. It is in this way these upāyas help as long as the self lasts. 

. Therefore those pramānas or authoritative passages which state that Siddhopāya (the Lord) confers the ultimate goal of perfect service (kainkarya ) along with preliminary benefits after removing all undesirable hindrances and that sādhyopaya (bhakti and prapatti) leads to these benefits by propitiating Siddhopaya - these pramānas are both apposite and agree with one another very well. 

IS THERE ANY NEED FOR THE SASTRA 

ENJOINING PRAPATTI ? 

4. Notwithstanding all this, some may ask: "Why should the sāstra enjoin this upāya called prapatti? (The sāstra has to help only when man cannot find out things for himself with his common sense or reason). In ordinary life, when a man is about to sink (into ruin ) because he cannot protect himself, he seeks the protection of some one who happens to be by his side and who has the ability to protect him. In the same way, if a man has under. stood bimself and Iswara from the s'āstra which trests of the existent upāya, will be not:neek Iswara for protection, of his own 

24 WHY SHOULD SĀSTRA ENJOIN PRAPATTI 278 

accord, (without the sāstra enjoining it)? So there is no prop.: riety in the sastra prescribing prapatti in the place of bhakti. 

This question is based on appropriate reasoning but proceeds too far. This is how it goes too far. In ordinary life (in the world) when a man seeks the help of another, he tries to learn before-band in what way he should approach the other, so that the latter may take pity on him and then he seeks bis protection. Similarly we should know who is competent to seek Iswara's pro tection and in what manner he should do so, so that the Lord may protect him; there is no pramana or authority other than the stāstra which deals with what abould be done and which can tell 08 how we should proceed to seek His help. It cannot be maintained that, by means of inference (or anumāna), we can understand that the Lord will protect if we seek refuge under Him and then seek His protection. For in that case, every one who has a know. ledge of the truth concerning Iswara may adopt the means in the manner suggested by his own inference and the texts in the stāstra which prescribe upāsana (bhakti) would then become useless. The distinction that he who is capable should adopt upāsana and the like and that he who is not capable of them should resort to prapatti - this distinction cannot be established by means of inference ( anumāna ). If the stāstra does not enjoin the per. formance of prapatti in the place of other upāyas to those who are incapable of them, they will bave to lose the fruit of these other upāyas as they are not competent enough for their proper per formance. This is how it stands. Though in ordinary life (in the world), we see service to kings and the like conferring certain benefits, yet we hold that in regard to the weaving of garlands, the lighting of lamps, the singing of hymns, the act of prostrating, and so on (in temples), if these things are done without any reference to the sāstras (as to how they should be done!, they will become offences. The worship of Bhagavan and His service have to be done with the right accessories as laid down in the stāstras and the fruits arising therefroin have also to be understood only from the sāstras. In the same way, although we see instances of prapattiBRIMAD RAHASYATRAYASARA 

CRAPTER 

io worldly life and the benefits arising theretrom, yet we can understand only from the sāstras the relationship of cause and effect that exists between prapatti performed with particular mantras and in accordance with the instructions of the good Acharya and certain special benefits which would result therefrom. Just as certain special forms of worship and service are prescribed for certain special benefits, prapatti, too, has been enjoined. If it were otherwise, no rules would have to be prescribed for the service of Bhagavan, in the same way as there are none for the service of the king. It would lead to the wrong view that, for prapatti also, the initiation into mantras with the instructions of good acharyas is unnecessary. That even those who are not competent for the utterance of mantras may perform prapatti to the Saviour who has certain specific attributes and that certain specific benefits will be derived therefrom, provided it is performed in the proper way without anything wanting and without any up due excess - this cannot be determined by any sound inference, Therefore just as particular forms of worship and service to Bhagavan are enjoined (in the sāstras) with certain accessories, there is nothing inappropriate in the sästra prescribing the per formance of prapatti with certain accessories (angas ). 

THE VIEW THAT UPĀSANA OR BHAKTI IS INCONSISTENT WITH ONE'S ESSEN 

TIAL NATURE IS WRONG: 

5. There are some who maintain that even among these upayas which are enjoined by the sāstras, upūsanas are opposed to the essential nature (of the jiva ). This should be taken to mean only a desire to praise prapatti with emphasis on it and not to condemn upāsanas ( as being against one's nature). The reasons are as follows: 

(a) It cannot be said that they are against the essential nature of the jīve on the ground that they would destroy the self, for the self is eternal (and cannot be destroyed). 

24 BHAKTI NOT INCONSISTENT WITH SVARUPA 875 

(b) It cannot be stated that the self or soul is, in its essential nature (svarupa), incapable, as the Sankhya saya, of being a doer, and is therefore incapablo, by its very nature, of performing upasanas. For the self is a doer in bhakti (or upa. sanas) and the like is in the performance of prapatti, and in rendering service (to Bhagavan and to Bhagavatas). As stated in the Brahma Sutras: "The 'Self is a doer (capable of endea vour or effort); otherwise the sāstras which enjoin doing certain things and refraining from certain other things would have no purpose or aim", and again, “This "doership of the self is dependent on Brahman" As stated in these passages, the self is a doer capable of endeavour, though his being a doer is dependent on Bhagavan. If it is maintained that the self is absolutely in capable of action, it would follow that, since purposetul action is the sign or mark, of the existence of a thing, the self is void or non-existent. If it is held that the self merely exists and is without jnāna (or knowledge), without the desire to act, and without the endeavour or effort needed for action, it would follow that it is incapable also of enjoyment (boktritvam). This would mean that samsāra is illusory and that there is no need for any upāya for the attaioment of moksha. The sloka "Lakshmi" comes of her own accord to a man who makes no endeavour. Another man does not obtain even food, bard though he worke. This is also due to past karma" - this sloka should not be inter preted as stating that the upayas prescribed in the sāstras are all of no use. It only emphasises that certain benefits come to a man as a result of certain actions performed in previous (births). 

(c) Nor can it be maintained that upasanas ara, accor. ding to sästras, against the essential nature of the jiva, because they would bring evil consequences. For, unlike actions performed out of the desire for worldly gains (kāmya) and actions prohibited 

19. Brahma Sutras: 2-3-33 20. Brahma Sutras: 2-3-40 

21. Mahabharata: Santi Parva;

276 · ORAPTER: 

in the sästras (nishiddha), which are obstacles to mnoksha and which arise from desire (rāga) and the like, upāsanas cannot bind the soul to samsara, because they are not performed out of a desire for worldly gains and because they are enjoined in the sästras only for those who want moksha. 

Thus upāsanas cannot destroy the essential nature of the self, they are not impossible of performance por do they bring evil consequences; there is, therefore, no justification for their be ing considered to be at variance with the essential nature (of the self). 

(d) Again it may be argued that since the self is different from such things as the body, there is no propriety in the man who koows that, in bis essential nature as the self, there is no such thing 28 varna or āsrama, performing the duties and rites (dharmas) and other upayas which are connected with them, because they all arise from the (erroneous) notion. "I am a Brahmin, I am & Kshatriya." (It may be argued) on this ground that these rites and duties (dharmas) which are dependent on one's caste (vara) and asrama may justly be considered as being against the essential nature of the self. This argument, too, is not sound for the following reagoo :-- Even if he understands that, in its essential nature, the self is not Brahmin and the like, yet since he is, owing to certain forms of past karna, in close association with the body which has the attributes of Brahmin and the like, he should not give up the dharmas enjoined by the sästrus in accor dance with his varna and äsrama and also in accordance with his capacity for getting rid of the illt of life and for attaining good things, as long as he is with that body, in the same way as he makes endeavours to ward off such things as bunger and thirst which arise from that association with the body. Therefore it cannot be maintained that these dharmas should be given up on the ground that they are against the essential nature of the soul because the body is different from the soul to (the man endowed with discrimination.) In regard to the performance of these 

24 BHAKTI NOT INCONSISTENT WITH SVARUPA 277 

dharmas, it is not the delusion that the essential nature of the self bas Brahminness and the like which gives competence, but the association with the body which has such attributes as Brahmiz. ness. Therefore we do not see any conflict between upāsanas and the essential nature of the self on account of the intelligent discri. mination between the body and the soul which is necessary for the performance of all dharma. That upāsanas have within then the notion of "I" (ahamkara) finds 20 authority or sanction in the sästras, but was merely assumed by these critics to exist. (In the performance of karma yoga, we are enjoined to give up the notion that we are free agents and that we want certain benefits ). 

(e) Some say that since karma yoga and the like have to be performed with the help of the body and the senses which are adventitious (upādhi) and wbich were acquired as the result of past karma, they are against the essential nature of the self. To them we reply that, even for a kaowledge of one's essential nature and for learning Dvaya and the like, there is nee i for such things as the mind. (So they would have to say that knowledge of the essential nature and learning Dvaya are against the essential Dature.) Thus their objection would extend to the latter also. 

THE OBJECTION THAT THE JĪVA WHO IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE LORD CANNOT AND 

SHOULD NOT ADOPT AN UPAYA. 

(f) It might be asked, “ Whatever that might be, since the jīva exists solely for Iswara (sesha ), he is not expected to protect himself and since he is absolutely subject to the will and control of Iswara, be cannot protect himself; is it proper then to prescribe a means or upüya &s necessary to be adopted by him for his protection and to call this an upaya that is capable of being adopted by him? Whea this is 80, bhakti yoga and the like are productive of evil to the essential Oature of the self (svarūpa); as they are inconsistent with his being & s'esha who exists only for Iswara and are not possible of adoption, as they are inconsistent 

278 OBAPTIR 

with bis being absolutely ander the will and control of Iowara". This objection has already been answered as leading to the logical conclusion of the possibility of salvation for all. If the Lord were to grant a jiva mukti or salvation without any consideration (vyāja) whatsoever, the jiva should be a mukti from beginning less time, If it is beld that Iswara, being independent and omni. potent, makes a man & mukta whenever He is pleased, it would mean that he is partial to some and cruel to others. Similar here. sies would follow : Further those sästras which prescribe the means for attaining mukti would become meaningless. Therefore in adopting this means enjoined as the result of the jiva's being a s'esha there is appropriateness and also a like appropriateness in the owner protecting what is his own. It would become possible to adopt such means as are agreeable to Him with the help of the measure of independence granted (to us) by Him as the Supreme Controller and to expect His favour in regard to the fruit or object of attainment. This s'eshatva or existing solely for the Lord and being absolutely subject to His will and control - these two will help, in the stage of realisation, to perform the kind of service that is agreeable to Him as that ordained by Him. 

If these objectors hold that, on account of the knowledge of being the s'esha and of entire dependence on Iswara, the jiva should make no effort for his own protection, it would follow that the service (kainkarya ) rendered in accordance with the sastras for the attainment of the Lord's favour and so also prapatti which is prescribed as possible, would he beyond his competence, because they are understood as being opposed to bis essential Dature. We have already stated that prapatti is capable of being adopted as & means in as much as it has been prescribed in the words "sara. nam vraja" (seek refage), as something that has to be performed over and above the mere kpowledge of the relationship (between the jiva and Iswara ) arising from the texts. Therefore there is no inappropriateness in the jiva, who exists only for the Lord and who is entirely subject to His control, adopting such means of bis own for his protection as he is competent to adopt, 

24 TAE RITES OF VARNA & ASRAMA MUST BE PERFORMED 279 

THE OBJECTION THAT THE RITES OF VARŅA AND ASRAMA AND BHAKTI YOGA ARE INCON SISTENT WITH EXCLUSIVE DEVO. 

TION TO THE LORD. 

(g) However, it may be stated, since the jiva bas understood clearly that He exists solely for Iswara and for no other, it is opposed to his nature as a supreme and exclusive devotee of the Lord to practise the rites (dharma ) ordained for his varṇa and asrama, because they imply the mediatorship of other deities (like Agai, Surya and Varuna) and also to practise such things as bhakti yoga which have these rites as their anga or accessory. It is only s'uddha vājis who worship the Lord alone (without any reference to other deities) that deserve to be called mer with sup reme and exclusive devotion to the Lord (paramaikānti)". This objection can arise only from a lack of clear understanding of the conclusion arrived at in such treatises as Sri Bhashya. It may be asked how. The answer is that in such vidyās as Pratardana and Madhu vidyā, it is distinctly stated that the Supreme Being is to be worshipped or meditated upon by the aspirant for mukti 8s having Indra and other deities as His body. The author of Sri Bhashya has declared that in regard to the rites and duties of the varna and ūsrama also, which are angas or accessories to the vidyās, the object of worship or meditation is only the Supreme Self who has the respective deities as His body. Therefore what is opposed to exclusive devotion to the Lord is the worship of other deities as if they were iodependent, and also connection with other deities owing to a desire for certain specific fruits, when these deities have nothing to do with the rites and duties which are com. pulsory and recurrent (nitya ) as well as those wbich are inci. dental and occasional (naimittika ). There is no opposition to supremo and exclusive devotion to the Lord in performing one's ordained rites and duties without any attachment to or desire for any other fruit and with the thought that these deities are attri. butes of the Lord and that such words as Agai denote the Lord 

280 CHAPTER 

who has Agni and the like as His body or attributes. There is no opposition to exclusive devotion, likewise, in following the princi ple: "These *words (Agai, Indra etc.) directly denote, by their etymological significance, the Supreme Self. It is not improper to think 89. So says Jaimini", for these are rites and daties enjoined (in the stāstras). 

(b) "But", it may be argued again, "the sõstras have enjoined also rites for such things as betwitchment (** abhichāra) to produce conviction. In the same manner, the forms of meditation (or upiisana ) have been enjoined only in order to produce convic tion or faith in the efficacy of wbat is prescribed (by the sästras) viz., prapatti. It does not mean that they are to be performed. To tbe aspirant for mukti, the end or object of attaionient and the means of attaining it are both one and the same. Therefore the means favourable for the attainment of lbat end is only Iswara, It is on account of this that the god presiding over dharma condemned upāsanas as opposed to the end in view, while saying to bis son :-"0, "Bharata, If you are afraid of sins, do not begin any activity and remain with the thought that Narayana is the oply end to be attained with all your heart." This arguinent, too, is not tenable for the following reasons: 

(1) The rites of bewitchment ( abhichāra) and the like are sources of evil, because they are performed for purposes or fruits that are evil. Since thakti or upasana is enjoined for attaining moksha, it cannot be a source of evil: 

Suddha Yalis . Those whose adoration is solely to Bhagavan without any intermediaray like Agni, Varuna and the like. 

** NOTE:- The Vedas prescribe the rites called abhichara for causing the death of one's enemy. They do so in order that by seeing the effect, men may have faith in the sastra. 

22. Brahma Sutras: 1-2-29 23. Vishnu dharma : 66-72 

24 

BHAKTI YOGA IS A TRUE UPAYA 

281 

(2) It would be inconsistent with the view of these critics to hold that bhakti or upāsana is enjoined only to produce an eager desire for the adoption of an easier means, viz., prapatti, by describing & more difficult means, vis, bhakti, for they bold that bhakti is no means at all (to attain moksha). Besides bhakti does not yield its fruit in this life but only after it. So it cannot create faith or conviction in the other means prescribed, vix., prapatti. Men generally adopt, of their own accord, the easier means in pre ference to the more difficult means. The success of the easier means in producing the desired result will create faith or convic tion in regard to the more difficult means and not vice versa. So the more difficult upāya cannot cause faith in the efficacy of the easier means. It will, therefore, have to be argued in support of their view that, when certain fruits or good results which will arise from a main rite or angī are stated to arise from its anga or accessory rite, it should be considered only as arthavada or mere praise having no literal truth according to a principle (or nyāya) of the Mimamsakas. Here moksha is really the fruit of prapatti, which is the angī and this fruit is, in the view of these critics, for the sake of mere praise (which is not true), assigned to its anga bhakti also. So, bhakti is, according to them, really not capable of yielding moksha. This argument, too, is no good as it would be inconsistent with the contention of these critics, for they would then have to admit that bhakti is an anga or accessory of prapatti (which they deny). 

The means or upāya, that is favoured by Iswara, who is the object of attainment, can be understood only from the sāstra (and it is no use asserting that bhakti is not favoured by Him). Reason is not competent to say that the means, viz., bhakti is opposed to the end in view (Bhagavan). If we are to object to any one thing that is prescribed in the stāstras by reasoning which is against the sastra, there would, by parity of reasoning, be no validity in any of the things or dharmas prescribed in the s'āstras and, likewise, in the s'astras prescribing prapatti as well. 

282 ON APTER 

Further there is no authority for the statement that in the sloka quoted above (from Vishnu dharma :'note 23), the word pātaka (sin) refers to upāsanas and the like. Therefore since bhakti and prapatti are both enjoined for the aspirant to mukti, they are, either of them, to be adopted in accordance with the competence (of the individual concerned). 

(i) Nor would it be proper to hold that, though these two bhakti and prapatti are enjoined (in the stāstras), bhakti or upāsana and the like are not to be practised in as much as they have not been favoured for adoption by the acharyas; (for instance) such things as the slaying of a bull for the entertainment of a guest at dinner, though enjoined, are opposed to the traditional practice of the learned (sishta). This objection, too, is not that of a thinking mind. It is only when all the achāryas avoid the performance of & rite or observance, that it should be abandoned in accordance with the saying: "Though a ritead has been prescribed in the sästra, yet if it will retard the attainment of svarga and is also repugnant to the general public, it should not be performed". In regard to the rites in question, since they were adopted by such ancient acharyas as Parasara who is described by Alavandar as one of the best sages, it cannot be maintained that they are against the traditional observance of all learned inen. 

(j) In the same way, it cannot be argued that, “though these rites were suitable as dharmas to be practised in other yugas, since in Kali Yuga, it is not possible to find men competent to perform such things as the upusana or meditation of the Supreme Self, they are pot suited for observance in this age. That is why it has been said :-“Whatever 25 fruit a nan obtained in Krita Yuga by redunciation (tyāga), whatever fruit a man obtained in the Dvapara Yuga by the performance of yajnas, whatever a man obtained in Tretayuga by worshipping the Lord, that a mag attains in Kali Yuga by the mere mention of His names", and so also in the Mahäbhirata " Kali Yug& has this one great 24.

advantage, O, king; in Kali, a man gets rid of his past karma by the mere mention of Sri Krishna's names and attains the Lord": Against this objection we may state that even at the present time, there may be present men who are competent to perform such things as upāsanas and who, like the ancient Ūchāryas, are established in yoga for its own sake, for it is said :-" To the * man who has Govinda at heart, there is Kritayuga in Kali yuga and to him who does not entertain Achyuta at heart, there is Kali Yuga even in Krita Yuga," If these were not admitted, it would follow that even prapatti, which is different from the mention of the Lord's names (samkārtana) is not to be performed, becanse it is difficult to find men who are competent to perform it and who have the intense faith (inahii visvisa ) necessary for it, for it has been said :-“There is ano man (O Brahma) who is competent to be initiated into this mantru. who is competent to perform the rite uttering this mantra or who will listen to it." Therefore since there is no other objection to such things as upāsanas, they can be said to be unsuitable only for those adhikūrīs who are "destitute28A of all upūyas and who have no other way of salvation", because they are inappropriate for their competence in the same way as ablutions by complete immersion in water are unsuitable for those that are ill. It is in regard to such men as do not under. stand their being incompetent ( for bhakti or upasana ) and who adopt it as a means that it is said: “It is owing a' to the weakness of mind which fails to understand its competence or incompetence that a man adopts bhakti as an upāya. Therefore even these upāsanas and the like are, for other adhikaris, suitable to the extent of their competence. Incompetence for them arises from inability to adopt them or the inability to eodnre delay (in attain ing salvation). The inan who has this incoinpetence adopts pra. patti. The man wbo has adopted prapatti as an independent and direct upāya is proclaimed as "one who has 29A performed & sacri.

fice, one who has 298 done what be ought to do' and 'one who29C has perforined a hundred sacrifices' by the Alvars, the great sages and the Lord's Sastras ( Bhagavat Săstra) and the Vedas. Further these authorities also praise all bis activities ap to the time of death, as if they were the varied duties connected with yajnas and ending with the final bath (avabhrita). They hold also that, in the same way as the man who has performed a yajna performs the compulsory and occasional rites (sritya and na imit tika ) after it, the man who has adopted prapatti should perform the duties of his varna and äsrama as the commands of the Lord who is omnipotent and that the man who has performed the sacri fice or yajna of the self does not require the performance of any other activity for the fruit desired by bim. Therefore as stated in such places as the sloka :-"The Yogi iskop superior to all those who practise austerities (tapas); he is soperior also to the jnănīs and to those who perform the rites and duties (ordained for them). Therefore, 0 Arjuna, become a yogin"; the dharmas or activities of renunciation are superior to the activities or dharmas of action (pravritti); so also the yoga connected with the self is superior to all other yogas; of all yogas the highest is the yoga connected with (Sri Krishna), the son of Vasudeva, for it has been said, "The sopan who fixes his mind on me and worships me with earnest faith should be considered as the highest among yogis". Similarly of all the vid yiis or forus of meditation on the Supreme Self, only the particular vidyā which is called nyäsa, nikshepa and 80 on is the bighest, for, among other reasons, it is easy, it has to be performed only once, and it leads to the attainment of the end 800n. This truth regarding the Nyasa vidyā is stated explicitly in the Bhagavat Sāstra in the following slokas: "Of all othe auste rities (tapas) prescribed for the attainment of moksha, the auste rity called nyasa (prapatti) is the bighest ", and "Those who, with their thoughts fixed only on moksha, are alsorbed in the per

formance of karmayoga and those, again, who follow jnana yoga aod bhaktiyoga do not deserve to be placed on a par with even ode-ten millionth of the man who has performed prapatti". 

To the man who is unable (owing to illness ) to perform such things as ablution by immersion," the medita:ion on A Vishnu, which is called mental ablation, is ordained; thereby be obtains not only the purity of those who perforun the other kinds of ablution, but acquires freedom from sins and the pleasure of the immediate en joyment of Bhagavan. In the same way, though prapatti is ordained for those who are not competent to perform such things as upisanas, it confers the fruits attainable from them; it secures them (the upāya, pamely, upasana also); it redeerns the man who is destitute of all other upayas ( akinchana ); and further it secures the fruit (desired by him) at the time when he wants it. There. fore prapatti has superior potency. 

DOES PRAPATTI REQUIRE ANGAS OR ACCESSORIES ? 

So far we have removed the misconceptions that may arise about the competence for the upiya and its essential nature (svarīpa). Henceforward we will proceed to remove those mis. conceptions that might be entertained in regard to accessories of that upaya. (1) Is it necessary that this püya sbould be accom. pained by such things as the determination to do what is agreeable (änukūlya sankalpa )? Will the Saviour who said, “If & *8 man seeks protection with the desire for the immediate attainment of an object (ürta ) or with endurance of delay in the attain uent (dripta), he should be protected by those who know the s'istras, even though he might be an enemy," "I will, in no circumstances, abandon one who has come to me in the guise of a friend, even though there are faults in biw. The great will appreciate this," and "Bring hin* here, O Sugriva, whether he be Vibhishana or

oven Ravana bimaself. I promise protection to him" - ( will the Saviour who said these words) and who was gracious even to his enemies care for the faults of those who have sought refuge under him? The ancients describe Him as the Protector of the whole world without any consideration of merit. Therefore these acces. sories (such as ūnukiilya sankalpa) are not requisites but attri butes that are most likely to be met with in those who have performed prapatti." Such is the contention of some critics. In reply to this misconception, it may be said that the passages on wbich it is based may really have, for their purport, the idea that though such attributes as ūnukiilya do not continue after the performance of prapatti, some expiation will occur and there will be no diminution in the fruit of prapatti, (They do not mean that qualifications like ānukilyasankalpa are not required at the time of the performance of prapatti). If this explanation is not accepted, many authoritative passages which distinguish bet ween the main rite (angi) and its accessories (anga) such as "Saraṇāgati is of six kinds," "Nyasa has five angas" and "Let him perform that prapatti which has five accessories " - many such authoritative passages would offer opposition. We have already stated that (the absence of these accessories) would be against what is the subject of experience in the world in regard to the conventions regarding the surrender of objects that have to be protected and that these accessories are required only once and so on. Even the divine missile, Brahmastra, requires its own acces sories (angas). Hence the sloka that there is no other requisite ** for prapatti anywhere and at any time" only states that it does not require aoy other dhurma cor rite. (It does not mean that reved) the angus of prapatti are not reqnired). Otherwise even intense faith (mahüvisvāsa) which these critics commend as an anga wight be considered as an attribute which may be found (in a prapanna) and not as an anga. 

36. Sanatkumara Samhita.

MAHAVISVASA 

287 

WHY SHOULD INTENSE FAITH BE CALLED AN 

ANGA INSTEAD OF MERE FAITH ? 

In this connextion, some others may contend as follows:--- “When the believer has faith in what is stated in the sāstras, what is the meaning of saying that there is something else called 'intense faith' or mahüvisvāsa? Therefore there is no point in bolding that this mahāvisvõsa is anything other than the faith in the sāstra which is general and that it is & special anga or accessory of pra. patti. This contention (or objection) is refuted by the well-known fact that there are degrees of faith as stated in the sloka:"One should never place confidence in a man whom one does not trust. Even in a man whom one trusts, too much confidence should not be reposed." It is also refuted by the text which prescribes extra ordinary faith as an anga or accessory (in regard to prapatti ). 

Bhagavan Narada has declared in Srimad Ashtakshara Brahma Vidya that there are, in different men, varying degrees of faith in the Moolamantra. (He says):- "In sproportion to the degree of faith that a man has in Ashtakshara, will be attain the fruit thereof. It is impossible to measure its greatness." The Supreme Ruler of all will ultimately protect even those prapannas who are far from perfect and whose faith is not strong enough. If authority is asked for this statement, here it is :--"By these man who has once uttered the two syllables 'Harih' - by bim steps have been taken for entering moksha". In accordance with this, Alavandar has conveyed the same idea in the sloka :-- "Whoever' folds his hands in worship to Thee in any manner and at any time - his sios vanish at once. It generates all good things. It never fails to bear fruit," and so also, “A single" drop of the ocean of nectar called bhakti towards the two lotuses of Thy feet will extinguish instantly the spreading wildfire called samsāra and confer superior happiness". By uttering the three syllables

CHAPTER 

"Govinda", Kshatrabandu, who stood surrounded by his past kar mas swarming (like ants ), attained the highest state." As implied in these passages, Iswara will promote the perfection of the upaya And protect the man. Has not this idea been conveyed by Sri Sandilya Bhagavan to Devala in the following sloka :- "Mapy of your previous births ended in vain. Consider how this life, too, may end in vain and perform prapatti? Froin the sloka :-"The divine 43A seers say that Thou art to be sought as the Saviour and that 'Thou protectest those who have soagbt Thy protection." -- (from this sloka) it should be understood that intense faith oan be found (only) in the divine seers and not in ordinary men) and that, by the authority of what is said by the divine seers, those whose faith is not strong should strengthen it. Therefore since there are varying degrees of faith, what is stated in the stāstra about intense faith being an anga of prapatti cannot be objected to. 

CAUSES OF THE DECAY OF FAITH AND THE 

REMEDY THEREFOR 

We will now show how some people suffer from diminution of faith and state how this tendency can be corrected. Some may ask: - "How could bhakti anil prapatti lead to such opposite results is worldly prosperity and mokshi inerely because of the difference in the mental attitude (of those who adopt them)? Have we ever seen the same seed yielding two different fruits owing to the diversity of intentions in the (inind of the) sower? The answer to this question is as follows:- "The sästra which is the (sole) authority in regard to matters pertaining to it in tbe same way as sense perception (pratyaksha) is in regard to what per. tains to it -- the sāstra cao certainly declare it to be so and reason has no right to attempt to disprove it. In worldly life, if we give an object to a charitable and generous king as an article for sale, we shall obtain a liberal return; but if it is given (without any

WILL TAE SAME UPAYA YIELD DIFFERENT FRUITS? 289 

thought of such retorn) merely as an offering or tribate, we see it produce whatever is desired (by the person). 

These two bhakti and prapatti, are of the nature of a rite prompted by pravritti (activity prompted by worldly interests), when they are adopted by a person who expects some benefit other than (moksha) and in the case of those who desire only the feet of Bhagavan, they are of the nature of & rite of renunciation (nivritti). The same holds good of such things as the rites and duties which are compulsory and regularly recurrent and those which are compulsory and occasional (ritya and naimittika), 

If it be asked whether üpasāna (bhakti) and prapatti, which are different in their nature since the former has to be repeated ooptinuously (till death) and the latter to be performed only once -- whether these two could yield the same fruit; the answer is as follows:- "It is certainly poosible, since it depends upon the competency of the person (adopting the upāya), as in worldly life and in the Vedic tradition. 

To those aspirants to mukti who have adopted prapatti as an independent and direct means, the upaya (means) and the end (which is) moksha, namely, the attainment of Bhagavan are one and the same (i. c) Bhagavan. However, owing to the degree of urgency (tvarā) in the desire for moksha which arises from the suffering of samsūra, there may be delay or absence of delay in the attainment of the fruit in accordance with the time when it is respectively desired by the persons concerned (viz.) ārta and dripta). 

The reason why the Alvars, Nathamuni and the like obtained such things as direct vision (säkshñtkära) of Bhagavan, while others who adopted prapatti had to go without it is (two fold)--the diffe rence in the desire for the fruit expressed at the time of prapatti and also the difference in the past good karma which had begun to operate in this life. 

290 CHAPTER 

Though that part of the fruit formerly desired is certain owing to the performance of prapatti on a single occasion, yet, if a person eagerly desires some other part of the fruit pot desired before, & further prapatti is also appropriate.

Some critics may entertain doubts in regard to the effective dess of prapatti which is the means of attaining all benefits without exception, when it is found that some forms of prapatti intended to secure tangible benefits in this life itself fail to do so. These critics should be made to understand that if there is no effect, it is due to some defect in the activity (karma), in the doer (karta) or in the means or accessories ( südhana ), just as in the case of other rites prescribed in the sästras. (For instance, the s'āstra says, “He who desires rain should perform a yajna with kariri (bamboo sprouts )". If the rain does not follow the yajna, it must be due to some defect in the performance of the karma, in the doer, or in the sacrificer or in the acoessories or sadhanas employed in the sacrifice). Defect in the performance (of prapatti) consists in the lack of intense faith, (mahüvisvūsa ), and the like, Defect in the doer consists in the absence of coinpetency prescribed for prapatti. Defect in the sadhunas or accessories is the absence of such things as the teaching of the wise which is essential for the performance of prapatti in accordance with the süstras. When prapatti is done without any of these defects, we see even the attainment of visible and (tangible) fruits that have been desired as the result. 

3. Yet others might contend as follows:-"Such sages as Vyasa who are alike the expounders of all siistras including the stāstra on prapatti state:-- "Attor" studying all the sästras and after frequent investigation of their meaning with the help of reason, this one truth alone becomes evident: Narayana should always be meditated on," "Hari "Salone is fit to be meditated on always by people like you who are sättvikas." " Vishnu " is cons

tantly to be ineditated on. He should never be forgotten." When they have arrived at this conclusion, how could it be said that, by the performance of prapatti on a single occasion, moksha could be attained? The passage in the Gita which saya :- " Those 46A who perform prapatti to me alone, get over mīyā which cannot be easily got over -- this passage and others like it refer to prapatti which is an anga or accessory to bhakti (upāsana) or meditation, Similarly such texts as the Charama sloka should be considered as prescribing prapatti with its accessories only as an anga of bhakti". This contention of theirs is inappropriate. (For it has been said): " Those who are incapable of meditation (upāsana or bhakti) and seek Thee as their upüya-even they cross over samsāra and enter Thy abode, Vaikunta,” “Whatever object is desired, by whatsoever person and whatever cannot be obtaised by other means, and that moksha from which abode there is no return and which cannot be attained by karma yoga, jiūnayoga, or bhakti yoga, all these fruits are obtained, O great sage, by those who respectively strive for them by the performance of prapatti. The Supreme Self is attained only thereby." As stated in these passa ges, if prapatti adopted as a direct and independent upāya is well established, the prapanna acquires, as its reward, the capacity to meditate constantly on Narayana as stated in Sri Vaikunta gadya. This is just like milk being a suitable drink for both the healthy man and the man who is in ill-health. Though meditation (upāsana or bhakti) with its (Vedic) angas is not within the competency of every one, yet it is not impossible for everyone to meditate on the Lord in such measure as is possible for one with his competency, as may be seen in the passage - "May 1, "as the result of Thy will, be endowed with the power of constantly medita ting un Thee!" The author of Sri Bhashya, too, after teaching this upāya (prapatti) in his smaller gadya (Sri Ranga gadya) and in the longer gadya (Saraņāgati gadya) and referred to it briefly in the Vaikuntagadya, is pleased to teach this form of

meditation so that the desire for the end in view may gain in strength without suffering any diminution. He does so in the passage which begins as follows: "In order to that one may continue to live the life of the spirit, one should meditate in this manner," 

THE RITES NITYA AND NAIMITTIKA ARE, 

ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE GIVEN UP 

BY THE PRAPANNA: 

The author of Sri Bhashya has also described in his Nitya the special form of worship (poojā) which is referred to in "I spent'l my time in studying the books which mention the attributes of the Lord, in listening to others reading them and in worshipping Him," (The description) begios (with the sentence):- "I will now explain the manner in which the man with exclusive devotion to Bhagavan should perform the adoration (ärädhana) of the Lord, Having become a worshipper with supreme and exclusive devotion to Him and with a desire only to serve Him", he goes on to say, "Remain meditatingó (on the Lord) with a vision as clear as 

visual perception and with extreme love ( to Him)". 

This service to the Lord wbich is the overflow of vninterrupt. ed meditation and seeks no other interest or profit and wbich consists in five forms of service io the course of the day, is in accord with what is enjoined in the scripture of Bhagavan (Bhagavat Sastra ) and with what has been prescribed by Vyasa, Daksha and other great sages. It is also inplicit in the following Tamil verses: "Giving up anger and deceit and controlling the senses, 53Aone should perform adoration five times in the day", as commented on by the acharyas. "Approaching" the Lord in the morning (abhigamana), then proceeding to collect the materials required for his worship

(upādāna); next performing the adoration (@radhana), afterwards uttering the sacred mantras (japa); lastly meditating on the Supreme Lord (dhyāna); thas in the aforesaid five parts of the day, I will spend my days adoriag Him with the good incense and flowers gathered by me with my own effort." Having heard, from the author of Sri Bhashya, this five-fold division of the day and what should be done in each, Vangipuram Nambi briefly summarised it in his Nitya in the words quoted above. This may be seen also in the treatise on daily life written by Periajeer and others. Any differences that might appear in these descriptions are easily ex. plained as due to differences found in different Samhitas. 

Hence the prapanna should spend his time in accordance with such sästraic scheme of life as has been taught by his acharya in rendering service to Bhagavan with no other purpose than to please Him. (In this context the following passages may be borne in mind):- "I do not desire to go to the divine world leaving Thee; oor do I desire to enjoy immortality so also without Thee, I have no desire for the glory which comes of ruling the world". “ You will benjoy yourself with Sita on the slopes of the moun tains. I will render all service to you whether you are awake or asleep". "I mays be born to any one in whatever family; (wher ever I may be born), may I have the eager longiog to enjoy the pleasure of rendering service to Thee! I will never do anything on behalf of any other deity with my body, mind, speech or head". "The only object that I have in view is that the Lord should take me into His service for His owd pleasure." 

This daily worship of Bhagavan consisting of abhigamana (apprnach) (and the four other duties) should not be done for the sake of such things as vanity, gain or honours as done by up believers; nor should it be done for the sake of any other object in

view (than pleasing Bhagavan, as may be done by those wbo have no knowledge of the truth and have not yet acquired freedom from the desire for worldly pleasures (vairāgya) and other such virtues. Without any desire even for the attainment of moksha as by those who adopt bhakti yoga but bave not completed it, if this mode of worship is performed with the sole desire of doing what is agreesble to the Lord for its own sake, as it is done by those who have already attained mukti, this abhigamana (approach) and other things will shield the prapanna from the approach to other deities (abhigamana), from activities for the sake of other inte. rests (upadana), from yajnas to other deities, from words about other (deities ) and from meditation (dhyāna ) of the other deities. 

Perialwar bas pointed out that there will be no approach to other deities (abhigamana) in the following verse - "Now to that I have the austerity (tapas) of rendering service to Thee, it would be a detraction from Thy glory, if I were hereafter to stand with bowed head in front of the house of any other. Kindly note", He has also pointed out that there will be no activity for securing other things (upādāna) in the verge :-- "I will not so beg of Thee food for eating or cloth for wear." That there will be no yajna or sacrifice to others is brought out in passages like these :- "She's will never adore any deity other than Bhagavan even in her thoughts”, “Who else® merits our flowers and our adoration than our Lord ?" "(The 6 worship of other deities than Bhagavan) is like washing & wooden doll when ones' mother is at band to be served", and "O men" of the world who neglect Bhagavan and worship jivas as if they were deities! Are you washing a wooden doll with warm water when similar service can and should be rendered to the mothers that gave you birth? Are you without the grace of the Lord tbat you cannot render service to Him ?." In the discourse of the seven sages also, it has been declared thus :

“He wbo *bas stolen the *bulb of the lotus - let bim worsbip other deities than Vishnu, who does good to Brahmins, who exercises control over the gods, who is worshipped by all those who live in the three worlds, who is the cause of the creation, the maintenance, and the destruction of the three worlds, who is under the control of no one else, who is the support of the world and who both creates and destroys the world, and who is the guru of the world," and again, “He who has stolen the bulb of the lotus - he is one who never performs those dharnias which please the Lord, who never favours them, and who is of such a nature that he practises evil dharmas and evil rites." That the prapanna will never utter the praise of others is declared in verses like the follow. ing:--Tiruvoymozhi 3-9 and also in: "The mouth will never sing the praise of any one other than the Lord.” So also that the prapanna will never think of others is declared in the following passages :-"My thoughts are never with any deity other than the Lord. Bhagavan who helps the gods is aware of this." and "I will" never think that there are other deities that I want to attain and that will come to me." 

(Our ancient seers) have declared that even those who are not competent to perform this five-fold schewe of adoration may not fail to render this service or kainkarya, if they will perform such compulsory and occasional rites as they are competent for, if they sing the praise of the Lord and the like and if they render service to such persons as have the competency to perform that adoration and as have exclusive devotion to the Lord in accordance with their competence and in perfect dependence on them. And this may be seen in the following passages :-“The adoration of Vishnu is

superior to all other adorations. The adoration of Vishun's devotee, which is different from it, is said to be superior even to that "; "Satagopan" is ever in the company of the servants of Bbagavan who saved Gokula with the bill (as an umbrella)" and "The tapas of those who are attached to the devotees of the Lord will surpass that of (even) those who sing the praise of the Lord." The joy of those who render this service and of those who look with delight on this service rendered by them is of the same nature as that of Iswara, who alone is competent to rule over the affairs of the world (jagad vyāpāra) and of those who have already attained inukti and merely look on. There is nothing inappropriate in this joy being the same in the case of those who perform the service and of those wbo look on it with delight, for it is just like the purifying influence described in the following sloka :-"To hears of the performance of dharma ( done by others), to see it, to think of it, to speak of it and to find delight in it - all these, O best of kings, purify always the person doing so." 

So also it is said in the Mahäbhārata :-"Therefore73A & Sadra should not utter my names with the pranava (the syllable Om), and in the Näradiyakalpa "The japa of the ashtökshara? has been prescribed, for women and for Sudras to be performed without the dative suffix thus:- (namonārüyana). Similarly there are no rules for them about the svara, about pranava and about touching the limbs (anganyäsa ). It is declared in the sāstras that for women and for Sudras, japa consists in the mere utterance of the mantra (without them)". In the Varāhapura. nam, it is said, “The pano born of the caste of those who eat dog's flesh woke up as soon as ihe day dawned, finished his obser. vance which consisted in singing the praise of Bhagavan and returned after uttering the mantra "Namo Nārāyaṇa".

we find the following :- " If a man goes to Vaikunta uttering the moolamantra, 'Nano Nārana' with his hands folded in reve. rence over bis head, he will dever return to the world of sansöra etc , and “If one is "to utter the name of Bhagavan, one should say "namo Narana". The middle of the sugar.cane (i.e.) Ashta. kshara with eight joints becomes suitable to everyone, if the root and the top (i.e.) the first and the last syllable are cut off. So also there is nothing inappropriate in all prapannas enjoying the delight (rasa) of thinking of Bhagavan at any time whatever. It is only for bhakti yoga, which has its angas or accessories and wbich is different from prapatti, that some are not competent. Even though prapatti becomes perfect by the rite which lasts only for a moment (we are taught) thus by the Saviour: "Always?' utter the dvaya with the thought of its iDeaning in your mind)". Therefore the command "Narayana is to be meditated on always" should be taken as an upāya for some (viz. those who adopt bhakti) and as the fruit for others, (panely prapannas). Thus the command is in Do way opposed to prapatti adopted as a direct and independent means. 

Sri Ramanuja has explained in such treatises as Sri Bhashya how prapatti is an anga to bhakti or upūsana. In the gadya he explains how prapatti can also be an independent and direct means, It is true we find the following :-"There is nothing other then yoga which can destroy such evil traits as ignorance (avidya) (and conceit)” and, “Past karmae cannot be destroyed even in ten thousand births without yoga. Only the fire of yoga can con aume away the dry grass of karma." But since prapatti has been enjoined as a direct and independent means, on the strength of that ordinance, the passages cited above (on yoga) should be consider ed as applicable only to those others who are competent for them. 

Similarly answers to other misconceptions that might arise in regard to sūdhyopāya (bhakti and prapatti) may be found in

298 Nikshepa rakshi. Sadhyopāya as clarified in this chapter should be borne in mind in regard to the three mysteries (mantras) in the appropriate place. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

The Sruti states at length that the Supreme Being chooses those who should win His grace; but this choice (of the jiva bound by karma for the bestowal of His grace) is based on some conside ration. Therefore we obtain redemption by the mercy of the Lord who, as antaryāmī, supports the world and, as Savivar, helps us cross the sea of samsara and by understanding clearly the good paths for winning His grace (bhakti end prapatti) as described in the s'āstras. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Those (great men) who were well-versed in the dialectical methods of rationalists wbich resemble the art of conjuring, who stand first like the little finger while counting men renowned in argument and whose thoughts have been rendered clear by the soap-out of the Upanishads and the tradition that has followed therefrom-- (those great men) have taught as, in the manner described in this chapter, that Sädhyopāya (bhakti and prapatti) are the means of securing the favour of Siddhopüya (namely 

Bhagavan ). 

(25) THE CHAPTER ON THE LIMITS WITHIN WHICH THE UPAYAS BHAKTI AND 

PRAPATTI HAVE POTENCY: 

SANSKRIT SLOKA 

The essential nature (svarupa) of the Omnipresent Lord (vibhu), what and of what description are His qualities, His vibhavas (avatārs), His sportful activities and the like and the limits set by His command -- all these can be determined from the s'rutis. So also the greatness of His devotees and the potency of the ways in which we should worsbip Him (bhakti) and the like (prapatti) have been determined by great men like Sri Ramanuja in accordance with what is stated (in the süstras). 

We have so far shown the manner in which the miscon. ceptions that arise in regard to the Siddhopāya which is revealed by the words in the second or accusative case in Dvaya (Sriman Nārāyana charanau) and Saranam and the specific sadhyopāya (prapatti) mentioned in the predicate (prapadye) can be removed. It now remains to clear those misconceptions that may arise about the potency of the upāya - misconceptions assigning to it a greater or less potency than that warranted by the pramāņas (sources of true kpowledge ). 

THE GREATNESS OF THE DEVOTEES OF 

BHAGAVAN: 

Those who have adopted these upayas are, indeed, described as baving the greatness of being capable of securing redenuption even to those who are connected with them. It is said: “Their 'fathers and their grand-fathers dance in joy clapping (their hands) saying: “A devotee of Vishnu is born into our family and he will help to save us from samsāra ", and again, " Those seven' genora tions of men who were born before into my family and those seven generations who will be born after me have become the servants 

1. Varahapuranam 

2. Tiruvoymozhi: 2-7-1. 

300 CH A PTER 

of the Lord. We have obtained this glorious and great existence". Similarly it has indeed been stated that the greatness of the man who has a knowledge of Bhagavan cannot be (adequately) estimated by the gods even ": "Even the gods cannot measure the greatness of the man who knows Sri Krishna as He is ". However we will now state the limits (of this greatness) so far as caste is concerned, by the force of pramālas which are not opposed to these texts (quoted above). 

DOES PRAPATTI ENTITLE A SÕDRA TO BE 

CONSIDERED A BRAHMINI 

It is said: “Those Sūdras" who have devotion' (blukti ) to Bhagavad are not sildras; they who are devotees of Bhagavan are Brabmins. Those who have no bhakti to Bhagavan (Janardana), whatever might be their caste - they alone are sūdras". Thus by the presence or absence in them of the specific attribute of bhakti to Bhagavan, men of lower castes are called by the names of the bigher and men of higher castes are called by the names of the lower respectively. From this, men of poor understanding might ask, “Are not the devotees of Bhagavan of one and the same caste?" If this view were accepted, it would be in conflict with all the s'āstras that prescribe the respective course of right conduct stating, "Thus will the devotee of the Lord who is a Brahmin conduct himself and thus will the devotee who is a Sidra conduct himself." The distance that exists between the mere Brabwin and the mere Sudra should be considered to exist (also) between the Lord's devotee who is a Brabmin and the Lord's devotee who is a Sudra. The stāstras which state that they are equal refer only to such things as the attainment of the final goal (moksha). Kadambi Appullar has made this point clear. Further learned scholars (like Peria Acban Pillai) while commenting on the verse, "The name, Narayana confere a (higher) kulam", express the

PRAPATTI AND CASTE 

301 

following conclusion:- "If a man who is low by birth and by conduct attains contact with Bhagavan, one who has them both should shrink from calling him low, because of the potency of bis devotion to Bhagavan". In answer to the question . “But this does not mean intermarriage among them ", they declared that this (probibition of inter-marriage) is due to caste and that the praise of the man is due to his possession of virtues. The words, " It confers a higher kulan", and likewise, the passage - “ We will give up our former kulain, and sing the praise of Bhagavan " mean only exaltation in the Vaishnava kulam. His kulam is indeed such as will not entertain the worship of other deities as well as the Lord. The saying current in the families of those who are exclusively devoted to Bhagavan (ekantī) is indeed as follows : "He to 'whom Vasudeva is not the (sole) deity from birth to death let him not be born into our family and even if he is born, let him die soon." Though the kulant is changed, since the words caste and kulam have been used in different senses, we may say that the caste will remain the same, but that the kulam will be different. " Though the cow may be of the temple, it does not cease to be a cow". In such passages as this:-"He should be copsidered as & Sadra", the great sages called men of higher castes by the words applicable to the lower castes and vice versa merely to indicate the degree of consideration or respect to be shown. Therefore the pur port of the sāstra is only this rauch:“Brahmins who are not devotees of Bhagavān are not to be held in esteem, whereas Sudras who are devotees of Bhagavan should be as much esteemed as Brahmins." 

If this were not accepted (as the right interpretation), all rules and regulations (regardiog caste) would be set at naught on the strength of the censure and praise (which) alone are intended to be conveyed) in such passages as the following :- "Auspicious qualities which carry esteem do not arise from caste. The gods

consider aus & Brahmin even a chandala who conducts himself in accordance with his caste," "Sannyasins and those who perform tapas (austerities) become chandalas when they lapse from the code of conduct prescribed for them", and "Because" & man's hair has turned grey, he is not esteemed as old. He who has jnāna, even if he be a child, is esteemed by the gods as an old man". This is the right explanation of all such passages : 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

When a member of one caste is praised as being of another Caste, it is to state that he should be esteemed as such at heart. But social conduct is regulated by special rules governing it. 

Sri Vidura, too, performed marriages and the like in accordance with the rules of his caste. “After the best of the Brahmins had eaten, Sri Krishna'' sat on a high seat and ate the pure and delicious food offered by Vidura.” On bearing of this, Duryodhana said to Sri Krishna:-"Without coming to Bhishma, Drona or to me, 0 Thou of lotus eyes, why didst thou eat, O Madhusudana, in the house of a Sidra?" Sri Krishna replied, “The food" offered by an enemy should not be eaten. (So also ) an enemy should not be given food to eat. You hate the Pandavas, Oking. Are they not my very life?" Io answering thus, it is evident that Sri Krishna admitted the truth of the particular caste ascribed to Vidura by Duryodhana. 

It may be asked: "Is not the eating of food cooked by a Sudra forbidden to Brahmins and Kshatriyas ?" The answer is as follows: "Apastamba and others state that Sidras who are under the supervision of Aryas are competent to cook their food", In other yugas (than Kali) there was no prohibition, because good Sudras under the control of Aryas were permitted to cook the food of the Aryas. (We read) further :-- "The se pure Vidura,

having the qualities necessary for it, brought the food." testifies to it, as Vidura's exceptional qualities are referred to. 

When this Brahma Jnapi (Vidura) gave up his life by the power of yoga, Dharmaputra (it is true) felt it his duty (as his nephew) to perform bis funeral obsequies in the special form (of Brahmamedha ). But it may have been performed in silence (without mantras;) or it was justifiable in the case of that excep. tional individual. This should not be considered as a precedent in the case of other individuals (as a principle applicable to all). If (this answer) were not accepted, it would follow that, because the virtuous Pandavas had a common wife, owing to the force of certain exceptional circumstances, others, too, might do likewise. (This would lead to promiscuity in social relations ). Therefore each individual should staod firm in his caste and render service (kainkarya) to Bhagavan in accordance with what is prescribed as competent for that caste. . 

Those who abide by the s'āstras should not believe in the elevation from (lower) castes stated in the deceptive sästras (of heretics ). The case of such as Visvamitra (who became a Brahmin after being a Kshatriya, was due to certain special causes as the charu (oblation of grain cooked in milk and other things) eated by his mother without knowing that it was intended for pro ducing a Brahmin child - it should not be considered that it is applicable to others as well, for it is against the texts (in the s'astras). The incidents and conduct of the Alvars who were possessed of powers even superior to those of Vidura and others sbould not be taken as precedents for our conduct. If we examine even their cond.ict carefully, (we shall find) that they did not transgress the rules of their respective castes. 

The sloka :-"Vishnu" is always to be praised (in song) with true knowledge (jnana). Therefore the pure koowledge concerning 

17. Mahabharata - Santi Parva 323-88.304 CHAPTER 

the eternal Lord should be obtained in clearness either from Brah mins or from Kshatriyas or from Vaisyas or from Sudras or from even lower castes - this sloka means merely that since knowledge of Bhagavan is essential as an acquisition, mere knowledge in its clearness should be obtained, when men of the previous castes are not available, even from those that are below them. Notwith standing this, the initiation into vidyrīs (upāsanas), mantras and the like should be only from such as Brahming. This is clearly established from Vidura's words:-"As I was born a Sudra, I cannot teach any further." 

Taladhara and Dharmavyadha (who were of lower castes) only did this much: they treated with respect the Brahmins who came to them to have their doubts cleared regarding dharma and made them understand the points at issue, just like people who put pil. grims on the right path when they happen to have lost their way. They did not become the main ūcharyas (of the Brahmias). This is bow the incidents in the Itihasas should be understood. 

"Bhakti 021o devotion is of eight kinds. If this bhakti is found in a mleccha, he should be considered as a devout and knowing Brabmin. To him giving is proper and from hina taking is proper. He should be treated with the same reverence as I myself". This sloka has been commented upon (by Peria Achan Pillai) As mean. ing not that girls might be given in marriage to him and the like, but that he may be given the gift of knowledge and such like. "Treatment with reverence" (poojyah) is & general term. There. fore it means that if a man has devotion to Bhagavan, he should be treated with as much respect as the sõstras permit. Its purport is merely this much, that if & nian treats such a devotee in the same way as he would treat others of the same caste, he would go to bell. The great sage summarised this in the sloka “He who 20treats a devotee of Bhagavan, be he a Sudra, a huntsman, or even a man who eats dog's flesh, as he would treat other men of these

Therefore the contention that all devotees of Vishou are of the same caste either because of the lower caste perishing or of all castes perishing--this contention is foolishi Reverence for the sake of devotion to Bhagavan is common, according to the sages, to all. Equality by the destruction of castes and the like will occur (only) at the time of mukti. 

In the Bhagavad Gtīū and elsewhere, in such passages as the following, the regulations and limits of the respective castes and regulations of conduct in accordance with castes have been declared in unequivocal terms, even in the case of men who have devotion to Bhagavan:-"Women," Vaisyas and Sudras, even among these, whoever seek me as refuge will attain the highest state". "The man who is absorbed in the performance of the duties and rites pertaining to his caste will attain the supreme end of life. Learn from me how this happens. The man attains his end by worship ping Bhagavan with the performance of his ordained karma"; "Therefore the Sudra should not atter my names with the pranava (aun)", "Bhagavan who is the Supreme Person is adored by the man who performs the duties and rites of his varna and his asrama. There is nothing which delights Bhagavan other than this". "The man? who does not deviate in the least from the karmas ordained for his caste, who considers alike those who wish him well and those who wish him ill, and who never deprives another of what belongs to him and never does any action of violence (himsā) - know that this man who has a mind free from

faults like desire is a devotee of Vishnu". Thus the virtue of being a devotee of Bhagavan and the specific fruit which will result from it (mukti) are common, whereas diversity of castes and diversity of codes of conduct persist (uptil mukti). This is evident from such passages as this." The Sudra is ( really) "fortunate and Kaliyuga is (really ) fortunate". 

SATTVAM OF THE BODY AND SATTVAM OF THE MIND. 

It has been said, "Tamas" (ignorance, sloth etc., ) is found in great measure in the Stidra, rajas in the kshatriya and sattvam in the Brahmin". Owing to the preponderance of such qualities as sattvam, in the body, a man is entitled to be called a Brahinin, a kshatriya and the like. But this is different from the praise of being & Brahmin that is often given in certain passages, owing to the quality of sattvam and the like in the mind. The qualities of caste pertaining to the body which are due to the special qualities of the body arise even at the time of birth and remain until death. The Brahmin-like qualities which arise out of the preponderance of sattvam in the mind may be present in all castes. In such as Prablada they are present even at the time of birth. In others, owing to such specific causes as contact with ächāryas, these (mental) qualities are acquired (later). Some (texts in the) stāstras are applicable to a person as a consequence of the particular caste pertaining to the body. Owing to the Brahmin-like qualities (of the niind) and the like, the attainment of the supreme end of life and the upüyas therefor and also such things as eulogy may be found in all castes. If in a Brahmin are found such features as are incongruous (with his caste), it wil meet with censure that, born in a caste which is declared by the süstras as being capable of such virtues as self restraint and mental serenity, he lapsed from the condition suitable to bim. If & man born in other castes acquires the higber virtues, he will be extolled bigbly as stated in the siloka :-"Men are to be honoured in the

following order of preference--for the possession of vidya (jnana), of right karma, of age, of relatives and of wealth. Even & Sidra possessing these is fit to be honoured in old age". 

If the excellence arising from the body and from the qualities of the mind were to cause pride or arrogance, it would lead to evil consequences. If the inferiority in the one (caste due to the body) and in the other (wental virtues) as described respectively in the following passages, "I was not born in any of the four castes where dharma could be practised.'; and “I was born in a family renowned in the world wherein every one was pure and performed yoga, where every one knew the truth about prakriti with its three qualities, and the jivas, where every one had his mind firmly fixed at Thy lotus-like feet and yet I inclined to sin and am now suok in samsāra, O Saviour" -- if these two kinds of inferiority are reali. sed by a person and if it should generate in him kārpanya (humility) so that he adopts the particular upāya suitable for his ūkinchanya (helplessness), it will be extolled, because it will lead to the attain. ment of the ultimate end. Thus though there are regulations regarding castes and the code of conduct pertaining to each caste, there is nothing to prevent a person from being honoured in the mind as established above. 

EKĀNTINS AND PARAMAIKANTINS: 

Among those who are devoted to Bhagavan, those who do not bow to any other deity are Ekūntins (ie.) men with exclusive devotion to Bhagavan, as stated in the siloka :-- "Exclusive devo. tion 81 (Ekāntitvam) to Bhagavan is common to all these three. Exclusive devotion consists in indifference to all other deities and in depending on Him alone." 

Among them the man with jnana is called Paramaikantin or man with supreme and exclusive devotion to Bhagavan, because he does not want anything else and among these latter, the supreme 29. Tirucchanda Viruttam - 90 3 1. Gitartha Sangraha : 28-32 30. Alavandar Stotram: @I 

308 and exclusive devotion of those who, impatient of delay, have performed bharanyāsa to the Almighty Seshi, and who, uader standing the truth of the struti that those asking for other things are like meo putting their money to interest, do not ask even for moksha as a reward and consider service (kainkarya) as an end in itself -- the supreme sod exclusive devotion of these men is like gold which is sixteen points pare*. The great sages who can estimate this degree of purity bave described, at considerable length, the greatness of these men with supreme and exclusive devotion to Bhagavan, ia such treatises as the Mahabharata. 

It is said in the " Vihagendra Samhita" as follows: "The man who is always thinking of Narayana - whatever be the calling (vritti) he $ follows for his living, that is adoration; whatever he says (jalpah) is japam; whatever he sees is meditation or dhyāna; the water that has received contact with his feet is incom parably holy water; whatever is left after he has eaten will purify; his mere words are & sacred mantra: whatever he touches becomes pure." These slokas, it is true, are authoritative, but "whatever be the calling, that is adoration" does not refer to any calling that is condemned in the sāstras. It means that even if the man is obliged, owing to the unfavourable conditions brought about by place, time and the like, to follow a calling which is not ordained for him, it will be a proper means of obtaining the materials required for the adoration of the Lord, for it has been said: "In **times of adversity, a man may follow a calling slightly lower than that prescribed for him." The passage which says : - "Even the sin committed for my sake will be counted as dharma" has also the same purport. If this (interpretation) were not accepted, it wonld extend even to those callings that are probibited. Even if the reading (in the sloka cited above) be cheshta ( movement) and not vritti (calling), just like the acts intended for keeping the body alive and those that are enjoined by the sastra, which are

(therefore ) accepted, the word cheshta (movements) would refer to such things as the closing and the opening of the eyes wbich are natural and which are reckoned in the secret sāstra (i.e.) Bhaga. vat Sastra as among* the offerings to the Lord. This will not extend to those inovaments that are forbidden (in the sastras). Only those which are not forbidden and which are consistent with one's nature and reason and with sästra are ordained as fit to be offered. This applies also to the sloka in the Gita which elaborates this idea, namely, “ Whatever you do for the protection of the body, whatever you eat, whatever offerings you make in the fire and whatever tapas you perform, do it, O son of Kunti, as if it were an offering to be placed before me." If, in such cases, any offence is committed against the sästras, one should perform, on the occasion, expiatory rites which are of the nature of service obligatory for the occasion (naimittka), in accor. dance with what is competent for one. "Whatever he says (jalpah) is japa" does not refer to vain chattering such as is forbidden in the siloka : “Harsh 8speech, exaggeration of merits, tale bearing, inappropriate talk-- these are the four sins of speech." It refers to the series of speeches and counter-speeches that are held by the man with his disciples, preceptors, fellow students, scholars and those who are in pursuit of spiritual excellence in order to teach wbat is not known, to confirm what is already known or to remove doubts. Or the word jalpah in that sloka might mean the succes. sion of speeches that are made in debate to refute infidels and heretics, for, though it is stated as a general rule, "One should not88A debate merely for the sake of a quarrel without the desire to know the truth", yet the dharma - s'āstras declare: "One should** condemn, according to one's ability, those who speak ill of Bhaga. van or of one's acharya". "Whatever he sees is meditation or Athyrina" does not refer to such things as witnessing forbidden

dances. It describes how when this man proceeds to render service (kainkarya), whatever object meets his eye appears to him as haviog Brahman as its inner self, for it has been said, 'I am Haria: all this is Jagardana; the causal substances like mahat and the effects which are produc-d therefrom are not different from Him. The man who thinks in this manner -- he will never fall & victim to the diseases of pleasure and pain which arise in samsāra", So also it is said, “Whatever appears ( before his eyes) is the Supreme Self". The sentence “ T'he water that has received contact with his feet is incomparably holy water" only assigns a superior merit when it is due. When the water from the feet is considered as holy, if there is exclusive devotion to Narayana in the person, it is said to be holier than other sacred waters. It does not refer to such things as impure water which may, by chance, come into contact with his feet. The statement "What ever is left after he has eaten purifies” refers only to certain specific remnants (of food) (ucchishta) which are prescribed && puri. ficatory in contexts like a repeated Upanayana. Owing to the excellence of this quality, (the remnant of the food) is said to have superior parifying power. The words, certainly, do not mean that when disciples, sons and the like are devoted to Narayana, whatever is left 88 rempant after they have eaten is purificatory for acharyus and parents. It is said in the Sanatkumāra Samhita that the man who has eaten the food that has been offered to other deities or what is left as a remnant after those who are other than gurus have eaten should, for purification, live on wilk alope for a month (puyovrata), should always utter ashtākshara and eat also Brahmakurcha - panchagavya. This passage prescribes the code of conduct for one who follows the dharma of Bhagavan and has been taken for illustration by Alavandar in his Agama Prämänya. Therefore the verse - "If the *remnant of the food that has been already eaten by the devotees of the Lord is given to me, it will immediately make me pure" moment is only applicable to

25 SASTRAIC RESTRICTIONS ALWAYS BINDING 811 

gurus. Even if it is of general application, it means only this much - "If those who are devotees of the Lord should give me what is left over after their meal, it would purify me, even though they have been obliged, by force of unfavourable circumstances like place and time, to follow occupations lower than those ordained for them and to make others also follow them." In this (Tamil) passage, if the word sesha should mean only what is left in the vessels in which the food was cooked as in the question and answer (after & srāddha) - "what is to be done with the food left over ?," and "let it be eaten in the company of friends" - if it should mean only this, there is nothing wrong. The word ucchishta, too, has been employed in the srutis to mean what is left in the cooking vessel after (people) have dined. Madu and others bave determined to this effect :- "One 39A should give up wealth and pleasure (artha and kama) when they are against dharma. Even dharma which is likely to bring suffering or which is likely to rouse disgust among people in the world should be given up". 

" His very speech should be considered as a sacred mantra ". This menns that even the words in the vernacular language emp loyed by bim as necessary for spiritual elevation should be cherish ed like Tirumantra and reflected upon. It does not mean that his talk on worldly affairs is fit to be uttered as japa. The saying : "His words in jest should be cherished as the texts in the srutis" should also be interpreted in this sense. “All that he touches be comes pure'; This should be interpreted as follows:- When a man is ill (and cannot himself bathe ), another is allowed to touch him and bathe for his sake; when the acharya initiates the s'ishya into the sacred mantras, he touches the sishya with his hand; this touch is called "touch with the band of Vishou". When an idol is Dewly installed, it is touched with the hand by great devotees of the Lord. In certain other circumstances, too, the touch with the hand is prescribed as purificatory. The passage means, therefore, that his touch of all things is even more purificatory in such contexts as are ordained in the sāstras. 

39A. Manusmriti: 4-176 

40. Jaanasaram : 40 

312 CHAPTER 

If this (interpretation) were not accepted, it would follow that the things which are condemned in the following slokas would become pure by his touch:-"The fruit of the fig tree (9488&ST) should not be eaten". "One" should not eat kommatti or (mullangi), athikkäi, suraikkai and kovaippazham Bhagavan ever stands far away from the man who always eats them." He who eats white brinjals, soap-out (C$$$TQ&.0L), kommatti (or mul. langi), kuvalai, athikkai, kāndal in ignorance-to him Bhagavan is always at a distance. He who eats, kommatti, sittavarai, kandal, nilaippanai and suraikkai - to him Bhagavan is ever at & distance." He who eats white brinjals, koinmatti, cheese (or curds) made from the milk of a cow within ten days of its caly. ing, the bulb of the lotus -- he will never think in his last moments of Bhagavan, the Lord of the world, "He who has eaten "Svelangãi (Cameru), peerku, irulli, vellulli, näikkudai (mushroom) ärpanrikkizhangu - he should perform the expiatory ceremony called 'Chandrāyana'. “To eat the sprout of the cocoanut, sanaippukkirai, mushroom, kusumbai, suraikkai, fruits or vege tables that have been produced with nightsoil as manure, milk mixed with salt, ghee that has been poured into the remnants of food on the leaf or plate, water in the place where the dhoby washes clothes to eat these is the same as to drink toddy." "The man who thinks of“ Bhagavan shoald never drink vinegar (611). It is reckoned as liquor. Therefore one should earnestly avoid it." "The "Vaishnava who touches blood even without know ing what it is - I never condone his offence, O goddess of the earth, even after a thousand apologies." "He who is born a * Brahmin and eats anna (cooked food) on the Ekadasi day - he eats sin in every morsel and the morsel is comparable to the dung of the dog "."

is no doubt of this. The man who drinks liquor goes to bell by him. self, whereas the man who eata anna on Ekādasi day drags his ancestors (also) into hell". "The mind becomesar impure by eating forbidden food, by coveting what one has not got, by seeing various objects of sepse-pleasure and by want of cleanliness in the body". " Yam& plans to kill the Brahmin with (the weapons of) failure to study the Vedas, the absence of right observances, laziness and forbidden food." 

If no such discrimination were accepted, it would conflict with many sāstras which have been recognised as great authorities and also with the traditional observances of the learned (sishta ). Therefore to state such views is merely of the nature of exaggera. tion (of some one aspect). Even by the man who, bas supreme and exclusive devotion (paramaikāntin) and whose greatness is boundless, these restrictions imposed by the săstras are not viola. ted. This may be understood from the observances until the last day of their lives, of great acharyas like Nathamudi, Alavandar and Sri Ramanuja. 

THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RITES OF THE VARNAS 

AND ASRAMAS IS OBLIGATORY: 

Those who are outside the palo of the Vedas and those who hold heretical views give up, owing to delusion, these restrictions and regulations which are ordained in the Vedas and the sāstras based on the Vedas. That this kind of renunciation is due to tamas is declared by Bhagavan in the sloka :- "One ** should not give up the karma ordained for the castes and the asramas. Their omission arising from ignorance is renonciation (tyāga) due to tamas". He bas (also) declared that the giving up of activities and abstentions which are of the nature of pain is renunciation due to rajas, in the following:- "He who gives op karma,because it is painful and fatiguing to the body - he 

47. Sriranga Mahatmiya 47-10 48. Manusmriti 5-3 

49. Bhagavad Gita 18-7 50. Bhagavad Gita 18-8314 CHAPTER 

renounces owing to rajas and does not obtain the fruit of renunci ation." His tyāga or renunciation is like that of the man who becomes sannyāsin because of the difficulties of maintaining a family. 

While giving up, in accordance with our competence, what should be given ap and doing what should be done, we should give up the thought, "I am doing all this as an independent agent, this activity is dependent on me; this will be the means of my attaining such and such an object". We should, on the other hand, think that the Supreme Rnler is the (real) doer and that we render service to Him, which is His due, with the sole object of pleasing Him. If we follow this line of thought (in what we do and in what we refrain from ), it is renunciation due to sattvan, and this has been declared by Bhagavan in :-"To perform the karma ordained for a man with the thought that it is an end in itself and that it ought to be done without the thought that the karma is his (independent) action and without the desire for gain of any kind - this is, O Arjuna, renunciation due to sattvam" The man should observe (these rites and regulations ) solely for the pur pose of pleasing Bhagavan. He should not even ask for moksha 28 a reward, for he should realise that, by the grace of the All merciful Lord which has been won by the prapatti performed before, moksha is oertain. (He should) render service (kainkarya) like those who have already attained mukti. This would resemble a healthy man eating food with milk (without any thought of the care from illness to be obtained from milk). Such a code of conduct is the bighest limit of renunciation due to sattvam. This is like eating food when men are hungry. Otherwise their conduct would resemble that of men who eat cakes for winning a wager, (They cannot derive any true pleasure therefrom). (The man that eats food when hungry enjoys it, because he does so with no other object than satisfying his hunger. The man who eats cakes for winding a wager, cannot find any relish in doing so.)

THE MEANING OF CHARAMA SLOKA 

316 

THE REAL MEANING OF "HAVING GIVEN UP ALL DHARMAS" 

IN THE CHARAMA SLOKA: 

While commenting on the words (in the Charaina Sloka ) “Having given up all dharmas", the author of Sri Bhashya inter preted them at first to mean that the giving up of dharmas means the giving up of the thought that, in his action, the man himself is the doer seeking a certain gain for himself by that means. This is renunciation of action due to sattvain (and not the giving up of the dharma itself viz., nitya and naimittika). This form of thought should be borne in mind by the man who bas adopted prapatti as a direct and independent upāya, at the time of the performance of prapatti and also in bis further actions (after prapatti), which are ends in themselves and have no relation of any kind to an upaya. In the second interpretation given of those words (by the author of of the Bhashya), they mean that when the man of poor ability who cannot brook any delay in the attainment of mukti falls into grief or despair at the thought of all the dharmas or rites prescribed in the sästras and his inability to perform them, the Lord, in order to dispel his despair, ordained another means which is easy of per forinance and has to be adopted only once and said: "You need not go about seeking other upāyas" The prapanna should note that in order that one may be competent for prapatti, the absence of adoption of any other upaya before its performance is a requisite which has been present of its own accord by the grace of God. In regard to actions after the performance of prapatti, this giving up of the adoption of other upāyas is insisted on in the sästra itself and this shows how prapatti does not require any aid (after it is once done). 

If the word parityajya (having given up) merely states what has, on account of inability, already occurred (and not what is enjoined), the meaning (of the first part of the charama sloka) would be that this having given up is a qualification for prapatti. If, on the other hand, the words (having given up) state what is 

816 CHAPTER 

ordained or enjoined to be done, then the meaning would be that prapatti does not require anything else to be performed. Thus, if parityajya (having given up) merely states what has already taken place or what has already occurred, the words mām ekanı will have to be thought of as meaning that nothing else (than Bhaga van) is required for the attainment of the desired end. If, on the other hand*, parityajya means that prapatti requires nothing else for yielding its fruit, the words, mã suchah (do not grieve), show, by the force of logic or meaning, that the grief or despair wbich is a mark of being destitute of other means is what is required for competency for praputti (adhikara;) 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

If prapatti stands in the place of bhakti or upāsana as one of the Brahma Vidyās, then the question arises whether the angas of bhakti might be considered as the angas of prapatti as well. But, in prapatti, they are not required as angas. This is indicated by the words mām and ekam. 

(If the word, parityajya, makes an injunction that other things should not be considered as angas for prapatti, and if the words (māsuchan) (do not grieve or despair) show that the previous grief or despair is qualification for prapatti (ākinchanya), then, where is the appropriateness of the word ekam (it may be asked ). The answer is :- the word ekam is intended to show that in the mental or sättvika renunciation of action by sattvam, it should be borne in mind that the jiva's doersbip is all dependent on the Lord and other sach things, that in prapatti, the means (upāya) and the end are one and the same (viz., the Lord) and that prapatti stands in the place of all (other) upāyas. 

*NOTE:-To the man or adhikari who grieves at his inability to adopt the dharmas or angas enjoined for bhakti yoga, the Charama Sloka says, “Per foro prapatti to me and you need not adopt any other dharma". 

25 

SINS SHOULD BE AVOIDED 

317 

Our acharyās like (Appallar) have argued thus: 

Since nitya and maimittika karma are enjoined on a man (irrespective of all fruit or gain that might arise from it) simply by virtue of his being a servant of the Lord, they should not be given up, lest he should be violating the command of the Master, (although they may not be required as angas for prapatti). 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS: 

Those who have violated the commands (of the Lord) and have not performed the expiatory ceremonies ( prāyaschitta ) enjoined for these violations according to their competence - they must suffer the consequences of the violation. By acting in accor. dance with the commands, one avoids the evil consequences (due to violation) and enjoys (also) the pleasure arising from the delight of the Lord. Thus two gains are certain. 

Such things as svarga that are declared to be the fruit of certain (good) karmas will not arise (as the prapanna performs them without desiring any fruit.) But if the man performs forbid den actions, the evil consequences will necessarily follow (though not desired by him), owing to another cause (viz. doing the forbid. den thing). 

When prapatti was treated (by the Bhashyakära) as an anga of bhakti yoga, it was only to illustrate how it wins bhakti yoga 48 a fruit, since it is capable of securing all fruits. In this context, we should bear in mind that, on the lines of the Bhashyakara's second interpretation (of the charama sloka ), prapatti stands in the place of all upāyas including bhakti yoga, wbich are difficult of performance. In accordance with his first interpretation, (that every dharma should be done with the thought that it is performed not by oneself but by the Lord and for His own ends - sāttvika parityāga) and not out of any desire for one's own gain, the meaning should be considered as enjoining the performance of prapatti with that thought and the service rendered by the pra. panna as an end in itself. 

818 CHAPTER 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS: 

"When a man falls into despair or grief because he is not able to adopt certain upayas which are prescribed as productive of the desired results - to that man I stand as those upāyas. This is the gist of the charama sloka." 

The performance or the non-performance of certain dharmas (like nitya and naimittika) are not to be considered as angas of prapatti. The man desires to perform these actions of which be is capable, because they have been ordained for him (without any reference to prapatti ). The non-performance of those actions of which he is incapable constitutes akinchanya (helplessness) which is necessary for prapatti. 

Rites like dars'a and purnamāsa bave not been prescribed as requisites for vajnas (sacrifices ). So at the time of the per. formance of yajnas, they are not performed. But on occasions like the new-moon day, they have to be done because they are enjoined on their own account. So also here; (i.6.) nitya and naimittika are not prescribed as angas for prapatti; they are not to be performed at the time of prapatti as its angas, but because they have been enjoined on their own account, without any rela tion or reference to prapatti. 

The teaching "Give upes dharma and adharma" relates to the giving up of those dharmas which are said to be productive of certain gains (kānıya) and of those karmas which are forbidden." 80 also "give up satyam and also anritam" means "Do not desire satyam* the enjoyment cr experience of your self as an end in itself; also do not desire the enjoyment of *anrita the pleasures of the world, wealth and the like ". It may also mean: "Give up speaking even that truth (satyam) which will cause pain to

KRISHNA'S ADVICE TO UDDHAVA

others." In order to reveal the excellence of his teaching, it is repeated again :-" Having given up both satyam and anritam", it is said further, "Give up the thought which enables you to give up satyam and anritam, namely, the thought that you are the doer", in order to enable us to realise that even our doersbip is dependent on another (the Lord ) Thus there is no authority here for violating the commands of the Lord. 

Now let us consider what was taught to Uddhava :- In spite of what has been said so far, some quote the words addressed to Uddhava.--"Give up, Uddhava, all injunctions (vidhis) (like sandhyā, wbich are prescribed as a means to an end); give up all prohibitions such as “don't injure others"; give up the dharmas to be actively performed and also the dharmas which prescribe the avoidance of or abstention from certain acts and also the requi. sites (angas) which you have heard so far and which you will learn bereafter as being necessary for both of them (Give up all these) and seek refuge in Me alone by all means, for I am the Inger Self of all beings. By doing so, you will attain moksha, where there is freedom from all fear". They quote these words and argue as follows "Since, here we are enjoinedt to give up the abstention froin certain actions, and since in the charama sloka, it is not proper to restrict or limit the meaning of sarva (all) in sarva karınāı, it follows that we should give up even the abstention (from evil acts )." This would mean that we should perform forbidden things as much as lies in our power. Since the doing of these forbidden things is something that, according to them, is enjoined, these people argue in their delusion that even if the prapanna does forbidden things deliberately after prapatti, there would be no stain left. This is extremely ridiculous, for the (notorious) charvakas (alepakas) say that even if a man sins, it leaves no staia behind, whereas the argument stated above goes further and is taatavuount to saying that (the prapanna ) should necessarily commit sin: This is "like the fish swallowing greedily 53.

If the interpretation (given by these men) were the real mean. ing (of the teaching to Uddhava), it would follow that all the forbidden things done by a man throughout his life would be the requisites (angas) of prapatti. The injunction that prapatti with its angas should be done only once would then have no meaning. It is not possible to do all the forbidden things at the moment of performing prapatti. Nor bave we seen any one performing prapatti, doing as much of the forbidden as lies in his power. According to this contention of theirs, even sips cannot be called sins (since they are enjoined), in the same way as injury ( to animals) in the Agpishomiya sacrifice is not called a sin ( be cause it is enjoined). All this would be in conflict with their own commentary on the words "I will release thee from all sins", including the sins that might be committed deliberately after pra. patti. It would imply that we should commit the three kinds of offences of the wind, speech and body ) as much as lies in our power. It is also opposed to the code of conduct followed by previous acharyas, to the tradition of our ancients, to their own actual conduct and, further, to the observances of present day aspirants to mukti. Those who contend in this manner should, wben they are attacked by & prapanna owiog to the desire for wealth or for pleasure, have to say; “Is this not, indeed, the dharma expected of a prapanna ?", and feel delighted. This would be opposed to countless pramanas and is also not the real purport of the words in question. Some acharyas would explain this contention that abstention from forbidden things is also included in the words sarva dharman (as something to be given up) es due to ignorance of the meaning of the word dharma. It is in this way: Among abstentions only that which is done in accor

GIVING UP ADHARMA

dance with prescribed rules as a means to secure a particular object is called dharma. Mere non-violence (ahimsā) is only the absense of sin and is not dharma in the primary sense of the word ( for ao rules or restraints are observed). Therefore to give up non-violence under taken for the sake of an object and in accordance with rules and restraints (niyama) means to give up the object aimed at and the rules and restraints in practising it. Beyond this, there is no au. thority for giving up the abstention from forbidden things that is prescribed in the nivritti sāstras (i.e.) sāstras for securing mukti, 

Even if it be held that more ahimsā which is not accompanied by niyama (the observance of rules and restraints ) is also meant by the word dharia, we submit the following: 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS: 

“If the word dharma includes in its import also the giving up of adharma, the giving up of adharma will have to be done always, as it is an independent vidhi or injunction (which has nothing to do with praputti), 

dre 

"It is impossible to contend in an assenably of the wise that the giving up of what is pleasing (to the Lord) anukilya and the performance of what is disagreeable ( to Him) prātikulya are angas to prapatti. 

"Let us bear in mind the fact that the injunction not to violate the code of conduct of the good (such as giving up sandhyā or sitya and naimittika) which we fiud in the chapter on prapatti is intended to apply only to the prapanna". 

When it is thus clear that these should not be given up as they are injunctions which have no relation to prapatti and which are independent rules. it may be asked wbat is the meaning of the teaching to Uadhava which says "Give up what is enjoined for action and also what is forbidden, give up action and abstention from action". The answer is that they mean only this much : that they should not be observed as angas or requisites for prapatti : 

322 CA APTER 

In the case of the aspirapt for mukti, it may mean also those activities and abstentions which are enjoined as means for securing certain other ends (than moksha) in those sästras that enjoin them, 88 in the passage: "Give up those dharmas that are the means of securing dharma, artha and käma," As against this, if it were held that nitya and naimittika karmas and the like are themselves (svarīpatyāga) to be given up, it would be opposed to everything that has been pointed out before. Those who are intelligent and who are sättvikas will appreciate this conclusion and approve of it. (The Alvars) have stated this in such passages as the following: "We wills? never do what ought not to be done. We* will never go (to any acharya), and study heretical sāstras", and "Vouchsafe# Thy grace so that I may not do wicked deeds". If we consider the import of the verse "O Lord 58A of the world! Consider my offences as virtuous acts", it also means the prayer that the offences should be pardoned. Therefore if the prapanna happens to commit an offence, he is bound to obtain pardon as declared in the passage :- " Whether "offences are committed deliberately or in ignorance, the only expiation that is required is to say " Pardon me ". 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

"He who is incapable of other forms of expiation or who is impatient of delay performs prapatti, once again, to the Lord, without transgressing the rule of lokasangraha". 

The contention that when there is aspiration for mukti, no forbidden thiogs will be done deliberately means only that it would be uplikely, belog inappropriate. It is like the saying that "in the Brahmins there is control of the senses". (It does not mean that the control is always found). Even in the case of great seges

SINS HAVE TO BE EXPIATED 

323 

and of men who were sage-like, there have occurred forbidden actions and expiations therefor. If it were otherwise ((1.e) that the aspirant for mukti would never commit an offence deliberately) then, since those wbo are upāsakas following bhakti yoga are also aspirants for nukti, it would follow that they, too, would not commit offences deliberately and the conclusion that is arrived at in Sri Bhashya that freedom from stain caused by later sins is applicable only to sing committed in ignorance and that there is no pardon for sins committed deliberately - this conclusion would then become meaningless. 

There is no difference between the upāsaka (the follower of Bhakti yoga) and the prapanna in regard to what is forbidden on account of caste (varna ), āsrama, sex (jāti), gotra (family), pravar, ( ancestry), right conduct, race kula, place, time, bodily or mental condition (avastha), character (guna) or convention (samaya). If what is forbidden bas been done, there is difference in the manner of expiation, because that depends on the com. petency (adhikära). 

The verse, "My servantse will never commit offences. Even if they commit them, I will consider them as if they were virtuous actions" - even this verse indicates that offences are not unlikely. The sentence "If they conmit offences, I will consider them as virtuous actions" means “If done in ignorance, I will pardon them. If offences are committed deliberately and if they do not obtain pardon, I will condone them after inflicting punishmeat, but will never forsake them. That, as a matter of fact, these offences are not virtuous acts is ipdicated therein when it is said: "It will be consi-lered as if they were good deeds". 

It is (distinctly) stated: “If there is an offence, expiation should be done at once. The expiation that is to be done is to per. form prapatti again". Therefore it cannot be contended that, if the prapanna commits an offence deliberately after prapatti, 

61. Perialvar Tirumozhi 4-4-2 

62. Lakshmitantram 17 (91-92).324 OH APTER 

Iswara will not have the desire to punish (the prapania), nor can it be said that if the Omnipotent Lord desires to panish and if pardon be not obtained, there will be no evil result following (for when He has once willed, the result must take place, for He is Almighty). If it be held that the offence would only cause the absence of pleasure to the Lord, then if that displeasure would not cause any evil (to the man), there would be no need to perform & later prāyaschitta (which is distinctly ordained in the passage cited above.) If it be held that the utmost that would happen (on account of the offence) is only absence of pleasure to oneself in addition to that of the Lord, the evil consequences, Damely, absence of pleasure will have to be admitted. It may be said :-(Let there be absence of pleasure; absence of pleasure being only & particular form of koowledge, it would last only for an instant). There is no reason for performing a prayaschitta in connection with the absence of one's own pleasure which has passed away. It it is said that the expiation or prāyaschitta is intended only to avoid the absence of pleasure in oneself that might continue, then, there is every reason to perform expiation owing to the fear that the sufferings stated in the srutis and the smritis (for non-performance of ordained rites and observances - nitya and naimittika ) would follow when the time comes for its fruition, for these sufferings are on the same footing as this displeasure ). 

Therefore in order to avoid (1) these sufferings and (2) the interruption to the enjoyment of the Lord (Bhagavad anubhava) here and the diminution of it caused by the weakness of the sepses, the fading of the intelligence, sorrow and the like and (3) in the case of those whose term of life has not already been upalterably fixed, delay in the ultimate gain, viz., moksha by the exteosion of the age limit - in order that this may not happen, prapatti bas to be performed again. Even those who hold the opinion that this is not required will have to concede that the por. formance of this latter prapatti will be pardoped by the Lord (even if it be considered as an offence ), since they hold the opinion that the Lord will forgive (even ) the doing of forbidden things. 

25 

ATONEMENT NECESSARY

We have already explained that it is not possible to perform prapatti in anticipation for offences that might be committed deli berately in future and that there is nothing improper in performing a later prapatti in order to obtain a fruit or object which was not prayed for in the previous prapatti (in the chapter on Expitation for Offences ). Thus it may be understood that there is nothing improper in observing the code of conduct followed by the good and arising from the commands of the Lord, (viz., nitya and naimittika ). 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

He who maintains the view that the prapanna will not be tainted even when he does forbidden things, - why does he view. with anger those who, in accordance with the Lord's commands, observe the code of conduct ordained as proper ? 

When it is held (by these disputants) that even when the (Lord's) commands are violated, He would not fail to protect, how could it be said that He would withhold His protection when His commands are performed ? 

No form of service (to the Lord) is proper without right conduct. When a man has not made himself clean, he is not fit to worship the Lord. 

Dharma is born of right conduct: and the Lord of Dharma is Achyuta." The meaning of all the sāstras is explained in these words in the fifth Veda (Mahābhārata). 

The remembrance of the prapatti (performed before ) which is taught by the wise is for the purpose of giving up such prāyas. chittas 88 one is not competent to perform and the performance of such others as one is competent for, 

When prapatti is remembered, the thought will arise that Bins committed in ignorance will cause no taint. It will also be understood that when they are committed deliberately, the per formance of a further prapatti is necessary. 

326 CHAPTER 

"Therefore the wise man should remain without committing any offence. But wben offences have occurred, the proper thing to do would be another prapatti". 

The activities of the man who performed prapatti ( at first) praying that he should be sinless and of the man who performed & further prapatti in order that his later life may be free from sin will inyeriably be free from sin. 

PRÄYASCHITTA FOR DELIBERATE OFTENCES 

IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY: 

Some may say, in (utter) disregard of texts to the contrary, that (even ) the offences committed deliberately by the prapanna would be pardoned, their opinion being based on certain incidents in the Itihāsas and the Puranas. This contention, too, arises from an ignorance of the real opinions in the respective contexts. (For instance) when Sugriva transgressed the time fixed by him for carrying out the terms of the alliance, the offence caused the appearance of great grief in Sri Rama's mind and he said, "The way in which Valin was slain is not yet closed. Abide by the terms of the agreement, O Sugriva. Do not go the way of Valin." On hearing these words, Lakshmana became so angry that the Lord bad to bring down his wrath. He went to Sugriva (to denounce him). On that occasion, did not (Hapumap), the scholar versed in the science of Indra's grammer, counsel Sugriva as follows:- "I do nothi see any other means for you, the offender, to escape from this situation except by begging the pardon of Lakshmana with folded hands". Sugriva, too, accepted this advice and said to Lakshman. "If out "of over-confidence or out of affection, I have transgressed in any way, pray, let the offence of your servant be pardoned". And Lakshmana too, had to seek Sugriva's pardon for over-stepping the proper bounds of speech by

327 

saying:- "Pardon me for any harsh words that I may have attered after listening to the words of Sri Rama in his grief." 

Thus even in the life of a prapanna, offences may occur deliberately, owing to past karma which has begun to operate (prārabdha). When they have occurred, the prapanna should repent and obtain pardon. When Alavandar says "I have not 

observed dharna (i.c.) karınayoga etc" and when it is said, "I have segiven up the rites that are to be performed by a Brahmin after ablution in the form of adoration to the three sacrifical Gres", it means only this much that he was not capable of such things as karma yoga and not that we should give up the observance of the Lord's commands (nitya and nuimittika), in so far as it lies in our power. 

Therefore even to a prapanna, action in obedience to the commands of the Lord and in accordance with the respective caste is an obligation that should be carried out until the bodies characte. rised by such things as Brahmic-dess a le cast off 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

"The service to the Lord of Sri (Lakshmi) should be perfor med according to one's ability and for its own sake, with the obser. vance of all the restraints and regulations (niyasa) prescribed (in the sāstras), in regard to the food to be eaten. the obtaining of knowledge (or the receiving of gifts ), the traditional mantra to be employed in the performance of rites and so also in regard to the acquisition of wealth and in regard to the respective caste and sucli 

like. 

"There is superior excellence in a person (adhikari) if, among the ordinary ways of right conduct, there is to be found in him the purity of conduct arising from the many purificatory ceremonies prescribed in the sāstras. So also there is superior excellence in 66. Ramayana: Kishkindha kanda : 36-28 68. Tirumalai 25 67. Alavandar: Stotram : 22 

328 CHAPTER 

the man who, in addition to the qualities of the spirit, such as self control, has also compassion to living beings. Superior also is the excellence of the man who, among all means of attaining his ends, adopts bhakti on prapatti There is also & supreme excellence in the man who, among all things desired as ends, chooses only moksha. (The siloka may also mean): 

"Superior is the excellence of the man who has the qualities of the spirit such as self-control and compassion to that of the man who merely follows the right code of conduct; superior is the man who has chosen the right upaya (bhakti or prapatti) to him who has only the qualities of the spirit; superior still is the man wbo has chosen the right end (namely) moksha to the man who bas only chosen the right upāya". 

This determination of the potency (of prapatti) should be borne in mind as being connected with the quality of Iswara as the controller indicated in the three mysteries (mantras). 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Our acharyas have declared that those who have understood the real import of the infallible words (in the charama sloka ) uttered by Sri Krishna, whose attributes and actions are wonderful, who is full of compassion and who has greater regard than for Himself to His servants that endure their existence only by His grace (or who shows His great regard to His servants by giving them His own likeness) - our richaryas hive declared that those wbo bave onderstood the real import of Sri Krishna's words will never approve the non-obsery wice of the way of life ordained in the Veda or Vedanta. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

Since the differences arising from such things as the four castes and the four asramas have been ordained (in the sästras), those who follow the line of conduct prescribed therein, whose con duct is also consistent with such attributes as devotion to the Lord

OBSERVANCE OF NITYA AND NAIMITTIKA

and who are proficient in the knowledge of the injunctions concerning prapatti, which are diametrically opposed to the bon. observance of the rites and duties pertaining to each caste and each asramu - these men of exclusive devotion to the Lord may be found even in this last yuga, and they will approve of the enquiry made so far (in this chapter). 

(26) THE CHAPTER ON THE VINDICATION OF 

(THE) POTENCY (OF PRAPATTI ). 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

It is, of course, wonderful that stones and the like should be. come women and the like (Ahalya); (but) more wonderful is it that fire should become as cold as snow (as in the case of Hanu. man) and that a blade of grass should become a missile (Kakasura); even niore wonderful is the act of slaying when it becomes the means of redemption (as for Sisupala and others). So also it is most wonderful that the sandal (of Sri Rama) should protect the three worlds. 

(Since the glory of Bhagavan is so wonderful, there is nothing surprising in praputti to Him accomplishing wonderful things.) 

We have already spoken about the limits within which pra patti has potency. We will hereafter remove the misconceptions of those who would minimise its potency, 

It has been said: "The man who has done good or evil deeds of a very serious nature will experience their fruits even here (in this life) within three days, three fortnights, three months or three years". In the same way, it has been said, "Bhakti as an upaya* destroy's all sids other than those wbich have begun to yield their fruits (prürabhdhu,, whereas prapatti (sidhyabhakti) is superior to bhakti and destroys even those sids which have begun to operate (prirabdha)". Therefore prapatti gets rid of even sins that have begun to bear their fruit (prürabdha) and yields the fruit of its own performance. As has been stated in regard to other vidyās (foros of meditation: upasana), that the sins committed before and those committed after upasana) will both be destroyed, prapatti, which is superior to them as a vidya dest

HOW SUFFERING HELPS THE PRAPANNA 331 

roys (even) the suffering due to karma which has begun to operate so that it may not continue the next iostant, the next day or the next life in accordance with the degree or intensity of the man's inipatience. This is the real purport of the words, "Do not despair or grieve", mā suchah (in the charma siloka). 

THE PURPOSE OF ISWARA IN MAKING 

THE PRAPANNA SUFFER: 

(In this connection) the following question may be asked by some who minimise the power of prapatti :-- "If this is the real meaning, should not the sufferings which are seen in the actual life of a prapanna as the result of prärabdha karma and the per formance of actions which would result in further suffering-shoold not these sufferings cease (at once)? If it is said that the Lord will grant the cessation of these (sufferings) only if He is prayed to, for it, by the sufferer, the question arises, "Why does not Iswara, who is the well-wisher of all (living beings), grant, of His own accord, the cessation of these connected sufferings also, in the saine way as prapatti grants incidentally such things as the ability to purify those who are in one's society. We do not see Iswara doing this. Therefore what is said in the charama sloka) about all gricf disappearing should be taken as not literally true, but as (exaggerated) praise of the potency of prapatti". 

The apswer to this question is as follows:- "Iswara is always inclined to bestow His grace. He is eager to confer mokshu on those who seek His protection even at the time of) the begin. ping of uttering the sentence which states prapatti. But owing to the man's desire, the Lord agrees to keep him here (in this world), for some time longer. If he enjoys the inferior pleasures of life without any pain (or sorrow or soffering), his desire will never disappear. Nor will the assurance that the realisation of the Lord is truly enjoyable grow in him. Therefore as bas been said in the following slokas: 

332 CRAPTER 

"He to whom I want to show favour - his wealth I take away from bim. Then his relatives forsake him. So be is ever full of sorrow or pain. If the man who suffers in this way continues to cling to me, I show him that grace which even the gods cappot obtain"; (as has been said in these slokas), Iswara avails Himself of those karmas which have begun to yield their fruit (prārabdha) and which are the cause of these sufferings and punishes these nen of hard hearts in order to correct them as a father and the like would do in the case of such as their sons) with a wbip at band. It is therefore proper to consider such punish wents as special favoors. 

When the king asked whether a disease could be (helpful), Bhattar replied that even a disease could be a teacher for us. Suf. ferings are teachers to the prapanna, because, if bis term of life is already ubalterably fixed, they would create repentance in the mind and if bis tern of life could be extended, they would teach him not to desire extepsion of life. This is well-known in such instances as Kurathalvan (*) 

The sufferings are intended only to reveal, to some, their offences with their consequences and then conceal them in order to create utter disgust, disgust like that of Perialvar who says:--- "Vy inind cannot bear the thought of living in samsāra, which is like living in a house in the roof of which there is & serpent," 80 that thereby they, too, night long for the release from samsāra which Iswara bas made up His mind to confer on them. In such contexts, the aspect of the experience of sorrow or pain is the fruit of evil deeds (in the past). The correction that ensures and that generates (the desire for) performing prāyaschitta is the fruit of the upaya, viz. prapatti. 

Among these, some punisbments are the fruit of certain good deeds in the past which have begun to operate (prārabdha). When 3. Bhagavatam? Varahapuranam? 3-A. Perialvar Tirumozbi: 11-8-3

HOW PUNISHMENT HELPS 

333 

the crow (Kakasura in the Ramayana) fell (at Sri Rama's feet) praying for life, the Lord gave him his life; the fruit of his prapatti was full and complete. Even the punishment inflicted on this wicked crow whereby he lost the sight of one eye was not really of the nature of a punishment. It was a special form of favour (because it would prevent him from doing evil again), 

Therefore just as we learn that the Lord's punishment, which is brought about by sins committed in an instant (but) which make the sioner wallow in Hell till the great dissolution (Bramā Pralaya), has great potency, so also we should learn that the special form of praņāma to Sri Krishna which is called *sukrita pranāma has great potency, for it has been said: "A single praņāma to Sri Krisha enables a man who wanders about in the wild and trackless forest of samsära to reach the boundary called moksha" and also : “ Would it be right to say that a single sukrita pranäma to Sri Krishna is equal to ten horse sacrifices ? (No). The man who has performed ten horse sacrifices returns again to (samsāra), but the man who has performed 'praņāma to Sri Krishna never returns". In accordance with the truths revealed in these silokas, we should interpret the following texts without circumscribing the potency of prapatti, in so far as it does not conflict with the meaning of the sästra :.- "Ele bwho performs prapatti only once and says, “I am Thine"-to him I grant freedom from fear of all beings. This is my vow", " If you are afraid of sin, 0 Bharata, desist from all action and remain with the thought that Narayana is alone the object to be attained by all possible means ", iind “Even if a man born of a low caste per forms prapatti to the Lord and that only once, the Lord protects him even if he has murdered his father and mother",

"The Lord protects biin even if he bas murdered his father and his mother" - Only whea this has not been committed after prapatti, will this sloka not be opposed to the rate concering prüyaschitta. If it be done after prapatti, we bave already shown how redemption could be obtained. In this way also could be easily explained such passages as this :- "Good nep' protect those who have sought iheir protection and who pray to them saying, "I am yours", even though they have murdered their fathers". 

THE POTENCY OF PRAPATTI. 

There may be some who are followers of our Visishtüdvaita darsana, who are aspirants to mukti and have sought the pro tection of Bhagavan through any one of the following paths prescribed in the seastra, viz., karma yoga, jnäna yoga, bhakti yoga or prapatti, but who are still in the earlier stages of yoga like *Yatamiina sünjna, when they have just begun to control the senses. Op finding in such men certain diseases like desire for money not completely cured, some to whom freedom from all desires is all important (even more than devotion to Bhagavan) would call them ignorant men unfit to be talked to. But this is improper as pointed out in the Bhagavat Sästra in the sections dealing with the professions followed by those who suffer from poverty. What has been said about those who follow the wrong path should not be applied to those who follow the right path but stumble in it (occasionally). About the former it has been said: "No giftsio should be received from those wbo observe dharma hypocritically for the sake of praise, from rationalists, from heretics and from those who are like cranes (ever bert on catcbing fish while appearing like one in contemplation): "They are to libe considered heretics who consider Bbagavan to be like others. They are unfit for the performance of all (sastraic) rites", and "Those

who wear matted" locks as an ornament and who have sbaved their heads bat who eat without performing yajna to the gods and the like, who are without any purity and who omit the performance of tarparas and sraddhas to their fore.fathers (pitris)-even by talking to such persons men go to Hell". (What has been said in these slokas does not apply to those who have only slipped or stunubled while following the right path). 

NO OFFENCE SHOULD EVER BE COMMITTED 

AGAINST BHAGAVATAS : 

Anong Bhagavatas, it is true that degrees of regard have been prescribed for those who have not received the purification by firem (or who have not done the rites or karma ordaioed for thern), who have not the.purification due to the wearing of the caste mark i bundra) (or who have given up their siitra ), who have not had the purification dne to nima (or who have renounced their gurus, gods and the like), and those who have not been initiated into the sacred mantras (or who have no association with good men). But fiven these will obtain redemption by some means or other (proyuschitta and the like) (provided they have not deviated from their exclusive devotion (to Bhagavan). The sastras have, indeed, Inid down the rule that offences should not be committed even agaiast these (inen). What has been said of the potency of karma yoga in the following slokas applies even more to that of bhukti apd prapatti: “The endeavour that has been com. menced in this karma-yogre never ends in vain; there is no offence if it is not completen; even a small fraction of this dharma redeems x n:an from measureless samsāra”, and “The "man who has begun yoga but has not completed it never perishes either here or in the higher world. (Is it not clear) that the man who has done a good thing will not meet with an evil end?" Further the Supreme Ruler Himself said to Arjuna and Dharma. 12. Vishnupuranam 3-8 - 105

putra respectively :--"Even "if a man is of impure waye, if he worships me without the desire for any other fruit, be is certainly a good man (sādhu). He is worthy of esteem, for his intentions are good", and "Even" if my devotees are inclined to sin, do Bip will cling to them, in the same way as water does not stain the leaf of the lotus". 

It has (also) been said in the discourse between Pundarika and Narada:-* He who "has sought the protection of the Lord, O best of Brahmins, whether he be clad in a garment of bark, whether he wears matted locks (jatā), whetber he holds a triad of sticks (like & sannyāsin), whether he has shaved his head clean or whether he bears the marks of other asramas or whether he has not any of them (it does not matter) for these are not the causes that win moksha. Even those who have no pity, who have wicked minds and are always inclined to evil ways --- even they attain the highest state, provided they have sought the protection of Narayana": "If the devoteesle of Visbou commit sins, the sins will not taint them, because they will perform prāyaschitta at once. They purify the whole world like the rising sun." "The man "in whom, at the end of thousands of virtuous lives, arises the thought that he is the servant of Vasudeva, who is the Supreme Self in all the worlds -- that man will go to the world of Bhagavan. There is no doubt of this. (Such being the case), is it necessary to speak of those who, with the seoses under control, bave fixed their souls in Bhagavao". In these silokas, it is stated that, even if devotees of Bhagavan continue to sin, they will doubtless attain mukti by performing prayaschitta and that (this being so) much more easily will sigless men attain mukti, turther the great sage declared also this, among other truths, that those who have no devotion to Bhagavan will never attain the desired goal even by

superior deeds of virtue: "Those * who do not torn their faces to Naroyand will never reach the desired goal, even though they have performed a bundred horse-sacrifices and many hundreds of Vajapeya sacrifices". 

Since it bas been said -- "He who Sunderstands Sri Krishna as He is' even the gods cannot know the extent of his greatness", even the eternal sūris cappot, indeed, measure his greatness. Therefore, even if sufferings afflict the devotees of Bhagavan who have continued to commit offences deliberately, they should not be treated with disregard. Has it not been stated as follows:- "By bowing s before those who are not devotees of Vishnu, by speaking of Bhagavan with irreverence, and by the vilification of the devotee of Visbna, (by all these), a man will surely have his fall. There is no doubt of this"? " The man who has stolen the bulb of the lotus - let bim vilify sanıyāsins always; let him treat with disre gard the devotees of Vishnu, let him be averse to (the study of) Vedanta, let the nan who has stolen the bulb of the lotus be out. wardly good, but inwardly wicked; let him hate those who know Brahman, and censure the rites and observances prescribed in the sästras. Let the man who has stolen the bulb of the lotus be ever perverse in bis intelligence and delude those who follow the right code of conduct and wbo have no firm faith in the s'āstra which treats of the jiva and the Parainātmā". 

The author of Sri Bhashya has, in his Saraņāgati Gadyanı spoken of offence to Bhagavan and the like ((1.c) offence to His devotees) along with the sins of omission and commission (while they too are sins of omission and commission). This is to indicute that offence to Bhagavan (and to Bhagavatas) is extremely serious, as when we speak of bovine cattle and bulls, the ball is mentioned separately, though it is included in "bovine cattle", simply to emphasise the bull. All sins are, of course, offences against

Bhagavao. So the separate meation of some kinds of sin is to refer to offences against Bhagavan and His devotees. Sri Rama. nuja's aim in this separate mention, is to state that whatever offences may be committed against others, it similar offences are committed against Bhagavan or His devotees, they would, by their very nature, lead to more severe punishments just, like treason against kings. The sphere of samsāra is, as it were, the nursery to Hell. Such being the case, it is very difficult to find in it people who walk in the right path. So to think ill of those who follow, in regard to Bhagavan, any one of the paths like karma yoga, which are like the first steps leading to mukti, in accordance with their competence (adhikära), is to commit an offence against the devotees of Bhagavan. 

When it is said :-" There S'is no mukti for one who is extre mely devoted to the science of grammar (Sabda Sastra), for one who sets much store by food and clothiog, for one who delights in living in a beautiful house and (80 also), for one who is able to allure the rpinds of the people in the world by one's speech ", it means (that there is no mukti for them) when there is no devotion to Bhagavan. The same is the meaning of the sloka :- “Those who are addicted to the pleasures of sex and to good food, and those who commit (the offences of) theft, uttering falsehoods and speaking harsh words, are men that have given up dharma and the gods avoid them and keep at a distance from them on that account." The same is also the purport of such slokus as the following : 

Those whose minds are firuly fixed on the pleasures of the senses while being averse to Govinda - from then, that Supreme Brahman is at a great distance". So also it is said:-" To those? who always thiok of Govinda and whose minds are firmly fixed on Hin ma to them Bhagavan may be considered to be always at hand". Such passages declare that there will be no delay (in attaining mukti) for those who are devoted to Bhagavan and who bave, at the same time, given up the pleasures of the senses. 24.

THE LIMITS OF THE PURIFYING POWER OF BHAGAVAN'S NAME 339 

Even those wbo wander about in the disguise of the devotees of Bhagavan without any devotion at heart to Him and wbo are therefore like tigers wrapped in the skin of the cow for the purpose of springing on cows -- even these are to be treated with respect for their appearance and for their names (Bhagavatas), in the same way A8 Uparichara and others treated such persons as the Asuras, until their inner nature was revealed. It is in regard to these actors by profession that (we find) the saying :-"The Youtward mark is not the cause of dharma" and "Though the fruit of the soap-out" tree has the property of rendering (muddy) water clear, yet the water is not rendered clear by the mere utterance of its name". 

THE UTTERANCE OF BHAGAVAN'S NAME PURIFIES 

ONLY THOSE WHO DO NOT HATE HIM. 

From the silokas and Tamil verses that follow, it should not be understood that the mere mention of Bhagavan's name, though in contenupt or vilification, will destroy all sins:-"Thoseae (who suffer from troubles), who are miserable, who have no steady foothold anywhere, who are afraid of samsāra and who are afflicted with terrible diseases - (all these) obtain freedom (from their ills) by the bere mention of the word 'Narayana' and become happy". *The inanwho, even without his being aware of it, pronounces the name of Bhagavan, is freed from all sins, in the same way as a forest is freed from deer owing to the fear of a lion", "The 32-Amea tion of Bhagavan's name - though it be to call a person who (merely) bears that name, though it be in irony, though it be pronounced wrongly, though it be in derision -(the mere mention of His name) will destroy all sids". "Hari destroys ** all sids when he is remembered even by men with evil bearts. Even if fire is touched unawares, it certainly burns." "The mentions of many of the names of Bhagavan which describe his attributes and actions is 28. Itihasa Samucchayam: 33-123-124 31. Vishnu Puranam 6-8-19. 29. Manusmriti 6-67

much more than is necessary). The mention of a single name is enough; for Ajamila, sinful though he was, attained mukti by calling his son 'Narayana' at the time of his death". "Kshatrabandhu" attained the highest state by the mention of the name 'Govinda' with its three syllables, though he was in the midst of past evil deeds which surrounded bim like ants. Why then, should we suffer from samsāra, while we have Sri Ranganatha who is so inordinate. ly fond as to be easily accessible towards His servants." (All these passages should not be taken as literally true). They only mean that, if the man has no batred for Bhagavan, the inention of Bhagavan's name is extremely purificatory, though his faith in Bhagavan is weak, though he utters the name like children and the like without a knowledge of its meaning, though he blabbers the name without any thought, though, his intentions being different, he utters the same as & conventional name or in irony and the like, though he is associated with other aims and though he has faults. Certainly it does not mean that derisive speech concerning Bhaga. van and the like would destroy sins. Derisive speech and the like concerning Bhagavan have indeed been counted among the deadly sins (pataka). Has it not been said: "They who 3 bate the Supreme Self and do not remember Kesava -- they will not find any good in bathing in the boly waters - nor those who associate with them (out of regard)" and also :-- "The *son that hates his father should be looked upon as born to somebody else. He who always bates Bhagavan should be looked upon as being born to a man of the lowest caste"? 

It is said in the Bhagavatam :-"The Gopisa7 attained mukti by love (to Sri Kriabna); Kamus& out of fear (of Sri Krishna), Sigu pala and other kings by hatred (to Sri Krishna), the Vrishois owing to their relationship; you ( the Pandavas) out of friendship to bim and we (Narada and others) by devotion". It states that, in dome way or other (fear, hatred, love, friendship etc.), those who are associated with Sri Krishna will obtain redemption, provided they

have done good deeds in the past. The same idea is found also in the sloka :- " Associations with Bhagavan, who is ever pare, whatever be the form it takes, will destroy sins". These two slokas refer to individuals who had a special competency owing to good deeds done in past lives. This is well-known from the purāṇas which relate the earlier and the later incidents in their lives. (It should not be considered applicable to others.) 

RESIDENCE IN HOLY PLACES. 

The statement (in certain passages) that the parting from life in certain holy places of Bhagavan will help the attainment of mukti should be understood as applicable only to those who are not ill-disposed to Bhagavan, though, in their indifference, they may be like animals. If aot understood in this manner, it would follow that even those who are bent on doing what is displeasing to the Lord would attaia mukti (which is absurd). 

The passage in the Sätvata Samhita, which says: "The mind that is impure owing to subjection to the wild senses -- that mind becomes pure in the last days by living in the holy places of Narayana" - this passage only means to say that thougb such men could not realise Bhagavad formerly owing to their addiction to such pleasures as those of the senses which are pot opposed to the stāstras, they will attain purity of mind in their last days". This is avident from the context in Sätvata Samhita (where the passage is found. “He whom the yogis 39-hendeavour by their efforts to fix in their minds at the time of separation from the body". He enters into their minds without any effort on their part in their last moments. This much superiority they have. This is shown also in the case of prapannas of whom it is said: ".* They attain to a clear vision merely by My Grace". 

Therefore to those who are inimical to Bhagavan, there is no redemption by these marks which serve their enmity - Damely, 38. Sriranga Mabatmya : 8-12 39-A. Mahabharata : Santiparva: 46-139. 39. Satyata Samhita 7-120 40. Saranagati gadya.

appearance, bearing the name of Bhagavan, residence in a holy place, and the utterance of His names", 

Things which are displeasing to the Lord, when done in holy places, contribute very greatly to ruin and this is well-known from many sästras. This is also due to the might of Bhagavan. 

To those who are devoted to Bhagavan, whatever acts they do in order to please Him, will, as in the case of Vritra and Kshatra bandhu, themselves destroy all sing and will be the cause of their redemption by some vyūja or gesture. 

Sach being the case, Iswara, who has already made up His mind to grant, to these devotees (who may have some faults also), the blessings of mukti to which they are entitled by their patare, -- Iswara will ( by some punishment or other means) enable them to expiate their offences. So we should clearly understand that Iswara is the only controller of whom it is said: "He alone" is the Ruler who controls: there is no second controller." . "Know that" He is the controller over all: He is more subtle than the subtlest ;" and "He who *dwells within the heart - He controls the whole world: by whom else is any man controlled ?" (With this knowledge in our minds ) we should refrain froin treating with disregard these devotees on the strength of what is said in such passages as this : 

The slayer" of Madhu ( Madhusudana) does not remain in the mind of the man which is impure owing to such things as (evik) desires; the swan never delights in water that is muddy." On the other hand, we should feel dolighted at any good features that might be found in such devotees, even as in finding water in a wilderness. 

It has been said :-"Whatever a man often does with the activities of his body, mind and speech - it makes a man its captive. Therefore one should (ever) perform what is good. So we should never deviate from the right path with the body, mind or speech.

ASSOCIATION WITH BHAGAVATAS 

343 

There is a saying that "The poison tree called samsāra bears two (kinds of) fruits which are like nectar - one is bhakti to Bhagavan and the other &ssociation with those who are His bhaktas". There fore we should feel it a blessing that we have obtained the unattain. able privilege of association with those really great men who may appear small (in the eyes of the ignorant) and who have the great good furtune of having sought the protection of the Supreme Being, for this should be the great object of desire during our life. time here. We should rest assured "that evil" deeds can never be ours, as we have been accepted by the Lord (as His servants)", and "That the Lord who wields the chakra (the discus) protects us and that (therefore) no one can do anything harmful to us." We should therefore crown ourselves, even here, in anticipation of the empireship of perfect service to the Lord which will be ours in Heaven (Paranapada). This potency which has been determined so far should be remembered in connection with such places as indicate the fruit in the tbree mysteries (mantras), as established by necessary consequence. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

The Supreme Self whose greatness is described in the Vedas, which reveal the truth, is beyond all limitations and beyond all measure in regard to His glory. Therefore, about those who approach Him and seek His feet, though such things as low birth and certain weaknesses may be found in them, yet it cannot be said that their greatness is, id any way, limited. This truth bas been taught to us by those who are highest among men and who are free from all partiality.

When the eternal Saviour, who cannot, in the least, be affected by such great demons as desire, hatred, pride and the like is present (to save us), that tapas or upaya called the surrender of the responsibility of our protection (bharanyāsa), which is accepted as transcending all other dharmas (upāyas) in putting down all adharmas -- that tapas is so great that the description of even a fragment of the ocean of its potency is beyond the range of even the ancient Vedas.

May that great seer dwelling in the hermitage of Badarika ( Narayana ), the friend of (all ) good men, who occupies & certain cbariot called Moolamantra with its eight syllables as ) its eigbt wheels and who instructs his reverent pupils, Nara and others (Narada and the like) in the dharma concerning bimself wbich is characteristic of Krita Yuga - may that great seer confer (His) blessing on us !

* The three mantras Namo Narayanaya, Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, and Namo Vishnave, with the Pranava (AUM) preceding each are called yyapaka mantras for they bave the words, Narayana, Vasudeva and Visbpu, which by their etymology, convey the meaning 'Omnipresent' or 'all pervading' (yyapaka)

(4) THE DISCIPLE WHO HAS BEEN INITIATED INTO THE MEANING OF THE MANTRA BY THE 

GRACE OF THE GURU: 

Here a being* who has been blessed by his guru with vision sees all the meaning concealed within the moola-mantra, without any exception, as if it is a treasure placed underneath a plate made of crystal.

THE PURPORT OF THE THREE MANTRAS AND THEIR 

RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER: 

So far we have explained the most essential truths which every sätvika should remember and established them on a firın basis (of authority (pramūna) and argument). We will now proceed to show in what ways, in the three great mysteries (mantras) which reveal all these (truths), the words and the sentences should be construed (in order that their meanings may be properly understood). 

Among them, the first, Damely, Tirumantra (Ashtük shara) helps us to understand such things as our essential nature, (svarīpa) which finds true happiness only in being the s'esha of the Supreme Being. By that (revelation), it creates a longing for the Supreme Goal of attainment preceded by the removal of all obstacles thereto and also a feeling of urgency (tvarū) (in regard to that attainment) whereby the competency for the adoption of the upāya (prapatti) becomes perfected. Dvaya reveals clearly the manner in which this particular upaya should be adopted by this adhikari with an antecedent longing for the fruit thereof. The charama sloka enjoins (as a vidhi) the adoption of this upāya. Though it is possible to find all these truths in each of these three mantras by itself, from the words themselves and from the sepse 

27 

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MANTRAS 

347 

suggested by them (ārtha ), yet each of these three bas & primary aim (which is different from that of the others). In the Tiru mantra, the first syllable ( a ) in the first word ( aum) expresses, in a concise form, the Supreme Reality who is the Protector or Saviour; in the middle word (namas ) (namo) and the third word (Nārāyanāya ) are to be understood respectively the upāya (pra. patti) and the Upeya (the end or goal, viz., service to Narayana ); what is stated briefly (in the Tirumantra) is made clear in Dvaya. (1) The word prapadye in Duaya indicates the particular kind of adhikäri (namely, one who is destitute of other upāyas - akinchana) by the first person singular and (2) the needlessness of other upayas, is inferred from the sense, and (so also) (3) the disappearance of the hindrances to the goal is implicit in the last word namas, The Charama-sloka explains dis. tinctly these (three things), (that are only hinted at in the Dvaya ). These three (mantras) are to us (inen destitute of other upāyas), maintenance, nourishment and enjoyment (of the fruit), being, respectively, the causes of knowledge (jnāna ), practice or adoption (anushtāna ) and the end or fruit (of our endeavour.) 

It has been said: "The God,' Narayana, who is perfect in the possession of the six attributes is certainly in the form of Ashtūkshara in the mouths of tbose who utter the mantra," So, from the tongue of the cichārya, it dispels the darkness (ignorance) in the cave of the disciple's heart and makes him realise his pure and essential pature, wbich finds bliss only in being the sesha of the Supreme Being. Since it gives (in this manner) real (spiri tual) existence to biin, the Tirumantra is his maintenance (dhüraka). T'he sharama sloka is the cause of his advancement in the parti, cular kind of knowledge which would enable him to adopt the final upaya (prapatti). It is the final word as a precept or instruction concerning the upāya, omitting nothing that should be learnt. Therefore the Charama siloka is bis nourishment (poshaka). Dvaya is the cause of the attaioment of the Supreme Goal of 

1. Naradiyam: 1-32 

348 CHAPTER 

existence by a single utterance of it and enables & person by con stant meditation to feel that he has attained bis object. Therefore Dvaya is an object of enjoyment (bhogya). 

THE PRIMARY IMPORTANCE OF TIRUMANTRA: 

Among these three mantras), in regard to Tirumantra, the seer, (rishi), the metre (cchandas) the god revealed by it, (devata), the germ (bija), the potency (sakti), the colour (varia), the application (viniyoga), the locality (sthāna) and nyāsa should be learnt from the respective kalpas and traditions (sampradaya). The greatness and glory of Tirumantra are well known froin Upanishads like Atharvana and Kata, from s'astras like that of Manu, and from various kalpas like Nārāyanūtmaka Hairanyagarbha kalpa, Näradīya kalpa and Bodhūyaniya kalpa. 

It has been said :-"Of "all mantras, the mantras treating of Bbagavan are the highest. Of the countless mantras treating of Bhagavan, the three vyāpaka mantras are the highest, so also the eternal moola-inantra is the highest of all mantras ; of all secrets, this is the supreme secret; of all things that purify, this is the most purificatory". So it is the highest among the three vyāpaka mantras; it is the essence of all the Vedas; it is capable of remov ing all evil influences; it is the means of obtaining all the objects desired by men; it helps in the adoption of all upāyas; it can be uttered by all castes, either in its Vedic form (with aum) or in its tantric form (without the aunı), in accordance with their respective competence; it reveals, in po uncertain terms, all the reals (tattvas), both those that are pervaded by Bhagavan and that which pervades all (viz the Supreme Self); it does not require the help or aid of any other mantra and is common to all the forms of Bhagavan (*like Sri Rama, Sri Krishna and so on). Owing to these reasons, all

achārgas delight in it. The Alvars, too, sing its praise with delight in the following passages -- " Having learnts Thy holy mantra with eight syllables", "Those who have been initiated by the acharya into the mantra with eight syllables and utter it with the proper nishta are capable of ruling over Vaikunta", " Those who constantly delight in the mantra with eight syllables and utter it become capable of ruling over Vaikunta", "You were devotees that sang the name of the Lord saying "Namo Nārāyanāya" 80 that country and town might understand" and "By uttering the holy name Namo Nārāyaṇāya in the proper way (2. e.) without seeking any material gain" etc, etc. The seers (rishis) too, have declared as follows:- "Many were the great seers like Sanaka who attained the abode of Visbnu by uttering the Ashtākshara", "Just' as among the deities there is no one superior to Narayana, there is, among the mantras, no mantra superior to the Ashta kshara"; "Raising my hand and swearing that it is true, I declare this to you! O my children and my disciples, listen. There is no mantra superior to the mantra of eight syllables. Adore Bhagavan with it always. Show your devotion to Him with it, and worship Him with it. Those who show their devotion to Him by looking upon this mantra as supreme will never perish (i. e. will not be in Samsāra.)" and 11" Sitting, or lying down, or standing anywhere, we have adopted only the mantra, Namo Nārāyanāya as our upāya." 

The Supreme Ruler bad this mantra taught to Pundarika by Narada; he received it as his supreme good; and as stated in the sloka ; " Pandarika "whose mind was ever bent on dharma understood that, of all things to be attained, Narayana was the highest and attained mukti by uttering the mantra with eight syllables : Namo Nārāyaṇāya". He practised this mantra and 3. Peria Thirumozhi 8-10-3

obtained release from samsāra. The supreme Ruler, Himself, initiated Tirumangai Alvar into this mantra, 

IT MAY BE UTTERED BY ALL WITH THE OMISSION OF THE PRAŅAVA AND THE SUFFIX OF THE 

FOURTH CASE AT THE END: 

When this mantra is taken without the pranava (at the beginning) and the dative suffix at the end of Narayana (i. e.) (as Namo Nārāyana), every one is competent to utter it. This may be seen from the Varaha purāna in the context of the sanctity of Kaisika Dvādasī, where it is said : 18" (Nampaduvan), who was of the caste that eat dog's flesh, came back after pronouncing the words: Namo Nārāyaņa". It may also be evident from the following Tamil verses: “When the name of Bhagavan is uttered, one should say Namo Nārāyana ", " Having sobtained this excellent garland called Namo Narayana etc" and " There is 1certainly a toogue in the mouth and there is certainly also the mantra called Namo Näraņa" which should be uttered at a single breath". 

To Brahmins and the like (Kshatriyas), the mantra consists of eight syllables including the praiava just as it occurs in the Veda. It has been stated: "Karma!? *is said, in the ocean of nectar called Pancharatra, to be of three kinds: to Brabmins karma is Vaidic (i.e.) to be performed with Vedic mantras; to Kshatrias, karma is both Vaidic and tantric; to Vaisyas and Sudras karma is tantric; or karma may be tantric to all.

TIRUMANTRA FOR WOMEN AND OTHERS 351 

pranava at the beginning) and the Shadakshara (the mantra with six syllables, Namo Vishnave with the pranava at the beginning) - these are the principal mantras of Visboa whose splendour is beyond all measure. These mantras with the pranava ( at the beginning) are Vaidika mantras; without the pranava they are Tântric mantras. To women and Sudras the utterance of the Moolainantra should be without the dative suffix (of the word Narayana). So also there is, for them, no svara, no pranava nor anganyāsa or other rules. To them the utterance of the mere mantra (without pranava ) is enjoined." In accor dance with this, it has been stated further: "The syllable a in the latter part of the word Nārāyana (i.e.) ayana denotes Visboa. If the nasal sound of the vowel m (anuswāra) at the end of the word ayanam be added to it, it becomes am and this 'a with the m2 becomes the germ (bija) of moolamantra. By this addition, the mantra comes to consist of eight letters. 

Even without the pranava, these adhikaris (women and Sudras) obtain the same fruit or goal and this may be seen from the following sloka - "Of what use are many mantras for the purpose of the fruit desired? Of what use are many vratas (ascetic observances )? The mantra, Namo Nārāyanāya, copfers all the boons that may be desired". The a in an which has been frescribed as a substitute for praṇava (aum) should be considered as having, in brief, all the meaning contained in prasava, because the syllable a being the first letter is stated (in the sāstra) to denote everything in a concise form. The meaning of the syllable u in the praňava, namely, 'only' is inferred from the meaning. The ideas of knowersbip and the like contained in the third letter of pränava, namely m should be understood as being present in the base of the second syllable of namas (or namo), namely n. 

THE MEANING OF PRAŅAVA AND ITS POTENCY: 

When the pranava is used as an independent mantra by itself, it may be pronounced in & single unit or instant of time (mätra), 18. Naradiya Kalpam: 1-57 

19. Naradiyam: 1-4 

TE 

352 OH APTER 

or two units of time, or three or three and a half units of time and its meanings vary in accordance with these units of time to denote either Brahman as effect ( kārya ) or Brahman as cause ( karana): (i. e.) when it is pronounced in a single unit of time, it means Brabman with the earth as His body; when in two units, it means, Brahman with the antariksha (the middle air or sky) as His body: when in three units, it means Brabmao with the world of svarga as His body; when in three and a half units of time, it denotes Brahman the Pure and the ultimate cause (of every thing). In some sästras it is said that, when the pranava begins any of the three vyāpaka mantras, it should be considered as a single syllable (without any parts as a • 14 - m) and as denoting then the Supreme Self. 

20" Pranava or the Veda consistiog of three letters, existed at the beginning, and the three Vedas, Rik, Yajus, and Säman were within it (in a, u and m respectively). It should be kept as a secret. It is a Veda with three letters and is different from the other Vedas. He who knows the pranava is a Vedavit (one who knows the Veda or the three Vedas)." The greatness and glory of pranava are well known from such passages as the above. In the nyäsavidya, the pranava is an independent mantra and refers to the surrender of the self, for it has been said: “The havis or offering called the self should be taken with the mantra beginning vasuranya and offered in the eternal fire called Achyuta with the mantra called pranava". For the same reason some construe it even here as denoting surrender. Others construe that the pranava should be considered in the Tirumantra only as helping to realise one's being sesha (tu the Lord), sioce primarily it gives knowledge of the essential Dature (svarūpa) of the jiva being s'esha, If so, it contributes & qualification or element of compe tence for the upāya (viz. praying for protection).

MEANING OF A IN PRANAVAS 

353 

It has been said :-"By & knowledge of Iswara, the devont jīva attains supreme purity". When we consider pranava as giving only a knowledge of the s'eshi (Bhagavao), 'supreme purity' would mean that it removes the upfitness of the jiva for the adoption of the upāya. When we consider pranava as indi. cating a kpowledge of the upaya, namely, Bhagavan, (and not the knowledge of the seshi), 'supreme purity' would mean inoksha. Bhagavan Sandilya explained, as follows, the way in which the meaning of pranava should be considered:- "This Supreme Being is of such and such a nature and the jiva is of such and such a nature. Yoga is said to be a kaowledge of the relationship bet. ween the two (that Iswara is the seshi and the jiva the sesha )". This meaning has been elaborated as follows:-"the a (in*pranava) is Vishnu who creates, sustains and destroys the world, the m (in it) means the jiva, who exists for the fulfiment of the pur poses of Vishnu. The u (in it) indicates that this relationship between the two can exist only between them (and no others). So pranava which consists of three letters and is the essence of the (tbree) Vedas reveals this meaning." The Tamil verse which says, "I am the "servant of Bhagavao, the Lord of Tirukkanna puram; bow am I entitled to be the servant of anyone else ?" - tbis Tamil verse also explains the meaning of pranava. The strutis and the smritis describe the three letters of pranava as the essence of the three Vedas. 

THE MEANING OF A IN PRANAVA: 

That these letters have these ineanings will be seen from the following passage in Vamana purāļa : -'By the first** letter a in the prinava, which is one of the members or limbs of the mantra with eight letters, Bhagavan, who is the support of every. thing, is denoted; the letter a is the origin of all words and Brahman is the origin of all things denoted by these words.

24. Peria Tirumozhi : 8-9-3 25. Vamana puranam:354 OB APTER 

Therefore a denotes Bhagavan. He is denoted by that letter. This relationship between the letter a and Bhagavān is seen from the meaning to be appropriate." Sri Ramanuja stated in the Vedārthasangraha that by the first letter (of pranava) which is the origin of all words is denoted Narayana who is the origin of all things denoted by these words. From this it follows that Bhaga van is the material and the instrumental cause of the whole world and that, as may be inferred from this, He is both omniscient and omnipotent and has other such qualities. "a means* negation (No) and wben masculine denotes Vishnu". "The letter a denotes Vishnu"; " By using the letter a, wbich is the first name of Narayana, what (an excellent) benedictory prayer has been made !" All this is evident from the Nighantus and the usage of scholars. 

When this a depotes the Supreme Ruler, it is derived, accord. ing to the science of grammar, from the verbal root ava which means to protect, to please etc., (the termination va is dropped) and the word that results refers to one who is a protector and so on (one who pleases). Though this root has many meanings, its best-known meaning is to protect; further it is this meaning which is required here (in connection with the mantra 'aum'); besides there is no authoritative etymological explanation that it should be considered as having many meanings; so the first meaning given (in grammar), namely, to protect is the direct and primary mean. ing of the word and the other meanings, when required, should be considered 88 suggested (lukshaņā) by the primary meaning. This is the appropriate way of explaining and the acharyas have commented on it only in this way as meaning the Protector or Saviour. As the meaning 'protector' is not restricted by any limiting adjunct, the protectorship extends to all. The manner of protection varies with the objects of protection as shown by the pramäņas (sources of knowledge). Since the protection is not stated to be based on any reason or condition, it might appear to be unconditioned (nirupādhika) but Iswara, who is omnipotent and independent, expects some vyāja or action prescribed by His 26. Nigbantu.

will to be performed by the jīva, which would serve as a justification for conferring moksha and the like on those who are in samsāra. Towards the nityas ( the eternal süres) and those who have already attained mukti, the protection is full and complete by way of maintaining what is already present and this is the result of Bhagavan's natural and unconditioned mercy. But this natural mercy (kūrunya) is restrained in the case of those in samsāra by the condition (upādhi) of the need for punishment which has arisen by beginningless offence when actions which are displeasing to Him have occurred. Prapatti and other vyājas have been prescribed in the Sästras only for renoving this condition which acts as a restraining force (on the Lord's (mercy). 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The fact of being the Master makes it appropriate that He should proteot; prapatti and the like are (only) secondary helps. 

The primary reason (for protecting) is the Omnipresent Lord's mercy which is not dependent upon anything else. 

As stated in the siloka : "In all "siddhāntas and in Vedanta, it is declared that the Lord protects with His consort Lakshmi, ever by His side, for she is the very embodiment of mercy", the Lord who has determined to grant redemption to all is ever ready (to do so) with His consort. The relationship with His spouse for the purpose of protection, which is evident from the pramāņas is derived (not explicitly from the words but) by inference from the purpose (of protection) which is evident from the pramānas. Whenever Bhagavan is referred to, Lakshmi should also be con. sidered as referred to, for it results from the principle:- "If two things are enjoined as necessary, wherever one of them is men. tioned, the other should also be considered as indicated” (Sanni. yogasishtanyāya). Thus the acharyas, too, have said, “Since Thou(Lakshmi) art ever inseparably connected with Thy Lord, 

27. Lakshmi Tantram : 28-14

even the Veda does not mention Thee separately." In all vidyās or forms of meditation (prescribed in the Upanishads) all qualities and attributes of Brahman which define Bis Dature are to be meditated upon (even though only one or two of them are actually mentioned in the particular Vidyā). Sirr ilarly this attribute, Damely, Lakshmi, who is the most important of all attributes sbould also be borbe in mind. It is this attribute (Lakshmi) which rules out other deities, (for they are not related to Lakshmi in that way) and defines Bhagavan's essential nature which is not dependent upon anything else, as having an excellence which sur passes everything else, His essential nature, form and glories, wbich do not arise from any other source, acquire even greater splendour from the essential pature, form and glories of Lakshmi, who is His attribute, and shine thereby. This may be seen in the simile; "like radiance which cannot be separated from the **sun." And this has been declared by the great sages who understood the nature and person of the Supreme Deity. So also in the word Nārāyaṇa in Tirumantra, Narayana's relationsbip to His consort should be borne in mind. This relationship to the spouse is dis tinctly and explicitly stated in the Duaya (Srimat - with Sri). In Sri Ramapuja's elaboration of the Dvaya in bis *Gadya, it is true that, among the nrārās in the words beginning with Bhagavan Nārāyana (Närānām + ayanan) Lakshmi is included among the ruāras by commentators. (From tbis it might be argued that she is also a jīva like other hāras). But this inclusion is only to indicate Her dependence ou Her Lord and Näras means etymo logically only “those who are related to Nara" without the specification of the form of relationship. So from that, it should not be inferred that Laksbwi is also a jiva. 

Here the first letter a is in the dative or fourth case singular, the (usual) dative singular suffix has been dropped. The reasons for bolding that the a is in the dative singular (when no case - suffix is seen ) are as follows: (1) In the place whicb enjoins the

THE MEANING OF A IN AUM 

357 

surrender of the self to the Supreme Self (i.e.) the Taittirīya Upanishad, the pranava is prescribed as the mantra (for doing so); (80 it should mean 'to the Supreme Self (dative)', (2) the mantra should reveal the nature of the action to be performed, (3) the self to be surrendered is seen in the third letter (m) (in aum) and the Supreme Brabman for whom it is surrendered is seen in the base (prakriti, viz. a) of the first letter; (4) the person to whom the surrender is made and the object which is surrendered should not be in the saine case. Therefore the a (which is the first letter) should be considered to be in the case (i.e.) (dative) suited to the word indicating the person to whom the surrender is made. The view of perverse interpreters (Advaitins) that a und the m (in aum are in the same case (nominative or first case ) and indicate the identity in the essential nature of the jiva and the Supreme Self is opposed to many pramānas (like pratyaksha and sabda); besides it would not fit in with the natural and obvious meaning of the word namo (namas) and the dative of the word Narayana (i.e.) Närāyaṇāya which are uttered along with the pranava, This is obvious also from the text twhich distinguisbes pranava as the bow, the self as the arrow, Brahman as the target and the act of surrender as the hitting of the target (the arrow and the target cannot be identical). In the pranava in Tirumantra, when the intention is the surrender of responsibility (bharasamarpanam), the dative or fourth case should be considered to bave the same meaning as the dative in the pranava considered as an independent mantra (i.e.) the person to whom the surrender is made. When the pranava is interpreted as indicating the essential nature (svarīpa) of the self wbich consists in existing solely for the Supreme Self (i.c.) in being sesha, the dative signifies 'baving another's interests alone as one's interests'. Therefore it reveals the relationship of sesha and s'eshi which exists between the jīva and the Paramātmā. We should then bear in mind that we are unconditional s'eshas (nirupādhika sesha) to the Supreme Self, who is the unconditional seshi (nirupādhika seshi). 

† Mundakopanishad : II - jj - 4. 

858 CHAPTER 

When the Lord who is the Supreme Ruler says, “You are my s'esha" and pursues him, the jival, owing to his egoism, tries to wriggle out saying, “ I exist only for myself." Therefore the thought that we are seshas to the Supreme Ruler will give (apiri. tual) existence to the jīva, who is otherwise, as it were, (spiritually) non-existent. To indicate the importance of this thought that we are seshas), the relationship to the s'eshi (for a) is declared even before the mention of the sesha (namely 11 the jīva). 

SANSKRIT SLOKA; 

When the relationship of our being seshas to the Supreme Being is well established in the mind, the other requisities (for spiritual life) such as self-control and serenity (suma and duma) follow easily as being necessary to it. When that thought is not established in the mind, all the rest serve no purpose and are, as it were, non-existent. 

When Iswara is the s'eshi of all, He is always (to be thought of as) with His Consort, for it has been said, “The two kinds of glory (nityavibhuti and lila - viblitti) are s'esha to me and to her, O Brahma and this is declared in the Vedanta and in my siīstras (Pancharātra āgamas)." So also it is said "Being seshisl is single and it rests with two (Bhagavan and Lakshui).” In the Agaisho miya sacrifice, the deity (to whom the havis or offering is made) is not Agni alone nor Soma alone; the deity of the sacrifice (which is single) is Agni and Sonia. So also in this offering of the self, the deity to whom the offering is intended is both (Bhagavan and Lakshmi). In order to reveal this, it was said “Being s'eshi is single and it rests with two". When we consider the text* in the Kata sruti, it becomes clear from the words themselves that the self is s'esha to both. To be sesha is to serve the purposes of another without the primary desire to gain something for oneself. 30. Vishvaksena Sambita 31. Somasi Andan - vide before (page ) 

NOTE*: KATA TEXT: By the letter a is denoted Vishnu, the ruler of all the worlds, and Lakshmi who is supported by Vishnu is denoted by the letter w; the m indicates that the jiva is their servapt. This is the definition of pranava. 

NOTE: f. vide page 89.

THE MEANING OF U IN AUM. 

359 

The author of Sri Bhashya has explained it as follows:-681A He is the s'esha whose essential nature (svarupa) has, for its sole interest, the promotion of the glory or excellence of another; the other is the s'eshi." The genitive dual case ending which is indicated by the Kata sruti (their servant) is elliptical. The genitive or sixth case, which ordinarily indicates relationship in general, extends here to the special relationship of being sesha to s'eshi which is understood from the pramūnas. Or it may be considered that in order to make clear the relationship of existing only for them', (viz. Bhagavad and Lakshmi), the dative daal termination is present, though in ellipsis. If we take this view, the sruti which says "the servant of both" explains the neaning of the elliptical dative dual. 

If we take this interpretation that the u refers to Lakshmi and that the self is s'esha to both (Bhagavan and Lakshmi) the only! formerly stated to be the meaning of'u (in a u 1) is not given by the word itself but is suggested by the context. It comes to this that this self (the jiva) is the unconditioned s'esha to both Bhaga van and Lakshmi and to no other. 

THE MEANING OF U IV AUM : 

If, on the other bapd, we take the middle letter u to mean 'only' in accordance with Vedic usage, the meaning 'only' is to prevent the doubts concerning the relationship of being sesha extending to any other (deity) unconditionally and this is done by the word itself (and is not merely suggested by the context). Since it declares that the relationship of being sesha to other deities than Bhagavan and lakshmi does not pertain to one's essential Oature, it follows that contact with other deities should not exist to the man who has a knowledge of the nature of his self, and this avoid ance of contact extends even to the devotees of other deities. In the chapter on the Ultimate Object in Life, we have already stated that, since being s'esha to Bhagavatas is pleasing to the Lord, it does not constitute the offence of being sesha to others. 

. 

31A Vedarthasangraba. 

360 CE APTER 

Thus if by the force of the word itself (namely w), we get the meaning that the relationship of being sesha is ruled out in the case of others, it is also evident that the idea of the relationship not existing (towards the Lord) is also ruled out, (since there is no limitation of time (ie) the self is always s'esha to the Lord and is never non-s'esha to Him). By this ruling out of the non-existence of the relationsbip of sesha, the substance (dravya) called the sentient being' is seen to be an attribute incapable of being sepa rated from Iswara (at any time or place) and is therefore shown to be bis body, in the same way as non-septient matter is His body. 

THE MEANING OF M IN AUM: 

The third letter m (in aunı) denotes, primarily, the jiva but means also by implication (upalakshana) all other things wbich are s'esha to the Lord. That this (m) denotes the jīvātma may be understood from the following: (1) The letter m which denotes the jiva should be used to perform vyāpaka nyasa (ie ) to performa nyūsa in one's body as if it pervades the whole body": (2) The five groups of consonants (in the Sanskrit alphabet) each contain. ing five letters beginning with k (F) and ending with m(A) denote the twentyfive tattvas or reals as stated in the Tattvasagarasamhita and the like. The Supreme Ruler is always within these reals as their Inner Self” and (3) “The five* letters in the Ka (F) group denote the five elements (bliitäni), those in the Cha (a) group depote the five senses of action karmendriyās); those in the ta (E) group denote the five senses of knowledge (jncnedriyis), those in the ta (a) group denote the five tanmatras (like sidell) the pa (T) denotes the urind, the pha (i) ahankūru, ba (a) denotes inahat and bha (27) prakriti. The jiviitin:t is denoted by the letter m and he is the twentyfifth tattva or real." 

From these it is evident that the jivātma is different both) from the twenty-four reals which have the defects of inertness and non-septience and from the twenty-sixtb Real, (namely, 

32. Tattva Sagara Samhita. 

33. Padmottaram IV, 25, 26, 27. 

MEANING OF M 

361 

Iswara) who is the (ultimate) cause of everything, the Saviour of all and the seshi of all and who is indicated by the first letter (in aum), 

In the Tirumantra, the words, and Nära (in Narayana), refer only to the attributes, namely, the jiva (and matter) as determinate words (* Nishkarshaka words) and do not refer to the Supreme Self within the jīva (and matter). 

If we examine the grammatical form of this letter (m), it is found to have been derived from the root mana meaning 'to kaow' and other such roots (mas - meaning 'measure ') and it denotes the jīvātmā who is atomic and who is of the essential nature (svarüpa) of jnina and (at the same time) possessed of the attri. bute, jnära. This is in accordance with the Brahma Sutra (2-3-19), which says " The jīvātmā is a kaower (ie) he possesses the attribute 'knowledge' (and is not merely inäna or knowledge as the Advaitins contend) and this is from the s'ruti itself". 

Though the jīvātmi is said to be, in general terms, of the essential nature of knowledge, yet since this essential nature (svarūpa) is koown froin the pramūnas (sabdha and the like) to be agreeable and pleasing, it is also of the essential nature of kinanda or bliss which is a specific form of knowledge 

When the jivütmii is said to be possessed of the attribute, knowledge, since the pramillas declare him to be possessed of knowledge without any restrictive word, it should be understood that in the state of mukti, his knowledge is all-pervasive and got limited by conditions (or upüdhi) and without any restriction or livnit. 

* NOTE: According to Visishtadvaita doctrine, many words are in determinate in meaning; for example go or cow' may mean the body of the cow, or the soul of the cow or the Supreme Self within the cow as its Antaryami; some words are determipate in meaning, for instance 'cowocss' ( gorvam ) which refers only to the jati (genus) 'cow' of the cow. The m (in aum) refers to the jiva and not to the Supreme Self). 

362 CE APTER 

When we consider this natural and pure form of the jivātmü, it will appear that it is free from the ipertness and other such defects of nonsentient things and so also from such things as pain, suffering etc., which are found in sainsära. Hence in the essen tial nature and the attributes (svarūpa and dharma) of the jivātmā, there is also spotlessness or freedom from all impurity or defect (nirmalatva). The seeker after salvation should meditate that the jīvātmā is absolutely pure and has its enjoyment only in being sesha to the Supreme Being and this may be seen from the Brahma Sutra (3-3-52) which says: "No, only the state (of the jivātmā) that differs from the state of samsāra (should be medi. tated upon), for that is the state which will ensue (in moksha) as in the contemplation of Brahman as He is ". 

To the prapama, the meditation on the fruit of attainment in mukti is useful in creating & desire for that fruit. The forms of meditation (concerning the form of the self) are different in accordance with the difference in the fruits desired and this is evident from the eighth chapter of the Gita and Sri Bhashya and other such treatises. 

Since the pramānas declare a plurality (or very large number) of souls, this third letter me (in aum), used in the singular, denotes the jāti or geous (and not a single individual), as in the Brahma Sutra (2-3.18) which says. The soul (or self) is not (generated) for (80 says) the Sruti.' (Here the word ' soul' denotes the genus and therefore it really means ' souls' (or self's). 

Though it is stated here that all souls are s'eshas to Bhagavan in general terms as in: --"Alsouls33A are the servants of the Supreme Self by their very nature" -- yet since the individual is also included in the all souls,' it follows that for that reason, every one should realise that he is also the servant of the Lord. 

Here the knowledge of being a s'esha, the abandonment of the conceit of one's independence (of the Lord), the adoption of the

MEANING OF M 

363 

particular upaya (dainely, prapatti) and the prayer for the fruit to be attained, namely, the service of a sesha to the Lord have all to arise in the individual; therefore the individual is the principal (figure). So some ichāryas say that the word aham (I) should be taken as anderstood and as being the substantive to which the m (which means the jiva) is the adjective "I who am a jiva". In that case, as stated also in slokas wbich elaborate the pranava, "Whatever is mine and I myself are Tbine, O Lord, Madhava! I am well aware of this "; since attributes always follow the princi. pal (or the substantive), the qualities and attributes are also intend ed by implication (upalakshana), (2) Other acharyas hold that the third letter itself (w) shows the aham (or I) by dropping, in the word (asmat=I) of the first part as and the latter part at and retaining only the consonant in the middle, in accordance with Vedic usage. Ia Nyasa vidyā (as described in the Taittiriya upanishad) which enjoins the offering of the self as an oblation to the Supreme Being, the pranava is called the mantra (for it). In order that the action to be performed may be made clear, the actual words indicating the Supreme Self and the individual self should be expressed and not remain merely implicit. Since according to the praminas, the first letter (a) denotes the person to whom the surrender is made and the middle letter (u) has some other meaning (either only or Lakshmi), by the law of what remains (päriseshya) the third letter (n) should indicate the oblation, namely, the individual self that is to be offered. There fore it is appropriate to hold that this (third) letter should mean (Iham (or I). Therefore it is that Bhattar commented on the pranava in Tiruixantra as follows:- "I exist* only as the property for Bhagavad who is indicated by the letter a". 

THE MEANING OF NAMAS OR NAMO IN TIRUMANTRA: 

So also the ma in nanas (namo) denotes the individual self in any one of the three ways indicated before (1) 25th tattva (2) the knowing self and (3) short for aham. This ma is in the 34. Alavandar: Stotram 53 

35. Ashtasloki - 3.364 CHAPTER 

genitive or sixth case ending, and the na (which precedes it) means negation 'no' or 'not'. So it is equivalent to na mama (not mine). The negation na (not) is placed first to indicate its greater importance as in the sentence drishtā Sītā** (seen was Sītā). The genitive case in ma is & mark of relationship in general (sam. bandha sāmünya) and implies (bere) the particular form of relationship (that of a sesha to the s'eshi). It is with this idea indeed that Bhattar said, " I do not then exist for myself.” The idea contained in this namas which has the same purport as the only of the middle letter u in pranava--for all sentences should be considered as expressive of exclusive affirmation (avadharana) - this idea is of the greatest importance, and it is said in such slokas as the following:- " The cause of samsāra (bondage) is the two letters inama (mine) and the cause of attaining the eternal Brah man is the sentence having three letters na mama (I am) not mine)." The idea of the following sloka has also the same porport as this namas:-"All that is crooked is the cause of samsāra; all that is straight is the cause that effects the attainment of Brahman". (Here the idea that we exist for Bbagavan is straight and the idea that we exist for ourselves is crooked.) 

If it is asked “What is it that is not mine (11a mama)?", the answer is found supplied by the context (anushanga) viz., the third letter in prunava and is as follows : 

"I do not belong to myself". In the chapter on * uushang« (The Context) it is evident that the meaning indicated by the context (anushanga) is more appropriate than the peaning arrived at by the insertion of a new word (adhyāhüra).- Here na mama aham "I am not mide" specifies that I am not mine. As the 

(*NOTE: Namas. Advaitins might say that the ma is in the ablative or fifth case meaning "thao I" (There is nothing other than I) and if we con sider that the word kinchir is understood and insert it, na ma' may mean "There is nothing else other than l". Here the word kinchit has to be understood (adhyahara) which is not so appropriate, as anushanga ). 36. Ramayana: Bala Kanda: 1-78 38. Mahabharata : Santi parva -

middle letter (in pranava ) pamely only, has already stated that I exist only for Iswara, which negates seshatva to others, this specification in namas indicates that in others oneself is also incla. ded. By the principle illustrated in f go-balīvarda (the specifics. tion is to show the negation of oneself in special as not having been included in the others' stated in the middle letter). 

Aham na inanna ("I am not mine") is the sentence in namas. From this it becoms clear that even one's svarüpa (essential nature) does not belong to oneself. Since attributes and qualities always follow the principal or substantive, it is tantamount to saying, specially, that one is not the unconditioned master of any. thing (belonging to one). This is the purpose of the specification, 

If we do not take the word aham from the context (anu. shanga) and accept the interpretation given above, it would mean that the general misapprehension that certain things (for example, our body and our qualities) really belong to us will be taken away from one's self. 

Thus namas dispels one's conceit (abhimana) about oneself and about those wbich appear to be one's by stating that they do not belong to one and the root causes of samsära, namely the notions of 'I' and 'mine' which are false, are thereby removed. The conceit (ahamkiira) which is thus removed is a form of illu. sory knowledge. The word ahamkära is used also to mean one of the twenty-four reals (tattras), but that ahamkrira is not capable of being removed by mere intelligence. It persists with the jīva until its separation from the subtle body (sīkshma sarira). Though this connection with the non-sentient tattva (real) called ahatkāra continues to exist, its effects in the form of the disease of conceit (abhimana) and the like which are illusory are cured by medicine in the forın of discrimination (viveka) resulting from such things as the moolamantra.

366 CHAPTER 

Since, from the middle letter of pranava, the notion that one is s'esha to any other than the Lord is got rid of, there is no need to state separately that one is not sesha to oneself. Therefore the porport may also be to show that the person to whom certain things appear to be s'esha and who appears to be s'eshi is pot the unconditioned master or s'eshi of any of these things. All those things that are s'esha to the jīva (like his body, bis attributes, bis wealth etc.) are indeed those that were given to bim for His own purposes by the Supreme: Ruler, who is the s'eshi of all. 

Those qualities and the like of the jīvas which are eternal have become theirs by the eternal will of Iswara. The transitory bodies and the like which are theirs in the impure state (samsāra) and in the pure state (after mukti when they might take bodies for some parpose or other)--these result from the transitory will of Iswara as the effect of past karma (in the case of the former) and without any relation to karnia (in the case of the latter). 

The pranava states that the jīva is sesha to none other than Bhagavan). So it becomes evident that he is not sesha even to himself as he is other than Bhagavan; it follows from this that, in the same way as he is s'esha to nobody else (than Bhagavan), no other thing is unconditionally s'esha to him. This does not appear in the pranava. Therefore this may be the purport of the nanas that the jiva is in no way independent li.e.) that he has no svītail tryam). In that case, taking froid the context (anushangu) the 11 in praiata, it would give the meaning "I am not capable of maintaining or looking after myself." 

It is also possible to understaod (adhyāhara), the word sviita ntrya (independence) after sa mnamu. It would then read na mama svātantryan (I have no independence). The absence of independence in the case of the sentient being is the inability to act independently (of the Lord) (i.c.) without His help. This is because, though in the state of bondage and in the state of release, be acts in accordance with his own mind, he can act only

with such things as the senses given by Iswara and by His stimu. lation and with His help. 

The protectorship of all, indicated by the base (prakriti) (viz) a in the first letter of pranava, ensues, in the case of those who adopt an upaya, only by stimulating them to the adoption of any one of the upāyas. Though the jiva adopts the upāya, since his activity is dependent on the Lord and since the one who affords protection by granting the fruit (of the upāya) is the Supreme Ruler who is gracious, it is only His protectorship of all indicated in the base of the first letter (of pranava) that is confirmed by this namas. Similarly Iswara's being the anconditional s'eshi of all which is stated by the dative case (fourth case) of the first letter & in the pranava (where the case ending has been dropped) -- this is confirmed by the interpretation suggested before, which denies unconditioned seshitvain to the jīva. As declared in the Brahma Sutra (2-3-40), “The doership of the jīva is due to the Supreme Being as stated in the Sruti ", the independence that the jiva seems to possess is granted to him in the execution of His own purposes by the Supreme Being who is the unconditioned s'eshi of all. The jiva's being seshi to other things is also due to its being given to him by the voconditioned seshi for the fulfilment of His own purposes. To sum up SANSKRIT SLOKAS:~ 

The Lord of Sri is (alone) independent in all things and is (alune) the Master (of all) without being dependent on any one else. Independence without any dependence for help on others and mastership belong to no one else. 

This gist of the pranava and of the namas has been taught to us by (our) üchāryas, in order that we may have the competence (for prapatti), namely, such as having the Lord alone as our refuge. 

In ordinary life, being master over others and being inde pendent of others are considered desirable, and being & servant and 

368 CHAPTER 

being dependent on others are considered undesirable. This is merely due to past karma as a conditioning factor (upādhi). But here (in spiritual life), being a servant (of the Lord) and being dependent (on the Lord) are agreeable to those who have a know. ledge of the truth, for they are appropriate and natural to our svarīpa (essential nature), as stated in such passages as the following: "We are all, by 40% nature, His servants". Thus it becomes evident that the jīva exists solely for another (Iswara) and is entirely dependent on Him. So the jiva may rightly be en. ployed to do what is pleasing to the s'eshi, who alone is independent (and omnipotent). Therefore it follows that the jiva should be s'esha (and render service) to His devotees, as stated in the Tamil verse) ;-" The Lord." who is absolutely pure, has made ine the servant of His servants". If the Lord who is the s'eshi, and who is independent (and all powerful) is pleased to make us seshas to His good devotees, it cannot be called improper or inappropriate; nor can it be avoided (or resisted). Since He is s'eshi, He has a right to employ us in whatever He desires, and since He is all powerful, He can enforce it. This idea may also be seen in the 

Tamil) verse :- "I will never" associate with those who think that there is any deity other than Thee. But gladly do I accept (the privilege of) being servant to Thy devotees." 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Being sesha to His devotees results to the Supreme Ruler from His own desire; but to us, it is a consequence of our being dependent on Him. (Sometimes) even to us, it may come as a consequence of our own desire, for to one who appreciates the worth of (virtuous) qualities, a desire to serve may arise towards those who are great by their virtues. Thus) service may be done owing to an appreciation of (noble) qualities, like the service of Lakshmada to Sri Rama. The omnipotent Lord has Himself

said. "I *render service to those who are my kinsmen by virtue of my beiog independent. I give one half (of what I have) to my kinsfolk and enjoy the other half. I forgive also harsh words (employed) by them towards me ". Thus by virtue of these words of His, He has willed that we should be s'eshas to Himself and to His devotees. It has already been shown in the chapter on the extreme limit of the ultimate goal of life) that the service rendered as s'eshas by the devotees to one another is due to the will of the omni-potent Lord and is appropriate in different ways (in exalting others and in being exalted by them). 

Since the jīva who is thus (akinchana) destitute (of any upāyas) has to receive the desired object from the independent s'eshi in accordance with His will, the prayer for protection (saranavaranam) which is explicitly stated in Dvaya and the Charama sloka for winning His favour is necessary and it is here implicit, in nanas of the Tirumantra. Since the surrender of the self and the prayer for protection are inseparable, the word which denotes either denotes also the other and is intended to express both. The word namas is itself (often) employed to stand for the prayer for protection, as may be seen from the following silokas: "The deity:42A with eyes broad like lotuses that was seen by me before - He has now become (incarnate as) yoar relative vis. Janardapa, the tiger among men". "Madhava" is both the father and the mother of the whole world. Seek His protection, O best among men, for He is capable of protecting (you)." " When Mar kandeya) gave them this advice, the tbree sons of Kunti and the twins, O best of the Bharatas, made namaskāra to Janardana along with Droupadi ", so also in the episode of Danjayanti (we find the following); "She considered that the time had come to scek refuge of the gods. So she made namaskiira with (all) her speech and (all) her mind." (Since namas has been used to

370 CHAPTER 

signify the prayer for protection ), it indicates that the responsi. bility for protecting oneself is not of the jiva (na mama bharah), where the word bharah (the burden of responsibility) is under. stood. Thus its purport may also be the surrender of responsi. bility. That the word namas indicates the surrender of self (atna samarpanam) is also wellknown from the following slokas : "Of all yajnas which's are performed with samit and such like as an aid, the man who has surrendered his self (ātma samarpana) to Bhagavan with the word namas is said to have performed the best Yajna," and "I bow to Bhagavan, for namas (bowing) or atma samarpaņam to Him enables a man to get rid of his suffering and enjoy wbatever he wants ". 

That the word namas has these meanings, viz., “I do not belong to myself; nor is any activity of mine s'esha to me; all these are s'esha only to Bhagavān," is stated in the section on the namaskāra in Nirukti. 

THE THREE MEANINGS OF NAMAS: 

Sthila, Stikshma and Para : Abirbhudhaya (Siva) commented on the word namas as having three different meanings : & gross meaning (sthūlārtha) a subtle meaning (sīkshmärtha), and a supreme meaning (para), in the following slokas : 

I. STHULĀRTHA : 

(8) The act of an intelligent man bowing his body, of his own accord, before another who is higher (without expecting any gain fron it) is called namas. In the sastras, all sentient beings are spoken of as belonging to two classes, the higher (Jyäyān), and the lower (ajyāyān). There is no one other than these. The primary meaning of the higher being' is He who has superior excellence both in time and (place) and in attributes. Bhagavan is present at all times and in all places and possesses also qualities that are 45. Abirbudhnaya samhita: 37 - 37. 46. Mantrarajapada: Stotram : 47. Ahirbudhnya: Samhita : 52 (2-33). 

STHULĀRTHA OF NAMAS 

371 

beyond (all) measure. So He alone is the higher (Jyāyan). All sentient beings other than He are lower (ajyāyān). The relation between these two, the higher and the lower, is that He is the s'eshi and the others (who are lower) are s'eshas (to Him). The higher is only One; all the rest are lower and the relation between these two consists in this, that He is bowed to and that the others bow to Him. He who is bowed to is called the higher and the s'eshi; the others who are seshas are said to be those who bow ( to him). The relation between them and Him is not on account of any gain (expected by them); this relation between the higher and the lower is due to their nature, when the sentient being bows to the Higher Person without expecting any gain and with a certain feeling; that feeling is called nanana ( bowing) (b) Namanam (bowing ) consists in the thought: "Bhagavan is always my seshī and I am always his s'esha," for it is this thought that is the cause of the bowing (of the body). This howing makes Bhagavan bend in favour to the man who bows (i.c.) it makes Bhagavan grant to the man who bows whatever is desired by him. This is certain. Bhagavan, who is higher, observes the bowing of the man who is lower and bends (is inclined) (to do him grace). Since it makes Bhagavan bend in favour, this action is called namas: (c) Uttering the word namas with speech, having this namas in mind and bowing with the body--this is namas in its perfection (saramāgati) and what is different from it in being defective in one or other of the three aspects is called defective namas. This is perfect prapatti (as aingi). 

"I will tell you its accessories or angas in their perfection : Listen. "The prapatti that I perform to Bhagavan, the Supreme Being, is itself my eternal fruit. I desire no other fruit." To have this (thought) is the best of accessories (angas). The desire for (other) fruit or gain is opposed to this anga. Ākinchanya or being destitute is the condition of being without the knowledge or the ability to perform bhakti. This state of destitution is due to false notions (vāsanas) that have been persisting in the mind from beginningless time and to the man's being by nature without 

372 OB APTER 

independence. It is due also to the mind being covered by the impurities of desire and hatred (rāga and dvesha). The external manifestation of this teeling of helplessness is called kārparyam and it is the second anga. The thought that one is independent and could act of one's own accord is opposed to this. The third anga is the thought that, though Bhagavan is the Supreme Being, He is merciful to all creatures and is ever bent on showing His grace to them. This is called mahavis'vāsa or intense faith and the thought that Bhagavan will reward or pupish according to one's karma and will (therefore) be iodifferent towards one-this thought is opposed to intense faith. The fourth anga is the thought that Bhagavan is all-powerful and can protect us and the prayer (result. ing from it) for protection. This would arise if we give up the thought that Bhagavan, though merciful, is wanting in the ability to protect us. The obstacle to this anga is the thought that He would be indifferent to us as He is without the quality of goodness. The fifth anga is called the avoidance of what is disagreeable (to Bhagavan). It consists in avoiding actions which would be against the will of the Master, Tbe obstacle to this is doiog what is for bidden in the s'āstras. The sixth anga is the determination to do good to all creatures in as much as all creatures-both those that nove and those that do not move--are His body. Doing what is harmful to them is opposed to this. Thus have I explained to you nanana (or s'aranāgati) which consists of the angas and the upāngas", which mean avoiding what is opposed to them. This is the gross (sthila) meaniog of the word namas. 

II. THE SUBTLE MEANING - SÖKSHMĀRTHA: 

Learn (now) the subtle meaning - (sīkshmārtha). Whenever the sentient being considers himself and what is connected with him as his own, the two letters ma, and ma in mama (mine) sigoify the notion of mine' or mamakära. The thought regarding oneself and those things that are connected with 

(* NOTE: Angas are accessorics, upangas are those that are accessories to angas: berc the avoidance of what is opposed to the respective angas). 

27 

SUKSHMARTHA AND PARARTHA 

373 

one that one is independent and that these things belong to oneself - this thought has arisen from the false notion which has grown in strength owing to wrong impressions (vāsanas) which are from time immemorial (beginningless ), This notion can be countered by the right thought viz., me na ( These are not mine). The meaning of me na is, “I am not independent. I am not sesha to myself (but to God). (My) body and other things are not nine; they are seshas to the Supreme Being." By this right understanding, those false thoughts that they belong to oneself disappear, Owing to those false thoughts that have acisen from false impressions (vāsanas ), which are from time immemorial (anadi) and which have grown in strength by notions opposed to the true nature of things, (we think as follows ):- "I am inde. pendent: these things are mine." This thought is got rid of by the word namas uttered by tho man performing prapatti with the right understanding that Bhagavan (Vishnu) is the inner self or soul of all. Thus has the subtle meaning been explained, 

III. THE SUPREME MEANING: (parārtha): 

"Listen now to the supreme meaning (para), which is differ ent (from what has been said before). The syllable na indicates the upāya (or endeavour): ma indicates that it is principal or all - important and the visarga (fipal aspirate) vis., S (in namas) means Bhagavan. This is the meaning obtained from that word (namas):-"In order to attain Bhagavan, who is eternal and who is the highest ruler, who is omnipotent and is called Purushottama - (in order to attain Him), Bhagavan is Himself the principal means called ramana, Thus have I explained to you the three meanings of namas." 

' Since, in the above, it is stated that only the Sapreme Seshi should be bowed to or sought as refuge, it is evident and appropriate that the Being to whom namas is due is the Supreme Seshi. In order to make it clear who this Supreme Seshī is, the specific Dame (Bhagavan) is given. In one of the slokas quoted before,374 CHAPTER 

it is said, "Doing what is forbidden by the sāstras is opposed to this (avoiding what is disagreeable to Him)", and so also "Doing evil to other creatures is opposed to this doing what is pleasing to Him). The gist of these sentences is that, if at the time of per. forming prapatti, there occurs an act which is deliberate and is disagreeable (to the Lord), there are absent the determination to do what is pleasing (to Him) and also such things as the abstinence in thought from doing what is disagreeable (to Him). If, after the performance of prapatti, the man deliberately does what is dis. agreeable (to Him), he acts in a manner which is opposed to the command of Bhagavan, whom he sought with eagerness (while performing prapatti). 

In the slokas cited above, the gross meaning (sthūlārtha) is that which appears obvious from etymological derivation according to grammar. The subtle meaning (sūkshmärtha) is that which appears from interpretation based on the similarity of syllables on the strength of Nirukta. The supreme meaning (parärtha) is that which is explained in the secret sāstras (i.c.) sāstras which comment on the meaning of the secret mantras) with the help of the conventions regarding the meaning of letters. (In the slokas cited above), in the first (sthilartha) interpretation, the behaviour which is inherent by nature to the s'esha (namely, namana) and the structure or constitution of sūdhyopāya with its angas, are explained. Then, in the second, they clarify the svarūpy of the jiva, as this is essential to the aspirant to mukti who adopts the upāya, namely, that he has no unconditional independence. Then in the third (i.e.) para, the slokas indicate the nature of siddhopāya (Bhagavan), who can be won by the adoption of the particular sādhyopāya and who is also the object to be attained. It may also be understood as stating that surrender (of self) is more important' than all other upayas. All these are to be understood in their proper places where the ten different interpretations are given later on. 

MEANING OF NARAYANA 

375 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS:-- 

All the mantras that are combined with the word namas with its various meanings as stated above become operative mantras to be einployed while surrendering one's self. The ma in praķava and in the namas lead to the consideration of one's self either by reference to the Jiva as a genus (Jāti) including one, or by reference to 'I' directly which is like catching hold of the horns (ic) (by pointing to what is essential and all-important). Since the consideration that has been pointed out in regard to one, applies equally to others as well, there is no question of any one being the Saviour of any other. Therefore since all creatures are dependent (on another) in the matter of protecting themselves and protecting others, protectorship not dependent on others is vested only in the Lord of Kamala (Lakshmi) 

THE WORD NĪRĪVĀŅA IN TIRUMANTRA: 

The word Noirii yana here (in Tirumantra) explains (in full), hy its conventional usage and by its etymology, the unconditional Saviour who appears in the first letter (of the pranava) as the Protector of all and as the s'eshi of all. His grace is to be obtained by means of the siidhyopaya called saraṇāgati (seeking protection or refuge of the Lord), wbicb is seen either implicitly or explicitly in the word namas. He is to be the recipient of the service rendered by the prapannu, which is implicit in the dative (fourth) case ( of the word Narayana) (i.e.) Nürüyanya. 

Explanation or elaboration is the clarification of what has been briefly stated before in another mander, so that there may be no ignorance, doubt or misconception (about its meaning). This explanation may be seen wherever it occurs [/i.e.) the meaning hinted at in the first letter a (of pranava) is explained in the word Nārāyana and the meaning of m in pranava is explained in 

the word Nara and 80 oD). 

376 CHAPTER 

This word, Nārāyana, which is of great help in showing clearly the two tattvas, namely, the sesha and the s'eshi finds the first place, in the Vishnugāyatri and in the Tiruuiriyarīyam, where certain names are commented upon before other vyāpaka names of Bhagavan. 

[ NOTE:-Vishnugayatri: Narayanaya vidinahe; Vasudeva ya dhimahi, Tanno Vishnuh prachodayar,] 

(Narayana, Vasudeva and Vishnu are called vyapaka names because their etymology indicates that the one referred to by them is present everyo: where). 

In the Nārāyaṇānuvāka which aims at determining the person of the Supreme Deity, who is the object of meditation in all vidyās, the word Nārāyaṇa is repeated ipany tirpes, thus showing great regard, for the purpose of declaring that Brahma, Siva and others, who might, on first thought, be considered as the Supreme Deity, on the strength of the presence of their names in. the vidyas are only the ribhūtis (or glorious possessions) of Nari yana just like the universe (which attests His glory). This it does by stating them in *grammatical co-ordination or apposition with Narayana (sāmānādhikaranyam). 

It declares that even these, (Brahma, Siva and others) are included in the meaning of Nāra (the first part of the compound) and that Narayana is their resting place or refuge. 

The potency of this name is well-known from the following passages: "Those who are afraid of sanisära and who suffer from terrible viseases are relieved of their sufferings by merely uttering the word Nārāyaṇa, and attain lappiness”. “The mano in whose mouth is the auspicious word, Narayana, is followed by 

(* NOTE:-Grammatical co-ordination: The following sentences in the Narayananuvaka arc referred to here: “ This universe is all the deity Narayana: He is the inner self of the universe: Narayana is the Supreme Jyotis (Light): The Supreme Being is Narayana: Narayana is the Supreme Brahmap: Nara yana is the Supreme Tarrva (Reality)....... He is Brahma: He is Siva: He is Indra : He is Akshara and He is the Supreme Independent Sovereign Ruler"). 48. Vyasa Sanjaya samvada :

Narayana even as the calf is followed by the cow." " The word SO Narayana is always available. Oar speech is within our control. Notwithstanding this, the jivas fall into the darkest hell by not utteriog the word": " The name, Narayana, confers (on the man who utters it) good birth in a Vaishnavite family: it confers also wealth.” “The mother 6 who gives the name, Narayana, to her son will never go to hell." In the Näradīya kalpa it is said: " Even those who atter the mere word, Narayana, are relieved of their diseases, of their dangers, of their fears and of their sorrows. There is no doubt of this." In another purāņa it is stated that if the number of vowels and consonants (in the word, Narayana ) be taken separately into account, it will (be seen to) resemble Tiru. mantra in having eight letters and may be treated as such. 

The compound word Närāyana may be split up into its two component parts thus: Nārāh ayanan yasya (He to whom Nārās are the resting place ) and Nārāņām ayanam (the resting place of Nārās). The word Nārās is here determinate in meaning and denotes only the nārās (sentient beings and non-sentient things) and does not refer also to the Lord who is their inter self. Therefore the two words are not in grammatical apposition. Nam malvar distinctly showed the meanings of these two ways of combining the two parts of the word (samāsa) in the following two passages by using the word at the end and at the beginning respectively. "He who has, as His s'eshas," countless jivas with koowledge and bliss as their attributes and with self-luminousness as their nature and also His own poble qualities--that Narayana," and " Narayana" is the Lord of all the seven worlds". In this are inplinit (Bhagavan's) possessing the two kinds of attributes, namely, freedom from defects and possession of all auspicious and noble qualities and, likewise, His possession of the two vibhūtis (glories), namely Lila Vibhuti (this (material) Universe) with all the

sentient and nonsentient beings in it) and Nitya Vibhuti, (the transcendental region of eternal glory with all that it contains). It should be borne in mind that this nārās includes the queen, the ornaments, the weapons, the attendants, the furniture and the like, the door-keepers, the retinue and such others. 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS: 

In the word Narayana, are contained all the attributes (of Brahman) which are established in the four chapters) of the Sarīraka Sastra:(Brahma sätras), namely, His being the cause of the Universe, the irrefutability of the proposition that He is the cause, His being the upaya for the attainment of mukti and His being the object of attainment (in mukti). All this has been explained by Bhattar in His Nitya in the words beginning with "Knowledge, bliss, purity and the like.” 

THE MEANING OF NĀRĀS: 

"I created the waters, which are called särās, and lay withia them. Therefore am I called Narayana." "The waters are called Närās because they were born of Nara (i. e. Bhagavan). They were at first His abode. Therefore is He called Narayana." In these two slokas, the waters refer by implication (upalakshana) to the other tattvas (reals) as well. This is evident from such passages as the following :- "The stattvas or reals had all their origin from Nara. Therefore are they known as Näriis. To Him they are the abode, therefore is He considered to be Narayana." In this interpretation of the word as a grain matical compound Bahn vrihi samāsa ( Närüh ayanan yasya), it is stated that the tattvas had their origin from Nara and are therefore called nrārüs. From this it follows that, as stated in Mahopanishad and elsewbere, Narayana is the cause of all (things and beings ) including Brahma and Isana ( Siva) in every way (i. e. the material cause aod the instrumental cause). The word ayana (resting place ) is derived

MEANING OF NARAYANA 

379 

in this way:-I yate iti' ayanam'. That which is pervaded is ayana (the passive voice being used for deriving the word). This declares that He pervades all, as they are all pervaded by him and that in order that He may do so, He has unparallelled subtleness (stikshmatva). Ayana may be derived also in another way: Iyate asmin iti : (That in which it is), in which case it would mean tbat in which everything rests. The word Narayana may be considered also as a compound of the tatpurusha type (tatpurusha samāsa), in which case it would be split into Narāņam and. ayanaın (the abode of Nārās ). It is true that the compound word should then be in the neuter gender Nārāyaṇam, but by the auth ority of nirukti, the masculine form Nārāyanah is not improper. The pramanas are the following :-"He is also 58called Narayana, for He is the resting place or abode of Narās". "The multitude of all jivas is called Nārās. Since Bhagavan is to be attained by them and is also the upāya for attaining Him, He is called Nara yana". "Nāra is so called because it means the multitude of jīvas which are indicated by the word nara. I am the goal to be attained by them; I am also the upāya for that attainment. Therefore am I called Nārāyaṇa by the seers." "The 6 wise call the multitude of jīvas by the name Nära. He is called Narayana because He is their ayana (abode or resting place). Therefore those who are thoroughly conversant with the Vedas and the Vedanta declare Him to be the kinsman, the mother, the father, the guru and the abode or resting place." 

THE DERIVATION OF THE WORD NARA: 

The verbal root in means 'to perish'; so ra (in nara) deno es pon-sentient things (i.e.) matter which perishes (i. e.) changes its essential nature (svartipa). Nara therefore, denotes those that do not perish or change their essential nature (i. c.) chetanas (sentient beings, using the na samāsa on the analogy of words like Naga - which means .mountain', for it does not (na) go 

60. Padmottaram: 

58. Mahabharata: Udyoga parva 69-10 59. Padmottaram; 

380 CHAPTER 

or move (ga) and naika, na-eka " pot one" (1. c.) many'. So Nara means sentient beings only; nära means the multitude of naras. Their ayanan (abode or resting place) is Narayana. This declares that He who has under His control the three kinds of chetanas or sentient beings (the bound, the released and the eternal) and also nonsentient things, their essential nature (or existence) their sustenance, and their activity--He is, to the three kinds of multitudinous souls (the bound, the released and the eternal) who are denoted by the word nara, the Dispenser of what they desire. It says also that sioce He is blissful, He is, of Bis own accord, the upeya (i. e.) the object of attainment and is also the support or resting place (adhāra), for it is said, “ Thus basei it been explained how the three worlds have Vishnu as the adhara (resting place or abode)” and “He 61A has entered into the three lokas, viz. the non-sentient, the sentient and the released souls and supports thern without andergoing any change." 

How these meanings are traceable in the word ayana will now be explained :- The word a yana may be derived from the verbal root in (which means to go), in three ways: (1) īyate anena iti ayana). Ayana is that by which or with which one goes, where it refers to the instrument (karana) or aid. ( When derived in this way) Iswara becomes the upāya or means (2) iyate asau iti ayana) "That which is reached. In this derivation Iswara becomes the upeya or object that is reacbed or attained: (3) īyato asmin iti a gana): "that in which it rests." In this derivation Iswara becomes the support or ādhāra on which everything reste. Ayana may also be derived from the verbal root «y, which means "to go." 

It is evident that Iswara has in Hin the qualities necessary for being the upāya, the upeya and the like, vie., easy accessibility (saulabhyam) and being supreme (paratvam). When ayana means 'abode', if we take Nārāyana to be a bahuvrihi compound ( Nārāh Ayanam Yasya) (He whose abode is Nārās ), it is consi.

dered to indicate that Narayan& pervades all things and beings within thein (i, e.) that He is jminanent within them. If we take Nārāyana to be a tatpurusha compound (Näräņam ayananı: the abode of Nārās, the (compound) word indicates that He pervades them froin withont (they being withio Him (i.c.) that He is transcendent. These two are declared in the s'rutis (i, e) in Nārāyaṇānīvikam) Immanence (or antarvyäpti) mends being present inseparably connected with other things and beings in such a way that it cannot be said that He is not present where they are: Traoscendence (bahiruyapti) means being present also in places where they are not present. Such things as Tine ( Kala) are omnipresent (vibli). So it should not be stated that Iswara is outside of them. When it is said "Narayana who is smaller (aiyiin) than all the smallest: the meaning of the word (i!!u is not 'of small size' but subtle'. So the passage really means: “Narayana who is subtler than all the subtle things ". It means that owing to His being subtle pothing can prevent Him from being within then, 

In the sruli ( which says “ He is smaller than the grain called s'yämāka), the purport is that He is of the size of the object within Which He is present (i.c.) of the measure of the upādhi or conditioning factor, and this is distinctly stated in the Brahma sūtras and their commentary (Sri Bhishyanı). Being full and complete in every object, on the part of One who is both immanent and transcendent, means that that aspect or phase of His which is within any one upidhi or conditioning factor is capable of (creat. ing, sustaining and destroying) and doing such other things to all thiogs and beiogs. It does not mean that His essential nature is all contained (and exhausted) within any one object (to the excla sion of all others). If we understand it in that sense, it would be opposed to His transcendence. If we explain this by saying that Iswara has the power of bringing together those which cannot be brought together (aghatitaghatanā sakti), it would be acceptance of the position of other systems (like Bhaskara's and Yadava 

62. Vishnupurana: 1-9-41. 

382 CHAPTER 

prakasa's), which maintain the possibility of bringing together things which are opposed to each other (Bhaskara and Yađava prakasa say that difference and non-difference can coexist). Here in Tirumantra, when the Supreme Ruler of all is indicated by the first letter (of pranava), the base nara of the word Närūs and the word ayana, all these words are purposely used to indicate His being the Protector and His being the ultimate ) cause (in a), His being eternal and His being the netă (guide) (in the word nara) and His being the resting place or support and the ioner self in the word ayana) in different ways. (It should not be thought that tbese three wean the same thing and that two of them are therefore redundant). 

If it be asked: "While the Chetana or sentient being is already indicated by the third letter of praava (111), wby should it be mentioned again in the word Naru (in Narayana)". The answer is as follows: "I do not exist without Thee, (my support); Thou dost not exist without me, (for I bring out Thy character:) " "Rama's younger brother (Lakshmana), and Lakshmana's elder brother". (In the two passages mentioned above, there is apparent repetition, but it is not a fault since it serves & definite purpose). (In the first passage ), the first part of the sentence emphasises the importance of the Seshi and the second emphasises the importance of the s'esha; so also (in the secodd. passage ) Rama's importance is hinted at in Ramanuja (Rama's younger brother) and Laksh. inapa's importance is hinted at in Lakshmanapirvaja (Laksh. mapa's elder brother): Thus each is characterised by the other. In the pranava, the s'eshie's inportance is proininent as in the chariot of Arjuna ( where Arjuna is prominent and Sri Krishna is not, being only the charioteer ); in the word Narayana, the s'eshi's importance is prominent as in the Rosamundala (the Rusakridii described in the Bhigavatam), where Sri Krishna is all-important and the Gopis not so. 

Even in the praat, though verbally the jīva is proibinent, the prominence, so far as the purport is considered, is of the Protector or Saviour.

THE MEANING OF NARAYANA 

383 

The jiva who appears in the pranava as of the form (äkāra) of jnana, both in his essential nature and in his attribute, and also as being atomic (aņı), is described in the word Nara as eternal (without change or deterioration.) Further since Narāh means 'the multitude of naras', it makes clear the fact of the jīvas being different from one another. If (on the other hand) we take the word Nārüh to rean those who have their origin from Nara (Bhagavan ), it indicates that the jivas have Brahman for their cause (in so-far as their embodiment is concerned). Owing to these additional meanings appearing in the word (Narayana), the two' words serve a purpose ( and are not redundant). 

(When the word Näriyana is taken as a bahuvrihi compound which can be split into Nārāh ayanam yasya), the word ayana is in grammatical co-ordination with Nārāh. By the word ayana, such ideas as their (näräh) being pervaded by Bhagavan are to be understood. The meaning of the s'ruti *63A that in regard to many chetanas who are eternal, one Chetana who is eternal is the cause of their attaining the desired objects--this meaning may also be seep here. 

It is true that the jiva is, according to the pramūnas, eternal. When he was described before as taking his origin from Brahman, what was meant was that, in respect of bis body which is his attribute, the origin was from Brahman (but not his essential nature, which is eternal.) 

The other interpretations which are given in kalpas like Vārdyanitmaku are also similar to these. 

In the sloka :-- “Both sentientó beings and non-sentient things whicb are all different from Vishnu are called Nāram. He who has tūran as His «tyanan (abode or resting place) is Nara yana" (in the light of this sloka) what was stated before (in Pūdmottaram), viz., Nārāh is the collection of all persons" should 

63A. * Katopanishad: II-5-13 

64.384 CHAPTER 

be taken in a wider sense (upalakshana) to include also the collection of all tattvas (non-sentiept included). Because even nod-septient matter is not perishable in its essential nature (svarīpa) and also owing to the continuity (praväha) of the different states (avasthās) into which it changes, (even) non. sentient matter is eternal. Närāh means therefore by implication (upalakshana) all the tattvas which are eternal and wbich are denoted by the word Nara. 

"Nara means also Nārāyana for the following reasons : (1) While pervading all (beings and things), He (i. e.) Narayana is na ra (one who does not change or deteriorate), for He is not tainted by the faults or impurities in them and by the sufferings which might be caused by them; (2) the verbal root nr means " to lead": He who leads (souls) is Nara : (3) In the Sahasra. nāma, Jahon, Narayana and Nara are said to be the names of Bhagavan : (4) In the passage, "The waters are the sons of Nara, the word Nara indicates oply Narayana and this is evident from the sentence in Vyasasmriti :-- "The waters took their origin from Narayana and they alone became afterwards His ayana or resting place". So the eternal and Supreme Ruler who leads all (to Himself ) is called by the name Nara. 

In the Ahirbudhnyasamhita (we find the following slokas : “Those that are related to nara are närāh. That nara is Puru shottama. It is He that confers knowledge on those that have sought His protection. It is He that dispels all (their) ignorance. Wherever He may be, He does not updergo any change. Hence He is called Nara, because He is always the same (na ra), Sentient beings and non-sentient things that are related to Him are His seshas. They are supported by Him, controlled by Him and created by Him. He has entered into them for supporting them. Therefore are they called Närāh (because they are sup ported, created and controlled by Nara). He controls all nārās; 

65, Mapusmriti: 1 - 10. 

66. Ahirbudhaya Samhita: (52 - (50 -.. 

S4) 

27 

THE MEANING OF NARAYANA 

385 

that is, by being within them, He pervades them in order to do such things as sustaining them. The nārāk are helpful (to us) in ander standing Him, for, by their existence is His existence understood. He is the ayana or abode of nārās and they are always His abode. To souls that are näräh, He is the supreme end to be attained and also the means or upāya of attaining Him ". This interpretation makes it clear that those attributes which define the essential nature of the Supreme Being such 48 (satyam, jnanan and irnandam) and the qualities or attributes of the essential nature so defined, such as compassion, His activities and the specific forms assumed by Him and likewise the three kinds of sentient beiogs, (the bound, the released and the eternal) and all non-sentient things — all these are meant by the word närāk. From all this it may be inferred that He has the attribute of being the support of all except Himself. Hence it declares also that He stands by Himself and in Himself (alone). From this, the delusion maintained by men of perverted vision (Advaitins) that Purusho tama, who pervades, supports, controls and masters them and the muurās who are related to Him are identical in their essential nature-this delusion will disappear, since it is evident that He is the soul of all and that He has such glories as that of being denoted by all words. 

The word nara (neaning . 'one who does not change') brings out the meaning of the clarificatory texts in the sruti (wbere Brabman is declared to be satyain, the Real that is un changing). The word nära which means those things which bave their origin in Nara as declared in the passage : "Those reals or tattvas that are born of Nara are called nārāk”-this word brings out the meaning of the s'ruti that declares Brahman to be the ultimate cause of all; the word a yana brings out the meaning of the texts prescribing forms of meditation or worship (as leading to the attainment of ends desired by men). 

Such texts as those in the Subālopanishad declare that the Supreme Being who is the inner self of all and who has all kinds 

386 CHAPTER 

of kinsbip (to us) is Narayana. (By this declaration) these pasf ages state that the Supreme Being is no other deity thao Narayana. 

Those who are relatives in the world became relatives (tous) by the will of Bhagavan. “O, Best off? deities, Thou art my mother. Thou art my father: Thou art my kinsman: Tbou art my guru : Thou art my learning: Thou art my wealth. So Thou art by all ", The Lord is moyes nuaster who is my benefactor, He is my father, ny kinsman, my king." " Thou art the world's father, its mother, its beloved son, its affectionate friend, its well. wisber and its guru : Thou art the goal to be attained and also the upaya or means by which it is to be attained. I am Tbine, I am sustained by Thee. I am Thy servant. I am one who considers Thee as the highest benefit. I am one who bas per. formed prapatti to Thee. Therefore the burden of protecting me is Thine". The Supreme Ruler is thas one who is the upcoadi. tioned relative in every form. If He is pleased (with us), there will be no one who will be opposed to us, for it has been said :-- "He from wbose'' favour all these people will become favourable (to us)--that Rama is now soliciting the favour of Sugriva, the best of monkeys", and "When Kesaya," the best of deities, who loves His devotees, is pleased, (with a man), his mind becomes clear thereby and all creatures--those that move and those that do not move become favourable to him. “When "A Bhagavan who is the God of all gods and who controls even Brabma is gracious, all the tbree worlds becowe favourable". “Iswara is, by His very nature, "the well-wisheria of all creatures ". If He is (at any time) differ. ently disposed, it is due to the upädhi or circumstance of the chetana (or sentient being) having disobeyed His command. Even that disposition (of Iswara's) will change (and become favourable) by some little gesture or consideration (vyuja). Havo they not

declared: "Even after approaching Sri Ranganatba who is so mad as always to take pity on His servants, why do we still con. 

tioue to be afflicted by samsära?" 

THE MEANING OF THE DATIVE (HOURTH) CASE OF 

THE WORD NĀRĀYANA (i.e.) NĀRĀYAŅĀYA: 

We will now set forth the meanings of the fourth case such as " for the sake of some one" which will correspond with the mean ing of the sentences to be shown hereafter : 

Considered in the obvious and ordinary way, it may be thought that the fourth case is nsed because of the word namas (which governs the fourth cuse (according to grawmar). In that view there is nothing noteworthy in the use of the dative case. This is the part of the Tirumantra which is the cause of the attainment of the fruit (desired), for it has been said: “That part of the mantra (moolamantra). wbich remains after the sixth letter counting frow namas (i.e.) a and which is after the fifteenth letter conoting the consonants of the alphabet beginning with ka li.e.) na, and leaving the consonantal part of 70- that part which remains after the ì in Nuräyanāya, (i. e.) āya, is called the potent part of that mantra.' This part is concerned with the attainment of the fruit. According to some interpretations, the prayer for the attainment of the fruit is found here. There is no difference of opinion in regard to the statement that the meanings of a word dif. fer in accordance with the purpose, the context, the mark or sign, the propriety. the locality and the tisue of its use and not by the were word as such. One of the meanings of the fourth case that are accepted is sampradūna (ie) to make the word indicate the person to whom a thing is given and who thereby becomes its sishin. Here in the fourth case Nārāyaṇāya in Tirumantra, it is true that what does not belong to Iswara is not given to Him, for the jiva is always Narayaba's s'esha and belongs to Him. So it might be thought that the sampradana which is indicated by the fourth case does 

73. Tirumalai ; 4. 

74. Naradiyam: 1 - 59. 

388 CHAPTER 

not apply here. But in as much as the jiva offers to Iswara what already belongs to Him for protection by Himself, it may be beld that the fourth case indicates sampradana and Ahirbudbnya (Siva) commented in this manner on the dative or fourth case in the Vyäpaka Mantras : 

"The surrender or offer of the self whicb is shown to be subordinate or s'esha is indicated by the fourth case in such words as Vishnu (i.e. Namo followed by Vishnu). When the qnestion is asked: "To whom is this self wbich is subordinate offered or surrendered for the sake of protection ", the answer is " to Visbnu". Thus Visbou is indicated by the fourth case". This is a commentary also on the fourth case in words like Narayapa as the sloka says 'in such words as Visbnu'. 

In this Tirumantra, the meanings of the seven sacred letters beginping from na have been separately stated in the mantra. smritis and these meanings have been summarised as follows by some acharyas in passages like the following :- "The meaning of na is looking after the welfare of all, helping to incline the wind (of the jiva) towards Paramapada and destroying those unworthy qualities of the self wbich are opposed to it. Since the letter ma signifies doing what is good to those who have sought (Him), helping to expand their attributive jnina (koowledge), and securing for them the respect of others : these are said to be its meanings hy those that know. The letter in signifies giving up scepticism, rendering service always to Bhagavan and doing the work of the acharya which consists in leading the sishya to Parumapadı. These benefits will, in the opinion of those that know the mantra, accrue to those that meditate on this letter. Tbose that meditate on the letter rā will acquire the love of the Lord, give ap the love of those that sre other than the Lord and protect the kingdom (from evils). By the letter ya, wise men acquire the eagerness to adopt the Yoga necessary for attaining Bbagavan and also its fruit. 

75. Ahirbudhnya Samhita : 52 - (35 - 36). 

27 THE ATTRIBUTES OF BHAGAVAN REVEALED IN TIRUMANTRA 389 

From the letter ņā one acquires the desire to praise the Lord and the command of language necessary for praising Him. The letter ya causes dread io (the miods) of Yakshas, Rakshasas, Vethala, and goblins (bhītas). Those that kaow the mantras have thos described the function of the different letters ". 

Thus Tirumantra which has been rendered free from the stain arising from perverse controversialists with the help of a careful study of the interpretations derived from grammar, nirukta and the like - will, like a rairror, reveal clearly the essential nature of the Supreme Being, and also whatever is difficult to see in regard to one's own essential nature. 

THE ATTRIBUTES OF BHAGAVĀN TO BE MEDITATED 

UPON WITH REFERENCE TO TIRUMANTRA: 

When we reflect in accordance with the praiānas, on the essential nature of the Supreme Being, who is the deity indicated by this (mantra) in all the forms which are explicitly stated and which are also implicit in this mantru, we should reflect on the following qualities of His in principal and on other excellent traits connected with them:- such qualities as His being the protector : His protectorship being the result of His very nature: His pro. tectorship extending to all, the many ways of His protection, correspondiog to the nature of the thing to be protected, His being the protector at all times, His being the protector in all places, His protection b.ing of all kinds, His protection being directed by His own interest, the omoiscience so essential for & protector, His omnipotence, the protection being irrevocable by any except His own will, the irresistibility by others of His protection, His supreme mercy, His expecting an occasion for protection, His requiring from the jiva just a pretext or vyāja for extending His protection, His accessibility to all those who have sought His help.

(108). 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

(Thus) here in Tirumantra, the Lord is to be reflected upon by good men in a concise form (in the letter a) as ibe consort of Sri (Laksbmi) and as the Saviour:(in the dative or the fourth case whose affix has been dropped) as the s'eshi, and as destitute of equals and superiors : in the word namas ) as the upaya or weaps of attaining Him: (in the word Narayuba) as the in-dwelling Self of all, (and in the fourth case of that word) as the object of atlain ment and as the Person to whom service is due. 

THE QUALITIES OF THE JIVĀTMĀ: In the same way, when the jivatma who is to attaio the Supreme Being, which is the object of bis attaioment, reflects on himself with the help of the Tirumantra, he should note the following principal qualities of his own, which are indicated explicitly by the words themselvts and a hich lie implicit in their meaning and uther qualities connected with them, wbich are all accepted on the authority of the pramāras : 'That he has to be redeemed by Bhagavan and Sri (Lakshmi), that he cannot be saved by any one else, that he has one who will protect bini in all places, at all times, and in every manner, that he has & Saviour who has noble qualities, that he has one (Lakshmi) to recommend

him (to the Lord's mercy), that he is the servant of the Lord and (His consort) Lakshmi, that he is their eternal servant, that he is their unconditional servant, that he is not entitled to be the servant of anyone else, that, in his essential nature, the self is jnana (know. ledge), that it is bliss, tbat it is self-luminous, that the self shines to itself, that the self is denoted by the word 'I', that the self is atomic (anu), that it is subtle (siikshma), that it cannot be cut (burot and so on), that the self or soul is different from the twenty four tattvas or reals, that (in its essential cature) the self is pure, that it is different from Iswara, that the self is a knower (baving kaowledge as its attribute), that the jiva bas, by nature, the capa. city to enjoy all things as agreeable, that he is competent to desire the supreme end of life, that he is fit to be commanded (by the Supreme Being), that he is fit to render service, that be bas in him the power to have a direct perception of all things, that he is entitled to have unsurpassed bliss, that he is a doer who can act subject to the will of the Supreme Being, that he is a master (of certain things) under certain conditions or upādhis, that he is the s'esha of the devotees of the Lord, that he is their servant, that he is destitute of upāyas other than the Lord, that he is steeped in such things as avidyā, that his knowledge is capable of expansion with the help of (suitable) instruments (karana) and the like, that be is beget by the fears due to samsāra, that be should look for ward to the removal of avidyā and the like, that he is destitute of any means (of attaining the end), that he has such things as the good-will of Iswara, that he should seek and obtain a good achārya, that he is competent to adopt sadhyopaya (bhakti or prapatti), that he should stand firm in the upāya, that he has great potency, that he may be called an object of creation, destruction and the like in virtue of his having the body as an attribute, but that the self is imperishable, that the self is one among many, that the selves are countless, that the selt is pervaded by Iswara (who is its is. dwelling Self), that he is subject to the control of Iswara, that he is supported by Iswara, and that as a consequence of these, the self is the body of Iswara that the five is the cause of the sportive delight894 ODAPTER 

(tilā rasa) of Iswara, that he is entitled to be the instrument for the Lord's enjoyment (bhoga) (in Nityavibhuti), that bis p98rage to his goal depends on Iswara, that the attainment of that goal depends on Iswara, that he should seek neither worldly prosperity por kaivalya, that he should eagerly long for the attainment of Bbagavan, that he should become free from all avidyā, that the self would manifest itself in its essential nature, that the self is capable of visualising everything in the state of mukti), that his sole enjoy ment should consist in the experience of Bhagavan in every form, that he is capable of having vosarpa-sed bliss, that bis being an enjoyer is (only) for the enjoynut ot of Bbagavan, that the self (in its realised state) can take any form and the like at will, that its will is irresistible, that the self will have perfect re-ewb. tance to the Lord except in regard to those unconi mon qualities or attributes that define His essential nature, tbat the sell's delight is in rendering every kind of service to Bhagavan and that the self will dever return to samsāra (after attaining mukti). (67). 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

In the three words of this (Tirumantra), we should reflect, in brief, on our being entitled to be the s'esha, of no one other than the Lord, that we bave no other upāya thao the Lord, and that we have no other end to attain than tbe Lord. 

Thus the Tirumantra has ( as stated in Nāradiyakalpam) everything that a man ought to know. From it one can under. stand the essential nature of cit (sentiept beiogs ) acit (000-sentient matter) and Iswara, as well as the differences among the jīvas themselves. The Tirumantra also teaches the unconditional differences between the jiva (the individual self) and the Supreme Sell, as, the former is s'esha and the latter Seshi. It determines Also the person of the Supreme Deity who is both the material and the instrumental cause of the whole universe. Therefore even those who live in the same locality as those that meditate on the Tirunantra in this mapper will never have delusions such 48.the following :- " There is no Iswara or God"; "Iswara is attri.

"The three gods, Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, are of equal rapk", "The three gods mentioned above are really one : " The Supreme Reality or Tattva is someone beyond these tbrea gods", "One of these, Brabma and Siva, is Iswara". "The essential nature (svarūpa) of Iswara is subject to change or modi. fication". "The material cause and the instruinental cause cau never be the game", "The jiva and Iswara are voly a single self". "The difference between the jiva and Iswara is due to certain limiting factors or conditions (upādhi)". "The jiva and Iswara are eternally (both) different and non-different," " The jiva is s'esha only on account of his karma". "The jiva is at times s'esha and at other times not a s'esha". "The jiva is inert (Jada)". "The jiva is, in his essential nature, knowledge (and does not possess knowledge as an attribute)". "The jive is eternally free from bondage". "The jiva only seems to enjoy (i.e. his enjoyment is not real but illusory). "The jiva is not a doer or agent". " The jiva is a doer or agent independent of Iswara". "The self laats (only) until the prala ya". "The jiva lasts only until mukti (and then becomes one with the Supreme Being)". There is only one jiva (all the others are illusory)", "The jiva stands self-supported". "The jiva is, in his essential nature, an effeci baving its origin in a cause." "The jiva can, in no sense, be considered as an effect (even with regard to His body and the like)", "The jiva can attain bis end only by karma". "The jiva, in the state of release from samsāra, is like a stone (haviug no knowledge and the like)". "The jiva finds delight only in his own disembodied self". "The jīva is absolutely independent of Bhagavan". "The jīva is one with Iswara". "The jiva is without such things as activities". "The jiva cao separate and unite (with Iswara)".

TEN WAYS OF CONSTRUING AND INTERPRETING 

TIRUMANTRA: We sball now copsider in what manner the Tirumantra should be considered as forming & sentence or sentences and the meaning of such sentence or sentences: 

The Tirumantra is considered as being a single sentence, as being two sentences and as beiаg three sentences, in different traditions. So also the ineanings of the sentence or sentences are reflected opon in many ways:

ONE SENTENCE-INDICATING UPAYA. 

(1) When it is looked upon as a single sentence, the con nection of words is to this effect :-" Adoration to Narayapa wbogo nature is such as can be ascertained from the pranava (aum), for it has been said: "Prasava" is the word that denotes Bhaga van." (It is true that) the praava itself is the name of Bhagavan, but there is no repetition or redundancy in another name being used, viz,, Narayana, for, as stated in Sandilya Smriti and the like, the aum (or pranava) is not of much avail, because its meaning by itself is not definite". Therefore, in the Vyāpaka mantras, the other pawe is for the purpose of indicating the particular (deity). This way of construing the sentence, when considered in the light of the gross interpretation described in such places as the Ahirbudhnya Samhita (see before) will make it (Tirumantra) appear as indicating the upāya. However the essential nature (of the jīva) and the supreme goal of life are also implicit in it (for, without a knowledge of them, no upāya can be adopted). ONE SENTENCE INDICATING KAINKARYA. 

(2) Considering such passages as " (They) fold" their hands together (in anjali) and with great delight atter the word namas". the mantra is held also as indicating the activity of the s'esha, namely, service, which is included in the supreme experience of Bhagavan in moksha. This form of service must (necessarily) be preceded by a reflection on (one's) essential nature or "svaripa * (i. e.) that of being a s'esha to the Lord. This can be made use of also by those who have adopted the upāya (prapatti), even in their present state, when they can realise the happiness (of tbat service to tue Lord). TWO SENTENCES INDICATING SVAROPA: 

(3) When these two ideas become well-established, it is necesary to have a clear and distinctive knowledge of one's essential 76. Patanjali: Yogasutras: I-1-27 77. Sandilya Spariti: 5-71 78. Mahabharata: Santi Parva: 344. 45.

nature. For that purpose, the Tirumantra may be looked upon as being two sentences (a) a Nārāyanāya um - (b) namas (or na mama) meaning (a) "I am the unconditional sesha of Bhagavan alone who is indicated by the letter a (in aum) and who has such attributes as being the universal Redeemer and the support of all and (I am the sesha) of no other. (b) I do not belong to myself, neither am I the unconditional master of anything oor have I any (absolute or unconditioned) independence. If it be asked " Will there not be reduod sacy owing to the letter a and the word Nārāyana being both the names of Bhagavan? The answer is (as follows):-- In that case one of the two should be considered as An adjective to the other) for the purpose of indicating the special qualities (such as protectorship) contained in its etymological interpretation. The redaadaacy would also cease if we construe the sentence into " (I am the sesha) of Narayana who is denoted by the letter a in (aum)". Do we not see the word 'Bhayavan', which is His name, being employed in apposition or grammatical co-ordination (stim.inidhikara ?ya) with the word · Vasudeva! (in the Vasudeva mantra )? There is no redundance, as the word Narayana serves a purpose, being used for removing all doubts as to which deity is the ultimate universal cause deaoted by the letter wbich is the origin of all letters (namely a ). The order of words in a sentence is depeаdent on the ways in which they are recited (according to tradition); but the construction or syotactical con. nection of the words is in accordance with the meaning. 

When thus taken as two sentences, the whole of the Tiru. mantra is descriptive of the essential nature (svarīpa) of the jiva. In the light of this coustruction, oamely, that of describing the essential nature, the ancients used to say: "Be born in Tiru. mantra, grow up in Duaya and stand firm in Dvaya alone". * Birtb' is due to the birth of a kaowledge of one's essential nature and the disappearance of the state wbich preceded it. This may be seen (from the verse): “Before I had a knowledge of 

79. Tirucchanda viruttam: 64 

27 

TEN MEANINGS OF ASHTAKSHARA 

390 

my essential nature, I was like one unborn. After attaining that knowledge, I was born and I do not forget this". That is acknow. ledging, of one's own accord, that one is the sesha of no one other than Bhagavan, that one is not subject to the will of any one other than Bhagavan tbat, consequently, one has no other interests than being sesha to Him and that one bas no other saviour than He. "Growth' means the adoption of the upaya resulting from & knowledge of a particular thing that has to be performed as being suited to one's competency. "To stand firm in Dvaya alone" means to become well-established in this upāya and in the (know. ledge of the) fruit arising from it, without associating oneself with any other upāya and without any other end in view. Thus Tiru mantra and Dvaya combined together reveal the svarūpa, the upaya and the end for which the upaya is adopted. 

TWO SENTENCES INDICATING THE UPAYA : 

(4) In this construction of Tirumantra into two sentences, some consider that the whole of Tirumantra has, for its purport, the surrender of the self with its accessories. In that case, the m in praṇava should be considered to be in the dowioative or first case. By the principle of the offering of the havis (or oblation), Tirumantra would then mean "This unconditional ofleriog, namely, the self or soul is surrendered to Narayana who is denoted by the letter a as His responsibility and who is the deity subject to no conditions or limiting factors (upādhi). In this unconditional sacrifice of the self, the word namas (nu mama) would come to mean that one dissociates oneself from oneself and says, " The burden of my protection is not mine." As when (an offering is made) with the words: “This is for ladra and not wine", here also, the two sentences are essential; one to express the connection (of the offering) with the Supreme Being and the denial of its connection with oneself. Also in this surrender with the words namas (na mama), the purport may also extend to the denial of one's being an agent or doer absolutely independeat of the Supreme Being. The two sentences may also be considered to 

400 CHAPTER 

... 

. 

. 

suggest the meaning; "The burden of my protection is of no other (than Bhagavan) nor is it my own". 

That Tirumantra has, for its purport, the offering or surrender of the self was stated in the Nitya as follows :- "After offering the self to the deity with the moolamantra etc" This idea is shows also in Sri Vaikunta Gadya as follows: "Praying that Bhagavan should accept one for eternal service to Himself alone, one should prostrate oneself and offer the soul to Bhagavan with the utterance of the sacred moolamantra", 

TWO SENTENCES INDICATING PURUSHĀRTHA: 

(5) In each of the two sentences, some understand & word (like syäm) meaning 'I pray that etc' or 'May I' etc. (In that case the first sentence would be aum Nārāyaṇīya syām, and the second na mama syām), and their meanings would be: 

“May I render service to Narayana denoted by the letter al May there be no hindrances to this!" Tirumantra, 48 & whole, would then be a prayer for the attainment of what is desired and the removal of all undesirable things and this is considered the supreme end. In that case the reflection on one's svarība is implicit in it. Similarly even when the Tirumantra is con. sidered to have, for its purport, only the indication of one's svarība, (as in the third meaning) it would, by suggestion or implication, indicate the specific end to be attained. The upaya and the prayer would then be known from the respective pramānas 

which ordain prapatti. 

It is often said that Tirumantra has, for its purport, the knowledge of svarūpa, of upāya and of purushärtha, because a knowledge of these which did not exist before is acquired from it. The knowledge of these is prāpya (to be acquired) and the Tiru mantra from which this knowledge arises may therefore be said to be präpyapara (i.c.) to bave, for its purport, the knowledge of these three. But the expression prapyapara does not mean that 

80. Sri Ramanuja: Nitya 

29 

TEN MEANINGS OF ASHTAKSHARA 

401 

Tirumantra has, for its denotation, this knowledge. It denotes the svarūpa, upāya and purushartha and not the knowledge of these which afterwards arises from it. (For example: the word *cow' denotes the animal called 'cow'; but when the word 'cow' is employed, we got also a knowledge of the cow. From this we should not say that the word 'cow' denotes the knowledge of the cow. It denotes only the cow though, subsequently, the knowledge also arises. To put it in other words, the denotation of the word and the items of knowledge which may arise when the word is employed are two different things. 'Cow' and knowledge of the cow' are two different things. 

THREE SENTENCES: 

When Tirumantra is considered as consisting of three. sentences (there are several ways of understanding the meaning:) (6) & (7) The svarūpa or essential nature (of the jiva) and his sapreme goal (purushärtha) are stated by the words themselves and the upāya is implicit in the meaning (though not expressed by the words); (8) or the svarūpa and the upāya are stated by the words themselves and the purushärtha is implicit in the meaning: (9) or the upaya and the purushārtha are stated by the words themselves and the svarüpa is implicit in the meaning (10) or the svarīipa, the upāya and the purushärtha ( all the three) are stated (distinctly) by the words themselves. 

(6) If it be asked how this is, the answer is as follows: The first two words indicate svarüpa and the third word purushirtha. 

As stated in the following sloka : I am" the property (s'esha) 

na mama of only Bhagavan who is denoted by the letter a; I do not exist for myself : He who is depoted by the word 'Narayana', which means the person whose abode or dwelling place is the multitude of the etermal nārās (i.e.) jivas --- To Him the varied forms of service which I should reader in virtue of my nature should 81. Ashtasloki: 3.

CHAPTRR 

appear (to me) in all places and in all states". (as stated in this s'loka ), the prasava and the nainas clarify the svarīpa ; and the third word Nārāya tāya with the predicate understood (Damely syām) is & prayer for the attainment of the goal, in view of the idea of existing for Bhagavan expressed (already) by the pranava. The form of the prayer would be “May I be for Narayana!" In this view, the prayer for the removal of hindrances (to s'eshatva) results from the meaning (and not from the words themselves, because the attainment of the purushärtha is impossi. ble without the remov.sl of hindrances). As stated in the Dvaya and in such passages as "ThouRlA shalt enjoy thyself on the slopes of the hills in the company of Sita", since the one to whom service is due has a spouse, the meaning would here also be, “May I be for Narayana as well as for Lakshmi!". If the predicate be needed, & word like bhaveyain (May I be) should be understood. This prayer has indeed bsea made in such forins as the following:-- “May I sørender faultless service remaining with Bhagavan con. stantly in all places and in all states." "Vouchsafe upto ine Thy grace so that I may render service to Thee". "I pray bor eternal service to Thee" and " I should be * Thy eternal servant," 

“Existing for His sake' is eleraal; so there is no need to pray for it; this relationship of existing for His sake (as His s'esha) is already expressed by the prapava. Therefore prayer is inide bere for service (to Bhagavan), which is the overflow of the full and perfect enjoyment of Bhagavan and which contains within itself all other ends of life as in the colomon saying: "Io the ocean is a Bin all puddle (i.e.) the larger contains the smaller within it)". 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS:--- 

Here in the dative or fourth case ( in the word Nārāyaṇāya ), although the jiva expects his owa guia (namely, the attuipment of bis purushärtha ), yet it ends in the Master gaining pleasure or 81A. Ramayana : Ayodhyakanda:31 • 27. 84. Sri Ramanuja : Siria Gadya. 82. Tiruvoymozbi: 3-3-2,

delight. (Therefore there is no violation of the proper function of the, s'esha). (Likewise) desiring that the Master should gain conduces also to one's own bliss or ananda. 

" Whether it is said, "I beg for service which would please Thee" or " Thou shouldst find delight in having my service" - iD either case, both are gainers". (This is the idea). It has been said:-" Food Mis of two kiads, that which has three qualities and that which has six qualities: That which hast three qualities is for those bound by karma; the other is for others". Here the food with six qualities is the enjoyment of the (six) qualities of Bhagavan and also the different kinds of service which result from them and wbich are most enjoyable. 

(In the Brahma Stitras) it is said that since the srutis indicate that there would be perfect resemblance or equality (bhoga mätra sāmya) only in regard to enjoyment between Brahman and the mukta, the perfect equality is only in enjoyment and in jnana or ko wledge. Therefore there is nothing (in the srutis or the sūtras) opposed to the mukta being a sesha (to Bhagavan) which pertains to his e34 atial nature (svarīpa) and, as a result thereof, rendering service (kainkarya) to Him. It has been explained in Sri Bhashya and elsewhere that when, in the state of aspiriog to mukti and in the state of mukti, the jiva ineditates on his being Brahman, what is meant is that this contemplation is only in virtue of the self or jīva being the body of Bhagavad. Therefore this notion of "I am Brahnan" is indeed the result of the body (here the self or jiva) being dependent on the inner self (Bhagavan ) and existing only for the fulfilment of His purposes. (Therefore there is no impropriety in the self being sesha to Bhagavan even in the state of mukti ). The service that is rendered in the state of release or mukti comes from the very pature of the self: it is free from the pairs of* opposites, constant and un-intermittent, and produces 86. Lakshmi tantram.

[*NOTE: pairs of opposites like pleasure and pain, heat and cold etc.)40+ CHAPTER 

unlimited delight. In the state of aspiration to mukti (mumukshu) the service that is rendered for its own sake is due to the circon. stance or upadhi of some good karma done in the past; it has to andare the pairs of opposites (dvandva ) such as heat and cold sod pleasare and pain; it is interrupted by sleep and other such (hindrances) and the delight arising therefrom is limited. 

Here all activities of the jiva which do not form the service of Bhagaven and which do not fit ia with His commands will yield adverse results of some kind or other. Among those activities which are permitted by Bhagavan, those which are for the purpose of attaining svarga, cows and the lik: will yield fruits which may appear to be pleasant but which are miagled with many undesirable elements. Therefore they are, for that reason, bindrances. So, as stated in the s-loka : "Oaer should give up the performance of those actions which are aimed at attaining the three ends, namely, dharma, wealth (artha) and pleasure (kāma)," the aspirant to mukti may perform those rites or actions in relation to Bhagavan which are the means of securing bhakti and jnana and also of promoting the glory of Bhagavan and of Bhagavatas without caring for any other fruit. Since these rites or actions are not productive of life in samsāra, they would be included in the proper form of service, The state of being a s'esha to Bhagavan indicated in the pranava extends to that of being a sesha to His devotees in so far as laid down in the pramānas, as a consequence of the jiva's absolute subjection to and sole existence for Hiin, which are indicated appropriately by the word namas. 

So tbe kainkarya or service to Bhagavad which is desired in the word Nārāyaṇāya extends to His devotees. This idea is expressed in such slokas as the following :- "I am greatly pleased with those wbo bave devotion towards my devotees. Therefore one should bouqur them greatly", and. “Therefore in order to obtain the grace of Bhagavan, one should please His

SERVICE TO BHAGAVATAS

devotees. By this the Lord becomes heartily inclined to show His grace. There is no doubt of this ". 

The saying that “dependence upon others isA miserable" means (only) that the dependence on the worthless, which is due to past karına and which is not suited to one's svarvpa, is the cause of misery. Being subject to the will of) Bbagavan and tadiyas is the prescribed goal suited to one who realises the essential nature of his self and it is therefore the cause of unsurpassed delight. "Tadiyas" or 'Bhagavatas' means those who feel a delight in heing the servants of the Lord. 

There are some who maintain that service to His devotees (tadiyas) logically follows when one desires to serve Narayana who his for His attribute Nārās, for service to the substantive in Nāriņām a yanam iaclides (they say) service to Narūnām (all nārās ) which is the adjective or attribute. (If the logic of this s'atement that what is prescribed for the substantive should be coosidered as prescribed also for its adjective or attribute, (in other words ), if being the attribute is itself the cause (of being honoured and served), then every thing that is denoted by the word Nārās here, such as Brahina and the other gods, the enemies of Bhaga van, cattle and the like, would coine under those to whone service shonld be desired. If it is said, “He desires to serve mea's sovereign", it does not follow that he desires to serve men also who are the adjectives of the sovereign (in the phrase 'men's sovereign"), So also, by mere logic, the desire to serve Nārās will not become proved. (That will require pramilas for proof). Therefore only this much can be said:- By the authority of the pramānas, since the aspirant desires to do what is pleasing to the Master, he desires to serve those who are dear to Hun and who realise that they are His s'eshas and have no other interests in life. Even in the experience of the state of mukti, the experience of everything else indicated by the word Nara which is included in the experience or enjoyment of Bhagavan - even this is not understood from (the) logic (of the adjective and the substantive ). It is understood from 89 A. Manusmriti : 4 - 160. 

406 OH APTER 

the authority of the pramana, (namely the sruti wbich says " He sees all, and attains all things". 

So far the Tirumantra was construed as having three sentences among which the first two were held as indicating the svarzpa of the jīva and the third as indicating the prayer for the attainment of the purushärtha or goal aimed at. 

17) Different from this is the construction of Tirumantra into three sentences of which the pranava brings out the svarūpa or essential nature, namas forms the prayer for the removal of hindrances or evils, and the purushartha which will result from that renewal is indicated in Nārāyarāya syāın ("May I be for Narayana !") That the namas in Tirumantra too, like the namas in Dvaya has, as its parport, the prayer for the removal of hindrances - this interpretation, too, is explained in Bhattar's Nitya in the slokas: “As stated in the pranava, I am the sesha of Bbagayan; in spite of it, I wily subdued by the notions of 'I' and Mine' owing to (my) past karma. The word namas states that, hereafter, I should reinember my being sesha tu Bhagavan and render service to klim". Therefore the syntactical con struction becomes in this interpretation): Ahain na mama syam "I sball not be my owa sesha or na mama kinchit syat" "May I have no hindrances'" Sy.iin or Syiłt being understood. So it amounts to a prayer for tha complete removal of all hindrances such as avidyż or ignorance, karma, the impressions left by them (väsanas), the taste or inclination (ruchi) and the association with prakriti or inatter. This has been shown in the passage in Vedārthasangraha, where it is said. " Owing to beginningless avidyā or ignorance, two kinds of karını, good and evil (pulya and pāpa) have been floving like a stream. Oa accjunt of this, the jīva becomes enclosed in bodies of four kinds: Brabina und the other gods, men, anivaals and plants. So in accordance with the notion entertained by the jiva regarding his nature, the streain of samsāra increases in its volume. In order to get rid of the fear caused by it which is hard to resist etc.” So also it ia said, 

27 

TEN MEANINGS OF ASHTAKSHARA 

407 

" In ordersA to protect the souls of samsārins whose nature is such that they have false notions of 'I' about the body, bad ways of life due to these (false notions) and the impure body which results therefrom, the Lord of the Nityasuris was born into all sorts of castes and species ". 

It may be asked :-" When & prayer has been made for the removal of hindrances, where is the need for another prayer for the attainment of the desired end? Will it not follow as a natural consequence? Hlas it not been said: “When the jīva attaingas Brabman, those qualities or attributes of his which are natural to him and which were, till now, bidden begin to shine forth. This is revealed by the word Svena in the sruti". "In the same way as the brightness or radiance of & gem is not produced (anew) but is a natural consequence of washing away the dirt covering it), so also jnana or knowledge is not produced in the soul (anew). When a tank or a well is dug, the water and the ether (space) are not created but siviply come into prominence (having already been there). It is only what already exists that is manifested clearly, How can there be the production of a thing which did not exist ? So also on the removal of uodesirable or evil qualities, qualities like koowledge begin to shine forth. They are not created anew, for these qualities are eternal in the jiva (since they belong to his essential nature) "? 

The answer to this question may be expressed as follows : 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

"The son begs of bis father for his share of the property, though it is lawfully his. In the same way the servant (the jiva) who has offended (the Master) begs of the Supreme Being tbat be should be peripitted to render service ". There is nothing inappro. priate in the jiva who has lost what he is entitled to, praying thus:-- “May I have what is my sbarel Be Thou so gracious en to pardon my offence;" 

89 A. Tiruviruttam. 

91. Vishau Dharma: 104 - (55 - 57). 90. Brahma Sutras: 4.4.1. 

408 CHAPTER 

From the passages quoted above, it would appear also that just 28 when the bindrance is removed the radiance Datural to the gem begins to shine by the will of God, as stated io." All thingsøla exist as such only by T'hy will", so also such things as the expansion of jriina which naturally belong to the Jiva, are wapifested as a result of the Lord's will, wbich is of the form of the compassion Datural to Him. 

But it may be asked: "In a (*)system of thought which bolds that the non-existence (of a thing) weaps the presence of some other tbing, the n boval of hiudraoces should, by itself, be the attainment of wbat is desired. Hence will out the separate prayer for it be redundant? Besides bas not the author of Sri Bhashya declared: “The disappearance of avidyā (literally, igaorance; karma ) is itself moksha"? 

(NOTE (*): Vísishtadvaitins hold thi t the non-cxistence (of a thing) is simply the existence of some other thing and not a category apart. For example, when we say, "There is no pot on the floor', the non-existence of the pot is merely the existence of the floor. Tarkikas hold, on the oth:r hanj, that pon-existence or the absence of a thiny (abhava) should be considered as a separate category ). 

To that question the answer is as follows: - For the sake of some purpose, a single thing may be indicated (in two ways), in its essential nature (svarūpa) and also in a form that is opposed to it So (here ), it is called the attainment of what is desired and the disappearance of what is not desired, because of the intention to signify & special purpose. In the state of samsāra, the dis. appearance of something that is undesirable way be another undesirable thing or the disappearance of what is desired and what is not desirable alike. But in the state of moksha, since every thing (without exception) that is undesirable disappears, wbal remains is all agreeable So the two (the disappearance of the undesirable and the attainment of what is desired) were stated separately in order to show, with great regard, that the former state (samsāra) is most undesirable and the latter most desirable, since it 

91A. Sri Vaikuntasatvan: 36. 

27 

TEN MEANINGS OF ASHTAKSHARA 

409 

(is free from all undesirable elements and) bas only what is desir able. Further the two have to be stated separately, since the withdrawal of punishment by Bhagavan and such things as the expansion of the jiva's knowledge are different things. It is not improper to pray separately for these two things since the remission of punishment by God which is the cause of the contraction of knowledge and the like is different from such things as the expan. sion of knowledge, service and the like wbich results from the disappearance of the contraction of knowledge, service and the like, which were the results of that punishment ? 

There is also another reason for two separate prayers - In some other systems of thought (like that of the Türkikas), moksha means the disappearance of all undesirable things and the attain. ment of a state similar to that of a stone (with no positive content in the forni of enjoyment or bliss). In order to show that moksha in our system is not of that kind, bat has & positive content of enjoyment or bliss, the two are stated as being separate and also to show that in the attainmeot of Bhagavan (in mukti), there is no such thing as an alloy of misery or pain just as there is in attaining such states as the position of Indra." 

Thus if it is held that the svarīipa and the prayer are expressed explicitly by the words themselves, the upaya prescribed by the süstras, for the attainment of the end in view (purushärtha) nouuely, the sädhyopāya, is implicit in the meaning of namas which states the disappearance of undesirable things in the case of the inan destitute of all other upāyas as a result of bharanyāsa. 

(8) SVARÜPA AND UPÃYA : 

Since the prayer for the purushärtha is not a mere desire but the soliciting of a protector, the anga and other accessories may be considered also as implicit and not expressed. The Tirumantra would then mainly indicate the svarüpa and upāya. If we split Narayana into nārāņām uyanam yena "He by whom He becomse 

410 CHAPTER 

the resting place of nārās (the world of jivas), the word ayana may be considered also as indicating the upaya, for He is the upaya. 

(9) UPAYA AND PURUSHARTHA : 

SANSKRIT SLOKA 

Some acharyas considered that, as in the order in which these are expressed in Dvaya and in the charama sloka, bere, in Tiru mantra also, the pra lava (tāram) expresses bharanyāsa or the surrend'r of the respoosibility of protection and that the other two words namas and Nárāyaṇāya express the attainment of the end in view. 

(10) THREE SENTENCES INDICATING RESPECTIVELY 

SVARŪPA, U PĀYA AND PURUSHĀRTHA 

Tirumantra may be consi lered also as stating all the three, viz., svaripa, upaya and purushärtha io that order. In this case the prajava states the svarüpa or essential nature of the jiva (as Bhagavad's s'esha), the namas states the upāya and what remains (i.c.) Nārāya līya states the prayer for the purushärtha or the attainment of the end in view. 

The details concerning these three should be understood by a study of the Vedanta stāstras. The construction or interpretation given above of Tiruinantra has resemblances to the order in which the tattva, the upaya and the purushärtha are explained in the Vedantha sāstras. Does not that sasira proceed in this way? Jo the first two chapters (adhyāyas) (of the Brahma sītras), the Supreme Real (Brahman) and the reals subordinate to it are determined. In the third chapter, competency (adhikāra) and accessories (angas) are stated along with the upāya and in the fourth chapter, the fruit or the attainment of the goal is explained by way of conclusion. The essential Dature of the Supreme Real and that of the lower reals explained in the first two chapters (adhyāyas ) and the fruit or goal of attainnuent explained in the fourth are the same for the inan wbo has adopted prapatti ag te

The shortcomings and sufferings in samsara which are dealt with in the sections (pada) on Vairagya and Ubhayalinga in the third chapter and the Redeemer's being opposed to all that is of the nature of blemish Theya) and His being the sole possessor of all auspicious qualities --- these, too, must necessarily be understood by tbe prapanna who is 20 aspirant to mukti. The different forms of meditation or worship (upāsana) of Brabman, which are treated of in the third section (pada) of the third chapter (of the Brahma sütras ), should be adopted by those who are competent for them (i.e.) those who have adopted bhakti. The man who is not competent for them and who is destitute of other upāyas should realise that these forms of meditation are too bigh for him and adopt siyāşa as bis upāya. For, as stated in the following sub-sections:- Nānā sabdadi bhedāt (Brahma sutras 3-3-56) (The forms of meditation or worship or vidyās concerning Brahman) are different from one another, for their names are different and vikalpah avisishta phalatvat (3---3--57). (Any one of them may be adopted as there is no difference in the resulting fruit). Nyasa is different from the other vidyas and in yielding the fruit conferred by them, does not require any other aid. The man who has adopted upāsana (or bhakti) should perform the rights and duties pertaining to his varna (caste) and äsrama (stage of life) as an accessory or anga to the vidya or form of meditation as stated in Brahma Sutras (3.4.33) * The man who practises bhakti should perform the duties of his varna and asrama as an anga to bhakti." The nan who has adopted prapatti as a direct and independent upāya should perforın these rites and duties as having been enjoined by Bhagavan and for *heir own sake (without expecting any gain or reward), for it is said in the Brahma Stitras (3.4 - 32). “Since they are enjoined, yajnas and other rites become the duties of the (respective) ūsramas". If this is understood the, svarūpa, upaya and puru. shartha which are explained in the Sārīraka Sastras (Brahma sūtras) are all to be found within the sacred Ashtūkshara. We have already explained how the five truths that ought to be understood may be found in thie. (Chap. 4). он APTER 

SUMMARY OF THE TEN INTERPRETATIONS OF 

TIRUMANTRA GIVEN ABOVE: 

Thus the acharyas consider Tirumantra, which has in. bumerable meanings within it, as having ten (different) meanings in accordance with their respective tradition: When the Tirumantra is considered as a siogle sentence, it is thought of as indicating (1) the essential nature (svartipa) of the jiva and (2) his activity as & s'esha. When coosidered as two sentences, it is thought of as indicating (1) the essential nature of the self and (2) the surrender (of the self) by a positive and a negative state. ment, Damely, (The burden of protecting me is Bhagavan's : it is not mine) and so also (3) as indicating & prayer for the puru. shūrtha. When it is considered as three sentences, it is thought of in the following ways:- (1) The first two words indicate the svarīpa and the third word indicates the prayer: (2) The pranava indicates the essential nature or svarūpa, and the other two words indicate the prayer for the removal of undesirable elements and for the attaioment of the desired end. (3) In the same manner, the first word indicates the svarīžpa and the other two indicate the upāya, (4) the first word indicates the surrender (of the self) and the other two indicate the prayer for the attain. ment of the fruit ( desired), (5) The three words indicate res.. pectively the tattva, the upaya and the purushārtha. 

When some of these meanings are considered as the main interpretations, the others, too, should be looked upon as being implicit in the meaning, though not expressed explicitly by the words thenselves. 

SL.VSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Therefore by the interpretations of the words and the sentences tbus taught (to us) by the acharyas, who have realised the truth, other interpretations stated by those who are outside the pale of Vedic religion and by beretics (within that fold) have been rejected.

THE GREATNESS OF ASHTAKSHARA 

413 

The man who has attained a clear and sure koowledge of Tirumantra which cannot be shaken by those outside the pale of Vedic religion and by heretics -- that man has been described as follows in the siloka :- "He has "nouated the (top most) storey of the palace of the knowledge of Tirumantra and bas obtained freedom from all anxiety (about bimself). The wise man looks down (from there) at ignorant people suffering for lack of this knowledge, like a man on the top of a mountain looking at people standing below (it)". The knowledge referred to in the following sloka : "Food, "sleep, ear and sex are common both to animals and to men. The superiority of men to animals consists in their possession of koowledge. Those who are without knowledge are like animals"-the koowledge referred to here is this clear and sure kaowledge. (The man who has this knowledge) will never be moved or troubled by praise or censure as stated in the sloka : " Here he is called & wise man (pandita) who like the (unsullied) waters in the depths of the Ganga will never feel elated by praise or pained by censure". "In the land where the man who has a true knowledge of Tiru. mantra and who stands firmly in its meditation, is honoured, there will be po disease, no famine and no fear of robbers". As stated in this sloka : No such evil will occur there. It has been stated by those who are proficient in Ayurveda : “Adoration® to that unique physician who killed, without exception, all diseases like räga (desire) which are chronic, which lie spread over all parts of the body and which cause feverish activity, ignorance, dissatisf&c. tion (with everything)". The sloka quoted above really means, in accordance with the above statement in Vāgbhataın, that in the land where a knowledge of Tirumantra is honoured) there will be no such priacipal diseases as rāgu or desire, no contraction of knowledge, for koowledge has been described as wealth or Sri and no such great robbers as those who steal the self which cannot be

stolen by external robbers. The person who considers the self which truly belongs to Bhagavan as his own is & robber). 

OTHER VYĀPAKA MANTRAS 

The ideas contained in the other Vyapaka mantras which contain the words (Vishnu and Vasudeva), namely Namo Vishnavi preceded by pranava and namo Bhagavate Vasudevāya prece. ded by praňava are just those which have been declared as existing in Tirumantra. As interpreted by Ahirbudhnya such qualities 48 pervasiveness, splendour, entrance (into all) or immanence and will, wbich are deduced from the respective verbal roots are additional qualities in the Supreme Being, Vishon and decisive of His being the Supreme Deity". The meanings of the word "Vishnu” as derived from the root Vish which means "to pervade, 'vas' which means to 'shine', vis . which means 'to enter" and ish which means 'to will' and so also the meanings of the Vasudeva derived from vasati, vasayati, which mean respectively, "He dwells within all" and 'He makes all dwell within Himself" and Divyati which means 'shines', from which follow His being the support of all, His being free from any taint due to contact with them, His sportive activity, and His will to conquer - all these meanings are contained in parts of the word “ Narayana". 

As stated in the sloka : “Whatever* a man ought to know is all contained in Ashtakshara, that is, the Vedas viz., Rik, Yajus, Saman and so also Atharvan and other collections of words," as stated therein, this Ashtakshara is, by itself, the revelation of all that is desired by the aspir: nt to mukli, in relation to the tattva (Truth) and hita (the means or upaya for reaching the goal). A single utterence of it is equal to frequent repetitions of all the vedas, for it has been said, "Whatever fruit is gained by those who repeat the Rik, Yajus and Sama Vedas many times -- that fruit is gained by the man who utters the Ashtakshara mantra

only once. A single utterance of this mantra is equal to & repetition of all the Vedas. Though, as stated in the sloka: "In proportion to the faith that & inan has in the Moolamantra does ho attain the ends he desires, it is impossible to estimate adequately its great Dess" (though, as stated in the sloka), there are degrees of success varying in accordance with the degrees of faith, the potency (of the mantra) is boundless (incapable of being measured) in the case of those who have great and intense faith (mahā visvāsa ) in it. Since in that sloka (100) it is not specifically stated by whom it is impossible to measure its potency, it may be inferred that even Narayana who propagated this mantra, who is the subject of this mantra and who is, by nature, omniscient and who incarnated 49 Nara and Narayana and propagated (by precept and practice) the Scripture without letting it become extinct-that even Narayana koows that its potency is pot capable of being measured. Tiru. mangai Alvar who wis initiated into tbis mantra and its meaning by the seer of this mantra (Bhagavaal, who is also its deity, has declared as follows:- "If thou shouldst, with the help of the mantra of eight letters, always enjoy Bhagavan, who appears at the end of the Vedas which form the wealth of Brahmins, thon shalt be happy." TAMIL VERSE: 

Those wise men with eight qualities who meditate on the mantra of eight letters which treats of Bhagavan who is possessed of eight qualities and who created the eight-bodied (Rudra), the eight-eyed (Brahma), the sight quarters and their eight guardians, the eight prakritis, and the eight great mountains-these wise inen have, within their (easy) reach, the eight great flowers, the eight siddhis or super-natural powers, the eight kinds of bhakti or devotion, the eight angas or accessories of yoga, the eight kinds of wealth, the eight great qualities, tho eight times eight arts or kalas and the rasa or emotional state or sentiment which is beyond the eight rasas, namely, the emotional state called sānti or serenity of spirit. 100.

EXPLANATION OF TAMIL VERSE: 

To those great and wise man who meditate on the sacred Ashtakshara, which treats of the Supreina Ruler, who is the (ultimate) cause of all and who is opposed to everything of the nature of blemish and is, at the sam, ting, the abɔde of all auspi. cious qualities -(to these great mpen) whatever is desired by them among the spiritual victues, the eight foring of wealth and the like is never beyond their reach. The 'eight-bodied' means Rudra who obtsined the boon of having eight bodies, namely, the five eleinents (bhutas-earth, water, fire, aic and ether or space), the moon and the sun and the man who performs & yajna or sacrifice; the eight-eyed refers to Brahma who has eight eyes because of his four faces; the eight quarters; the eight guardians of the eight quarters such as lodra, the eight prakritis are the eight tattvas or reals like avyakta, mahat and ahañkāra, the eight great mountains means the eight* chief mountain ranges; 'who created these means the Supreme Being possessed of eight qualities who created all these; His eight qualities are being (1) without subjection to karma, (2) without old age, or (3) death, or (1) grief, (5) or hunyor or, (6) thirst, (7) the possession of eternal objects of enjoy. ment and (8) omnipotence or the ability to accomplish whatever He Jesires ; 'to those wise men possessed of wisdom with its eight angas who meditate on the mantra' means to those enlightened men who are possessed of understanding with its eight angas and who meditate on the sacred Ashtūkshara wbich is the chief mantra among those that treat of Bhagavaa.' The eight angas of wisdom are " quickness of grasp, retention of wbat is learnt, remembrance, the ability to explain, inference, inodification of what has been stated (to adapt it to new situations), reason, tbe kuowledge of Truth - these are the eight qualities of understanding ". The eight great flowers are the following :-"Nou-Valeace (ahimsā) is the first flower, control of the senses is (another) flower: theo comes the flower called compassion to all creatures, then the flower of

The eight forms of devotion are the following :- Love10 to God's devotees without an eye to their faults, delight in the worship offered to Hiru by others an eagerness to listen to stories concerning Bhagavan, changes in the voice and the body and tears in the eyes while listening to them, efforts to worship Bhagavan, freedom from hypocrisy in one's relations towards God, constant meditation on God, and freedom from the expectation of rewards from God. The eight angas of yoga are yama, niyama and the rest (ūsana, prānāyānia, pratyahara, dhyāna, dhārana and samadhi); the eight forms of wealth are:- the power to contract one's body to & much smaller size, the power to make one's body assume larger dimensions, the power to make oneself light (of weigbt), the power to make oneself heavy, perfect control over oneself, control over others, the attain. ment of whatever is desired, and success by merely desiring it.

The ninth is s'anti. Among these, there is nothing which he cannot have at his desire. The imperfect development of spiritual qualities regulis from want of earnestness in meditation. The inability to attain the right forms of wealtb is due to neglect The delay in the release from samsāra is due to weakness in the desire for it. That is why it has been declared "The mantra „10 namo narayana - secures wbatever is desired." 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

Thus (we have shown here what was taoght by (achāryās) who were free from the demon of ignorance (avidyā), who never ignored the path of the righteous and who shrank in shame fronı the enjoyment of petty pleasures. 

TAMIL VERSE:--- 

We bave been initiated into the excellent mantra, which enables us to give up all association as s'eshas with those who are other than our great Redeemer, and to realise that we are souls (and not mere bodies) (pranava) We have awakened froin (our) ignorance and being without any other refnge, (we) have sought the feet of Narayana who created (all the worlds) (nanias). As the result of our initiation into this mantra, we (Dow) seek to perform that service which the ancient devotees (the eternal sūris reader with eagerness (Nārāyanüya). 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

This mantra which is thus constituted of three words that are composed, respectively, of one, two and five 'letters and which treats of the three things to be known, namely, tattva (the trutb), hita (the upāya and purushärtha (the end to be attained) that are of the very essence of Vedanta-this mantra which is the foremost of all mantras, which has the pranava of three letters wbich is the

y 

(28) THE CHAPTER ON THE DVAYA SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

This mantra (Dvaya) which is used for performing s'arana. gati to the Lord of Padma ( Lakshmi) is of the nature of the dawn coming after the dark night of samsāra; for having caused it to be heard by Bhagavan, & mso is in the position of one who has done his duty; having repeated it frequently, he is in the position of one who has attained his goal. 

The particular upāya (viz. prapatti) which was stated as being indicated directly and explicitly by the middle word of Tiru mantra (namo) or by implication ia its meaning and the goal of attainment ( purushūrtha ) viz. service to the Lord which is indicated in the third word (Nārāyaṇāya) are shown clearly and distinctly in Duaya. This mantra is revealed in kattavalli separa. tely, in two parts (with other passages coming in between ) and is enjoined as fit to be meditated on with the two parts together. It is also explained in such treatises as Sri Prasna Samhita in Pancharātra with details about the number of syllables in it (the aumber of letters, sentences, their order etc ). Therefore it is a tantrika mantra based on the strutiThe statement of some that it is a sentence given by ancient acharyas means only this much: that it should be held in great esteein because it was taught by the ancient achüryas or that Bhagavan who is the Supreme Acharya enjoined it in the Bhagavat Sästra, (Pūrcharātra). Those who desire to know may find its rishi (its beejam etc.) as for the Moolamantra and the like in accordance with such treatises as the Mantrasastra and the Science of Gramınar (vyākarana). 

THE REASON FOR ITS BEING CALLED DVAYA: 

This mantra is called Duaya (the Two) because it treats of two points, the upiya and the upeya (the means and the goal of attainment, which are implicit in two slokas (of the Ramayana ), Damely, "He ('Lakshmana) fell at the two feet of bis brother 1. Ramayana : Ayodya kanda: 31-2

THE NAME DVAYA 

421 

and said in the presence of Sita, "Thou shalt enjoy thyself with Sita on the slopes of the mountains. Whether thou art awake or asleep, I (Lakshmana) will rooder every form of service to Thee" The man who is not for any other upāya or for any other end or object (in view) has full competence for the adoption of this mantra. 

Some (achūryas) say that this mantra is called Duaya (The Two), because it indicates (1) the soliciting (vārana) of a Saviour and (2) the surrender of the responsibility (bharasamarpaņam), both in one The same is the reason for the word Dvaya being employed in respeet of such other mantras as "Srimad Narayana Swamin". To this mantra also, such things as the adoration of The guru which are prescribed in the following slokas in regard to another mantra concerning prapatti are applicable : "After prostrating before the guru, this sacred mantra (literally: the king of mantrasi should be learnt. The guru is, hinuself, the supreme Biabuan; the guru is himself the great upaya; the guru is lim-elf the great vidyā or form of meditation; the guru is hiuisell the sacred siddhopāya, the guru is himself moksha, the guru is hin self the great wealth of jnāna or koowledge and bhakti because he initiates (one) into the mantra, the guru is most venerable. This mantra does not require any suitability or any auspicious position of the stars for its initiation por any purity attainable from baths in holy waters. Nor does it require for its successful initiation any japam, homam, daily repetition and the like. First one should prostrate in full before the guru three times and touch his feet with one's head and receive the mantra like a poor man expecting a hidden treasure. Having thus received the mantra, one should seek refuge under me. By this mantra alone should ope surrender one's self to me. He who has done so be. comes one who bas done what one ought to do ". 

2. Ramayana : Ayodhya kanda : 31-27 3. Satyaki Tantram: CHAPTER 

It is learnt from the Sastras (Katavalli and the like) that a single utterance of this mantra by a believer preceded by a know ledge of its meaning as a whyle will secure salvation. The potency of this mantra as distinguished from that of other mantras has been described as follows (by Sri Rawanoja):- "In whatever mannere you atter the Dvaya *tc." It bas been said: "The man by whom the nane of Bhagavan is uttered even ancong. ciously is freed from all sins as & forest with a lion in it from animals that are afraid of lions ", and (so also), "The extent of potency that Thy game, O Hari, has in condoping sins exceeds even that of sins that can (ever) be committed by a man who eats dog's flash (i. e, a chandāla,". If, in such passages, the potency of a mere utterance of the Lord's Dane is praised in very high terms, what is said in such treatises as the s'ruti about even a single utterance of this great mantra which reveals, in full, the Redeemer, the surrender of the self to Hi'n and the fruit to be obtained there. from can be easily realised by the force of pramäas. The reason of this potency may be understood from the pranūlas and from tradition or sampradaya. It is not proper to argne about these subjects wbich are of the nature of mystic doctrines. We can only place faith in them on the strength of what is stated in the s'astras. Io such treatises as the Mahabhiirata. it is said: - "dignments? based on reason are of no avail in regard to divine and o:her myse teries. The man who desires his happiness should have implicit faith in them like one who is deaf and who is blind." 

The self-surrender which is the prirport of this mantra bas been praised in such slokas is the folluwing and in other contexts : "A man shold surrender to Brahman his true and natural self free from all limiting conditivos like aviya. This is bhakti yoga and the karma yoga which is necessary for it. Other things are vain talk." Instead of 'Other things are yaio tulk" there is

another reading of the sloka which would mean “This is (real) knowledge and what is to be acquired with the help of knowledge." Though this sloka bas, for its purport, the surrender of the self, the surrender of the responsibility or burden of protection which is described here is contained within it. Other mantras which are mentioned in such treatises as Vyāsasmriti and in Svetas'vatara upanishad like, “Aman should remember that he is the body of the spotless and resplendent Vishnu and with an eager longing for Him, who is the object of attainment, and without any desire for other ends, (he) should surrender his self to Vishnu uttering the mantra "Tad Vishnoh" - Done of those other mantras reveals the Redeemer, the act of seeking His protection and the fruit arising from it so clearly (as this Dvaya) Even in the Tiru. mantra these three are stated (only) with extreme conciseness. Therefore this Dvaya which reveals, in full, the object of attain. ment and the ineans of attainment is the most important of all mantras dealing with prapatti. 

THE MEANING OF THIS MANTRA 

The s'aranāgati gadya is a commentary on Draya : 

(Sri Rainanuja) has in his gūdy« (prose treatise) given the meaning of this mantra as known from sruti, smriti, Itihāsas Puranas, Blugavat Süstra and the like and in accordance with the traditional order of interpretation of great acharyas :-- It is as follows:-The purport of the word Srimat (in Duaya) is explained in these words in the gadya);-" (Lakshmi) whose essential Dature (svarīpa) and whose form rūpa are such as can be held in esteem by Bhagavan and as are in conformity with the nature of) Bhagavan Narayana ". In the words beginniog with "opposed to everything of the nature of blemish" (in the gadya), (Sri Ramanuja) has described at length Bhagavan's essential nature (svarūpa), His foron (ripa ), and His attributes and glories (ribhūtis). So the meaning of the word Narayana has been commented upon (in 

9. Vyasa Smriti.424 CHAPTER 

them.) In the commentary on the word 'Narayana', Lakshmi who has been already stated in Srimat is once again made to appear in the midst of His glories (vibhūtis) in the word Sri. vallabha in the gadya in order to explain her role as mediator (between the jiva and her Spouse). Then Sri Ramapuja takes for comment the words Sriman Nārāyana employed in the sentences treating of the goal and the means of attaining it. The person competent for prapatti indicated by the first person singular in the word prapadye (I seek Him for refuge) is explained in the words (in the gadya) which mean "I seek the refuge of Thy two lotus feet" explain the words charanau (feet) and saranam (refuge) and 80 also the verb (in Dvaya). Later Sri Ramanuja indicates distinctly the word Dvaya which is commented upon. 

It may be asked: "Why should (he) dwell at such length without specifying the word Draya either in the beginning or at the end, but only here?" The answer is as follows:- Here in regard to the upāya and the upeya or what is to be attained thereby, the most important is Narayana with Sri (Lakshmi). Therefore the word Narayana with its attribute Sri which occurs in two places rip Dvaya) has been already commented upon. So in order to show that along with the sādhyopāya (namely prapatti)) which is indicated by this mantra, the principal upāya and the principal object of attainment have been commented upon, the word Dvaya is here inserted (i.e.) to mean that the Duaya has been, for the most part, explained. Then in the slokas which begin with 'pitaran mataram" and in certaio sentences taken form Jitantü, and Bhagavad Gita and other passages which express the same idea, Sri Ramapaja shows that the resulting meaning of the Dvaya is the adoption of the upāya (prapatti) without any other object and with no other upāya in one's view or power, and the form of prayer for pardon with the thought of the Saviour's nature preceding it. Tbereafter following the order indicated by the meaning (and not by the actual order of words in the sentence), Sri Ramanuja explains the prayer in the word namas for the removal of (all)

he pointe attainmhakti) thaiya), Phiase) in the which 

hindrances. After this, he explains the supreme aim of life which is indicated by the suffix of the dative (or fourth case) in the words wbich end in the fourth case (Narāyānāya), which includes such aims as superior bhakti (parabhakti) that precede the attainment of the supreme aim (the attainment of Bhagavan and His kain. karya). Then he points out how Bhagavan is so full of compas. sion (as shown also in the second half of the Charamasloka,) as to vouchsafe success both in regard to this life and in regard to what is to follow thereafter. (This he does) by the words stated to have been spoken by Bhagavan. Therefore all that is stated by (Ramanuja) in the (Saraṇāgati) gadya is intended to be conveyed by the Dvaya. This is indicated also by the words in the gadya) which mean “attering the Draya in this manner with an understanding of its meaning etc". 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS 

The Acharyas of old have declared that the statement in such writings as the Gadya that superior bhakti para-bhakti) and the like (li, e. parajnana and parama bhaktı) have, for their result, kuinkarya describes what occurs in the state of mukti. Since what follows later in order namely, the direct vision of the Lord (ara. jnana) and the eager desire for the uninterrupted enjoyment of Bhagavan are preceded by the eager longing to do so, they are said to result from para.bhakti. 

At the time of departare from the body, the grace of the Lord who dwells in the heart (of the jival grants to those who have performed prapatti that spiritual ripeness which wonld enable them to have a vision of the Lord. When the seed of a plant is soaked in the oil of ankola (azhinjil), it produces sprouts, leaves, flowers, fruits and the like in a few instants. So also, in just a few instants, the grace of the Lord enables the self to attain that spiritual perfection which would inake possible parabhakti, parajnana and paramabhakti. This state of perfection or ripeness which is referred to in the gadra is as appropriate as what is taught in such 

426 CA APTER 

treatises as the Sätvata concerning the special religious observances (vrata) for attaining moksha - for instance, that the minds of men rendered impure by stains caused by the wicked senses become pure at the time of their death, as a result of their residence in a place where there is a temple dedicated to Narayana. Such (great souls) as Nammalvar, Nathamuni and others enjoyed the Lord even before their death, owing to some special grace of the Supreme Being. 

Nammalvar has, in the following passages and elsewhere, stated the meaning of Dvaya: - "Meditate to soon on the feet of Narayana and His consort and acquire & new life" (here the words up to and acquire express the upaya stated in the first part of Dvaya and what follows indicates the meaning of the second part); “The" man that has sought the feet of Bhagavan black as the raincloud and who has thereby attained new life" and "O Thou on" whose chest abides Laksbmi because she cannot endure Beparation from Tbee even for an instant, etc". 

THE DETAILED INTERPRETATION OF DVAYA: 

The meaning of Sriman: 

The word Sriman Närayana which stands first in Duaya refers to the Supreme Reality (parutattva) which is the refoge of every one. The determination of the person of the Supreme Reality is well known to be arrived at in the s'rutis by reason of His being the Lord of Sri and by the word 'Narayana.' The word Srimat in the first part of Dvaya) is to show that, when Nara yapa becomes the Redeemer, Hei: with His attribute (Lakshui). Arulalapperumal L'oberumanar states :- " Refore understanding the sabstantive which bas attributes, the attributes bave to be understood. Thefore to understand Hari who has Lakshmi for His attribute, the attribute, 'Lakshmi', has (first) to be under stood." That this (Lakshmi) is an attribute both in the first part 10.

(of the Dvaya) and in the second bas already been explained in the chapter Siddhopāya s'odhana as also the principle that when the upāya has an attribute, there will be no duality of the upāya. (See page : 250). 

The meaning of Sri:- In the Bhagavat sastras (Pancha. rätra), the word Sri has been etymologically interpreted in six ways: (1) srīyate (is resorted to); (2) srayate (resorts to); (3) srnoti (listens); (4) srāvayati (makes listen); (5) srniti (removes); (6) srinati (makes ripe). The other words that are required to make the megning clear have to be understood from what is appropriate (in the context) and on the strength of pramānas. (1) & (2) Sriyate and Srayate :- Among them when we take the word to mean that She (Lakshmi) is resorted to by those who desire spiritual re-birth and that she resorts to the Supreme Ruler of all in order to give them spiritual rebirth, we may take the following sloka (for authority):- "When Thy** beloved Lord is displeased with a man who has committed serious offences in order, like a father, to reform him, Thou, O mother, sayest to Him, " What is this? Is there any man in the world who has no faults?" and persuadest Him by suitable devices to accept the offender by making Him forget (vismārya) his offences. Therefore art Thou our mother." As stated in this sloka, she helps to mitigate the anger of the Supreme Ruler who wields the rod of punishment for the sake of promoting the welfare of the offender. Thus she sees to it that the Lord's patural compassion becomes the cause of the man's ( spiritual) rebirth. The word Sri, in this interpretation, would describe her greatness as & mediator (who intercedes on bebalf of the jiva) owing to her excessive love which is that of a mother. The word vismārya, which means 'by making him forget' has, for its purport, as in the word avignāta (in avignāta A sahasrāms'u), which literally means (not knowing), the removal of the thought of punishing" entertained by the omniscient Iswara. The same is the meaning of the word 'fascinated in the

passage, "He who is fascinated by the "charms of Lakshmi, the lotus-born etc" The word 'mediator (purushakira) means "another intelligent being who is sought as a means or upāya for securing the favour of an intelligent being who can satisfy the wants of one". This mediator or purushakāra' is the mediate (as distinguished from the direct) cause for the attainment of the (desired) fruit. 

We have already pointed out in Niksheparaksha, as an autho. rity, that by (her) very nature, by the practice (of the wise), by what we see in worldly affairs and by the words of gurus, and so also by the sruti and smriti, dependence on an interceding) mediator is established (as a rule to be followed). "By Her very nature" means "By her nature in which there is no admixture of the anger arising from mental strength characteristic of a father and in which love (as for a child) resulting froma motherly feelings becomes over-whelming." It is her nature (always) to say: "There is no one who does not connit an offence"; "Who will get angry, best of monkeys, with these Rakshasis who are under the authority of a king and being servants, render service to him?" "I 

cannot endure (to see) the sufferings of these servants of Ravana and therefore I pardon their offences". Her being the Lord's favourite is also such that, if she should intercede (on our bebalf), the Lord cannot refuse. Since her very nature is such, it cannot be said that, to secure her help, the intercession of some one else will be needed and so on ad infinitum. As (an instance of) the practice of the wise, it is well-known from the Purinas, that, when Brahma and others were afraid to approach the Lord on seeing His wiath against Flis enemy, Hiranya, which arose owing to His intense love for Prahlada, they approached the Sapreme Ruler, who was then in the form of Nrisimha, with Lakshmi as their leader (mediator) and praised Him.

such contexts as the following:- " The renowned" Lakshmana thus spoke to $ītā end the noble-minded Rama." "Lakshmana, the descendent of Raghu, seized the two feet of his brother, Sri Rama, and said these words, in the presence of Sita." Io worldly affairs, too, this may be seen in kings pardoping the servants of the zenapa as a result of even slight propitiation though their offences are great. This idea is also the purport of the siloka:-"O Mother Lakshmi ! We who find our sole delight in rendering service to Thee and have only that as our aim, approach the Lord, look at Him and delight in serving Him, here and elsewhere, with the idea that He is Thy Spouse, in the same way as the people of Mithila looked upon Sri Rama as the bridegroom and the beloved husband of Sita". The words of gurus are such passages as that of Nam malvar who says :-"O Thou" on whose chest abides Lakshmi, who says she cannot endure separation from Thee even for an instant". Texts may also be seen in support of this in the srutis which are in the form of Sri Sriktas. The Smritis based on these are the words of Sounaka and others -such as the following :- "The mana who begs for the attainment of Bhagavan, who is the purport of all words, should, of necessity, seek the protection also of Lakshmi. It is not enough to perform prapatti to the Lord alone". Since it is evident from many pramāṇas that Lakshmi plays the role of a mediator interceding at the feet of the Lord, it is but proper to understand it (in this way) in this context. Thus she is resorted to as a mediator and as the attribute of Siddhopāya. 

As stated in the following selokas ;- "O Lakshmi, ** with & countenance as delightful as the moon! When we consider Bhagavan and Thee separately, (we see) that the essential nature (svarūpa) of Bhagavan and His being the Supreme Ruler over all are the outcome of the superiority resulting from His being associ. ated with Thee. Therefore Thou art that aspect of His which declares Thy Lord as being such and such." "Thou art, O 18. Ramayana : Ayodhyakandam 31 - 2 21. Tiruvoymozhi : 6 - 10 - 10. 19.

Lakshmills, the property of Bhagavan solely by Thine own will. Though His greatness (and superiority) result from Thee, they are not dependent on any one else for the reason given above. A gem is precious because of its radiance; still it should not be considered as having no worth (in itself). Its natural value does not diminish and is not dependent on anything else ",-(as stated in these slokas) she is attached to Bhagavan (the Siddhopāya) like rays to the sun and the like, contributing to His splendour. 

When we take the etymological meaning to be that she is to be reverenced by all, while she (herself) reveres the Supreme Ruler over all, she is the lady entitled to the service of all (of 1s). She is herself of the nature of a sesha to the Lord as stated in: “ Thy belovedsø Spouse is Bhagavan who is called Purnshottama" and in the sloka : "All things, those that move and those that do not move, are, O Goddess that rulest over Srirangam, for Thy Tila. The eternal siiris who are said to be constantly looking at the region of eternal enjoyment (bhoga) namely, Vaikunta, were appointed to be Thy servants. By Thy compassion alone are we among those who are protected. Thy s'eshi is Bhagavan; all the rest are subject to Thy grace". W'hen the (etymological) meaning of the word Sri is taken to be as stated in the sloka : “The whole world depends on Lakshmi for support" that all things depend upon Her for protectiod and that she is attached to all things, that aspect of the Lord of Sri which is declared by such words as Narayana (Vishnu and Vasudeva ) is declared also of Vishnu's consort. The author on Sri Bhashya, too, has said Baghavati Sri in the same way as He says Bhagavan Närüyana in that context; (i. e.) he calls for Bhagavari to show that She has the same distinction as Her Spouse. 

(3) & (4) When the (etymological) ineaning (of Sri) is taken to be, 'Sbe listens' (srìoti) and She makes listen (srīvajati) it would mean: "When we who have offended (against the Lord)

pray to Her that she should persuade Him to be accessible to us on our approaching His feet for protection, she listens to the cry of suffering of those who have sought Her is a refuge and pleads (to the Lord) on our bebalf god helps to mitigate our suffering. The words which (literally) state her activity (really) aim at stating Her role as a mediator. Having heard from Him these words : "Those who32A seek my two feet as their sole upaya or refuge - I myself take them, O, my beloved! out of samsära", and also "Compassions is a supreme virtue", she wonld, when the proper occasion arises, say, like the female pigeon to the male pigeon in the siloka :-- "Listen, my beloved #husband, with attention to what I am going to say for your good. He who has sought refuge under you should be protected even if it be at the cost of your life". It may also be considered to have the following meanings : Having heard from the Supreme Ruler that He is ever bent on the advancement of the world's welfare, she would offer her advice to be listened to even by her enemies as in the passage : " If you should desire to save your abode (viz. Lanka) and to avoid a horrible death, it would be in your interest to obtain the friendship ot Sri Rama, who is the best of men ".. 

(5) " When the etymological meaning (of Sri) is taken to be that she removes all faults (srnati), it wonld mean that she removes all hindrances in the way of those who have adopted the upaya (nanely prapatti), such as karma, and this idea is brought out in the following passages :- "In all siddhiintas (systems of reli vious thonght) and in the Vedanta, it has been declared that when Bhagavan affords protection, He does it always with Lakshmi, who is the very embodiment of compassion, by His side", and so also, "Lakshmise who resides in the ever fragrant lotus destroys all the (past) karma of jīvas".

(6) In the etymological interpretation, "She makes the world ripe by her qualities” (srnāti), the root (Sri) would mean that, by her attributes like compassion, she enables those who have sought her protection to become ripe enough to have the qualities necessary for rendering service to the Lord. This idea is brought out in the passage: "Havings Thy grace and the grace of Thy Consort who abides in the lotus, I will sweep the floor of Thy temple". Bearing in mind all these excellences (of Lakshmi) stated in all these interpretations, Alavandar wrote: " Thy Dame too is Sri. How can we bave the fitness to praise Thee?" Bhattar, too, had in mind ber being unconditionally gracious and said :- " Bhagavan" is ever gracious because of His association with Thee. Thy graciousness is not dne to any cause or condition. It exists of its own accord, for art Thou not Sri ?" Among these meanings those that are appropriate to Bhagavan's being the upāja 

· should be borne in mind in regard to the first part (of Dvaya), while those that are appropriate to Bhagavan's being the object of attainment should be borne in mind in regard to the second part (of Dvaya ). 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

In the surrender of such as one's essential Dature (and the burden of protection etc.), the Master is well known, to those who sce with the eye of the s'rutis, as the upāya or means and as one to whom the surrender is made. He is also the upeya (the object of attainment). 

Though the word Sriman means in general 'one who is 288ociated with Sri, yet here, as a consequence of the pramānas (i.e.) Sruti which says (Lakshmi is His Spouse) it means the husband or Sponse of Sri.

The relationship wbich appears to be general really means, on the strength of the Sruit, the specific relationsbip (of being the spouse ). Since He is called the Spouse of Her who is resorted to for protection and who is (also ) the world's mother, His being the Supreme Being and His easy accessibility are both indicated (thereby). Though Sri is included in the word (Nārā) (io Nara yana), she is taken here separately in order to show that there is a difference between her and other things (included in Nārā) (in that she has omnipresence and other such qualities). She is shown as an attribute (of the Lord) (in the word Sriman) in order to bring out the idea of her existence solely for Her Spouse, in accor. dance with the pramūnas (i. e. of Her own will and that of Her Lord ). 

THE MEANING OF THE SUFFIX MATUP (IN SRIMAN): 

Though sustixes" like matup have (all) the following mean ings :- 'excess' 'censure' praise' 'eternal connection'. 

superiority (over others)', 'association', and 'the statement of mere existence', yet here, by special usage, it indicates 'eternal connection' wbich is well-known from the pramānas. This eternal connection between Bhagavan and Sri is indeed such that even when He assumed the form of a Brahmacharin (in Vamana. vatara), He is said to bave concealed, with the deer-skin, His Spouse, abiding in His chest'. 

The two objections that have been raised by some in this context are not sound: The first objection is that the suffix matug is not employed when, of two things that are put in grammatical apposition or co-ordination (sāmānīdhikaranya), one is insepar* able from the other and cannot exist without the other. For instance, when we say “Brahman is Ānauda, Brohman and Ananda (bliss ) are in grammatical apposition or co-ordination with each other. Since anandam or bvliss is an inseparable attribute of Brahman, matup is not added to it as a safix. But when we 

42. Vartika: 5.2-14434 LA 

OF APTER 

say, 'the man having a stick (dandi)', the suffix matup comes after danda (stick), because the stick can be separated from the man and can exist without the man. So the objector says that since the suffix occurs in Sriman, Srī should be coosidered as separable from Narayaoa ( as in Dandi) which is pat in apposition with it. 

The second objection is as follows:-“If Sri is separable from Narayana and can exist where He is not (as during Sita's separation from Sri Rama) the two words Sri and the word meaning Bhaga. van should not be put jo apposition or co-ordination without the suffix, but we do find them in grammatical apposition or co-ordi pation when Sri Krishna says :-"Among women, I am the deity of fame, Sri (Lakshmi) and Vāk (Saraswati)" and also in the sentence :-"Bhagavan is“ Lakshmi who abides in the lotus ". 

These (two) objections are unsound for the following reasons - The existence of the suffix does not, by itself, determine whether there is inseparable connection or no. For example: By the principle enunciated in Brahma Stitras 2 - 3.29, " The jiva is called jnāna because the attribute jnana or knowledge is an essen tial and distinctive quality of the jiva, in the same way as Brahman is called Ananda (bliss), because Ananda is an essential and distinctive quality of Brahman." Here there is inseparable connec tion between the jiva and jnana and the two are put in apposition with each other, whereas usage such as the jiva is one having jnāna (Jnanavān) is also frequently found. That is, though there is inseparable coopection between the jiva and jnāna, the suffix matup is attached to jnana, as in dandi, where the connec. tion is separable. It is clear from this that the existence or non-existence of the suffix matup does not, of itself, afford evidence about the separability or inseparability of connection. 

(NOTE: . Sriman, jnanavan, dandi have also the suffis malup though in different variations).

MEANING OF SRIMAN 

435 

When it is said, for instance, " The king himself is all the subjects", where there is no suffix matup after the word lokāh (subjects) in the appositional use, it cannot be stated that there is inseparable connection between the king and his subjects and that the latter cannot exist without him, for the meaning of the sen. tence is something entirely different (from separability or insepara bility of connection). So the proper thing to do is to under. stand the nature of the connection with the help of other pramānas which bring it out clearly (and not merely by the existence or non-existence of the suffix matup). 

"Here (in regard to Lakshmi's inseparable connection with Bhagavan), since the pramāṇas declare eternal connection (bet ween them), both in the state when they are sought as upaya and in the state when the fruit (of the adoption of the upāya) is enjoyed and since in this mantra (Dvaya), this idea of inseparable connection needs to be stressed, the matup indicates that the two stand inseparably connected, both in the first part of Dvaya and in the second part and this conclusion is arrived at on the strength of such pramūnas as the following :- “ Lakshmana," the descen dant of Raghu, seized the two feet of Sri Rama firmly and said these words in the presence of Sita", and " Yon willA enjoy your self in the company of Sitä on the slopes of the mountains and whether you are awake or asleep, I will render every form of service to you". (The first passage describes their inseparability in the state of upāya and the second in the state of the attainment of the fruit, namely, the rendering of service to them (kainkarya). Napinalvar, too, realised in his mind this inseparability in the following passages :-- 0, Thou, on whose" chest resides Lakshmi, whose home is the lotus, because she cannot endure separation from 

Thee for an instant !, " While Lakshmi" with her beautiful brace. lets and Thou stand together, I see that the supreme end of exist ence is to enjoy 'Thee and render service to Thee like the eternal

sūris and other selves" (the former describes the state of upaya and the latter the state of attainment) and so also in, "Here (where" we adopt the means or upaya) and there (in Vaikunta) where we enjoy Bhagavan, there is no one other than Narayana who is ever found in (intimate) connection with Lakshmi". ((48) describes both the states). This realisation (of inseparable connection between Bhagavan and Sri, is essential for seeking the Lord's protection without any misgivings or hesitation and whenever we desire it, 

THE MEANING OF THE WORD NĀRĀYANA AND 

THE QUALITIES DISCLOSED IN IT ; 

Even the intercession of the mediator which appears as a requisite is effective (only because of the relationship between Nārāyana and the jiva and because of His qualities wbich are disclosed in the word Nārāyana. (i.e. It is because Narayana is intimately associated with the jīvas and has certain great qualities that Lakshmi's intercession proves effective). This may be seen in the passage: " Bhagavan may's even say:" "My devotees will never commit offences, Even if they offend, it is only for my glory ( to bring out my unique forgiveness" ). 

It may be asked whether it is not enough to say Sriman (and not Sriman Narayana) as the word Şrimän by itself has been declared to be one of the names of Bhagavan in the sloka :-- Sridharah: Srīkarah: Sreyah: Sriman, Lokatrayasrayah and elsewhere. The answer is as follows: "The word Sriman is here used as an adjective qualifying Narayana, because the word Nārāyana is required here (in Duaya ) in the first part in order to enable us to bear in mind the special qualities (indicated by that word) which are adapted for His being the spāya and, in the second part, in order to show that Narayana, the Seshi, who has both kinds of vibhiti, is the object of attainment.

28 

MEANING OF NĀRĀYANA 

437 

Though the word 'Narayana' used here (in Dvaya) has, for its purport, all the qualities which were etymologically derived from the word in the chapter on the moolamantra, yet, since in the first part (of Dvaya) the aim of the word 'Narayana' is to show His beiog the refuge, the following are the principal among the qualities to be borne in mind : affection (like that of a cow for the calf), that of being the Swāmin or Master, good nature, easy accessibility, omniscience, omnipotence, irresistible will or purpose, supreme compassion, gratitude, firmness, perfection or fulness, supreme generosity and the like. These qualities have been briefly told in such passages as the following:- "O, Thou so that art full of matchless qualities, that ownest the three worlds, O, Thou, that art my Saviour and that dwellest on the mountain Tiruvengadam which is longed for by hosts of gods and rishis! (Soulabhya)". 

Of these vātsālya or affection is the tenderness which accepts a man for protection ignoring his offences, as in the sloka : "I will Devero ignore one who comes to me like a friend, even if there be faults in him. This will not be censured by the good ". It is (a quality) needed for not avoiding Him on account of one's offences. Swimitva or the attribute of being the master is the special kind of association existing between Bhagavan and the jiva, wbich is dis closed in the pranava and the like. This is necessary to inspire con fidence that He will protect (us) for His owo glory. Sausīlya, or good nature, is shown in His intimate companionship with such people of low birth as buntsmen, monkeys and cow-herds in spite of His superiority to all beings. This (quality) is necessary for inspiring confidence which would not make one despair saying : " Where is He who is the Master of all and who is armed with the discus and where am I"? but which wonld encourage one to expect Him to render even sucb service as driving the chariot and conveying a message. Soulabhya or easy accessibility consists in 'His being within the range of the eyes of all men' even though

498 CHAPTER 

He is beyond the reach of even such great yogis as Sanaka and Sapandana. This (qualiiy) is necessary in order that we may not give up the longing for Him owing to a notion that He is too difficult of approach. Omniscience consists in His seeing all things, as stated in such slokas as the following: "There is nothing in any of the three worlds that is not known to Thee", and "I bow to *Bhagavan who, by His very nature, sees all things at the same time". This is necessary for the thought that there is nothing unknown to Him among the good things to be given to those who have sought His protection and among the hindrances to be re moved from them. Omnipotence consists in the ability to accon. plish what cannot be accomplished (by others). This is necessary to give us the assurance that, though we are now in samsiiru (or bondage of births and deaths ), He can make us enter the assembly of the eternal siiris, Satyasankalpatva means that His will or purpose can never be thwarted even by Himself. This is necessary for the confidence that we shonld have that the words: “I will release you from all sins", will never prove futile. Supreme compassion is the desire to remove the suffering of others withont any thought of one's own interests. This is necessary for the knowledge that He will pardon on some pretext (vyäja) even those who have committed innumerable offences, as in the slokas : "I will never give up the man who seeks me in the manner of a friend, even though he has faults", and "Fetch bim, O Sugriva, best of monkeys, whether he be Vibhishana or even Ravana himself. I promise security to him". Gratitude consists in looking upon even trivial acts of kindness with the greatest regard, as if they were supreme deeds of helpfulness and never forgetting them. (lostances of this) may be seen in such slokas as the following: "Since Sri Ramak is large-hearted, he does not remember even hundreds of offences committed by others against him. He delights (on the other hand) on even a single act of help :', and "That cry** 54: Ramayana: Yuddhakanda 17-35. 58. Ramayana : Ayodhyakanda: 1-11 55. Nyaya Tatvam.

for help uttered aloud by Droupadi even from a distance calling me "Govinda!”-that cry is never away from my mind like a debt that has increased with the interest accumulated on it". This quality makes one say to oneself: “If He sees anything of worth done by me within the limits of my ability, He will never forsake ine". Firnidess is the quality of persistence in protecting sup pliants. This is necessary to inspire the faith that He will never forsake us, even though others who are very intimate with Him try to dissuade Him, as (when Sri Rama said):-"I will never SIA give up the man who comes to me in the manner of a friend". Pari foirnatvan (perfection or fullness) consists in (His) having all objects that üre desired or desirable. This is necessary to make us endeavour to serve Him in the way that is within our limited power, with the knowledge that is what we offer to him (upahüra), He will consider only the fervour of emotion or feeling and not measure its worth or value. This may be seen in the following words (of the Lord): "Though what is offered to me by ruy levotees is atornic, it appears very great to me owiog to their love. What is offered to me by those wanting in devotion, however great it might be, never gives me delight". " Whatever is given to me with love, be it only such trivial things as a leaf, a flower, a fruit or even (mere) water, I eat it, because it is given with devo tion by one who is devout”. Supreme generosity is the liberality in making gifts which makes a person feel that he has not done enough, even when he has given all that he possesses without any Ghonght of the slightness of the endeavour on the part of the person liepehted, the greatness of the benefit conferred or the unworthiness of the beneficiary. This is a quality which induces men like *Dudhibhands and others to ask with importunity for the great bent fits of spiritual life even for those who are connected with thew, Thus such qualities in the Redeemer as are useful for

seeking His protection and the manner in which they are useful should be borne in mind. 

In the state of practising the vidyās or forms of meditation (prescribed in the s'rutis), only certain qualities (of Brahman) pertaining to that vidya are ineditated upon. Still in the state of enjoyinent of the fruit of the meditition, the object of enjoyment is Brahman with all his qualities. In the case of the word occurring in the second part of Dvaya, though all qualities may be present, since the aim is to attain Na ayana with such qualities as are essential for our service to Hira whicb arise from His essential nature and from His qualities, the most inportant qualities to be understood are His being the Seshi and IIis being capable of afford ing (perfect) bliss. 

In another chapter (in chapter 11 Parikara vibhiige), we bave (already) stated that here (in the word Nirnayam in 1112 first part of Dvaya) the determination to do what is agreeable and the avoidance of what is adverse are inílicated on account of the relationsbip (of master and servant) implied in it. 

There are some (achüryas) who take Sriman Vurug'ara charunau as a single compound word. There are others who take it as three separate words Sriman!, Narayana!, Churuan anil supply the word tava (Thy) between Narayana and curatau. In this interpretation, they have in mind such passages as “ 62 Do not approach those who say these words'. "O) Thou with eyes like the lotus, 0 Vasudeva, O Vishnu... ...be Thou my pupu". ** May 62A Thou Thyself be my upiipu!" and the Tamil verse: "O) Thou“ on whose chest resides lakshmi who dwells in the lotus 'O Thou, my ludeener, I seek Thy feet as my upcrzre having no other upaya and no other object of attainment", "() Sriman Narayana, my Master" and other such mantras and also Saran gati gadya which is an elaboration of Dvaya.

instances Bhagavan is addressed in the vocative case and the prayer in the gadyu seeking Flis protection follows). So also the first part of Dvaya is interpreted thus :- 'O Thou with Lakshmi for Thy Spouse, O Narayana, I seek Thy feet for refuge,' (understanding the word Thy (tava)). Thrs, whether we take it as a single com pound word or as threc separate words, there is no difference in the inander in which the attribute (adjective) Sri and the substan tive Narayana stand in relation to each other in the first part of Dvaya and in the second. 

THE MEANING OF CHARAŅAU. 

The word Chararau means not merely 'the two feet' but by implication, the divinely auspicions form (of the Lord), (which is not of matter or prakriti). That the Tord of Sri is the Supreme Deity superior to everyone else and that He is in association with an eternal form are most important among things that should be known. This quay be seen from such pissages as the following: “He who has the true knowledge that Bhagavan has an eternal form and so also, O Puusbkara, that He is superior to everyone else-Hiin does Bhagavan approach”. Therefore in the word Sriman Narūpalu, we should bear in mind His being the Supreme Reality that is easily accessible and in the word Charanau, His having an eternal forin. Even by those who have no clear idea of the essential nature of the Divine Being (that He is jnana and ananda) and that He has the qualities mentioned before-even for then the object of meditation should be the divinely auspicious fornt which is constituted wholly of suddha sattva (and not matter), wbich, in those who have a kaowledge of it, removes the contraction of knowledge (due to past karma) and wbich suggests Ilim as the Supreme Reality and His easy accessibility. Owing to its being the principal (meditation ), (Sri Ramapuja ) speaks of the divinely auspicious form in the Gadya before stating the qualities. Though Tirumangai Alwar had a true knowledge of the essential nature of the Divine Being, yet he spoke of bimself as one who 

65. Poushkara Samhita : 

442 CA APTEK 

does not believe in the Supreme Reality (that is jnana and ananda ) like atheists who consider the body as the soul, because of his extreme devotion to the eternal form wbich is delightful even to Iswara ( who is jnana and ananda ). This idea is expressed in the sloka: “ The divinelye auspicious form of Bbagavan is more delightful and more wonderful to Him than His own essential Dature (which is jnana and ananda)". 

The divinely auspicious form of the Supreme Ruler is pure and auspicious (subha ) and is a fit object of meditation (asraya ) as declared in the following passages : - "May I see that holy countenance of Vishnu with eyes like lotus in the form which He has assumed of His own will and which, when remembered, removes the sids of men ! " " Sri Rama fascinates the eyes of men with the beauty (of his form) and their minds with such qualities as generosity." Those who are in the bondage of sansāra may be objects for meditation (ūsraya) but there is no parity or auspiciousness in them. The essential nature ( svarūpu ) of Bhagavan is pure and auspicious but it cannot be an object of meditation. 

The pure and essential form of the jīva (free from bondage ) cannot come back to samsara, since it is without the qualities necessary for doing so; but by its nature, it has in it in the poten tiality of being associated with such qualities. Therefore it has not the purity and auspiciousness which are opposed to anything that is of the nature of a blemish, nor can it be a fit object of medi tation. When a released soul (mukta) assumes a form, it can become an object of meditation as also eternal sūris (nityas) who have form, but neither of them has the purity and auspiciousness which can release the baddhas from samsāra. Therefore it is only the divinely auspicious fornı (of the Lord) which has purity and auspiciousness and the fitness of being an object of meditation, which are both necessary to the aspirant to mukti.

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

It is known that the ( divinely auspicious) form of the Master 18 of more importance (to the aspirant to mukti) than His essential Datare svarípa, because it is capable of being grasped easily both by the high (like Brahma) and by the low (like ordinary men ) and because it can produce (in those that contemplate it) bhakti and južne. 

In the sentence prescribing saraṇāgati, namely, " Seek refuge under me alone", (charamasloka) also, the Lord who had assumed 

a form appeared as the place of refuge. From the sastras, it is well known that this dividely auspicious form in the five states Para, Vyüha, Vibhava, Antaryāmī or Hārda and Archa is pure and auspicious and suitable for meditation. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Here (in the Duaya ) the feet of the Lord should be meditated on as the upriya, because they ure easier of being grasped by the mind for meditation and have such virtues as raising compassion 

(in Him ). 

The servant resorts to the feet (of the Lord) because of their being extreinely appropriate for resort and because as stated in the saying: "It is not possible to withstand the seizure of the feet", they are capable of increasing the compassion of the Lord and also because they have in them the power of affording unique enjoyment as stated in the sloka : "How can69A a man who has his mind set on Thy lotus feet which are full of nectar ever desire anything else? Will the bee ever seek the worthless Iksburaka flower, while the lotus in there full of honey?" This idea is well-expressed in the following passages :- "I am a 698suppliant at Thy two feet which protect the gods and the asuras alike". "Those lotus feet of the Lord which can secure the state of bliss for me - there is

"My upaya" is in Thy Two feet”, "I give up, O Lord, all upūyas and also the desire to enjoy the self (in its freed state) and am a suppliant before Thy feet which once nieasured the universe", "He seized the two feet of his brother (Sri Rama) firmly", "O mys child, I caught the two feet (of the Lord) whose soles are red, which are well-set and which are adorned with toes that are beantiful, tender and rosy (in colour) and bowed with my head, “I have songht” the feet as (my) refuge". "He who has" sought as an upaya, (for protection) the two feet that destroy the sing of those who perform prapatti". and others. Those who followed this tradition (like Nammalvar and Alavandar) said also :-"I was firmly set under Thy feet (for protection )"; "I have no other upaya and no other object of attaioment than Thee and all it suppliant before Thy feet". (So also) those who were proticient in the sustras (like Parasari Bhatta ) said, " Hari hat's a forin full of such qualities as fragrance and tenderness. The means that can secure llim for os are Ilis two feet”. 

In the word churanau 'The two feet) the word 'alone'is implicit in the meaning (li.e. the two feet alone) as in “seck Prefuge vader Him alone by all possible means," "Satagopan *who resorted to His fert alone if the upiira and as the object of attain ment" and "The feet of our Lord who lies on the serpent iseshu) ---His feet are wlone our page".

is against the interpretation that Bhagavan with Sr as His attri bute is intended (for in that case 'the four feet' should be the words). This is silly because this oljection is refuted by the word Srimat which distinctly and explicitly states at the very beginning of the sentence " with His attribute Sri". This indication of the attribute 'Sri' is first heard in the sentence and cannot therefore be annulled by the dual form, namely, the two feet' (wbich comes later in the sentence). The reasoning which says that the plural form "many or four-feet" should have been used in that case will appear ridiculous to those who are acquainted with liter. ature, for the dnal forni is used, because the husband is the principal factor and his sponse is necessarily associated with him. When an emperor has a spouse, no one would dare to say that he has some one else (as a second rnler). So also, here, a serious staternent has been recklessly made without due reflection, 

the upüya, where is the need for this attribute viz. Sri? If He needs her, it would follow that He is not omnipotent." The same objection conld be inade against the qualities (of Narayana) and the form (vigral) (of Narayana) which are stated in the words Varā gana and chura(114 respectively. If it is maintained, in accordance with the pramiais, that the qnalities and the form are lfis attributes and that as there is a special efficacy appropriate to them as such, the omnipotence (of the Lord) is not thereby annulled, then the sanie argument will hold good (in the case of Sri also) becarise (ller being the upaya along with Bhagavan) has been stated by many authorities (pramiiņas) and because in the word Srimat, Sri's being the attribute is natural owing to her rela. tropship of being the Spouse. 

If, in spite of all this, it is beld nerely (on the ground of the (dual) charaṇau (the two feet) that the association with Sri is mere *Upalakshana and does not signify that Sri is also upāya, 

*NOTE: Upalakshana: a mere mark, token or sign to indicate Narayana who is recognised by that mark. An Upalak shana is not an essential feature of the object in question, 

446 CHAPTER 

then the same thing would bave to be said abont His association with such things as qualities (and form). If it is held that since the word (charaṇau) is employed along with the word Nārāyana stating that they are the repaya, the one who has the qualities and the form which are necessary for being the upaya is the upaya, the same thing can be said also (of Sri) here. Such being the case, if it is held that in case Sri is considered an attribute, it wouli be against (the Lord's) omnipotence, there would be the same irreconcilability with that onnipotence, in expectiog Sri to be the pediator (interceding on behalf of the jiva), 

It is said in Bhattar's Srigunaratna-kos'anı :- "Though qualities like youth are common to Thee and Bhagavan, you have divided between yourselves for the sake of enjoyment (certain qualities) -- such qualities as there should be in a man - namely, independence of all others, anbjugation of enemies and firmness, in Bhagavan--and such qualities as there should be in a woman - namely, gentleness, existing only for the sake of the husband, compassion and patience, in Thee”. Jo accordance with that s-loka, when the jivas offend Iswara who stands snpreme in power with the characteristics of the masculine natnre, of the nature of the father and of the ruler exercising control and such others, Lakshmi who has gentleness, affection and the like becomes the inediator interceding on their behalf. If it is said that this inter cession as a mediator is subject to the independent will of the Lord, then it may be said without any contradiction by the pramūnas that Iswara's being the Sarası or Protector with his attribute Sri who participates in the performance of (Her husband's ) duties is also due to His indepeulent will.

the above sloka, upāya has been pointed out as the special meaning here, it denotes upnya. . 

SANSKRIT SLOKA 

By the very nature of bharanyasa (the surrender of the burden or responsibility of protection ), the Protector or Saviour is here (in Duaya ) placed in the position of other upayas, in order that the prapanna may refrain from any effort on his own part. 

It may be asked :- When the Supreme Ruler is the means or upaya for attaining the fruit of His worship or adoration performed in accordance with the respective ordinances of the sastras in the case of every adhikūrī or competent person, where is the need for His being specially called the upaya here? The answer is :-"It is merely to show that the nature of prapatti is such that Iswara who is endowed with qualities like natural compassion is placed in it (prapatti) in the position of other upüyas. 

If it be asked, “Since prapatti is adopted in the place of bhaktiyoga, why should Iswara be stated to be " In the place of other upayas"? The answer is as follows:- “The fruit (of spiritual striving ) is to be attained by prapatti being adopted as an accessory means or aid and by upāsana or meditation or adoration (bhakti) being adopted as the main or primary) upāya. When there is no rpüsana (or bhakti), that fruit has to be obtained by means of prapatti alone. This becomes possible only because Iswara is naturally possessed of such qualities as compassion. That is why it is said that Igwara stands in the case of the man destitute of repayas, in the position of other upüyas. The man who is desi'nte of upūrus ordained for the attainment of the desired fruit and cannot bear the burden or responsibility (of adopting those upāyas ) places (Iswara) who stands as the Protector in the position of other upāyas saying: "May Thou be my upaya!" It means ** Iostead of placing the burden of adopting other upāyas on my shoulders (literally, the bead) may the granting of all the desired 

448 CHAPTER 

fruits wbich could be obtained by bearing that burden be solely Thy burden or responsibility, since Thou art capable and con passionate !" Separating this aspect (from others, viz., the acces sories), nikshepa or bharanyāsa is called the primary means or angi (and not the accessory means). This includes the man's being without the responsibility for any effort on his own part. It is in view of this separation of bharasamarpanan (from its angas or accessories, viz., the prayer that He should not expect one to do anything for oneself, that the word s'aranam is used here only to denote upiya. (From this it would follow that the prepanna is care-free thereafter io regard to bis protection.) 

In some places the prayer to Iswara to be the upüya and riikshepa or bharanyasa are spoken of separately ( as if they were different, though, in reality, they are not different). This should be understood as being due to one of three reasons: (1) The word upaya is (then) used to mean only the prayer for protection without including the prayer that Iswara should be in the place of other upayas which can be expected of the prapanna. (2) It may be to distinguish bharasamarpanan and the like distinctly and separately from the prayer for being the upaya or (3) Since the samarpanam or surrender is of three things viz., starīipa (essential nature), bhara (responsibility for protec tion) and phala (or the fruit to be attained), every one of them has to be stated as different from the other two. Therefore none of these can be said to be redundant, (The prayer for Iswara being the upüya refers to bhara; and the word nikshepa refers to svarīpa). 

This aspect of Iswara being the upūsu should be understood as the peculiar feature of Nyāsa vidya. (Iswara's) jnana, power, and the like also appear in as much as they are required for this purpose.

MEANING OF PRAPADYE 

449 

THE MEANING OF THE WORD PRAPADYE: 

Since verbs meaning 'to go' or 'to move' mean also to have a knowledge of' or 'to know, the root pad in the word prapadye, which means 'to go' means, here the specific know ledge required in this context. The knowledge, here, is the sure koowledge or faith that the Lord will save (116). Since faith which is the most important of the accessories or angas (to prapatti) is referred to here, the sādhyopāya with all its accessories is indicated here. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows:- The preposi. tion prat (in prapadye) discloses the greatness or intensity of the faith which is its excellence. This excellence or intensity of faith would arise only when one bears in mind the medi atorship (of Lakshmi) and ope's relationship with the Lord, the Lord's qualities and the like (form) which are respectively present in the words (Srimat) and Nārāyana. By this intensity of faith, all doubts arising from the greatness of one's offences will disappear. This intensity of faith is necessary as stated in the sloka : "The Rakshasasea had no confidence in (the effectiveness of) the Brabma missile (astra ) with wbich Hanuman was bound. The result was that that missile wbich would never fail of its purpose became loose immediately. In the same way, if men had no faith in the efficacy of prapatti, it would be the same as if it had not been performed at all. Therefore prapatti gives mokshu soon to those who have faith in it". The potency of this certainty of belief is well known from the following paseages :- "If a man“, has no faith, he can never approach that Supreme Brahman", and “Hari is everal present in all those who bave no doubts. The Lord of Taksbmi (Madhava ) is never present in those who doubt as a l'esult of their reasoning or logic". If this intense faith is present, doubts will never arise during any inquiry into Bhagavan's qua lilies and the like). Therefore intensity of faith at the first moment (of performing prapatti) which would never permit of later doubts is an accessory or anga of prapatti. Even if it is

weak, Iswara wbo has begun to show His special grace will make it full and perfect". Has not the Saviour graciously stated: “I will never gives np the man who has come to me in the gnise of a friend, whatever might happen'? Is not His yrace of such a nature as is described in the sloka, about such things as even anjali :- "If a manas has folded his hands in worship to Thy feet at any time and in any manner, it will destroy all his sips at that very instant and lead to the attainment of good things. It will never prove futile". Therefore even weakness of faith will grow into deep and intense faith (in those who have performed prapatti with all its angas). 

- On this expression of intense faith stating, "I have made up my mind to beg Thee for being my upaya", the prayer (to Iswara ) to be the upüya may be takto here as having been made and this wonld be in accordance witb the following pramānas: " When what a mano desires cannot be attained with the help of any one else, a prayer is made, with intense faith, to one who has the required ability (to secure the object desired) that he shoald be the means or upaya. This prayer is prapatti; it is s'aranagati!'. "The thoughts of praying:--- "May Thou alone be my upāya!” this is saranagati. Let this be done towards Bhagavan", "Those who say to Hari: “Be Thou my upuga"- never approach them”. The anga or accessory called " seeking protectorship” is contained within this and is not separate or different from this. 

It may be asked:--" What is the prayer in this first part of Dvaya for? Since in the second part, there is a prayer for the attainment of the desired end and the removal of bindrances there. to, the prayer here cannot be for the same as, in that case, there would be repetition or redundancy. When prapatti is adopted as an anga or accessory, the prayer might be said to be for bhakti as an upāya; but here, since prapatti is adopted as a direct and inde

pendent means, there cannot be any upāya which can be acquired and for which a prayer could be made ( what, then, can this prayer be for?)". The answer to this question is as follows:- "The award of the desired fruit which finds a place in the second part of Dvaya ) is common to all adhikūris, whatever be the upāya (bhakti or prapatti) that they adopt. Since prapatti is not an aniga or accessory for any other rpüya in the case of one who is destitute of any other upiiga and who makes a surrender of every. thing (svarīpa - bhara . and phala), its superiority (to other upāyas ) consists in the Saviour Himself standing in the place of the upāya and granting the fruit or desired end. Therefore what is prayed for here is the point that Iswara should accept the res ponsibility of protection (bharasvīkära ). But it may be asked ngain :- " Will not this prayer that the Lord should stand as the upaya mean the same as & prayer that He should grant the desired fruit or object withont any other upaya being required as a further condition coming in between? In that case will not the prayer in the second part of Dvaya be redundant!" The answer to this question is as follows:- Since in the prayer of the above description (in the second part), what is required is stated separately because it is different in some points froin the expectation in the prayer (in the first part), there is no redundancy: [li.e.) in the prayer for Iswara being the upiya, there is no expectation of any fruit except that He should be the upaya ; in the prayer in the second part there is expectation of the desired fruit). It may also be explained thuis: though the word signifying prayer (bhaveyam) has to be supplied in order to make the second part a complete sentence, in the first part praying for Iswara becoming the upāya, the fruit is asked for, but in a general way, while, in the second part, the parport is tu specify the nature of that fruit. 

The sum and substance of the first and the second parts, when duly determined, will amount to saying this :- "I am destitute of all upāyas; therefore in order that Thou mayst stand in the place of these upã yas and grant me the specific end that is desired, I surrender the responsibility for the protection of myself as stated 

452 CHAPTER 

( in the sastras)". Thus it (the Dvaya) is a surrender of the 1esponsibility (for protection) accompanied by & special prayer 

This surrender, too, is the meaning of prapadye which indicates resolution (I resolve). We have (already) proved in many pla res with the help of pramūnas and on the authority of traditional practice that the surrender of responsibility with all its accessories is the giet of the sästras on prapatti (vide chapters 11 and 12 on Parikaravibhāga and Sängaprapadanu). 

The primary importance of the nikshepa (surrender) which is stated in another inantra for the performing of praputti is the same here also, namely: "By this "mantra alone should a man surrender himself to ine. Ile who has thus surrendered what ought to be surrendered will become one who has done what he ought to do". 

The first person singular in prapadye (I resolve) which shows one to be the doer, proves that the way to win the favour of Siddhopūya (Iswara), who has the gift of moksha in His power, is some form of vyīja (bhakti or prapatti) which can be accom plished by the aspirant to mukti in accordance with the sāstras. 

In this (the first part of Dvaa) the specific adhikari or competept person for the performance and the idea of helplessness (kārpanya), which is one of the accessories or angas of prapatti, are also hinted at as in the following passages "] who 90Ahave no other upāya and no other Saviour" etc. "I am the "abode of all offences: I have no means or upaya for saving myself and have nothing else to attain than Thee." and "I have "not been firmly established in the performance of dharma (i.e. I have not per formed karma yoga ;) neither have I realised the essential nature ( svarūpa) of myself (i, e. I have not perfornued jnana yoga : nor have I devotion to Thy lotus feet lie. I bave not performed

bhakti yoga". This is elaborated by Sri Ramanuja in the Sarana gati gadya in the words, "Having no other refuge or Suviour" and in the little gadya (Sri Ranga Gadya) in the churņikä, which says, "My sonl is eternally subject to Thy control" and likewise in the churrika in Vaikuntagadya where he says, 'I realise that, in order to attain Hindi, I have no other meads, even in thousands of crores of kalpas (1000 yugas), than seeking His two lotus feet". Aralalapperumal Eroperumanar, too, has declared: "The "man who, owing to his powerlesspess, has not the required upāya or ineans for attaining Bhagavan which is the end desired by him that man should realise with faith that His feet are the upāja for securing Ais object" Since prapatti ordains, as an upüya, the surrender of the responsibility for protection (bhara. samarpana) which is adapted to the adhikhüri who is destitute of upyas, it goes without saying (froin the very logic of the matter) that it does not require the performance of any other action which is too hard (for him) to perform. 

Thus in the word prapadye (I resolve to seek ) accompanied by the word saranan (refuge), four accessories may be considered as having been indicated: the faith that (the Lord) will protect, alod so also seeking Him as the Saviour, the surrender of the self and (one's) helplessness (kärpanya). We have already stated that the word Narayana with its adjective (Srimat) declares such things as Bhagavan's being the Master in accordance with such agthoritative texts as the following:-"All beings,** those that move and those that do not move, are the body of Bhagavan. Therefore I should do what is good for them". This determination is the sixth anga and "The fifth Ranga is the avoidance of what is displeusing to the Master." Therefore His being the Master sng. gests the determination to do what is agreeable (to Hin ) and the avoidance of what is disagreeable (to Him). In another chapter we have stated that these accessories, too, are to be thought of only once for the sale of the upāya (namely : prapatti). The use of 

93. Ahirbudhnya Samhita : 52-23 94. Abirbudhoya Samhita: 52-21464 CHAPTER 

the present tense in the verb (prapadye) is, like (the use of present tense in the verb occurring in) the mantra uttered while cutting kus'a grass, to indicate the time when the prapatti is performed. (It does not mean, as the present tense sometimes ineans, that it should be done always). The views ( held by some ) that the present tense (in prapadye) sbows that the intention is to enjoin the continuous performance of prapatti until the end of the present body, that it enjoins the continuance of faith which is one of the accessories until the fruit is attained and that it shows also the need for the continuance of such things as the determination to do what is agreeable (to the Lord) even after the performance of prapatti, as its accessories--thesc views are opposed to the pramūras which lay down (the rule) that this upāya (prapatti) with its accessories should be perforwed only once. 

If they (viz. the accessories described above) continue (even after the performance of prapatti because of the excessive eager ness to attain the object and of their being enjoyable, it does not follow that this continuance is part and parcel of the upāya adopted in the first part (of Dvaya), Therefore the use of the present tense in this sentence (in Dvaya) which states the upāya does not refer to the continuance of uttering the Dvaya for the sake of the enjoyment arising from love which is expressed in Sri Ramanuja's gadya (namely - uttering the Dvaya always with an understand ing of its meaning), (The meaning is: as an upaya a single performance or utterance will do; but when ove finds it enjoyable, the Dvaya may be repeatedly attered). 

Thus the first part of Donja discloses the Lord's being the Saviour of all, the essential nature or svarība of sarani gati, ita accessories and the nature of the person qualified for its perform.. ance. From this it is evident also that the jira has no other upaya. 

THE SECOND PART OF DVAYA: 

Saraṇāgati which has been thus described (in the first part; is capable of securing all desired ends, for it bas been stated :--

SECOND PART OF DVAYA 

455 

"Oply "so long as prapatti which can remove all sins has not been performed towards Thee, only so long will there be raisery caused by the loss of wealth and the apxiety to regain it; only so long will there be the desire to win wealth, only so long will there be no realisation of the self being different from the body; oply so long will there be the suffering of sansära." Further the Saviour is supremely generous; “Is there *any other who is so generous as He and who can grant whatever is desired ?" He stands ever ready with the deterioination to grant whatever is desired by the suppliants, for it has been said: "If we receive any thing from the Lord, He does not lose anything thereby. He will give us whatever we ask.” (Such being the case) the question arises: "What is the object or end for which prapatti should be performed?* The second part of Dvaya, (as if in answer to this question), prays for that object (end or fruit), which would be in keeping with the Saviour who is supremely generons, in keeping with this special upaya (prapatti) which can secure the favour of One who is superior to all others, and in keeping with one's owa essential nature (svarīpa) which will find its sole delight only in being His s'esha. As expressed in the passage: "The only end which I seek is that the Lord should take me as His servant for Ifis own pleasure", the second part prays for this desired end (namely, service to the Lord ), including the removal of all lipdrances to it. From this it also follows that the jiva should have no other interest or object. 

In this context, the word Näiriyamır with the attribute qualify ing it (viz. Srimat) discloses, primarily and in accordance with the praninas, the Lord's being the Master and the like and so also the unsurpassed enjoyability of the Master who has countless qualities and the two vibhutis (glories ) which make Him fit to be the object of attaioinent.

THE MEANING OF THE WORD SRIMATE (IN THE 

SECOND PART OF DVAYA): 

Though Bhagavan who is thus endowed with the two vibhūtis (Lilū and Nitya) is the object of attainment, the word Srimate (with Sri) is employed here to show that, for the offering of the havis of the self, the intended recipients, are both the Lord and His Spouse. They are (the two) to whom we are s'eshas and consequently (the two) to whom our service is due. Primarily they are (therefore) the objects of attainment. This idea is implicit also in the following and other passages :- " Bhagavan, the Lord of the world, is in the glorious world called Vaikunta with Lakshini"; " Bhagavan who is seated on the serpent Ādisesha with his Sponse" "The Lord is seated with Lakshmi who is (in every way) suited to Him." "At the loa sight of Thee and Thy consort with her shining bracelets standing together (as the Rulers of the world)” “Lakshmi whose beauty fascinates even Thee ", etu. 

Though the word Sri used here has several meanings as stated in the following slokas: " She dispels104 all blemishes; generates good qualities in those who are in the world; is attained by all at all times and has herself attained the Supreme Object of attaio ment (Bhagavan)" and "The Lord's Spouse who's has aitained the Lord and is attained by others and who dispels all blemishes and listens to the cry of the distressed " -- (though the word has all these meanings) yet, here, it denotes the person who is entitled to (our) service as it is derived from the verbal root Sri which means *Service'. 

THE MEANING OF NĀRĀYAŅĀYA: 

Though the word Srimate by itself denotes Bhagavan and IIis Spouse wbo are entitled to our service, yet the word Nürayaņa is employed here to indicate the full and perfect -njoyment (unu 99. Lainga puranam:

bhaval of the association of a sesha to the s'eshi, and of His qualities and glories (vibhītis ); for this enjoyment ( alone) will generate the kind of love which is essential for all fornus of service. Here the dative (or fourth case) which means for Näriyana (existing for Ilim) refers thereby to service, 'Existing for Him' is in itself an eternal fact (and need not be prayed for). Therefore what is to be prayed for here is service (to Them) preceded by full and per fect enjoyinent as stated in the following slokas and elsewhere : “ flereafter I should bear in mind the fact of iny being His s'esha and render service to Him: This is the ineaning of namas." " Whether you are awake or asleep, I (Lakshmuana ) will perform all kinds of service to You". 

Since the jivu while performing suraņagati (with this mantra) is praying to the Savionr for what he desires, a word like bhaveyan (may I be) has to be sapp'ied: Srimale Noiriyani ya bhaveyam (May I be for Narayana !) Thus, at first, the attainment of the desired end (service to the Lord) is prayed for as being the nuore important; thereafter, by the word nous, the removal of all bind. rances (to salvation and to service) is prayed for. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

Giving up the idea of his salvation by himself or by others as impossible and giving up the idea of his existing either for bimself or for others by the thought that lie exists (only) for the Lord and having become free from all sins by his aversion to all other objects of enjoyment than the Lord), the prapanna enjoys all bis bliss as something which is accessory to the Lord's enjoyment. 

TUE JEAVIVG OF THR VORD NAMAS -- 

Here, after the word namas, the verb bas to be supplied 80 that it becomes na mama syum, which means, "Let me not be for myself." Or it may be looked upon as na mama kinchit syut

meaping, 'Let there be (in me) no notion at all of the sense of 'mine' (mamakära)', which would be a prayer for the removal of all bindrances or undesirable things, as it asks for the disappear ance of the notion of mine' in regard to all objects. The objec. tions raised and the answers given thereto in regard to the attain. ment of the desired end and the disappearance of all undesirable elements in the case of Tirumantra should be borne in mind here (also). 

Though this word namas prays for the removal of all such hindrances as avidyā (ignorance), karma, the impressions and inclinations which have resulted therefrom (vāsanas), the ruchi or tastes and the association with prakriti or watter, yet it is consi. dered (by sowe jicharyas) that, in accordance with the sruti* which gives the etymological interpretation of this word (namas), the purport or ain bere (in the second part of Dvaya) is the l'emoval, in the state of attaining full and perfect service in nukti, of the weeds of one's being the doer by one's own will and of one's being the doer for one's own purpo-es apd, like. wise, of one's being the enjoyer by one's own will and of being the enjoyer solely for oneself. This weed or wrong notion is likely to arise because, in regard to the enjoyment of the fruit elsewhere (in svarga), the thought is present that the fruit was won by one by one's own actions and is enjoyed by one for oneself. From this it would follow that the (man performing prapatti understands that, in regard to the service in the state of mukti, there are no such wrong notions as one's being the doer and the enjoyer by one's owo will and for the sake of oneself-notions which are present in the state of enjoyment of other fruits (like those in svarga). Having understood this, the man performing prapatli makes his prayer in conformity with this knowledge. 

Arulalapperumalemperumanar commented on the word namas occurring here by the following sloka :--- " The wise say 

(* NOTE:- The Sruti says: Whatever actions may appear mine are the Lord's, not mine, They do not belong to me; they are the Lord's; I cxist for the Lord and pot for myself na inama ( not minc; not for me))

MEANING OF NAMAH 

459 

that itamas means the state of being carefree without expecting any help (of being without any responsibility in regard to oneself) nairapekshyam wbich results from the jiva's surrendering all bis burdens to the Supreme Being." The nairapekshyam referred to in that sloka is being carefree or baving no expectation or requirements without the sense of responsibility in regard to one's salvation. From this freedom from responsibility, we should realise that either bharasantarpaņam is suggested bere, (since there cannot be the state of being carefree without it) or that the surrender of the bhara to the extent of one's being carefree is intended. If we take the latter part of Dvaya to be " Aham Srimate, Narüyaņāya" . (I am for Sriman Narayana ) and consider it to be the offering of the self along with the bhara or burden of protection, and that thereafter na mama declares one's having no connection with oneself, as, when an offering is made (to the gods), it is said “This is for Indra and not for me", if we take it in this forn, it will be extremely appropriate for this inter pretation of the whole of Duaya being a statement of bhara - samartana. In this interpretation the first part of Dvaya is about the file angus or accessories, while the second part states the angi, which is prapatti. When the offering or surrender is made saying: "I am for Narayana' as in the s'loka "I who l&realise that I am Thy s'esha surrender myself here and now at Thy two lotus feet". --- (when this surrender is made), it would imply that the responsibility of one's protection and the fruit arising from one's protection are Narayana's as stated in the following passages : "When the 109 question arises to whom the surrender of the self is made for the sake of salvation or protection, the answer is given "To Vishnu", and "I am Thy 110 responsibility (bhara) (in regard to protection)". This namas discloses the severance of all connec tion between a man and his self and what belongs to bim and also between himself and his protection and the fruit resulting from it.

460 CHAPTER 

The (fourth or ) dative case of Narayana and the word namas have, each, its significance, in as minch as they indicate respectively the declaration of one's connexion with the Supreme Being and the denial of one's connection with oneself. It may also be that namas denies such things as one's being a doer not subject to the will of) the Supreme Being. Even if we take the simple and ordipary meaning of namas as namimi (I bow to Narayana," it would be in keeping with the meaning " I surender" as the word namāmi l I bow) has been commented upon in llantrarijupada. 

stotra as meaning 'for the surrender of the self'. 

Thus in the case of those who consider on the latter part of Duapa as indicating the surrender of the self, the special kind of fruit or end (namely kainkarya) arises of itself (without the need for stating it), as it is in conformity with the surrender of the self and consistent with one's essential nature (svariipa). In the caso of those who interpret on the latter part as indicating the fruit or object of attainment (namely, kainkaryal as explained before, the idea of the surrender of the responsibility for protection should be considered as being present in the first part which treats of the upaya in the verb (prapadge) being taken along with the word saranam (upaya). 

THE PURPORT OF DVAYA: 

lbus, in Dviyat, in the different words, by the nature of the Words actually used and of the nieaning which is implicit (without being actually stated in words, the following principal points as well as wbat is required for then stand revealed:- (Iswara's ) association with the mediator Takshini), this (association) being eternal, Sri being incinded in the upãyu along (with Bhagavad), the Saviour being full and perfect in His qualities, the particular forn of relationship between the jira and Iswara, (that of being the body and the socl respectively and that of being s'esha and s'eshi), Iswara having a divide and auspicions form, the s'esha making his approach to the Lord, in this divine ion), how (the 

28 

· PURPORT OF DVAYA 

461 

divide and auspicious form of the Lord) becomes the upuya; the manner of winning the Lord's grace, its accessories, the adhikari competent for adopting the upaya; how the end to be attained is the Lord with His attribute Sri, how the object of attainment (the Lord) is endowed with qualities and vibhitis (glories), how the Lord and Sri are the recipients entitled to (our) service, the prayer for perforniing this service, the attainment of all forms of service, the removal of all that is undesirable, their utter and complete removal, the jiva's being the doer subject to the will of the Supreme Being and for His purposes, the jiva's being the enjoyer (in moksha) subject to the Lord's will and by way of his enjoyinent beicg accessory to the Lord's enjoyment. And these aro recalled in Dvara along with two principal things which are intended to be stated, namely, (1) the repūva which is siddha (viz. the Lord with Sri), the upāya which is sidhnya (viz. prapatti) and (2) the object of attainment which is siddha (namely, the Lord with Sri) and the object of attainment which is sūdhya (namely kainkarya or service). 

Thus in this gem of a mantra (Dvaya), the Supreme Reality (the Lord of Sri), the special upaya (for attaining it), (namely prapatti) and the desired end or fruit (namely-enjoyment and kainkarya) are taught as in the Suriraka sāstra (Brahma Sutras) (ie, in the order in which they are treated there). In Dvaya the order of words follows the order in wbich the upāya and its fruit occur (i.c.) the upāya is stated first and the fruit is stated thereafter (as the former produces the latter). However, as in the mantra (taught) in the Svetās'vatara (upanishad) viz. “Desir ons of moksha I seek Thy protection)," the important point is the adoption of the upaya preceded by a desire for the fruit (aimed at); former (ācharyas) have explained that, following the logical (or psychological order), the sentence stating the fruit (namely, enjoyment and kainkarya) should be thought of first. For is it not a fact that a man would never study the nature of an upaya and adopt it without previously studying the nature of the end to be attained thereby?. So also in the Tirumantra, the order of 

462 CHAPTER 

meditation should be as stated above in regard to the upüya, and the fruit thereof. It is only if he desires the fruit and is (also) competent, that the adoption of the upaya would follow. 

The words of learned med such as "One sbonld seek (the Lord's) protection with (the utterance) of Dvaya" and "The saravāgati which is stated in Dvaya consists in the faith that to attain Narayana with Sri, His two lotus feet are the upaya" - (these words) also show that Dvaya reveals the adoption of the upāya. 

THE SUMSIARY OF THE MEANING OF DVAYA:-- 

Although here (in Dvaya), the first part, the words ending with the dative (or fourth) case and the namas - (althongh) these three are three separate sentences, yet it should be construed as a single sentence with the upaya as the primary purpose. This is how it should be construed): 

The sum and substance of Duaya is this:- "At the feet of Narayana who is the Lord of all, who is, in everyway and supremely blissful (or enjoyable) and who is inseparable from Lakshmi and in order that I may obtain the removal of all that is opposed to all kinds of service in all places, at all times and in all states or circumstances and to receive (the privilege of) full and perfect service to T'hem, I, who ana destitute of upayas, surrender the responsibility of the protection of myself with the accompaniment of the five angas or accessories at the feet of Narayana, so that I may not have anything to do fui such things as the responsibility for protecting myself.

who had won over the Lord by (their) prapatti and who were overpowered solely by their compassion (to teach it to others). 

2. This (mantra) is understood as consisting of eight words (if Sriman Nārāyana charanau should be taken as three separate words ;) of six words (if that componnd word is taken as a single word); and as a single sentence with five words where the predicate is important.

3. This uniqne mantra (or this mantra consisting of a single sentence) called Dvaya has three members (sentences); it can help secure the fourth end of life (namely - moksha); it gives a clear idea of the five things that ought to be known; it explains the upāya with six ungas (prapatti); its potency or greatness is similar to that of the seven oceans; it explains the meaning of azshtrikshura, the mantra with eight letters, and it produces here (in this world?) in Sriranga, in the minds of wise men* (Like Sri Ramanujal the ninth rasa, namely, (Santa or spiritual serenity). 

TAMIL VERSE: 

We have thus explained how, by uttering, in combination, the two parts of Dvaya which are reed separately in the s'ruti, one can seek, as refuge or upirya, the two feet of the Lord of Sri who, out of compassion, is bent on helping us and who is prepared to pardon us; one can thus attain the Lord of the lotus.born Lakshmi and in the region of bliss attain faultless service to the Lord) along with the full and perfect enjoyment of the Lord.

There is no sästra superior to Vedanta; there is no higher Truth or Reality than the slayer of Madhu (Narayana); there is

nothing more holy of resort than His devotees; there is no better dwelling place than those places that are agreeable to them; there is no better means of preserving health than the quality of satte (or eating sätvic food); there is no other way of acquiring wisdom than devotion to the wise; there is no bliss greater than moksha ; similarly there is no better ineans of obtaining spiritual welfare (moksha) than the utterance of Derya.

466 CB APTER 

INTRODUCTION TO CHARAMA SLOKA: 

* This' Narayana, the Lord of Sri, who abides (for everi in the ocean of wilk bas left His serpent-bed and arrived at the city of Madhura." As stated in this sloka, the Supreme Ruler, the Lord of Sri, incarnated in the beautiful city of Dwaraka in order to protect the good, to destroy the wicked and to establish dharma on a firm footing; He became easily accessible to every one, and assumed tbe role of a messenger to the Pandavas who had sought His protection, as stated in the passage : "On being* thus advised, the sons of Pritha and the twins made namaskarams to Janardana, () best of men, along with Draupadi." He made Arjuna the warrior in the chariot and acted as his charioteer to do his bidding. This Arjupa realised that the Lord of all had determined to slay his enemies using him as a (mere) instrument, and that the destruction of his kidsnen was certain. He became troubled in wind by inopportune affection and inopportune campassion and by the fear that the slaying of his ūcharyas and others, thongh they appeared (against him) in war-like trim, was a sin. So be wanteil to know what was tbe proper thing for him to do and begged (Sri Krishna) saying, "Bes pleased to tell me what, you feel sure, is to my lasting benefit. I am your disciple and have sought your pro. tection. Therefore advise me as to what I should do”. In order to dispel his grief, the Lord explained to him the eternal and essen. tial nature of the soul or self (äitman) which is different from the body and the like (the senses etc.) and likewise karma yoga and jnänu yoga, which are, to the man who understands this essential nature, the mediate means for attaining the supreine goal and also bhakti yoga which has been enjoined as the primary and direct means of attaining it, as also all its accessories. Though Arjuna was eagar to attain this supreme end quickly, he thought it too hard to perform it (bhakti-yoga) with all its accessories and though he had the knowledge and the ability needed for its adoption, he realised that the nature of this upaju was such that it would secure

467 

the end in view only after a very long period of adoption and after unceasing attention and that the end in view could not be attained quickly, So Arjuna became overwhelmed with despair. Vader the guise of teaching Arjuna, the Achirya of the Gitopanishad is graciously pleased, out of His infinite compassion, to expluin this most secret upaya (viz. prapatti) in the charama sloka which is the conclusion of the teaching and which leaves nothing unsaid. Prapatti which is one of the upüyas that be enjoined as optional in the sloku: "I can be attained by those who desire to serve ne only by bhakti or by prapatti. There is no other way of attaining ine", is the means alike, of attaining His feet and all other things that are desired, for it has been said, “Only so long as "prapatti which extinguishes all sins is not performed, only so long will there be suffering, etc." It can be performed without any accessories other than the determination to do what is agreeable to the Lord and the avoidance of what is adverse to Him and the like. It is tasier of performance and can be done in just an instant. Since the Supreme Lord, who is the Savionr, has Himself taught this truth which is well known from the sirutis, it has also the sanction of the cicluirga (for Bhagavan is Himself the wchary«r here). The permission of the acharya is prescribed in such treatises as Vishnu. tuttva as follows: - "Giving Sup all object of desire and the kurmas by which they can be secured, Sarangati with its five ringas (the angus and the ange heing six ) should he performed with the permission of the üchirja in accordance with the rules prescribed in the sustras and with renunciation of the fruits of all actions." 

SARVA PHARMĪN ETC. We have refuted, at considerable length, in Tütparya chait. strikā and Nikshepa-rakshui, the interpretations given of this sloka by such perverse (cominentators ) as Sankara. Here we will state the best and most appropriate meanings as established in the tradition of wise men. The first half of this (sloka) enjoins the

5. Sri Vishnutattvam. 

468 CHAPTER 

upāya, the second ball is the sesha which is subordinate or supple wentary to it by way of indication of the end to be attained by that upüya). Therefore the main purport of this siloka is to prescribe the upaya. Dharma is & means of attaining an object which can be understood solely from the sästra. The use of the plural forn), dharmant, indicates the manifold nature of the dhar. mias enjoined in the süstra as the means of attaining the desired objects or ends. The word sarva (all) suggests that these dhar. mas) have certain accessories or angas. There is certainly no impropriety in calling the accessories to dharma by the word dharma. If (on the other hand) we interpret the word sarva (all) as the opposite of 'one', it would indicate the manifoldness of the angis (the dharmas theroselves). 

Though the word dharma is used without any qualification or restriction, yet what is intended (by the word) here is the various kinds of upasana, or ineditation prescribed for the attaioment of moksha in the sústras with all their accessories (such kinds of meditation as dahara vidyā, sad vid yıi and Sandilya vidya). The knowledge of Purushottama (wbich is praised highly in the Gitu (Chap. XI) is conclusively shown in (Sri Ramanuja's) Gita Bhuishya and elsewhere as leading merely to the knowledge of the Truth or Reality which is of help to all vidyās or forins of meditation; the know ledge of the truth concerning the avatūrs (of Bhagavan) is shown in Ch. IV there as the cause of the adopted upisanas yielding their fruit quickly, residence in places where there are tewples of Narayana and the like are also shown to make the upasanas effective by the removal or extinction of those sins which stand in the way of the upasanas bearing fruit. Therefore it is not proper to consider them as direct and primary means of attaining moksha and to state that the plural form of dharma, vix, dharmin is used to include these also, (for they are only mediate culises of mokshu and not direct causes like the repaisanās). This plural form dharmith is sigoificant io as much as it refers to such different and many vidyās, as Sündily vidyā and dahara vid y even without the three mentioned above ((viz) the knowledge of Purushottama and 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

469 

of the avatars and residence in holy places ), for it has been said * The "vidyās are many, as their names and the like are different;" there is no impropriety even if we take the plural to signify the manifoldness of the angi's (forins of meditation) and of the angas or their accessories. 

THE MEANING OF PARITYAJYA (HAVING GIVEN UP). 

la the word purityijyt, the 'giving up' or abandonment consists in the aversion to other kinds of upāya (than prapatti), which arises from a consideration of one's being destitute of the competency for them, for it has been said, "By this 'prapatti and with only akinchanya or one's being without other upāyas as a prerequisite etc)". If there is connexion due to desire, the giving up of that desire is certainly #yāga or renunciation. 

The preposition pari (before tyaj) is to show the extreme aversion arising from the lack of competence (for other upüyas ) at all times and in every form, which the person destitute of upayas has come to realise in himself as expressed in the following passages, “I see no means of crossing (the sea of sainsāra) in all the eternity of time which lies before me," and " It is 'only by the lotus feet of the Lord that I shall attain the desired goal. I have no other means of attaining spiritual welfare in any of my births." 

"Aversion in every form" means being without the improper desire to perform what is impossible for a man with the thought: “Though I cannot adopt the upāya in full perfection, I will do it to the best of my ability; when that also is too difficult to perform, I will adopt, in the place of the prescribed angas, something less difficult or the upayas which will produce the prescribed upājas", 

6. Brahma Sutras 3-3-56. 7. ? 8. Sriranga Gadya 9. Jitanta: 1 - 10. 

470 CHAPTER 

The object of this anuvāda* (statement of what has already occurred) pamely sarva dharmän parityajya (which is not a Tidli or injunction) is to indicate the person who is specially competent to adopt prapatti, The preposition pari in parityajya is to indicate the person who is most competent or has full con petency. In the sentence:- "Having to reacbed this world which is perishable and without pleasure, you should resort to me with devotion," having reached does not state a vidhi or injunction meaning - "Reach this world". It only means 'Being in this would' or 'since you are in this world'. So also, here, the words sarvadharmūn parityajya do not mean give up all dharmas'. It should be taken to mean: "You that have given up all dhar. mas". Since this usage of having done a thing' (past participle) is met with in other senses also, it is not right to say that 'having given up all dharmas' or giving up all dharnas is one of the accessories enjoined for prapatti. 

If parityajya (having given up) is to be considered (at all) as enjoining what should be done (vidhi), there is nothing wrong in stating that it enjoins, as in the chapters on Prapatti and else where, the thought of helplessness (kiirpasya) which is of the nature of such thoughts as being destitute of upãyes. In that interpretation, sarva dharman parityajya would mean "Reflect at first on the state in which you are unfit for the adoption or per formance of every form of dharma" (in this case it would be a vidhi). This state has been (well) expressed in such passages as the following: "lam the abode of all offences (against Thee) and I have no means of saving myself oor have I anything else to attain than Thee", and "I have not performed dharma with any constancy; I have not realised the nature of the self nor have I bhakti or devotion to Thy lotus feet". Even this interpretation, which is not the meaning that strikes one immediately and is 

*NOTE: What is meant is not that the person should give up but that as he is unable to adopt other dharmas, he should seek the Lord as an upaya.

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

471 

therefore a little strained, is better than the meanings given by Sankara and others that what is intended here is such as the giving up of the dharmas themselves in their essential nature (svarīpa), because it is not out of keeping with any pramūnas (for in the chapters on prapatti, it is enjoined that the rites and observances of castes &pd üs'ramas should (always) be performed). 

When we take partyajya is a vidhi or injnnction, it would be appropriate to say that the meaning of sarva dharmūn parityajya is - "No durma of any kind need be performed for the sake of prapatti", in the sense that prapatti does not require any of them (als anges). In that case, the use of the preposition pari woold suggest that even such observances as are stated in " This should be done after performing achamana" and "This should be done with bodily purity", which are requisite for securing fitness for all rites in common, are not to be accepted as angas for prapatti. 

Notwithstanding this, if it is nuaintained that the giving up of such charmos as kurma g'ogu, jrūna joga and bhakti yoga in their essential forın (svarīpa) is an anga or accessory to prapatti, it would follow that prapatti is not in the competence of any one. The abandonment of a dharma can be enjoined only in the case of a person who is capable of perform ing it. This would be opposed to the thought of helpless. ness ( kürparya ), which is called an «nga ( of prapatti ) according to many pramīņas. It would also be opposed to the tradition that prapatti is for those who are destitute of upayas, which is evident from such passages as the following: "I am without any upüyas and have no other saviour". "I was not born into any of the four castes so as to be competent for the performance of dharma". "I have given" up the rites to be performed by a Brahmin who has the mark of worshipping the three fires after ablution", and "I am not well established in the

performance of dharma, nor have I realised the pature of my self 

etc. 

To state that the jiva (kshetrajna) is eternally incapable of all other upayas, since he is entirely dependent on and subject to the control of Iswara and (in the same brenth) to state that the giving up of these dharmus or upāyas is enjoined on him is against all s'iistrus and is opposed also to the very words of these writers and their actual practice. (For bow can a man give up a dharma which he is not capable of performing? How can i inan proceedi to perform kainkarya, if he is incapable of it owing to otter depen dence and subjection?). It would, therefore, he extremely ridi. culous to hold this view. If this view were right, thep by the same logic, even the vidhi contained in vraja (seek me etc.) would be iwpossible of perfornance. 

The statement that the jirutma is eternally incapable of all other upäras would only go to confirm the view that parityajya (here, does not enjoin the giving up and) only states what has already occurred (anuvärda) (owing to ipability ), which these writers would not like to accept. 

(Further) the 19e of a single set of words in a single sentence cannot mean both the statewent of what has occurred owing to inability in the case of the man who is not capable and the injunc. tion to the man who is capable of performance to give it up ( which is another view held by sowe) 

Nor can it be held that the option is given to the same person (adhikūrī) who is capable of performing charme either to perform the dharma or to give it up. This would mean two alternative courses, one of which is difficult and the other light, when there is no difference in the object of attain njent. For if the ruan who is capable of adopting the difficult "piya is enjoined to adopt the lighter or easier upaya by giving up the performance (of what he is capable of ), then no one would ever think of adopting the more difficult upüya and since there is no other way in which the 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

473 

difference in competency could be stated, all the sūstras which enjoin the performance or adoption of the more difficult upāya would carry no weight, 

It is also extremely inappropriate to say that, in order to stimulate the adoption of the easier upāya, the difficult upiya is (first) enjoined and then forbidden for performance. 

The view that what are not (really) upāyas are enjoined as upiyas (and are thereafter condemned as unfit for performance) - this view would tend to look upon the srutis and the smritis as deceptive. Even such things as the essential nature of the Savionr (which we learn only from them) could not (then) be known for certain, 

It is true that, in the world, among those that are desirous of wealth, some choose cultivation of the soil and other such difficult operations, while others choose lighter professions like dealing in rubies and other gems; but this option is determined by the differences in capacity or competence among the adhikūris. 

Kooarathalvan's commentary on the charama siloka :-"You that suffer (froin anxiety) because of the impossibility of adoption of other upāyas, give up everything that has been declared as the means of attaining nie and seek me as (your) refuge (tor salvation) 

this commentary, too, means only what has been explained (as the ineaning so far) and is not, therefore, opposed to it. (In that commentary 'giving up' states only what bas occurred before (anuvāda) or nieans only "without doing it as an anga required for prapatti." 

It is true that, in such cases, as Sanāvartana or the conclu. sion of the Priijapatyavrata, baths accompanied by certain vratas or observances are prescribed and also (as an alternative) baths without any such vratas (which are easier). But this option is determined by the condition or the circumstances in which the person is situated. If we do not take it in this light, the enjoining474 CHAPTER 

of the more difficult alternative vould be of no use (for no one would adopt it). 

There is another (wrong) view that the adhikari competent for prapatti is the person who has fullness of knowledge or fallness of faith and that the adhikarī for upāsanā is the person who lacks this fullness of knowledge or fullness of faith. If this view were accepted, it would follow that such men as Vyasa who taught the churamasloka and the like and who, because of their piety, had fullness of knowledge and fullness of faith should be looked upon as incompetent for upisani. There is no evidence or pramäņa to prove that when they taught, they had knowledge and faith and having (later) become weak in intelligence and faith adopted upāsanā. There is no evidence in the respective accounts of their lives to sbow that though they were prupannas (with prapatti as their upaya) they practised upāsanii also for setting an example to the world. Even if this were adınitted to be a fact, the adoption of a dharma which is forbidden to a man for the sake of setting an' example to the world would be a sin so far as he is concerned and as the observance or adoption of the dharma is opposed to the mun's competence, it would not be a proper example to set the world right. (Sri Ramanuja) has explained in the Gitä Bhishyu that loka sangraha consists in a man choosing one of two ways of life (permitted for himself) as being easy of performance by others and beneficial to them, and adopting that way of life as an example to others in order to establish them firmly in it. A sannyűsin adopting the way of life peculiar to the house-holder and forbidden to himself is not setting an example for the sake of the betterment of the world (lokasangraha). This would be vnly the violation of the commandment (of the Lord). In the same way, the adoption by a prapanna of a dharna forbidden to bim, under the mis apprehension that it would be a forin of kainkarya is also opposed to bis competency: 

There is nothing wrong in a prapanna perforining those rites that are prescribed in the sāstras and that are not required for prapatti with the idea that they are (forms of) kuinkarya (service). 

29 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

475 

If it is maintained that as an anga or accessory of præpatti, men should give up all dharmas (rites and observances) appro. priate to their respective cistes (and asramas) and capable also of being perforined by thein, it would follow that they would lose the fruit viz, the kainkarya or service appropriate to their respective caste, rīsrama and the like, in the period after prapatti; (it would also follow) that they should give up also such dharmas as nod. violence and speaking the truth which are common to all and tbe showing of reverence to ācharyas and roam about like cattle, beasts and birds. 

It may be argued that dharmas which are of the Dature of refraining (from actions) and which are understood from probi bitory texts (such as do not kill ') are not activities calculated to protect oneself and are therefore not opposed to prahatti and that, owing to this what is intended here is only the giving up of such activities as are positive (pruvritti) (and not mere abstentions from activity). 'This argument, too, is unsound. Nivritti, abstention or renunciation, is also a form of activity arising from one's will or determination, and it too, may occur for the sake of protecting oneself as may be seen in the world and from the Vedas. (Prohi bitory texts in the Vedas presume that eveo abstentions are activities. Refraining from treasonable activities is often for the sake of protection of one's self from the penal code). 

If it be held that, on the strength of the injunction (vidhi) contained in parityajya), the prapanna should give up all dharias whether they be positive activities (pravritti) or absteu. tions from actions (nivritti) and that this is the real inteolion of the s'istras, then it would follow that the ancients who performed prapatti and those who are prapannas today have done and are doing what is against the süstras in performing different kinds of kuinkarya (pravritti) and in performing expiatory rites for offences (committed by them) (for what is forbidden should, on that view, be performed and no expiation would be necessary for it). These men who are propagators of the tradition of prapatti 10 accordance with the pramänas end who are also supremely 

476 CHAPTER 

compassionate could, under no stretch of imagination, be thought of as deluded or deceitful. 

It may be argued that this objection would stand only if the giving up of all dharmas (rites and observances) is enjoined (on the prapanna) for the rest of his life, and that it would not bold good, if the giving up of all dlarınas in their essential form (svarüpa) is considered as an anga (of prapatti) to be done only at the time of performing prapatti and if their resumption is pernitted after that performance. The answer to this argument is as follows:- " There is no need at all to enjoin the giving np of an activity or of an abstention which is not likely to be present at all at that time. If only such activities or dharmas in their svarūpa as are likely or possible at the time are enjoined to be given up, it would follow that prapatti should be performed after giving up such things as the following :-- residence in holy places sacred to Bhagavan, the tuft of hair, the sacred thread (yagnopa vita) and the wearing of the mark of the sect (pundra). 

Therefore the proper interpretation of the vidhi (if it be taken as vidhi) enjoining the giving up is this: "Prapalli does not require, as an anga or accessory, apy dharma or observance or rite which is required as an anga (such as harina) to uprisana (meditation) according to vidjüs'. 

ven in this view that parityajya indicates a vidhi or injunc tion to give up. the person competent for prapatti is one who is incapable of other upayas, or one who, though capable of other upayas, is too inipatient to endure the delay in attaining the fruit (which the other upāyas inight entail). If we take this view, it will not be agriost any of the pramūnas (viz those which enjoin the rites of the varias iod asramas, and those which enjoin bhakti yoga and the like). Former achiiryas did not discuss the point whether or not the giving up of all dhurmas in their essential forn is an anga of prapatti. Their discussions were confined only to the question of which words in the charama sloka respectively indicated the qualification necessary for prapatti viz. that of being 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

477 

destitute of otber upiigers and whicb words the idea that pripatti did not require (aoy anga or accessory). 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Soine üchuryus, who were conversant with the requirements of a sentence, thought that the charamu sloka speaks first (in purityujya) of the person competent for prapatti (as one who is unable to adopt other upriyas) and then declares by the word ekam we alone) that proporti as an upcya does not require anything else as angn or accessory. Others said that the charama sloka speaks first of prapulti pot requiring anything else as angu and then declares who the competent person is for the easier rpüya in the word vraju) by the suggestion contained in the word soku or grief (in mii suchun) (for the grief should be the grief due to the man's inability to adopt other mpiyas). (There was no discussion among these earlier cluir yas of the point whether prapatti enjoined the giving up of all dharmas (even such as those ordained for the varias and the äsramas). Thus the discussion was confined only to the way in which the words (in the sloka) should he construed, though there was no difference in the meaning as a whole, and the anthor of Sri Bhushya did not stop the discussion. What was (wrongly) iunagined as having been the subject of discussion by other people who did not know what had formerly taken place -- that was shown to be without any foundation by such teachers as Vishpuchitta. 

But it may be asked how the difference between those who are competent and those who are not competent (for praputti) could be justified in the face of such slokus as the following: "'l5is is the upriya for those who do not understand; this is also the upāya for those who know well: this is the upcija for those who want to reach (quickly) the shore beyond samsāra and this is the upāya also for those who want (immediately) to render con. stant service to the Lord", and "Hari is the only upaya to 13. Lakshmi Taotra; 17 - 100. 

14. Bhattar. 

478 CHAPTER 

those who do not know of other upüyas, either with tbeir ignorance or with their koowledge of such qualities of the Lord as His being the Lord (of all), and on account of intensity of bhakti". The answer to this question is as follows:- The «jnanam or ignorance referred to in the word (ajnirat) in Lakshmi Tantra and avidyātah in Bhattar's sloka is not the ignorance of such beings as cattle of what is stated in the sastras. It means only this much, lack of a clear understanding of such forms (of adora tion) as upasanas or ignorance, even in regard to prapatti, of subtle diceties or distinctions in it. The word vijānatiim in Lakshmitantran (to those who know) and deve paribrudatayi viditaya (with the knowledge of such qualities of the Lord as His being the Lord of all) refer only to the kind of knowledge which enables one to understand such things as upasanas or the kind of knowledge which enables a man to have a clear understanding of such things as the qualities of the Saviour, which is necessary for prapatti. It does not (certainly) mean a knowledge of all things, in general, for only the koowledge of the Savionr's quality of being the Lord of all is referred to bere. Even if a man has this know ledge that is essential (for upasana), when he is withont the ability to adopt that (upasana), he is one that is destitute of upüyas (akinchan) and has competency for prapatti, 

Here another objection might be raised, viz.," }ven if a man has ( the knowledge and) the ability, he should remain without any endeavour on his own part, koowing as he does, the Saviour's nature, for does not Sita say:- "If Sii Rama', who can destroy the hosts of his enemies, discharges his arrows on Lanka and takes me away from here, it will be the appropriate thing for him?". The answer to this is that (Sita's attitude ) would be an example of the pra. panna's later life (not of what he should do or should not do before prapatti). If this is not admitted, all süstras which enjoin the adoption of upāyas would be meaningless. 

15. Ramayana : Sundarakanda : 39 - 30. 

29 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

479 

Even when a man has both the knowledge of the other upaya (viz. upüsana) and the ability to adopt it, if he is too impatient to brook delay in the attainment (of the end), he may be competent for perforining prapatti, if he thinks that only prupatti would secure his object reco, (the quick attainment). This (that even the man who has the knowledge abd ability to adopt upūsana may adopt prapatti if he cannot lirook delay) is disclosed in the words: " This is the upüya for those who want to cross the sea of san süra"; "for those who want to cross', here, weaos "Those who want to reach the shore beyond samsura quickly (i, e) those that desire a quick removal of the hindrances that stand in their way. “This is the wpaya for those who desire tinantyan" (the perfect enjoyment of the service of Brahman) which is one's (lue on account of one's essential nature. Here also the meaning is 'those who desire to have it quickly' (i.e. those who cannot brook existence without that enjoyment. 

Having these two in mind, Bhattar says, "by the intensity of their bhakti." Here bhakti does not signify bhakti yoga, but 'intensity of the love (of the Lord)'. Intensity of bhakti or love means a state of inind in which the man would cease to exist if he could not have quick attainment. Though this is not the bhakti yoga enjoined for some adhikaris, jet some get that state of mind by the grace of Bhagavan due to righteous acts (in previous births). The man who has this state of wiod is also competent for prapatti. 

Therefore prapatti way be adopted by (1) those who do not know of other upüyas and who have a knowledge of what prapatti is in general (without a knowledge of details and distinctions); (2) those who have a clear understanding of prapatti and the other upāya (upāsana) but lack the ability to adopt the latter; (3) those who, though they have both the koowledge and the ability, cappot brook delay (in the attaidnient of the end) and cannot exist with out it. This man who cannot brook delay is also destitute of upāyas for attaining the end in his view at the time when he wants 

480 CHAPTER 

it (s0 he, too, is competent for prapatti). It is in consideration of this circumstance that (Bhattar) wrote:- " who know of no other upāya in the world". 

Vyasa and others who held administrative offices (under the Tord) could brook delay and were also capable of the other upüya (i.e.) upūsana. Therefore it is that they adopted upüsana and not because they were wanting in knowledge or in faith. (Those who hold adıninistrative offices inust serve their full period before thiokiog of attainment.) 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

(If it be asked, "Why is it said in some places) that a man adopts upasanu owing to weakness of intelligence?" the answer is as follows):-" When a man is incapable of an upaya which is extremely difficult of adoption and yet adopts it because of an obstinate desire, the ignoring of the easy upaya should be con sidered as being due to weakness of intellect.” Or it is proper also to explain their adoption of the difficult upüra as due to their unfitness for prapatti (owing to their lack of faith in it and the like.) This is not the explanation in the case of Vyasa and others (adopt ing upisana), for they remove all the doubts of others (and cannot be considered as wanting in knowledge or faith). 

Since in this manner the competency of a man either for trpaisana or for prapatti is determined, both the sõstras (those of upisana and those of prapatti) have their own respective purpose. 

The difference between the two adhikäris in regard to the rites and observances of their caste and disrama is only the difference of the purpose for which or the thought with which they are perforiped. It is true that, in the case of the prapanila, the perforipance of any rite or observance will prevent the attaioment of his eod, because, like the Brahma missile, it would cease to have any effect, if any other rite is performed to attain the same end. But if these rites are performed for their own sake (without the desire for any fruit) or for such things as the glory of Bhagavad or 

29 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

481 

the welfare of Bhagavatas, there is no impropriety (and prapatti would not lose its efficacy). 

But it may be asked by sonie:-“Even if it is admitted that the giving up of the dharmas themselves is not enjoined, it is possible that purityajya ( having given up) may mean the giving up of (only) the thought that they are upayas. (The answer to this question is as follows:) "In those tests which refer to the activities of the prapanna after the performance of prapatti, it may be held rightly that what is ordained is the giving up of the thought that these activities are upayas. But the charama-sloka is a text which enjoins an upuyu (before prupatti) and not what should be done after it, and the word parityajya occurs there, Therefore this interpretation would result in the injunction that these dharmas in their essential form sbonld be performed as angas or accessories to prapatti, but without the thought that they are upayas. If this vicw were accepted, then, the view that certain things should be performed after prapatti merely for their own sake (without any aim, object or the desire for any fruit) and as mere service (to the Lord) would become untenable. (For they would still be angas or accessories and coold not be an end in themselves ). Nor could there be, in that case, the absence of any requisite or accessory dharma which is said to be the anique feature of pr«patti Thus this upaya would cease to be within the competence of the man destitute of all upüyas. This is how it would result. Tliere is no need to enjoin here the giving up of the thought of their being upayas in regard to those dharnas that are not repüyas. So the performance of those dharmas which are upuyus without the thought that they are upayas would only be the adherence to such upciyas as the old püsanas. If it is maintained that the word parityajya means the giving up of the thought of their being upayas, then there would bave been no need to reconcile the conflicting statements about the ordinance con cerning abandonment and that about performance by saying that the difference is due to tbe persons competent for each of them, It is only if the text is held to enjoin the giving up of the dharmas 

482 CHAPTER 

themselves, there would arise any such conflict. If it is held that the adoption of karma, jnana and bhakti, but without the thought that they are upayas is an anga to prapatli, there would be no essential difference between the bhakta and the prapama. The difference would only be pomipa) . ) the man who bas bhakti as the main and independent means and prapatti as an accessory to it could be called a bhakta and the man who adopts prapatti as the inain and independent means and bhakti as an accessory to it wonld be called a prapanna, but both wonld perform the same dharinas and there would be no difference in their action. 

It may be argued that, in regard to accessory activity, there Deed not be fullness or perfection of performance and that some short-comings might be allowed therein ; but this argnment is not sound. Has it not been stated:-"A rite or observance performed for the attainment of a certain frnit will yield the desired fruit, only when all the accessory rites or angas are duly performed?" (Part Mināmsā). 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Thus if it is stated that the alarmus themselves in their essential forn should be given up, even the rendering of service would beconie an offence. If it is said that what is to be given up is only the thought that they are uspiyas, then the dharmas in their essential form would become an anga (of prapatti). 

It is only those who have torgotten the episodes of Kakasura and the like that world mainisin, as angas of prapatti, these 

harınas without the thought that they are upāyas and that the person is himself the doer of the action and its beneficiary (for the doership and the benetit are God's). 

We have (also ) heard that, by a single performance alone of prapatti far removed from any other dharma, the ancients obtained at once what they desired. . 

* NOTE: Kakasura performed prapatri (to Sri Rama) without any of the rites due to varna or asrama.

If it is inaintained that the angas of blakti yoga which might be presumed as necessary also for prapatti are declared to be no necessary for prapatte and as being no augas to it, the potency of the upiya (prapatti), wbich is equal in might to the Brahma missile, becomes well established and the rendering of service and 

the like will also become appropriate. 

Therefore the view that here (in parityajya) the giving up of all dharmas, (rites, observances and the like) is enjoined (for prapatti) and the view that what is enjoined to be given up is only the thought of their Icing upüyas and the thought that they are argas to it -- these views conflict with such sästras as ordain the observance of the corumandments, with the sustras nbich state that prapatti does not require anything else, with the tradi. tional observances of former üchäryas and with the code of conduct followed by virtuous mea in former times who had become prapannas. Thus owing to the objections pointed out so far, the giving up of all dharmas is not an anga to prapatti ; nor is the performance of these dharinas in their essential form an anga (without the thought of their being upriyus or angas to prapatti), because as has beeu stated before, praputti does not require the performance of any other dharma. Therefore this injunction or ordinance about giving up' (traga) has, for its purport, the stateinent that prupatti does not require any (aid) from any other alarma. 

To make this denial, there must be a wrong presumption of soioetbing that has to be denied. If it is asked what dharnas (rites, observances and the like) are presumed (wrongly) as being reqnisite and are then stated to be unnecessary (the answer is as follows) - In the vidyās or fornis of ineditation (upäsanas) t'njoined in Vedanta, some of the accessories which appear as angas in certain vidyas, such as the rites, duties and observances of the varnas and the asramas and also such things as meditation on the route to moksha are required also in other vidyös or forins of meditation. So also there may, at first, be a (wrong) presump484 CHAPTER 

tion that in nyüsavidyā too, these inigbt be required as accessary. To correct this presumption, here (in parityajya), these dharmas which might be thought of (wrongly) on the analogy of upūsanas as angas (to prapatti) are not required for it. This is the right interpretation of the text here. 

Though these dharmas capoot be considered as accessory aids (to prapatti) as they are stated to he for uprisana in Brahmcı Sutras (3.4 -33), yet as stated in another siitrat (3 - 4 - 32), the karmas ordained for the different asramas have to be performed, as they are enjoined as ordinances or commands; there is nothing to prevent their perfornuance by the prapanna (since command ments have to be obeyed as such (and for no other reason). 

CONCLUSION: 

Therefore, as neither the performance of these dharmas por their giving op is an anga to pruputti; to be without the desire to do what is beyond one's ability is a mark of competency (for prapatti). The performance of those duties or rites which are niitya and nuimitlikat and which are within the range of one's ability takes rank as were service consisting in the observance of & command, 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

It is only the thought or the will to do wbat is pleasing to the Lord that is stated (in the süstras) as an ange of prapatti, The action arising out of that will or thought is not an anga. The rites of the varìu and israma are the proper thing to do in virtue of their being the Lord's command and not because it is the consequence of the will or the thonghat to do what is pleasing to Him, 

If so, it may be asked: "What is the purpose or object of performiog those manifold and great acts of service which cannot be included among the commands to perform nitya and naimittika 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

485 

karma?" These cannot be included among any of the other upāyas for moksha (because they are not performed with the object of attaining moksha); por are they angas or accessories to prapatti, because it does not require any such angas or aids. The person does not perforiu them because of the fear that the Lord would be offended at their non-performance, por does he perform them with the desire that they would bring about, by themselves, extinction of his sins or the attainment of such fruits as svarga, cattle, children and the like. Neither does he perform them merely for his own delight just like worldly men playing dice and the like, nor does he perform them to please the Lord having seen, like the freed souls, by actual observation, what would be approved of hy Him. If so, why does he perform them, it may be asked. (The answer is as follows) - He proceeds to perform them because it is evident from the sästras that these acts of service have, for their fruit, the propitiation of the Lord (just like other fruits) As one in whose nature the quality of sattvam pre dominates, he acquires a taste for pleasing the Tord and follows the light shed by the lamp of the s'āstras in trying to give delight to the Lord who stands in varied relationships to him (ns father, mother etc.), in the saine way as he shows his love to his friends, 

children and the like. 

In this connection some may ask :- "In the case of the wise man who has made a complete surrender of all responsibility to the Lord of all, is not the criterion for deciding what should be given up and what taken up, the knowledge of his own essential nature (svarīpa?) So he is bound (only) by the knowledge of his own essential nature (to do or not to do this or tbat); why, then, should he follow the dictates of the sistras?". This question is improper, for, if it is determined what his essential nature is with the help of the s'āstras, then there is no other guide for him thap the sästras, until the time of his attaining mukti, to help him to understand what aims in life he should avoid as also the upāyas therefor, and what aims he should have and also the upayas for securing these aims. From the knowledge that he is sesha to the Lord and the 

486 CHAPTER 

like, it is just possible to know a few things that are appropriate to the sesha. The knowledge of one's essential nature cannot indicate, unequivocally, in what manner service shonld be rendered in order that it may please the s'eshi, and what upāyas should be adopted for this service. This beiog so, is one ignores the süstras and renders service with forbidden snbstances (like opium, say) or even among substances that are permitted, to render service with substances acquired unjustly and thus render service according to one's own sweet will and pleasure in ways opposed to what is enjoined in the s'āstras, then there wonld be no difference between reverential conduct and offence. Then since there is no criterion besides one's own's own taste, one might think of performing as service all that is considered as forbidden and therefore avoided by seekers after mukti. The author of Sri Blizslya has stated (in regard to the offering of food (havis) to Archi):- " Having "collected those things which are not prohibited in the sustras etc." Therefore the proper thing is to render such forms of service as are enjoined in the süstras as competent to the person concerned and subject to the dictates of the sistrus. The teaching contained in the sloka :- "To knows what onght to be done and what ought . not to be done, the only authoriy that you have is the sõstra. Therefore wbile you are here, noderstand the karma enjoined in the sustru just as it is” – this teaching is common to all ( what. ever their corupetency). Sri Alnvandar in his Grtirthasangraha says:-"Among these ekuintins ( who are devoted exclusively to the Lord), the wise map (jmni) is called paramaikinti, one who has supienie devotion to the Lord to the exclusion of all other interests. Ilis being alive is solely dependent on the Lord, To be united with Him is bis (only 1 delight; to part from Him is his (only ) pain. His mind is always with the Lord. He considers himself as an entity only becanse of his meditating on Hiin, of visiting holy places (sacred to Hiin), and of speaking of Him to others, of bowing to Him and uttering his sacred names. His

actioos are performed with his life-breath, miod, will and the senses all dedicated to Him. He performs all the duties pertaining to him and also practises bhakti inspired solely by love. He shonlu give up the idea of their being upüyas and place the upaya in the Lord without any fear". In these slokas what Alavandar meant by the words "inspired solely by love" was not that he should ignore the sristras. His idea was to emphasise the great inspi. ration arising from his love (of the Lord), whose s'esha he is, to perform those acts of service which he can coderstand only from the s'āstras, in order to give delight to Him. When these slokas are considered in relation to the man who practises upasanas ant the like, its aim is to show that these upāsanas are most pleasing to the person himself, that they are not the direct means of attain ing the supreme end, but are the means of winning the favour of the Saviour who is the direct means or upāya for obtaining this end, and that the Lord of all who is pleased by these upisanas stands, as the direct upaya for the attainment of this end. When the silokas are considered in relation to the man who has alopted prupalii as the principal and independent means, their aim is to show that, thongh he perforios the ordinances of nitya and nai. mittika karm and such other rites just as they are enjoined for blakti yogn, since he does not perforın them for the sake of other objects like starga and moksha and perforins then solely for pleasing the fiord, be has not adopted any other upaya (for moksher and has no other interests or object. (Their aim is also) to show that, as he is destitute of other payas, the Lord Flimself stands in the place of those i piiyas and rewards him with the desired fruit. 

Those who have not studied Vedanta might ask (in this connection:- Both these adhiküris (the bhakta and the prapanmu) are devoted solely and exclusively to the Tiord as stated (in the slokas):-" \Vise men do not worship Brahma, Rudra and other gods, for the reward that can he given by them is limited," "They

are "my devotees who have no devotion to other deities, who love those that are devoted to me and who seek me alone as their upüya" and "He who has attained the lotus feet of Vishnu should not worship other deities." If these two adhikäris should perform the rites and observances of their castes and asramas as stated (ia Alavandar's slokas! (viz., all the karmas pertaining to them and also bhakti), would not their supreme and exclusive devotion to the Lord be adversely affected in as much as these rites or dharmas are mixed up with (the worsbip of) such gods as Agoi and ladra?" Here, as explained in the Brahma Sutras (1-2-29), names like Agni may be considered, on the authority of Jainini, as directly referring to Brahman or Bhagavan for Agui and other such words may be etymologically derived as agram nayati. (He wbo receives the best part of the offering for Hunself) etc. There is no worship or contact with other deities, because they are like the sacred Dunes fonnd in Sahasraniima (etymologically applicable to Bhagavad). The author of Sri Bhashya has stated in his Nitya:--"Having pleased the gods, the rishis and the Manes with oblations and with the thought that they have Bhagavin as their inner self" etc. So it is perfectly in accordance with the sustras to perform these respective rites ineditating that the Supreme Being hus the respective deities as His body In "Pratardana vidya and the like we are taught in the sustras that the Supreme Being may be meditated on (or worshipped) in three forms: rone) in His own divine and essential nature, (two), the Supreme Being as having sentient beings as His attribute (or body), and ( three) the Supreme Being ay having non-sentient things as His attribute (or body). Though He is worshipped in these three ways, the worship is really to the Supreme Being and not to llis attributes (or budies) (namely . the sentient and non-sentient beings). In the same way here also, the bhakta or prapanna does not adore the gods, the rishis and the Manes, who are really attri. hutes or bodies of the Supreme Being.

As stated in the following slokas: "In alla vajnas, it is I that am worshipped and it is also I myself that rewards (those who perforın ther) with the fruits thereof," "It is Thou" alone that assumest the forms of the Pitris add the gods and receivest the offerings (kavis) (uade to the gods) and the offerings (kavya) made to the Manes in sriddhas" and "Those who* propitiate the Pitris, the guis, the Brahmios and Agai--they propitiate only Vishnu who is the inner self of all things"-as stated in these slokas, it is only the Supreme Being, who is the inner sell of all, that is the object of duration to the wise man. Therefore to the man who performs kainkarya or service according to the süstras with this knowledge, there is no association with other upuyus; there 19 10 4ssociation for him with other objects or purposes in acquiring the necessary substances for worship and in eatiog the food offered (to th?se gods). Similarly there is no association for him with other deities whon, obeying the injunctious (contained in the s'astrasi, he worships the Supreme Being having, for His attributes, sentient beings and non-sentient things. It has been said, “ He who worships as the Supreme Being any deity other thun Narayan't who dwells in his heart, who controls him and is his Lord and Master--he is usinner," " Je wlio considersøe Narayana as being (only) equal to other deities ---- he will stay in hell as long as the sun and the moon last”, and “One should oota" go near the places where Buddha, Rudra and the like are wor sinpped and so also near the cremation ground, near a corpse, near & forest and acar the capital city of a kingdom." As stated in thesa s lokas), it would be an sin for a paramaikantin if other deities are looked upon by him as the Supreme Being, if they are considered equad (to Narayana) and if he goes to places where other deities are worshipped, when these deities have nothing to do with his witya and naimiltika rites and observances. Since these deities stand in the position of bodies to the Supreme Being who is

the inner self of all and who is the object of adoration in these sites and observances (nitya and naimittika), there is no thought in the mind of the man (with supreme and exclusive devotion to the Lord) of these deities being the Supreme Self, of their being equal to Bhagavan, of their being independent of the Lord, of their being objects of adoration or of their being the dispensers of the fruits of actions. Therefore in the same way as by Prana, Vaisviinara, and the three worlds which are the attributes of the Supreme Being in the Vidyas or meditations called Vaisvünara vidya and the like. he is not affected, so also his exclusive devotion to the Lord is not (in the least) affected by such attributes as Agni (which are associated with these rites and observances, nitya and naimittika). 

While proceeding to state the adoration of Bhagavan to be performed by the prapanna in the day and the night, Vangipuram Naubi has described the dharınas of the castes and the asramas with their respective mantras (in the following passages) :-" (The prapanna) should spend his time by performing duly all the rites ordained for the time of the sandhyā, after sipping the water (üchamana) with the prescribed mantras; after this he should perform the homa to the sacrificial fires during the Agnihotra rites with the prescribed mantras and with sainit (fnel), ghee and other ench substances. He should do every karma at the time prescribed for them in the sāsiras". Then he says: "He should "perform, without being lazy, all the rites from the bath to Brahma yajna prescribed in the Vedas for his iisrama as fit to be done at doon", He continues : "Then he should perform the prescribed Vajna to the gods and to the pitris (Mines), after which he should eat the food offered to Bhagavan (wbich act is called anuyāga)". Bhattar and Kooratbalvan, too, in their respective nityas, have stated as follows:-- " With the vertical mark (Urdhivapuura) on his forehead, (he) should perform the rites ordained in the srutis, and

smritis as far as it lies in his power, with the thought that they form the adoration of the Supreme Being and then offer oblations of water (tarpanam)". Peria Jeer (Nanjeer) begins by performing obeisance with the words: "I seek the feet of Parasara Bhuttarya". By this be reininds us of the special tradition concerning the homage to be paid to gurus and the like. After this, he says “I will now describe the manner in which service should be rendered to the lotus feet of Bhagavan every day by men with exclusive devotion to him (Ekuiltins)”. He then says " (The Ekäntin) should sprinkle water on himself by uttering the mantra beginning with Āpohi and then sip water (achamana) with the utterance of the intrus which denote Bhagavaa; after this he should offer arghya to the Supreine Being who is in the sphere of the sun and then perform japa, meditating on Bhagavan with the niantra of Gāyatri. After the japa, he should offer praise to Purushottama. Oblations of water (tarpana) should then be made to the gods, the rishis and the piiris (Manes, who have Narayaon as their inner self." We see also that, in all families which follow the tradition of the anthor of Sri Bhashya, until the present day, weidings and upanayanas (initiation with the sacred thread) have been perforined in accordance with their respective (Grilyu) stītrus, (Apastaiba and the like) with the respective mantras denoting the respective deities. It is also well-known to all that the great vichiryas like Peria Nainbi performed yojnas (sacrifices) and the like in accordance with their respective sītras. Therefore in the case of those who follow the teaching of the author of Sri Bhishya, his disciples and their disciples, it is not proper to perforin any rites (like those of weddings) with the mantras in certain sumhitäs* following the doctrines of the Agamas (Pūnchariitra) which are prescribed specially (to those who follow theur). 

(*NOTE: Satvatam : Padmam: Jayakhyam, etc. these are the agama samhitas.) 

We have already shown in Sri Pancharātrarakshii (The Defence of Pancharatra) that the Pancharatra is of four kinds or 

492 CHAPTER 

systenus (Igama Siddhiinta, Mantra Siddharta, Tantra Sid. dhinta and Tanträntara Siddhanta) in accordance with the con petency and the like (ability) of the person concerned, that the principle holds good that what is not stated in any one of them should be taken from the others, provided there is no conflict or opposition and that, in all the four kinds or systems of Pancha riitru, the direct means or upiya of attaining moksha is set forth and that by every one of them. there is the attainment of mokslu, juist in the same way as to all the four sisramus there are Brahmat Vidyais (bhakti and prapatti) and that to every one of them there is the possibility of attaining moksha. It has also been stated there, at considerable length, that if a person were to perform all karmas or rites with any mantras of his own liking, ignoring what is enjoined in those sustras as the proper tning for each kind or system, he should perform expiatory rites (prāyaschitta) and the like. Therefore until the time of attaining mukti, there is no authority for rendering service or kainkarya (to the Lord) in any maoner other than what is ordained in the stāstrus as appropriate for each adhikūrī. 

Hence since even the prupanna is subject to the authority of the süstrus and shonld perform only such service as is perunitted or enjoined by them, the following (heretical) views which are opposed to the scriptures and the traditional observances (of the good) supported by right reason or logic are not to be accepled by those who desire to stand in sattuuni. (views such as the following): (1) Both those commands that are enjoined as positive rites or actions and those that forbid curtain activities should be violated ; (2) Both those activities and rites that are enjoined and those that are forbidden should be given up. (3) The rites and observances of the varius and visramus are dependent only on the bodies (of Brahmins and the like) and may therefore be given up by the person who has attained a true knowledge of the essential nature of his self (which is different from the body ). (4) They may be performed or may not be performed (5) Even if they are given up, no harm will result except the loss of the Lord's pleasure 

29 

MEANING OF PARIT YAJYA 

493 

(6) The only harn that would result in their being given up is the ill.will of society and other such (erroneous) views. 

It is true that, as for those in the asrama of the Sanayasin, to whom certain old rites and observances (of the grihasthüsrama) are forbidden and certain new rites and observances enjoined, (so also) for those who are Bhagavatas, as a consequence of their being snch, certain things are forbidden and certain new things are enjoined. But no karma or rite which has been ordained as com pulsory of performance should (on any account) be given up. For it has been stated :- "The man who does not perform the rites pertaining to the sandhyā is always impure and is unfit for the performance of any (other) rite. Whatever other rite or karma he nay perform, he will not obtain the fruit thereof”. As in the differences in the manner of performing the sandhyit meditation or worship that are found in the sūtras and the ditferent Dharma Süslrus (Mlanu, Apastamba and the like) those differences that are found in the different samhitüs of the Lord's Süstra (Pūrcha. rätra) and also such differences in the sandhyu meditation as are stated in the Itihasas and the Puranas -- these differences shonld be observed respectively by those who follow these respective süstras. Conduct like the following which is enjoined in the sāstras and the Ithihasas, Damely, "At the time of the ** parvas, one should pray to the deities for protection" and "One should bow in front of places where the gods are worshipped -- (conduct like this) is restricted in the case of the man who is supremely and exclusively devoted to Bhagavan (Paramaikantin) owing to the authority of the süstra (i,e. the only deity or God that he should pay homage to is Bhagavad). Therefore no siistra is violated. 

Such injunctions as the following :-"Thereforest the mantra called Ashtiikshara should be repeated at the time of the sandhya, by pure-minded devotees of mine always in order to purify their

selves", and "uttering the Dvaya always in this spanner with its meaping at heart" in the gadya - these instructions should be carried out without any conflict with the performance of the rites (sritya and naimittika) which are compulsory of performance and at such times as are left over after their performance, Naradi and others have also stated:-“The japa (namely, the repetition of Ashtīkshara) sbould be performed at such times as do not conflict with the performance of rites ordained in the sritis and the smritis." Vangipuram Nambi, too, has said: -" Having spent your time in performing the homa in rites like Agnihotra etc" Even in his last days, the author of Sri Bhishya stood up with great difficulty and offered the anjali of water at the time of sandhsya. Therefore giving up the rites of the varias and the asramas on the pretext that they are dependent on the upadhi of the body is opposed to such things as the traditional observances of the ancients. If this pretext were sound, since even such special forms of service (in temples) as the weaving of garlands and the lighting of lamps capaot be performed without the upüdhi (or conditioning factor) of the body, the senses and the like-even these would have to be given up (by the man who has realised bis essential nature (svarīīpa). If the perforınance of such services is desired, the external purity (üchüra) and the purificatory rites (samskürus) which qualify (a person) for such service, cannot be given up. 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS: 

Observing the restrictions concerning food, residence* (if the reading is graha) or receiving from the good achürya the mantras prescribed for the person, tooney, caste and the like, one should render service to the Lord of Lakshmi in accordance with one's ability and with no other aim or purpose. 

NOTE* :-One should live ncar Bhagavatas: 

tMoney should not be received as a gift from the unworthy, 32. Sri Ramanuja: Gadya :

Just in the same way as a chaste wife looks after her auspi cious thread, clothes and the like with the greatest care, the pra panna should preserve the path and manner prescribed in the süstras for the service of the Lord. 

The husband takes proper care of his wife either with punish. ment or with favours, respectively, when she loses her thread and thie like or guards there with care. So also will the Lord (his vievotee for giving up or performing the enjoined rites). 

To retlect on such things as the caste of devotees merely for the purpose of treating them with disregard will bring ruin; but if it is donc only for understanding the restrictions enjoined in the sristras, there is po harm io it anywhere, 

That is the reason why, in the süstras, Dharmavyadha Tnladhara, Sabari, Vidura and others are described only by their respective castes. 

Their conduct, too, as described in the Itihasas, was only in accordance with their castes; if there was* any exceptional circum stances (in their lives against the rules of their caste), it was due to the exceptional instructions or regulations. The wharmas or rites prescribed for a certain place, a certain period of time, a certain withikari and the like should not be adopted at a different place and a different time or by another adhiküri. 

Some (people) who cannot understand the purport of certain episodes (in the Itihasas and Puranas) increase the lila ruser which Bhagavan enjoys in Kaliyuga. " Daughters-in-law should be treated with regard and properly adorned by their mothers-in-law, their fathers-in-law, their husbands and so also by their brothers. in-law who desire to have varied prosperity. Those houses wbich are cursed by daughters.in-law on account of their ill treatment will fall into ruin as if pulled down by evil spirits". In statenients 

(*NOTE: Vidura was cremated according to Brahma Medha rites because an aerial voice ordered it.) 

496 CHAPTER 

like the above, the injunction about treating (the daughter-in-law) with regard has, on account of propriety, to be determined with proper restrictions in each case (the mother-in-law's regard is shown differently front that of the husband or the brother-in-law and so on). So also injunctions regarding the respect to be shown to devotees among mlecchas and the like bave to be understood with proper reservations and restrictions. 

These reservations and restrictions are established also by the practice of successive generations of men accepted on all hands as wise and virtuous. Therefore the performance of the Lord's service along with the observance of the regulations enjoined for the respective castes and īsramas is not opposed to the state of supreme and exclusive devotion to the Lord (parmaikantitva). 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Even the service rendered directly to the Lord of Lakshmi is surely divided by good men into two classes : valuable and worthless. 

That (service) is declared to be valuable service which is rendered by the nian who has done what he ought to do (ie the prapanna) with no other aim and for no other purpose (i. c. for its own sake) or for the protection of such persons as gurus. 

That (service) is declared to be of no value which is rendered for ostentation (or vanity), for injuring others, for preventing others from rendering service or for the sake of some gain. 

The Lord of all receives, with His fert, the service renderer by those have no supreine and exclusive devotion to Him and that done by those who have supreme and exclusive devotion to Him, with His head. This idea is expressed by Bhagavan Veda Vyasa in the following (passages ):" That which is offered to the gods and the Pitris (Manes) in accordance with the prescribed rules

reaches the feet of the God of gods. The rites performed by wise 114n who have supreme and exclusive devotion to Bhagavan - these Bhagavan receives with His head". 

The rites, mitja and naimittika, which are performed in this way as commandments of the Lord (äjna) and those valuable services which are rendered by a man for the pleasure of the Lord as those approved by Him (anujmui) - these have no connection with praputti and this is declared by the injunction contained in the word parityajya (having given up) (in the charuma sloka ). 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

1. Therefore one should not perform, for the sake of prapatti, those things of which one is capable, nor should one acquire, for the sake of prapatti, the ability or skill needed to accoinplish what one is incapable of. 

According to this interpretation ( of the word parit yajya in the Churuma sloka ), ūkinchanya or being destitute of upiyas which confers competence (udhiküra) for prupatti is suggested by the sentence which states "Do not grieve". If purityujyı, on the other hand, is considered as an anuvāda or expression of what has already occurred (nainely, the person being incapable of any upya), then, the word eka (10e alone) indicates that among those rites which arise from the Lord's command and those which are approved of by him, there is no connection between such of them as are perforined as being within the range of a man's ability and pripatti. In this interpretation, the sentence ma suchah (Do pot grievel mukes clear the qnalification (adhikūru) needed for prapatti wbich has already been expressed (in parityajya) and indicates also the manner in which the prapanna should conduct himself after the performance of prapatti (i.e.) being free from all vare or apsiety, 

498 CHAPTER 

There are some other ways of interpreting the word (pari tyjya) without treating the injunction regarding 'giving up' as having no authority : 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

2. What is asked to be given up may be stated to be the prevention of the vain effort to perform what one is not capable of or the giving up of such vain effort along with the shame or re worse due to one's inability (to do it in full). 

3 The word tyaga contained in parityajya may also be considered as preventing the continuance of the trivial desire to perforna (these rites) like a drowning man catching at a reed or a hlade of grass. 

4. In the Brahma Sritras, it is declared that any one of the vidyās (thirty two vidyās or forms of meditation described in the Upanishads) may be adopted at one's option, as all of them yield the same fruit. By drawing onr attention to it, the injunction for tyaga contained in parityajya may also be to suggest that pra. patti is like the Brahma missile, wbich proves ineffective if any other upāya is also adopted: 

(To suin up :-) The forms of injunction may be such as follows: 

1. To the man who proceeds to adopt what he is not capable of, it says “Don't". 

2. To the inan who is firri ly determined to do what is not in his power, it says, "Give up this determination ". 

3. If a inau were to adopt one of the payas (other than prapatti) which are left open to the option (of the aspirant to mukti), it says to bin that, by the principle of the Brahma missile, it would conflict with the effectiveness of prapatti. 

29 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

493 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Therefore the meanings of the words sarva dharman pari. tyajya (giving up all dharmas) which are approved of by the wise are as follows: 

(1) incompetence to do those things that are not within one's 

power gives competence for prapatti; and (21 being destitute of all other upiyas is a qualification for 

praputti; 

(3) the dharmas or rites being no accessory or anga to prapatti; 

(4) the prevention of effort in trying to do what is not possible 

for one; 

(5) the giving up of the desire to do what is beyond one's ability; 

(6) the indication of the principle of the Brahia missile. 

The interpretation (which is given by some) that what is asked to be given up is the dharınas or rites associated with other deities (than Bhagavan) is not objectionable, but as this applies to both the man who adopts bhakti or upüsuna and the man who adopts prapatti, this interpretation is inappropriate here (in the context specially relating to the prapania ). 

"The giving "up of upuyas" stated in such passages as the following :-One should give up the upayas and also the apuyas (those activities that are forbidden )" should also be interpreted in the same way 

(TAMIL VERSE EMBODYING THESE IDEAS :) 

"Do not endeavour to do what is beyond your power though you have begun the attempt; at the outset, it is the part of wisdom to give up the desire to do what lies beyond your ability; the path

of prapatti does not require any aids ; if you desire other aids for it, it will lose its potency like the Brbama missile ; you are not among those who have the full knowledge required to follow the path of bhakti or upūsana, which takes a long time to bear fruit; hence if you seek my feet as your refuge reflecting on your being destitute of other upāyas, I will pardon all your sins": Let us extol the great and good qualities of the holy Sri Krishna who spoke these words. 

THE MEANING OF THE WORDS MĀM AND AHAJI 

IN THE CHARAMA SLOKA:-- 

As stated in the contexte in the Gita, which describes the secret of ervatāra or incarnation and that in which Sri Krishna” declares Himself as (Purushottama), the primary aim of the words mām (me) and ahan (I) (in the charama s'loka) is to disclose (Bhagavad's) easy accessibility and His absolute independence (and omnipotence) respectively. 

SANSKRIT SIOKAS: 

He who knows the secret of incarnation to consist in its being real, in the incarnation continuing in its real nature (as Bhagavan) though incarnating in lower forms, in its being constituted of the (transcendental, substance called suddhasatvam in its being cansert only by Bhagavan's own will or desire (and not by karma); in its occurrence at a time when there is decline of dharma and in its being occasioned for the purpose of protecting the good -- (he who knows all this) will never be born again. 

This knowledge of the secret of incardation is required for the bhakta, who has prapatti as an anga, to complete and perfect bis upuya. To the man who has adopted prapatti as the direct and independent means, it reveals the easy accessibility of the omni potent and independeat Lord. The accessibility and ownipotence 

35. Bhagavad Gita : Chap. IV. 

36. Bhagavad Gita: Chap. XY, 

MEANING OF MĀM 

501 

which are declared in these two contexts are complementary to each other, 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Even if a person is independent and omnipotent, if he is not accessible, no one will seek him (for protection). Even if a person is sought (for protection) on account of bis easy accessibility, he cannot award the desired fruit if he is dependent on others. 

Towards one who is not independent, there is no possibility of rendering service, as the person rendering service, might think of acting as he pleases; and towards one who is not easily accessible, service might be possible though difficult, but as is seen in the world, it does not confer happiness or pleasure (on the person rendering service), 

The Saviour who is both accessible and supreme is not only merely accessible like a blade of grass but exalted (in status and pature). Though exalted and supreme, he is not inaccessible like Mount Meru, but easily accessible. Therefore He is both capable of being sought (for protection) and capable of being attained. In these two words sīm and aham, the eagerness with which the universal Saviour and Seshi is awaiting an opportunity for protect ing (the jiva ) is disclosed. 

Iswara who thus waits for an occasion or opportunity as stated in the passage :-- " The Lordexpects a prayer for protection," is ever favourably inclined saying, " When will these (jivus) pray for my help?" This attitude of His is suggested by the word mm (me. The word aham (1) shows His attitude of readiness to copftr. for His own glory, the desired fruit as quickly as possible saying, “ When shall I take back (and wear) (these jīvas) like jewels from which the dirt (prakriti) has been removed," 

Thus the charama siloka indicates by the words nām and ekan (ine alone) the Siddhopüya who does not require anything

else than the surrender of responsibility (bharanyāsa) with the prayer for protection performed according to the injunction. And by tbe words saranam vraja (seek as refuge or upāya) it shows, in the form of an injunction (vidhi) Sadhyopūga (namely, prapatti) which is the ineans of wipping His grace. Since the vidye called prapatti, which is here enjoined, is ordained as it ineans of propitiating the Saviour, it becomes an upayı and re sembles in that respect bhakti yoga. Iswara who is propitiater thereby is the direct means or upöya for moksha. What has to be understood as a distinguishing feature of this vid yii (prupatti) is its being an upāya which does not require (any aid or acces sory). All the attributes vecessory for this purpose are also sigui. fied in the words mām and ekan (me alone). 

By the word inam (me) which denotes the Savionr whose nature is indicated in such slokas as the following: "This Nara yana *who has the ocean of milk as His abode has now come to the city of Madhura leaving His bed of Adhisesha" by this word ( mm) are disclosed His being the Universal Saviour, His being the universal S'eshi, His being the Lord of Sri, Ilis veidy Nara yada (the resting place of Naras) which are revealed in Tiru mantra and Dunya, and so also the qunlities which can be inferred from them, namely, omniscience, omnipotence and the like, and, 30 also, such qualities as Ilis being supremely compassionate, His good nature (sausilya) and His love which are all the niarks of supremacy and accessibility. ('The word miim also discloses ), like the word having the dual termination, vis, charaan (the two feet) in Duijor, the divinely auspicious forw of Partha sarathi which suggests Loth His being the Supreme Being and His easy accessibility and which is onr auspicious refuge. Here these four squalities of His, namely, His love, I Jis being the Master, His good nature (sansilya) and His accessibility which are stated in such passages is the following :-- "O Thon that hast incoruparable attributes, Thon that ownest the three worlds, Thon that art my

Saviour! Thon that dwellest on Mount Veokatam, which is tagerly longed for by hosts of incomparable gods and rishis!" - these four qualities are revealed when Sri Krishna did not treat Arjuna's misplaced compassion and affection at the beginning with risregard, when He Himself declared : " There is 20% one bigher than I ", when He served as charioteer to Arjuna who addressed Ilim as “0, Krishoa O Yadava" and said " Drive my chariot and statiun it between the two armies" and when, at Arjupa's request, He revealed to Him His universal form immanent in all things and when later, as soon as he prayed to see His former delightful form as Sri Krishna, He stood before him once again an his chariotcer. Among the aforesaid qualities of the Saviour, the most importaat attributes that ire essential for the protection of those who seek Him have been briefly set forth in the Bhagavat Sistra: "Though Bhagavans who keeps all under flis control is both omniscient and compassionate, He expects & prayer for pro tection, since He has to conduct the course of the world of san Stira" anil in this stoka of the wise xichirya, “In the face of 'Thy omoiscience, omnipotence and compassion, my sins cannot bu*ar fruit." Among these three qualities, knowledge and night tre required in common for conferring punishnient and favour. l'he Lord's being the Master serves the purpose both of His cleriving the delight of Lilä from man in sainsira and His deriving enjoyment or bhoga in Vaikunta from the soul that has obtained mukti, So this attribute of Lordship cannot restraia the Lord's jnünu or knowledge and sakti or might so us to operate only in the work of protection. Compassion and its varieties (literally - branches) good nature, love and the like are solely responsible for the conferment of favours. The ancients who appreciated this distinguishing feature of mercy wrote is follows:--"O Thou "that art the Lord of Brubwa, the god of the gods!

"I will "oot believe that I could be saved by anything other than Thy compassion," "I look to" Thy compassion alone for salvation," "O Thou that, "in spite of having the glorious Lakshmi, art so full of compassion as to come and abide permanently in my heart", It is impossible" to protect me except with Thy holy compassion," "I will sweep.* Thy temple (and render such other service) being the recipient of Thy compassion and the compassion of Thy consort who dwells in the lotus," "Showing" Thy mercy with the exclamation 'Ha!

"O Lord of Hastigiri52! Those that are devoted to Thee by their qualities and actions with the knowledge of Thee -- it is Thy compassion which has made ther devoted to thee. I consider thać only that compassion is a source of strength to me who am destitute of upūgus." In these Ways, these ancients looked lipon (the Lord's) compassion by their refuge and considered the relationship of the s'eshy to the sesha and other qualities (of the Lord) as the obedient servants of compassion and became solely dependent on the Lord's mercy, Sita devi also said, in spite of the existence of other qualities: "kama", the descendant of Kakustha, extended his protection to him (Kakasura, out of compassion, though be deserved the punisb ment of being killed”.

wise and have a vision of me etc.," the primary importance of (the Lord's) compassion is indicated. Haciog (Arjuoa) with this primary quality so essential for protection and other attributes which are ancillary to it, Sri Krishna referred to Himself as him (ine). 

THE MEANING OF EKAM IN THE CHARAMA SLOKA: 

(1: While the siogular form mäin (ine) itself indicates the idea of alone' (ekum), the further use of the word ekan is, according to some, to disclose that He who is the object of attain. ineat is Hivuself the means or upāya for that attainment like the (celestial) kalpuku tree giving itself (to those that ask). Thus (these commentators) suggest that the use of eka after min is to suggest the identity of the object of attainment and the means of attaining it. This interpretation finds support in the sentence mim ekam cv«r® in a similar context :- " By all* means, seek the protection only of me alone who am the inner self of all beings, You will then have no fear of any kind." Since the word eva (only) is already present, it is but proper to seek some other piir puse for the existence or use of the word ekam in addition to only. (This purpose is the declaration of the oneness of the means and the end). 

(2) As against this, others say that the word ekam which has the following nieanings: 'chief', 'something other than', and 

there is no other than this', is, in this sentence, a mere synonym of 'no other' and means 'only' or 'alone' as in the slokas, “Those who seek me alone (and no other) as their refuge will surmount the insurmountable müyä" and "Seek the protectiou of Him alone (and no other)". In this way they mention that by emphasising the fullness of the qualities of the Saviour, one is made to understand that one cannot adopt an upaya by one's owa independence. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows:-"As 

54. Bhagavatam: 11 - 12 - 14. 55. Bhagavad Gita: 7-14 

506 CHAPTER 

the man adopts, for his owo protection, the means ordained for Him by the sāstras for propitiating the Lord), it is just possible that he might think of himself also as doing something for his pro tection on an equal footing with the Saviour wbo is the Siddho püya. Taking into account this possibility, the word eka denies that there is any upaya other than the Lord to make the upayas two. If it be asked how this denial is made, the answer is as follows: It is true that the jiva is the doer according to the pramäņas, for it is stated: - "He is the doer; otherwise the sāstras could have no meaning or purpose". Still this doership of the jiva is depen dept on the Supreme Being and is very limited (in its scope) besides being subject to bindrances. Therefore though he adopts the upuya, it is only on account of the Lord's grace as stated in the sloka :-- " Without Thy* compassion, 0 Varada, even the prayer that Tbou shouldst be my itpüya would not arise from me." When the Lord withholds His help and stimulation, the jiva cao. not even stretch out his limbs or bend them. Therefore he prac tises the upaya revealed by the Lord, with the help of the body and the senses given by Him and with His help and looks up to Him like the chūtaka bird for the desired fruit to be given by Him. So it is improper for the intelligent aspirant to mukti to consider himself, as another siddhopāya equal to the Lord, who is absolute ly independent of others and whose activities extend everywhere and can meet with no biadcances or obstacles. This is, according to these commentators, the purport of the word eka. (only He and no other). (3) Followicg this line of reasoning, they say also that the word eka (one) is used to prevent the consideration of prapatti which is sadhyopaya as being equal to Siddhopüya. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows:- Although like bhakti. yoga, prapatii too, has been enjoined as an endeavour to propiti. ate (the Lord), yet its purpose is merely to allay the displeasure of the Supreme Ruler who has innate compassion and other such qualities. For the direct attainment of the desired fruit, it is only

the will of the Lord who has, by His very nature, the ability and the compassion (necessary for protecting the jīva) - it is only His will that is the cause. He accepts the responsibility for pro tecting the prapunna who is absolutely destitue of upayas and Himself stands in the place of such more difficult upāyas as bhakti yoga. He expects only the vyāja (pretext or gesture ) of pra. patti accompanied by such things as the will to do what is pleasing to Him. This nyäsa vidyż does not require any ancillary rite or accessory and has this as its distinguishing feature. Therefore in this vidya, He is the only upaya to be prayed for as stated in the following passages: "Sarañagatik consists in the thought "I pray that Thou alone shonldst be wy upaya"; "I made Him the sosubject of the thought that the Lord should be my upāya. Even this became possible only by virtue of His compassion." "O Lorde that mad'st me consent and placed me beneath Thy feet I" As stated in these passages, to piace the mere vyāja or pretext vis. prapatti, which too was inspired only by Him acting as the upaya to place it on an equal footing with Him is not proper. This is the purport of the word eka (only · Do other). 

Taking into consideration the fact 'thnt sādhyopāya is a inere pretext or gesture (vyāja) in relation to Siddhopaya and is with. out any importance, sone (writers) exaggerated its insignificance by statiog that prapatti consists merely in (1) the knowledge of the relation of the sesha to the s'eshī (2) the mere knowledge that the Lord is the Siddhopaya, (3) nonresistance (to His grace) (4) mere acceptance or receptivity (5) the attitude of being different from acit or non-sentient matter (6) the activity of the septient being and (7) serenity of mind (8) an attribute of the adhikari. Ironi these (exaggerated statements) it is not proper to conclude that any of them is the real meaning of prapatti, for the pu port (of these exaggerations) is quite different. All these interpretations are opposed to the positive injunction contained in sarana vraja

(seek me as Thy Saviour). They would also lead to too wide an application (atiprasanga). We will explain how:- (1) & (2) If praptti were to consist only in the knowledge of the relationship of the s'esha to the s'eshin or in the knowledge that the Lord is Siddhopüya, then since this knowledge wonld of itself arise from the sentence or text (stating it), there would be no need to state it in the form of an injunction (ordaining 'know this "). If it be said that moksha might result from mere knowledge and without doing the thing enjoined in a vidhi or injunction, it would, as ex plained in Sri Bhishya and elsewhere (Vedūrthasangrahu), be opposed to the spirit of) the injunctions directing one to upāsanas; if it be held that the man who has a knowledge of the truth should thereby acqnire a different kind of knowledge called prapatti, then the essential pature (svarīpa) of this knowledge should be under stood in accordance with the texts or passages ordaining the dharine (s'aranam vraja), those that describe or deline its characteristics fthat it can yield fruits not attainable otherwise etc.) and those that prescribe the mapper of adopting it (anush tana) (the utterance of the Duaya and the like). If the statement that prapatti consists only in the acceptance of Siddhopūra were true, it would mean that the man should first know Sidu hopeira and then perform the action called 'surrender of responsibility (bharanyosa) for which he is competent and that this surrender should be preceded by the prayer enjoined in the vidhis or injunc tions, (3) If prapatti were to consist in nere non-resistance (to the Lord's grace), it would mean (a) that it was possible for him to resist Iswara owing to sperior strength. This would imply that Iswara is not omnipotent or (b) If resistance means resist. ing the Lord's grace by con, 'nitting an offence and inenrring punishment, it would follow that prapaiti is only a nieans of pr. pitiation (c) If resistance means resisting in means of one's own activity to protect oneself, then since there is no such resistance of the nature of activity in such states as pralaya and sushupti (dreamless sleep) and so also in the waking stake when the man is capable of action but does not act, Iswara would have to

509 

award mokslia to him. (4) If prapatti were to consist in mere acceptance, it would then stand on the same footing as upisana. There would be no difference between the bhakta and the prapanna. (5) If prapatti were to consist merely in being different from non-sentient things, it would be present even when the man acts against the will of God. This, certainly, could not be the cause of being saved or protected. (6) If prapatti were to consist in the mere activity of the sentient being, not only upisanas but other activities of the sentient being (like eating, breathing, etc.,) would lie the cause of salvation. There would then be no difference between prapatti and all these activities. If it be said that prapatti is what happens to a man of its own accord, there would then be no need for instructions (upades') concerning it. (7) If it be said that prapatti meaos serenity of mind without the purpose of obtaining any frnit, then it would vary with different individuals in accordance with their respective tastes. (8) If prapatti were a mere attribute of the adhikiri (and not something to be done), the word vrajı would be improper, for it lays down soniething to be done and there is no reference to any fruit or the desire for it (and the like). So it would not be proper to call prupulti an attribute of the adhikari.* If it were possible to condemn (the performance of) prapatti in these ways, althongh it is enjoined as something to be performed, it would be equally possible to condemn also upasanas and the like in the same mander In that case, the attempt to distinguish prapatti from upāsanas and the like (which was the reason for the argunent) would fail. If it be said that though this Siddhopāya (Iswara ) has accepted the responsibility of protecting one and is bent op granting the (desired) frnit, yet the man should consider that this acceptance is unnecessary, prapatti would then be a case of meditating on wbat is not true (drishti vidhi) (and it would not lead to moksha ). 

NOTE*: “He who desires svarga should perform Jyotishtona". In this sentence, the adhikari is seen to be one who desires a certain fruit, namely Svarga. 

510 CA APTEN 

If it means the thought that the acceptance by Iswara, too, is annecessary, it would be opposed to the idea contained in the words of the Lord saranam vraja (seek me as the Saviour). 

(NOTE*_Drishti vidhi eg. "Imagine the mind to be Brahman and meditatc on it". This kind of meditation would not lead to moksha.) 

Therefore Iswara is the object of propitiation and He is the Siddhopūya and is of great importance. Both bhakti and prapalit are ways of propitiation and are sadhyopāyas which are not so important. The aspirant to mukti) should be firmly established in either of these two, according to his competence. 

(4) It bas also been stated by some (ächiiryas) that the word eka is employed to indicate how the Saviour, who has accepted the responsibility, stands alone, requiring nothing else after the per formance of prapatti, so that there need be no adoption of any of the means (like upisana) prescribed for the attainment of the desired fruit. This may he explained as follows :--- If a person has performed prapatti as an ange and then adopts also upusanus and the like as angī, the Saviour becomes the upüya for the fruit desired. In the case of the man who adopts prapatti as a direct and independent inerny, being destitute of the other pros and impatient of delny, the game Iswara takes, upon This own qualities, the borden that lies between prapatli and Himself. As stated in the tollowing passages :- " l'hose who6 are incapable of bhaktı yoga and seek Thee as u püya they, too, pass beyond sansürat and reach Thy abode, Varkuuta", and "Thou hasta Thyself given Thy feet as the fruit of my attaioment and as the upüga for attaining it" - as stated here, the Lord limself, who is endowed with the qualities essential for it, stands as the Dispenser of the fruit desired, without requiring any ancillary rite or dharma. Therefore what is stated in the charama.sloka comes to this :- " Bear this in mind and seek Me alone for your salvation". (5) It is said by some that the word cka is used here for the porpose of making it

63. Tiruvoymozhi : 5-7 - 10. 

MEANING OF EKAM 

511 

clear that, when prapatti is performed to Him who is perfect in every way, nothing else is required except such as the will to do what is pleasing to the Lord. Therefore the Lord teaches that one should not introduce, into this, ancillary rites such as are requireri for the vidyās, under the impression that they, too, form upāyas for propitiating Him. The Lord's purport (in the sloka) is as follows --" Prapatti does not require any aids such as are per formed either because they are my commands or because their performance is approved of by me. When I become gracious owing to the performance of prapatti, I am bent on granting the desired fruit and stand as the one and only surety for this upāyu which is capable of being performed in an instant. In regard to the fruit of this prapatti, nothing else need be performed. I do not require any such aid in regard to my determination to save Thee". This announts to saying that, with the exception of such things as the will to do what is pleasing (to the Lord), no oiber auxiliury causes should be added on in the name of ancillaries to proputti. 

As stated (in the Saranagati Ga:lya " Thou that utterest the Duaya in some manner or other" and in Varadarīja stava. “By the mere words which state prapatti, I long to see l'hee - Thee that canst not be attained by bhakti", even though a man has not the clear understanding necessary for the full and perfect performance of prapatti, this upya will be effective even if it be adopted in a less satisfactory manner. Therefore there is certainly no need to seek ancillary rites or dharmas for this upāya. 

(It is true that) (in the Ramayana) it is stated :- " Thea Rama," the slayer of his enemies, spread kus'a grass on the beach, had uis arm shining like the body of & serpent for his pillow, folded his hands in anjali and lay down facing the east and expecting the arrival of the god of the ocean" and, likewise, in the story of Brahmadatta in the episode of Saptavyadha, “The kingit vas in great danger and sought with devotion Narayana, the chief of the 94.

gods, the Saviour and the Ruler over all, as his upaya with concentra tion of mind and fasting for six nights. The renowned king saw in his contemplation (dliyana) the Lord Narayana" But these ipcillary rites that are described in the Rimiyunu and Hari. wamsa) are not necessary for prapatti. In these two places, what is of importance is the ritual of sitting with the intention of star ving onto death and therefore the ancillary actions described there are proper. The same explanation holds good in the case of Hamaskara well performed. (There is no prapalti in all these cases). But in prapatti, no other requisites are needed except such is the will to do what is pleasing to the Lord - such as are stated in the chapters on Prapatti. We do not find any ancillary rites except such requisites, at the time, as the will to do what is pleasing. in the following instances of those who performed prapatti with only their being destitute of all updyjcs for their sole wealth. (a) Droupadi, (b) Damayanti, (c) Rakshasis, (d) Vibbishana, (e) Kshatrabandbu, (f) Muchukunda, (g) Gajendra, (h) the l'apdavas, (i) the gods, (j) Sumukha. (k) Trisankn, (1) Sanasrhepa, (m) Kirata, (n) kaka, (o) Kapota and the like We find that, by the instantaneous performance of mere prapatti without any other requisites, the desired fruit was obtaine:) by kuch of these that sought protection in the same manner, even in prupatti performed for the sake of moksha, there is nothing to prevent the attainment of the fruit at the desired time. This is the purport also of the words mü s'uchah (Do not grieve). 

If parilyajya is interpreteri to inean that there is nothing else required for propulli, this interpretation of the word oka inay be considered as confirming or en nhasizing this. (It need not there. fore be looked upon as redundant). Or the word ekı may be considered to have another ineaning, bamely, the idea of the upaya

and the upeya being the same. If the word eka is considered as stating that prupatti does not require anything else, then the word parityajya inay be considered as having the other meanings stated before. 

If it be asked why the word eka should be used as an adjective of the Saviour, when (properly speaking), it should quality prapatti (80 that it might mean that prapatti alone is necessary withont any ancillary dharmas), the answer is as follows: The words, miim ekan (me alone) are employed to show that, in the case of the man destitute of other upayas, these ancillary dharmus other than prapatti are in no way connected with the Saviour as the means of propitiating Him. (6) It is also stated by some (comentators) that, as in the first half of the sloka we find the words sarva dharniin (all dharmas) and in the second half the word sarva päpobhyo (from all sins), the word eka stands here as the counter-part or counter-poise to the world all. If this be admitted, then the gist of the charma sloka would be: 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

If a man is in despair because of his inability to adopt such means or upayas as will yield the respective fruits desired by hin, then, I myself (single as I anı) will stand for him as the respective means or upaya to enable him to secure that fruit." 

This statement may be explained as follows: "Whatever be the object that a man, whoever be may be, wishes to attain and whatever be the meaos or upāyas by which he cannot attain them and likewise, the attainment of moksha desired by the aspirant, which cannot be attained by karma yoga, jnisa yoga and bhakti yoga, all these fruits, can, O great sage, be attained by propatti. The place desired by the aspiraat to mukti is that supreme abode from which the man who reaches it never returos". As declared (in the passage cited above), when a man falls into grief because he cannot obtain any one of the fruits desired by him either because

SRIMAD RAHASYATRAYABARA

CHAPTER 

of ignorance of the means prescribed in the sõstras for acquiring the respective fruit, or because even wbile possessing that know ledge, he is unable to adopt the prescribed ineans, or because, while possessing both (the knowledge and the ability), be is too impatient to wait until the time when the fruit will be attained thereby - (when a man falls into grief in this way) the Charma-sloka declares to him, “ You need not go about in search of these means. I will myself be the only and sole upöya for your attainment of all these fruits, provided I am propitiated by the performanc: of prupatti. The Charma Sloka says, as it were :- " This single and sovereign pedicine will give you all the health which a larger pumber of other medicines may confer on you. It is enough, if, instead of falling into despair, you take this single medicine. This will cure all the ailments that can be cured by other medicines. After taking this medicine, you can enjoy all pleasures. Therefore you need not fall into despair thinking that you have lost your health and the pleasures." This is, as it were, the meaning of the Churama-slok«. 

Though the word eka stands as the counter-part of the word sarva (all) and qualifies the Savionr as He is post importani. being the Sidhopüya, yet it is tantamount to stating that prupalli alone is enjoined as the single dharma in the place of all other dharmus, as in the phrase " by nyasa alone" From this it follows that even those who desire the three eods (other than mokshu (viz). (dharma, arth and kisma) my perform pruputti to Bhagavan for securing them. So it is not proper to have any contact with other deities except as they fignre as attributes to the Lord in the performance of the nitya and imittika rites, as stated in such slokas as the following:-"I am propitiating Hiin from whom, O lodra, yon have obtained your position of lordship. I will not adore you. Here is my anjali to you. You may strike me with your thunderbolt or abstain from doing so. I will never adore any one but Govinda."

515 

Even those who seek other upāyas for attaining moksha (like bhakti yoga) may perform prapatti in order to get rid of the hindrances in the way (of those upayas). Prapatti is suitable in the case also of those who want to get rid of obstacles to the attain. inent (of Bhagavan ) vix, sias and this is declared bere (in the charama-sloka) to show that it is capable of securing any fruit that may be desired (by one). The idea that prapatti will destroy the obstacles to the upayas for attainment (namely, sins) is conveyed (by Sri Ramanuja) in bis Gitū Bhashya in his second interpretation of the sloka). In the Gadya, he has declared that prapatti will help to get rid of the hindraaces to the attainment of Bhagavan It does not mean that, in those two places, Sri kimagujr expresses one of these two ideas in disregard of the other. Both passages illustrate the potency of this upery (pru. patti) which cın secure all desired ends. The pranavan (aum) enters into the body of another inantra, viz. namo Nariyaņāya as il part thereof and yet is itself an independent mantra, So also this prapatti forms an uniga to bhakti in the case of others. This is evident from the anthority of the texts. That bhakti and prapatti stand as alternative upriyas determined by the comu petence of the persons concerned is evident from such passages as the following: "I am capable of being attained 0, Thou of great wisdom, either by deep bhakti or by prapatti on the part of those who desire to render service to me, I cannot be attained by any other means ". 

(There is a well-known sloka which says):- "A man attains moksha either by right knowledge, or by death in the waters of the Ganga or hy namuskura well-performed or by bhakti". In such pussiges th:ize that are direct means of attaining mukti are stated along with others that are not direct but only auxiliary. This is only a way of exaggerating the importance of these indirect weaps.

CONCLUSION IN REGARD TO THE MEANING OF 

THE WORD EKA 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Six meanings have (thus) been pointed out by acharyas for the word eka. They are (1) the identity of the object of attain ment (Bhagavad) and the means or upāya for that attainment (2) the denial of one's own importance (i. e. of the jiva's works); (3) prapatti being only a mere pretext or gesture (vyāja). (4) the absence of any relation or connection between prapatti and other upayas; (5) and likewise, the absence of any relation or connection hetween prapatti and the angas or ancillary dharmas (karma yoga, etc.) of other upāyas (like bhakti) and (6) prapatti as a single means of securing all desired ends without any distinction whatsoever. 

THE SAVIOUR IS BHAGAVAN WITH SRI AS HIS 

ATTRIBUTE: There are some commentators who state that the meaning of the word eku (a single ope) declares that the Saviour is only one (namely, Bhagavan) and that Sri has nothing to do with salvation). But their contention does not stand to reason. Just as qualities and forins qualify the Lord as His attributes, so also Sri is an attribute of His (inseparable from Him). She is the ruler over all beings' and is dear to Bbagavan and is declared in the srutis as sharing in His duties and as ever bent on protecting those that seek her help. Though it is stated (in the Chaindogya Upanishad and otber Vedic texts) that the material cause of the Universe is only one (sat), yet other things that are requisite as material causes are understood its existing as His attributes (viz. cit and acit in their subtle and unmanifested forms) on the authority of the pramāņas. So also in this context, Sri shunld be understood, although not distinctly stated. Even when a single form of upāsana or meditation is enjoined, the qualities that are connected with the object of meditation enter also into it. Similarly though a single deity is enjoined as the Saviour to be sought, Sri,

who is IIis attribute, should also be considered as being associated with Elim (in the act of salvation | The Siddhopaya (namely, Bhagavan ) is (of conrse) single bat His qualities remain with Hiin though not explicitly stated).

There fore, on the anthority of many Vedic texts and Sytritis which cannot le stated to have some other purport, the siogle one who is to be sought as the Savionr is the Lord with His attribute Sri who is His consort. 

THE MEANING OF THE WORD SARANAM IN THE 

CHARAMA-SLOKA: 

The meanings that have (already) been given to the word s'aranani occurring in Duayan (on p. ) should be borne in mind in regard to the word saraqan employed here in the charuma-sloka. This prayer for refuge or upüya (saranam though taught to Arjuna, should be considered applicable to all ind this is evident from the* Svetäsvatara Upanishad and from Sri Ramanaja's words in the (Saraṇāgati) Gadya: "O Thou that art the Saviour of all beings in the world ignoring the differ

ences that may exist aipong those that seek Thee". Similarly in such passages as the following :- “Those Brahmioses who know the first part of the Veda and those people who understand the meaning of its latter part declare that the Supreme Being, Sri Krishna, is the ever-existing dharmu or upaya ", " The greatío and emiosat Rishis say that Thou art the refuge and the Saviour of those that have sought Thy protection". "He is the "Yoga (upüya) and the one who leads those who know bhakti yoga to their goal". and "Bhagavan 71Awhom the wise call the eternal means (upüya) and the goal of attainment" -- (in such passages ) also, since there is no limitation of ineaning, it has to be understood that the Saviour is for all. The only reqarsite for seeking Hun as the Saviour or Refuge is that the person should be destitute of any other refuge or protector. 

THE MEANING OF THE WORD VRAJA: 

The word vraju also, like the word prapadye (in Dva ya ) enjoins self-sgrrender with all its auxiliaries. In the word (prapadye in Dunya), the first person is used, because it is the thought or neditation in the mind of the inun who perforins prapatti. Here (in the charamasloka) it is ia the second person, since the injunction is addressed to the man (Arjuna) who stands opposite to the Lord (i.c.) Sri Krishna) saying: "I am" Thy disciple and (it is only fitting that) Thou shouldst order me to do what is right". Auxiliaries like the will to do what is pleasing to the Lord are also indicated here and may be found suggested in *suitable words as in Dvaya, There is a ( well-known) principle which states: “When an action is enjoined in the sastra, a single performance of it satisfies the requirements of the süstra".

upāsana bowever, is an exception to tbis general rule because it requires frequent repetition. But prapatti is no such exception (and hence a single performance will quite do ). This stateinent is confirmed also by such words as the following: -"To the man who performs prapatti only once and says "I exist for Thee " - to that inap I grant freedom fron fear from all beings. This is my vow". To the man who performs bharanyāsa (the surrender of responsibility) to the generous and omnipotent (Lord), there is no reason for delay in the attainment except his own desire. Therefore in the case of this nyasa vidyā, the peculiarity is that it arrests even the consequences of past karna which have already begun to operate (priirabdha karma). 

In this connection some (commentators) ask "An action maybe enjoined for perforinance only by a man who has freedom of will and action, How can an action be enjoined (in the word craja) for performance by one who has been taught as being absolutely dependent (on the Lord) in the Vedanta and other sästrus treating of the self and in such as the moolt niantra? This (question) is the result of an inadequate runderstanding of what is meant by complete dependence on another the Lord). As deter 

other wise the sõstras which enjoin dharmas would have no purpose or meaning", and " The doership (of the jiva) is depen. dent on the Supreme Self, for the sruti says so". Since the jiva is an agent or doer subject to the will of Bhagavan, there is notbiog to prevent an injunction asking bim to do something. 

Just as nonsentient things (acit) like ether and fire bear the attributes respectively of sound and heat created by Iswara, the jiva', absolute dependence on Iswara consists in bearing this burden of free will (and responsibility) (granted to him by Iswara). If it be maintained that he has no responsibility at all as a doer or agent, it would be like the beresies (siddhanta) which attribute

doership (respectively) to prakriti and avidya (Sankhya and Advaita). If (on the other hand) it be maintained that the jiva's doership is dependent only on bilmself (and on nobody else), then since it would resemble the heresy which does not admit the existence of one who is in supreme control of all selves, it would be # form of atheisid, If it is held that the doersbiy which comes from the will of the Lord is merely the state of being the knower, there would be no such thing a9 a desire for the ends of life (purushārtha) and the eodeavour to attain them. It it be held that apart from the knowledge and the particular form of knowledge called desire, there is no such thing as effort (or mental activity), it would be impossible to adopt any means for securing objects that are tangible or intangible and for rendering service for its own enke. Therefore it has to be admitted that the self has these three (attributes):«-knowledge, desire, and effort (knowing, feeling and willing). Among these (three), desire and effort are only different niodifications or states of knowledge and this may be upderstood from the principle of logical economy *adopted by Sri Ranvapuja in his Vedārthasangrahu. 

l'he doership or ayuntship which consists in being the sent (israya) of an action (or the place where an action takes place) is a common attribute of both sentient beings and non seotient things (for the latter also move about and undergo changes). But the sert (usraya) of an effort or endeavour (prayatna) is (an attribute) peculiar to septicot beings. Effort or endeavone (prayatna) is a form of knowledge or will that is the cause of sti mulating one to exercise the body (the senses and the like). When one is the seat of mere knowledge and of were enjoyibent (bhogar), there is only the doership which consists in being the seat of such action as is common to sentient beings and non-sentient things.

called 

Olt whina'y the 

When & person is stimulated by his will to act in & particular manner, he becomes the seat of endeavour or effort (prayatna) and is a doer of that particular form. It cannot justly be maio tained that this form of doership is found only in rendering kain. karya or service. Even in this case, the man must have adopted an upaya with a view to attaining the end called the love of the Lord. If all this is admitted, it is only the doership that takes the form of ao endeavour or effort which would lead to bondage - it is only this form of doership that should be avoided. If it be asked what that form of doership is, the answer is as follows:- Iswara has given the jiva such qualities as knowledge and ability and also such things as the senses and the body. He supports the jiva and stimulates him (to action). He enjoys also the fruit of (that) action. When He is thus renderiog help (to the jīva), if the latter should consider himself as being ditferent froin this and if, even when be considers his position in the right spirit, he adopts an upiya for some (worldly) pnrpose - the endeavonr would lead to bondage. Even bhakli and propalli would certainly lead to bondnge in the case of the man who perfornus them for securing other ends (than moksha). Therefore just like the doership in the state of attain. ment (multi) of the man who longs for rendering service to the Lord by virtue of his very nature and with no other purpose, the doership in the state when he adopts an upaya (for the sake of mukti and service) is not improper. The doersbip of varied forms of service (to the Lord) in the state of attainment (i. e. mukti) results from the selfs owo longing (to render service) combined with the varied desires of the Lord (wbich have no connection with kurma). The doership in the state of samsāra is of different kiods corresponding to the conditioning factor (upādhi) in the forms of sattvani, rajas and tamas wbich have been evolved in accordance with the past karma and by the will of Iswara. That doership wbich results from rajas and tamas and 80 also from that sattva wbich is the cause of attachment to other interests (than moksha) - that doership leads to bondage. That doersbip (on the other hand) which results from the form of 

522 (HAPTER 

superior sattvam which creates a longing for he attainment of Bhagavan -- that doership leads to moksha. In the state of mukti, the doersbip will bave no connection at all with any of these three qualities. 

Therefore between the tests which state that the self is not a doer and the texts which state that the self is a doer, there is no conflict, since it is possible to discriminate wherein it hils doership and wherein it has no doership. If it be az ked how this conld be understood, the answer is as follows:- The texts wbich declare that the self is not a doer or agent have, for their purport, the truth that the doership of the self which is dependent on Iswara and on the qualities of prakriti (sattva, rajas and tamas) should not be considered as independent of other (forons). The texts which declare that the self is a doer or agent have, for their purport, the truth that, of the jnina or knowledge and its particular forms called desire to perforin and effort' which have come to him in accordance with such things as the desire of Iswara, the jiva is hitnself the seat or äsraru. This conclusion has been taught clearly by the Gutachuiryu Himself in the slokes beginning with the following --" It is ascertained that when a man does any action with his body, speech or mind, there are five canses that contribute to that action, vix, the body, the self, thu senses, the vital breath and fifthly Divinity or duitam" In that context the Divinity that is called the fifth (canse) is Purushotama When Prrushotama stimulates the jiva to perform in action, lle is called the karayiti or one who causes that action, He is (also ) called the kartī or doer in regard to those actions like the awarding of the fruit ( to the jiva) and the creation of the world. When He does not prevent the senlient being from performing an action, He is said to be indifferent. Since Ile permits it, He is said to be anumantü (i. e.) one who acquiesces. As Iswara, sometimes, acts like an expert porter who carries a heavy veight to help an apprentice who can carry only a light burden, He is also said to co-operate (with the jīva ) (sahakürī). In such things as the

MEANING OF VRAJA 

523 

creation (of the woi kl), since differences like gods and men are due to the conditioning factor (upādhi) of their respective past karina, Iswara is declared not to be the doer as stated in the sloka: "The fouri castes were created by me in accordance wtih such qualities as sattvam that are found in jīvas and also with their past karma. Though I perform the act of creation, I am not the real cause nor am I tainted by it." Thus from Iswara who has the common and general doership of all things without exception, the jiva acqnires the power to make an effort and act in accordance with his own will. Therefore it is evident that the jiva is fit to be directed to do a thing and the word vraja may justly enjoin the performance of an action. 

Since the durma called saranagati can rightly be enjoined for performance, jnst like such things as blakti, the stateinent of Tirukkurnkai Piran Pillan (the foremost of the disciples of Sri Ramanuja) that the good we do for ourselves is like wilk that is Lought (in the market) and that the good that comes from Iswarı is like mother's milk shonld be understood to mean that we should remember that bheiti, prapatli and the like result (from the grace of) (tod and that the jiva is solely dependent (on Iswara).. (It does not mean that we are not right in performing blakti or prapalli and sliould leave everything to God.) 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS: 

He who states that the texts wbich declare bhakti to be an upaya are only for the purpose of creating faith in prapatti is undermining faith in every svírstra withont directly appearing to do so. 

Bhakti as an upaya has been compared (by some critics of it) " to water from a sacred river contained in a pitcher but mingled with a drop of liquor". But this comparison or simile would hold good only when egoisia is mingled with (bhakti). The same condem.

nation would hold good in the case of prapatti also, when it is mingled with egoism or ahaukāra. 

It is stated by some that Alavandar begs, in the following sloka, forgiveness for baving performed prapatti - "Io consideration* of iny grandfather, Nathamuni, and ignoring what I myself have done, vouchsafe unto me Thy grace." Here Alavandar is not seeking pardon for the prapatti which he performed in accordance with the süstras, on the ground that the performance was an offence. He is seeking pardon for any trace af egoism (ahanküra) that might have been present in him and no njore than that. If it were for having performed prapatti, he should beg the pardon (of the Lord) for having shown reverence to previous acharyas, for this, too, would be an offence, being an action of his. Thus there would be no end to the making of apologies (anuvasthi (i.e.) infinite regress). If it is argued that this second begeing of for giveness is both for itself and for other offences, it might also be argued that the previous performance of prapatti is also begging forgiveness for that action and for previous actions. If these fallacious arguments were adopted, it would follow that the ancients, too, signed in performing prupatti and that it was not proper to show reverence to them. So the reverence shown in this stotra (by Alavandar) (to his grandfather etc,) at the beginning and at the end is either for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the prapatti done here or for removing any defects in the per forniance. As in this reverence shown to ächāryas, in prapatti and the like also, the doership that is subject to the will of another (viz Iswara ) is no fault. There is a (wrong ) view that since the doership of the jiva is subject (to the will of Iswara ), the self bas no real doership and therefore if a man knows this real nature of his (that he is not a doer), Done of the forbidden actions that might be performed by hin will leave any stain on him. Tbis

MEANING OF VRAJA 

In the upanishads, it is stated that the aspirant to mukti shonld be like a child. Some writers argue from this that he might act just as be pleases (doing even forbidden things). 'Being like a child' means 'remaining without revealing his "greatness' and this is established in the sūtra “Without revealing his greatness) for this fits in with the vid yä” (and pot behaving in a childish manner.) (The Gītā says :-) 

"To those that shave not renounced their doership and the fruit of their actions, the fruits of their karma will (certainly) follow and they will be of three kinds, what is undesirable, what is desirable and what is partly desirable and partly undesirable. These consequences of karmu never affect those who have renounced." und " He "who, while performing an action, does not think that it is done by him and whose mind has no attachment to the fruits of thut action -- . he does not slay any one even though he has slain all those that live in these three worlds"'These passages do not refer, as shown in Gutu.bhiskya to sins committed deliberately ifter the replaciarion. Otherwise they would conflict with inany instrus. Further the word "thongh he has slain" apply to what is done in a righteous War. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

The contention that like a potent medicine which is taken now acting like a cure for upwholesome things that may be done in the future, prapatti will destroy any sins that might be committed after its performance - this contention is disproved by huodreds of texts in the srutis and the stritis which are directly applicable to the prapanna and are not sublated by other texts. 

In such slokas as the following, Manu and others, too, pres cribed the conditions under wbich transgressions may be permitted: " When there is a real fear that want of food might cause death, 

79. Brahr.): Sutras : 3-3-49; 80. Bhagavad Gita: 18-12

526 CHAPTER 

if a man eats food obtained from wherever it was possible, he will not be tainted by the sin thereof, in the same way as mire does pot stain ether (äkiis'a)" "At a tiipe" when there is a fear that want of food wight cause death, the man that eats the food obtained by him, whatever the source might be, will not be stained by the sja thereof, in the same way as water does not wet the leaf of the lotus." That this rule applies equally to the man who knows or ineditates on Brahman is seen stated in the Stitra which says, "At a time when death is feared ( owing to starvation ), the man (the ruan who meditates on Brahman) may eat any food, what soever, for the sāstras say so ” and this is taught there with the help of an illustration. Therefore the view that the self is not a doer and that it is entirely dependent (on Iswara) and hence will not be stained by any sins committed after prapatti though they are deliberate and that no further prapatti need be performed (for their expiation) - this view is opposed to our siddhuinta (Sri Ramanuja's doctrine ). 

In this context some ( commentators) explain the meaning of vraja otherwise ((i. e. that it does not enjoin any action) and state that to the aspirant to mukti, there is no upiya to be adopted except the knowledge of relationship that is learnt from the siistrus to exist between the jīva and Iswara. They find support for this view in the following slokas without comprehending their real purport. The slokas are:- "The self is the propertyes of Bhagavad. He who considers his self as belonging to himself, is a thief of the self. Is there any form of sin that is not committed by him?" " Bhagavad controlses all beings in the universe from within the sphere of the sun and He is the ruler over all. He is within your heart and if you have no quarrel with him, you need not go (on a

pilgrimage) to the Ganga or to Kurukshetru" and "Rememberka always that the Lord is the naster, that the self or atmit is His servant and that this relationship exists always by your very nature." This argument is opposed to the natural and self evident injunction for bhakti, prapatti and the like. Since listen. iny to Vedanta and reflecting on it arise from mere desire, there is no need also 10 enjoin the knowledge (of relationship) which arises from the s'üstras. (* There is no need for the süstra to enjoin something which a man will do of his own accord). As is well known, it has been established in Sri Bhuishri) that if knowledge which need not be enjoined is called the means of attaining mukli, it would be opposed to the injunction orduining certain things for perforinance and there would be other objections too; (the injunc tion made in the sustras would serve no purpose at all). 

If this is admitted, the knowledge of the relationship between the jiva and Iswara is indirectly helpful to all aspirants to makit, whatever vill vi they may adopt. When a man has acquired this knowledge from the sustrus, the question then arises “ What is the means or ipi ya for attaining Bhagavan, the Lord of Sri, who is our master and who imparts insurpassed bliss ?" When this question has arisen, the answer is that these means or upāyas are certain other forms of knowledge (other than the knowledge of relationship) which are enjoined for the purpose in accordance with each man's competence and they are bhakti and prapatti. Of these, prapatli is the surrender of the responsibility for one's protection along with its auxiliaries its stated in the following passage: "Wien the question* arises : " To whom is this self to be surrendered for protection ? the answer is "To Vishnu ". In order to show that this (prajatti) should be performed with the knowledge of the relation ship existing between one's self and I:wara, it was stated that pra. patti is the knowledge of the relationship. (It does not mean that prapatli is ruerely that knowledge and notbing else). We have

already described at great length the essential pature (svarūpa) of this prapatti, its auxiliaries and the like (pages 115 - 135). 

TAMIL VERSE: 

"I ain the means as well as the end to be attained. The aspirant (to.mukti) should become subject to me and seek my protection. The upāya called saraṇāgati is not the direct means for the attainment. Sadhanas or means like bhakti yoga and karma yoga are no aids to prapatti; other troublesome angas are Bot required for prapatti. I will myself stand in the place of all sach means (as are prescribed for attaining the desired fruits). I am the messenger and the master. Seek me as your refage and be free from all apxiety". So says the Lord and surrounds me 

on all sides). 

THE MEANING OF THE WORD AHAM (1) IN 

THE SECOND HALF OF THE SLOKA 

Thus in the first half of the charama sloka, Sri Krishda enjoins, for a particular person (adhikari), the adoption of that upāya (prapatti) wbich is referred to in the first part of Dvaya and wbich bas (in itself) the potency of all dharmas or rites and, at the same time a peculiar and unique potency of its own whicb none of them possesses (for it can destroy even that karma which has already begun to operate and yield its consequences). He has explained that this upāya does not require any special or ancillary dharmas on the part of the adhikari and has to be perforined only once. In the second half of the sloka, be graciously explains, at length, the fruit to be attained (by adopting this 1paya), which in (only) briefly indicated by the word namas in the second part of Dvaya. In the first half of the s-loka, Sri Krishna stated that which has to be done by the person or adhikari (seeking mukti). In the second half. He states what He, as the Saviour who has accepted the responsibility of protecting, will perform and comforts the man who has done what he ought to do (se) performed prapatti. 

MEANING OF AHAMI ANI) TWA 

Here from the first person singular, mokshu rishyami (I) will set Thee free). (from this) itself, the mending 'l' is evident. So the use of the word ahain (I) has the purpose of indicatiny. by virtue of its meaning, the power of accomplishing what is to others inipossible, for tbis is essential for setting (one) free from all sins. Its purport is this:- "I that bound the offender with fetters and that am destitute of equals and superiors am now full of compassion as the result of a vyāja or pretext and am bent on granting him pardon. (When I am thus inclined) there is no one to prevent me. Nor is there any one else who is capaile of making him attain freedom (from sids)". This idea is well-known from such passages as the following:--"Bhagavan Vishou is the giver of moksha". "The jivasa" have been boood with the bonds of kurma by tbe Supreme Being for His tili and they can be liberated from these bonds only by Him. No one else is capable of doing so." In this word aham (1), Bhagavan's natural compassion is the onperior aiding turce and the graciousness of the Lord which results from prapatii acts as a subordinate aiding force and Ilis independence ind omnipotence, which are irresistible, stand as the foremost and siree ageury to dispel all obstacles. If it be asked how, the unswer is as follows.--. "His natural compassion makes Him so gracious us to overlook countless ofiences in consideration of some slight pipirja or pretest. This graciousness accompanied by compassion makes the Lord's independence and omnipotence operate for the removal of all hindrances that stand in the way of prapannas. 'T'hus Iswara, who has all the qualities essential for grauting freedom froin all sids, can act towards that end withont requiring any aid. This is the purport of the ahanı or (I) and it announts to saying " I myself (withont the belp of anybody else)". 

THE MEANING OF THE IORD TWĀ (THEE) :

THE MEANINGS OF SARVA PĀPEBHYO (FROM ALL 

SINS) : 

Having this referred to the Dispenser of mukti who is capable of putting the jiva in bondage or out of it and also to the aspirant to mukti who is incapable (of any endeavour) and who has surrendered (to the Lord) the responsiblity for his protection, the sloka proceeds to speak of the bonds in the word sarvapūpebliyo (from all sids). Sin is the cause of evil and what it is can be understood from the s'üstras. Evil' means 'becoming subject to what is disagreeable and losing what is agreeable.' Here (in the charama - sloka) sin denotes also acts of inerit (punya) which lead to enjoy. ment in samsūra (which includes svarga), for they, too, are to the aspirant to mukti, productive of undesirable fruits. It has been said:-"This ølsvarga and other such places are, my child, like hell when compared with the abode of the Supreme Being". Thus to the aspirant to mukti, even such places as svarga are like hell. In the case of the aspirant, therefore, that which leads to svarga is, in no way, different from that which leads to hell. That is why the aspirant to mukti is enjoined to give up those means wbich lead to dharma, artha (wealth) and küma (pleasure), in the same way as he is enjoined to give up sinful actions. Indeed the Srutis and the Smritis declare that good deeds and evil deeds are both to be avoided by the aspirant to mukti, for it is stated "Giving up

of and 

punya and papa of which are both of the nature, karm which are hard to give up etc." 

Thus having denoted, by the word päpa (sins), both punya and päpa, which are the causes of bondage, the sloka indicates, by the plural of the word pāpa (viz. püpebhyall, their being countless. If so, it may be asked what purpose is served by the word sarva (all). (The apswer is) the word 'all' is used for the purpose of including among the hosts of sins, avdiyü or ignorance, the past impressions (vāsanas) which create a liking for adverse things, the taste (ruchi) for evil things and the contact with prakriti or watter both in its gross state and in its subtle state (io pralaya), for these are the causes of karma and also the products of karına. (Io the Saranagati Gadya), Sri Ramanuja has, in three clauses chooranikas, indicated, both explicitly by the words themselves and implicitly from their meaning, those hindrances or obstacles which are referred to in all sins. The three passages begin with munovākkiiyaih' (by mind, speech and body). 

(A question might arise in this connection):- It is said, *Having and ministere1 the aff uirs entrusted to them by the Lord for a long time and again and again, they reach the end of their karma and attain mukti, where jīvas who were formerly Brahmas, Indras, and Rudras, are enjoying bliss in Paramapada (the supreme abode)." (So also) it is said: "Those that have been appointed by the Sapreme Being) to be administrators should remain here in the world of samsāra) until the expiry of their period of administration". (We find also the following :-) The man who adopts a bhakti or upāsana as the means will have the bep •fit of the destruction (the fruits of) such karmas (punya and pāpa) as have not begun to yield their consequences at the very begioning of this upiisana; for (it is said) that there will be delay (for their attaining mukti) till the enjoyment is

completed of those karıas that have began to operate (prie rabdha). This is applicable even to those who are not adidini strators. The question may be asked:- "If so, what is the meaning of saying that the Lord will pardon also in the case of the prapanna) those karmas which have began to operate and yield their fruits ?" The answer is as follows:- “Even in the case of karmas which have begun to bear fruit, if the man who has adopted prapatti as the direct and independent upūya con. siders as evil and undesirable those parts which would lead to another birth or (even) another day's existence and grieves on that account, Iswara will give bin pardon even in respect of all that kurna. If the prapanna is so impatient as to feel that he cannot bear to live without the immediate attainnient of moksha, the lord will, at that very instant, pardon even all that karma which has hegin to hear fruit so that no trace of it may be left over. There. fore there is no reason why one should not pray for pardon even in respect of that karma which has legun to bear fruit (priirabdha). 

(In the Survivvigati.gudpu Sri Ranınuja av:-) "Pandon all sins without exception, (sins) past, futme, and present - cona mitted by the mind, the speech, or the bedy." Here past (sins) refer to those committed before prapati and future (sins) refer to those that might le committed after the performince of prupulti. We do not see any sios committed at the instant of performing prapaiti. What, then, is the meaning of present (kriyamaina) sios? (The answer is):- By the word 'present' (kriyamiiņa) is meant that which was begin before and which will be com pleted in future? According to this definition, those sins which were begun before and which require a long time for their completion and thuse that might be done on account of negligence or careless ness at the instant of performing prapatti - these are called present (sins) - Future (sin s) are those that may begin after prapatli. Among those sius which are committed after prapalli and which may be partly of the present and partly of the future, those which are not couunitted doliberately will be pardoped by Iswara and will leave no trace at all (on the self). Those that are

committed deliberately can be atoned for by the performance again of prapatti, for it is said:-"If an "offence be committed, expiation should be made therefor and the expiation to be made is only the performance of prapatti again." When it is said that if Iswara is bent on granting moksha, even deadly sins cannot stand in the way, apd that there will be no punishment for sing committed delibe. rately after prapatti, what is meant is not that there is no need for expiation or priyaschitta, but that if Iswara is again propitiated by prapatti, (which is the prāyaschitta), moksha is sure to follow. It is the result of God's forgiveness that the man is induced to perform expiation by a further prapatti. 

It has been said (by some richāryas) that, to Iswara, the sins or offences of the jīva are (agreeable) like the dirt on the body of a beloved wife and like the slime on the body of the new-born calf to the cow. This only means that even if wicked men should perform prapatti, Iswara will not forsake them and will bring them round to righteous ways. It does not mean that sins committed deliberately would give delight to Iswara. If so, the prapanna should have, by all the means in his power, to commit such sins. 

Even if offences are committed deliberately owing to the peculiar nature of a nian's prakriti, and even if a further prapatti is not performed (by way of expiation), it is the peculiar character. istic of Iswara's forgiveness that He sees to it that such prapannas do not go to hell and that He awards them light punishments (sufferings) as (kings do) in the case of their offending sons. Sins lead to sufferings that are seen and that are tangible and also to sufferiogs like those in hell. So when it is said that there is no hell for the prapanna as in the following slokas :- “Those who87 consider Vishnu, the bearer of Saroga, as the supreme end of life and who perform prapatti to Him never go to the world of Yama" and “Whatever be the family into which they are born, and 

96. Lakshmi Tantram: 17-91192. 98. ?? 97. Vamana-purana: 94 - 43.534 OA APTER 

wherever they may live, those who are ever attached to Vasudeva never go to hell" when such statements are made to the effect that there is no hell for them, there is nothing in them to deny that they will not have any sufferings in this life itself (like blind ness). Logic cannot repudiate explicit statements (made in the sruti and the smriii). It is idle to say that, even in some of those who have committed offences and who have not repented for them by performing a further prapatti. we do not see such visible sufferings as blindness which are stated to be their punishments. Even in their lives, we may see such sufferings as the following in accordance with the seriousness of their offences :-- many varieties of suffering due to the three well-known canses (the elements of Dature, the body and supernatural powers), dullness of the intelli gence required for the Lord's service, the diminution of delight and the absence of it in the enjoyment of Bhagavan, the alssence of delight in rendering service to Bhagavan and His devotees, offences against the Lord and His devotees, the centre, the boycott and the like by the virtuous, the destrnction of their good deeds, the loss of the est en in which they were formerly held by good men, the suffering dine iu the frustration of their ambitions and desires, ilod such other forms of sorrow. It is well-known from the srutis, the Dhurma siistries of Nanu and others and from the Itihasis, Purunas and the Pancharatru that, for varied kinds of sins of omission and commission, there are varied kinds of visible suffering. Therefore when blindness and the like are taken by way of examplo, it should be taken only as one instance (and not as an invariable form of suffering). This is evident from the opeping words of the septence which speak of sofferings in the world in general, 

It is not possible to argue, with any certainty, that the varied sufferings which come to a man as the fruit of sins committed deliberately after prapatti and which find support in the authority of the texts are due to past karma which has begun to yield its fruit. These may conie as the result of either of the two kinds of karma. That is why good men (sõlvikus) dread offences that 

MEANING OF SARVAPAPEBHYO 

535 

might be committed deliberately. If this were otherwise, it would be opposed to the s'āstra which enjoins a further prapatti and to the code of conduct followed by virtuous men and to ancient tradition. 

(It is true) Nanjiyar stated that if a man does not feel reped tant after committing an offence, he shonld be considered as without knowledge. But what is meant is that his omission to repent is due to dulness of intelligence and not that the prapatti was not fnl. filled. Deliberate offences which would meet with Bhagavan's dis approval would not be committed by some men as these result from conditions created by past karma. Io the case of some others who commit such offences, repentance and the like put an end to them. Men of hard hearts may not repeat at all. Therefore if deliberate offences bappen to be committed, the inan should repent and perform prapatti again. If he does not, they would lead to light punishments or sufferings in accordance with what is said in the s'rutis and the like. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

Wise men who have performed prapatti would never think of committing offences deliberately, men of a mediocre intelligence repent (for such offences.) Hard - hearted men meet with punish ment for them. 

Therefore in order that there may be no punishment of any kind, one should guard against deliberate offences. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

When one performs the commands of the omnipotent Lord (nitya and naimittika karma) solely for the purpose of pleasing Him, no punishment will ensue, though he may not have thought (of avoiding any such punishment). 

If & prapanna should try, as much as it lies in his power, to avoid offences, be should avoid. even more carefully, offences

against the devotees of Bhagavan and association with those who commit such offences. 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

The countless and serious sips committed by the man who meditates on Brahman (Brahinavit) will be transferred to the man who hates hijo. Realising this, one should dread committing any offence against a Brahmavit. 

Even by associatiog with one who has offended against the devotees of Brahman, a man will incur sins. (At the same time) & man should not hate one who offends against the devotees of 

Iswara, who alone is competent to punish hint. 

TAMIL VERSE 

The Lord, whose will is irresistible and who creates, in the minds of those who do not care for him, all their desires and wbo also frustrates them -- the Lord has turned my mind today froni sansüra or bondage and has placed me beneath His two feet for protection. He has been pleased to forget His wrath caused by my actions in the past prompted by my mind before the perfor mance of prapatti and has appeared already (as avatars and archii) to grant we mukti. He sipiles gently, wondering whether we shall accept His grace today or tomorrow. 

THE MEANING OF THE IVORN MOKSHAYISHYIMI 

(I WILL SET THEE FREE) 

The word mokshayishyami 'I will set thee tree from all sins) means "I will haunt thee release (from the bondage of samsara) at the time when you want it". 

It may be asked :--"(lo another context) ihe. Lord says, “I will never pardon". Is it not opposed to what is stated here viz. "I will set thee free from all sias?"; therefore this should be merely to give a little seeming confort in words and is not to be

taken literally." The answer to this question is as follows:-- 

• There is no conflict between these two statements for they apply to different cases. "I will not forgive" occurs in the sloka : “Though a man adores me with a hundred lotnses, O Goddess of the earth, whichevel 10 devotee of Vishnu touches blood even unawares I will not pardon bin. I will never pardon bis offence, O Goddess of the Earth, even if he tries to show me a hundred marks of reverent attention (upachära)". It only means. "I will not forgive the man for such trivial forms of expiation (as the uffering of lotuses and external marks of attention). Here in the Charamasloka, the word moksha yishyimi (means “I will forgive all (offences) if the man adopts the particular upüya wbich is an atonewent for all sins.” The intention of the Saviour is expressed indeed in the sloka :---"Be itm Vibhighana or Ravana himself, bring him here, O Sugriva. I will grant him pardon." These words are not seeming-pleasant, for there is no conflict between what is stated in Varihapuränam) aod what is stated in the Gita, as they apply to different situations. If they are to be taken as only seeming-pleasant, all the texts in the süstras which enjoin bhakti and prapatti would be void of authority, 

Here “Releasing from sins " menns Iswara giviug up His intention to punish the singer for having violated His commands from beginningless time. By this turning away (of Iswara) froio the thought of punishuiuent, the effects of His punishnient, such as uvid yä or ignorance, would all cease lo exist. Isware's turning away from the thought of punishment means His will which takes tbe form: “By my gracetal will the loan who performs all his duties as for nje and as being done by me attain the world that is etertial". The cessation of such things as avidya in the jiva iDeans the expansion of inteiligence, kuowledge, wisdow and such others.

DE CHAPTER 

The manner and the order in which the causes of sumsära, which are of the nature of punya and papa will disappear are as follows - The bindrances to the adoption of the upiya have dis appeared already by their respective causes (such as the performance of the rites and duties of varnas und üsranas), then the punyas and papas done before the adoption of the upaya which are opposed to the attainment (of mukti) will disappear without any trace at the beginning of the adoption of the upiya, provided they are not such as have already begun to yield their fruit prarabdha). Among sins committed after prapatti, those offences which may be com mitted without any awareness of them and which are the result of unfavourable conditions of place, time and the like will not in the least taint (the self). Those offences which are committed delibe rately when there is no danger of death will cease either by some form of atonement or expiation which is within the ruan's power or by experiencing the frnit of the karma which would be of the gature of a light punishment. That portion of the karma which has begun to yield its fruit to the prapanna that will have to be experienced within the tinie desired by him (for nukti) will disappear either by the experience or enjoyment of the fruit or by an intervening rite of expiation. That which remains will disappear by the potency of the upüya (prapatti). 

Among those good deeds (pulya) which are done deliberately with thought both (of moksha and of sainsīra), such as are not hindrances and such good deeds (purya) done before and after the adoption of the upaya by the uprisaka ls are capable of streng theoing his vidya or Meditation -- these will disappear after having yielded their fruit. Those good deeds (punyu) done before and after the adoption of the upiya (damely, upisana) which are of no use to the meditation or vidyu and which have been prevented from yielding their fruit and those good deeds, done before and after, which are useful for the meditation but which have had no occasion to yield their frnit owing to the superior strength of (other) karma favourable for the meditation and unfavourable for it and which still remain without yielding their fruit - these too, will disappear 

MEANING OF MOKSHAYISHYAMI 

539 

in the last monents of the man's life. This truth is expressed in the sütra "By 16 the same principle, the deeds, too, which are other than sinful will not stain (the self)." Those good deeds (which are the cause of rain, food and the like which are necessary for the performance of the vidyā) will cease to exist immediately after the fall of the body". 

Since those good deeds which were performed solely for pleasing the Lord and which were merely of the nature of service have already yielded their fruit, there is no need to speak about their staining the self. Those deeds which were performed by the man for setting an exanıple to the rest of the world (lokasangraha) had to be performed as commands of the Lord. They are of the nature of pure kainkarya or service and have already given their fruits. Among them, if any such good deeds were done without the renunciation of egoism (sātvikatyāga) out of carelessness, they, too, would amonnt to sins as stated in the sloka "Tapas is!* no sin, the study of the Vega is no sin, the rites and duties prescrib ed for each man are no sins, nor is the earning of money by hard work for their sake a sin. If these very things are done with a wrong intention with the thought, “I am doing this and doing this for myself", they become sinful". These (sins) will become subject to the release promised in moksha pishyiimi. Those pra. pattis that were performed for other ends (than mukti) must have already yielded their fruit. 

For the sake of the end for which a former prapatti was performed, a second or further prapatti ought not to be performed, as it would be inconsistant with the potency of prapatti and with the intense and great faith with which the first prapatti was performed. If one were to perform more than one prapatti for the sake of a single end in view, it would be like adopting another upāya (and there would be need for atonement).

540 CHAPTER 

The disappearance or destruction of past karma means Iswara's giving up the thought of awarding the person the fruit thereof. When karma is said not to stain or taint the self (aslesha), it means that the thought of awarding the fruit or consequence of the karma in the case of those who have sought His protection does not even arise ip Iswara. 

If it be asked"(It is stated in the srutis that the good deeds and the bad deeds of the man who is to obtain mukli will be distri. buted among his friends and his foes respectively (at the last moment of his life). If good deeds and had deeds for past karna) are all destroyed in the manner described above, how can this distribution take place ?" The answer is: The distribution among foes and friends will be, respectively, of those evil deeds which are said not to taint and to be destroyed, (aslesha and vinäsa) and those good deeds (punya) which are done deliberately after the adoption of the upāya and which have been prevented from yielding their fruit hy stronger karma. (It is said in the srutis) that Iswara distributes these among the man's friends and foes at the time of his death, Why should Iswara wait until the time of the map's death for this distribution, when He could as well bave done so, at the very beginning when the man adopted the upāya ?" The answers to these questions are as follows: "A man may have behaved with favourable intentions towards the devotee at first, but later he may change and behave with evil intentions. In such circum stances the good deeds should not have already been given away to the friend (who has afterwards turned foe). Further the Lord desires to give opportunities to foes who have done evil to the devotee to beg for forgiveness. These are the reasons why Iswara does not effect the transfer of the good and the bad karma until the last inoments of the devotee. 

The good deeds done by a man for the sake of such ends as svarga are, to the aspirant for mukti, of the pature of sins (papa).. Hence such good deeds (of tbe devotee) will not be transferred to bis friend, if the latter is an aspirapt for mukti.

--- ---- -- ------- ---· ---- --- -- - ---- It may be asked "What is the ineaning of transferring tho karmas performed by one man to some others?" The answer is as follows:---"' he punishment or reward which Iswara intended to award to those who performed these karmas is now transferred to his foes and friends in equal measure," It may be asked, “If punishmenis and rewards for the karmus performed by one man are to be awarded to some other man or wen, would there not be too wide ao iupplication (atiprusungu) (i.c.) the punishment does not go to the evinduer but to some body else who has pot done evil. It is also against the principle that he who sowed must reap the harvest". The answer is this:- There will be no such unfairness due to tov wide an application (utiprasung«), because the rewards und punishments are awarded in accordance with the obligations or offences done, respectively, by these friends and foes to the aspirant for mukti. That is why it is nowhere stated that these good deeds and bait deeds are transferred to those who are neither friends nor foes. The word 'transfer is used here in the sense that (their friends and foes) will have fruits similar to those of the karmas said w be transferred. This sruti which speaks of the transfer of good and bici deeds suggests the extreme of pleasure and displeasure that the Lord would feel, if the obligations and offences de done to the journi (the mu of wisilom) who is extrempe. ly dear to the Lord. 

If we take the interpretation given in the sloku (on paye 318), varva papeblıyoh (from will xlos) would briefly include, as desired hy the man, all hindrances to tht itttainvient of the Lord, all miodrances to the proper adoption of the upaya and also the causes uf experiencing disagreeable things. 

Here the hindrance to the attainment of the Lord is the Lord's will that the offender shall not enjoy Him. The hindrance to the 

NOTE* This interpretation:-"If a man is in despair at the thought that he is incapable of performing whatever will produce the ends desired by him, I myself stand in the place of those actions.") 

542 CHAPTER 

upāya is the Lord's will that the offender shall not understand Hiru aright and do wbat is necessary to propitiate Him. The causes of experienciog disagreeable things consist in the will of God that the man shall experience the consequences or fruits of doing such karmas as displeased Him. 

If all punishments are cancelled in the case of the aspirant for mukti, the effects of such punishments, namely, contact with acit and the like will stand cancelled by the Lord's grace which cancell ed the punishments. Thereafter since there are no causes, there will be no such effects as disagreeable experiences. This is indicated in the siitra: "The man who has attained 108 moksha will never return to samsāra, for the s'rutis say so", These conclusions are within the reach of the knowledge of those very wise men who have stndied Sri Bhashya for a long time along with the traditions of the good. 

Thus (the words) "I will release thee from all sins" speak of the removal of the stream of all hindrances which are of the natuce of either causes (the Lord's will to punish) or effects (avidyñ and the like); it means the same thing as saying that the self will (then) have the manifestation (ävirbhiva) of the perfect enjoyment of Bhagavan. For Bhagavad Sonnaka says:-"When thelo dirt is washed away, the gew shines of itself, but the sheen is not newly produced. In the saine way, when the self casts off its blemishes or faults, jrräna is not newly created in it (for it is already there). When a tapk is dug, water and space are not newly created. What is already present is now brought to mani. festation. How can a thing wbich did not exist before arise anew? So by the casting off of evil qualities, good qualities like jnūna shine forth. They are pot dewly produced, for it has been stated (in the sāstras) that they are eternal qualities of the self". Since the substance called jnūna or knowledge and its inherent power to cover all objects are both eternal, the right word to use is 'mani festation' (i.c.) it is used in its primary sense.

(It is true that) the expansion of jnīra or knowledge to cover 

do what is good and other such things and the foring of service or kainkarya arise anew. Still as their origin depends on the con ditional factor (upädhi), namely, the removal of hindrances thereto, the word 'manifestation' (avirbhara) is used in such places as: " May 19 the perforidance of different kinds of service which are natural to myself manifest itself." This is in order to show that when the hindrances disappear, these services will automatically follow. (In the state of sumsiira), the objects (in the Universe) wbich are all the glorious possessions of Bhagavan appear dis. agreeable in various ways or (only) slightly agreeable as a result of the conditioning factor (upūdhi), namely, karma. In the state of moksha, they would all become agreeable (siuce karma has dis appeared), as agreeableness is their natural quality. Therefore in that state, too, the word 'Inanifestation' (of agreeableness) may justly be used. Therefore the words "I will release thee from all sios" nake it evident that the self will have a new state in which all things will mauifost their datural agreeableness to it. 

If the word ckan means the identity of the upaya and the peya or the end of attainment (as has already been indicated), this attainment of the desired end is also made plain. Therefore the idea that was expressed clearly in the sloka (Gītā - 18 - 65), namely “Thou wilt come to me" may be considered to be stated ia the churana sloka (also) by the meaning implicit in the word ekam, and by the statement that the hindrances to that attainment are destroyed ----(I will release thee from all sios). Therefore the wharama-sloka cannot be said to snpplement or explain what has been stated in the preceeding sloku.* 

107. Ashtasloki: 3. 

NOTE: The author declares that the charama-sloka is not explanatory of the previous sloka (Gita 18-65) as stated by some who consider it to refer to bhaktiyoga. It is independent of the previous sloka and concerns itself with prapatti.544 

SRIMAD RAHASYATRA YASARA 

CHAPTER 

Here an objection that has no soundness in it may be raised to this effect:-"When it is said "I will release thee from all gins", does it follow from those words alone that the release from sins would lead to the attainment of Bhagavan stated in "Thou wilt reach me?" Is it not possible that, with the removal or pardon of all sins, the self may attain the state called kaivalyan in which it enjoys only itself without attaining Bhagavan ? That there is a state called kaivalyam, has, it is well known, been declared in such treatises as Naradiya kalpam, where we find the sloka :-- "This mantra enables a man to obtain wealth and lord ship in this world, svarga and the like in the world beyond, kaivalya (the enjoyment of one's own self) and the enjoyment of Bhagavau". Alavandac also says " To those who desire to have wealth and lordship, the enjoyment of their own self dissociated from the body and, likewise, the performance of kainkarya or service at the feet of the Lord etc. etc." He says also (elsewhere): * Without the grace 208 of Lakshmi, the beloved consort of the Lord with the lotus eyes, we cannot have the valuable things desired (hy men) in samsara, the enjoyment of the disembodied) self, i kaivalya) and the enjoyment of Bhagavan". In the Gady, also, is found quoted (the sentence) in Jitantu stotrı - “Leaving all desired pleasures and the enjoy nient of the (disemboditd) self, I have reached Thy feet." This truth is also stated at length in Sri Ramanuja's Gitä-blushya and such other writings. There fore should not the freedom from all sins which results from the statement "I will release thee from all sins" be considered common to kaivalya and the enjoyment of Bhagavau ?". 

The objection (slated on far) is unsound for the following reasons:- " If all sins have disappeared, there is no reason wby the self should be without the experience of Bhagavan, which is its natural and inherent right. Therefore the state of the enjoy ment of the mere self (kaivalyam) without the enjoyment of Bhagavan would not be the goal of attainment then. Hence in 

108. Gitarthasangraba : 12. 

109. Chatussloki: 3. 

29 

MEANING OF MOKSHAYISHYAMI 

545 

that state (kaivalyam), (we should understand that) the karmas which produce wealth, and such sufferings aus old age and death have disappeared but that the karma which is a bindrance to the perfect enjoyment of Bhagavan has not yet been destroyed. This state (of kaivalya) is a particular kind of enjoyment wbich consists in the experience of one's own disembodied self. Of this state it has been said :-"lo that experience of the self, the self feels that there is nothing greater than it", and also, “If a man desires! this enjoyment of the (disembodied) self, these three (karma yoga, jnäna yoga and bhakti yoga) will enable him to attain that extreme which is called kaivalyure". As stated (in these slokas), this expe rience in which there is neither contact with acit or watter nor knjoynent of Bhagavan and wbich results from the adoption of a particular upīra within the man's ability was called kaivalyam, because it is the enjoyment of the mere (kevala) sell without association with either acit or Bhagavan. 

(In some places) mukti or the attaininent of Bhagavan is called by the word kaivalyam in order to show that all upädhis or conditioning factors have ceased to exist in mukti. So also the word mukti is sometinies employed to denote the experience of the disembodied self as in the sloka "O, Lord of Hastigiri," I look upon all the enjoyments of this world, the title of Brahma, the high position of Rudra, and the experience of the disembodied self, which is called mukti - I look upon these as water poured in the soil saturated with salt. I koow the bliss of rendering service to Thee". The word mukti employed here should be explained as in the sloka :- " The man who it is free from desire, fear and anger - he is always a mukta (aven here in samsāra). It only means "He resembles & mukta". It inay be asked "Is it (kaivalyam) pot stated to be freedom from old age, and death ? " The answer is that it is just like calling the gods immortal (amara), (That is : they are not truly immortal.) Compared

with human beings, they may be said to be relatively inmortal, for they live much longer. Or it may be explained as stating that kaivalyam will lead, in course of time, to mukti. In the same way should be explained the use of the word nukti when it is intended to mean merely the attiinment of the same abode or loka as that of *the Vibhavas or Vyihas and also samipya and särūpya. 

It bas been declared that real mukti is different from the others) in the (following) sloka:-"Some live 318A in the worlds of Vishnu. This is sālokyam (living in the same loka or world as Vishnu). Some reach near Him. This is sämipyam (attaining 

place near Vishnu). Some others attain a form resembling that of Vishnu. This is säriipyam (having a form resembling His). Others still attain sayujyam and it is this which goes by the name moksha". The sižyujyam referred to here is going to Paramapadu and enjoying the same bliss as that of Bhagavan (and this alone is real and true mukti). That the experience of the mere disen bodied self is not eternal and that it is not real moksha are evident from these slokas :- "There are four kinds' of people who are mide and wbo are called my devotees. Ainong them, those who are exclusively attached to me (ekiintins) are the best, for they worship no other deities. To these men who perform their duties and rites without any attachment or desire for their fruit. I am alone the goal. The other three virtuous kinds of bhaktas or devotees are said to be desirous of certain ends. All these (three) are liable to fall (from their bigh state) but the jnani (who is an ckiinti attains moksha " (Again it is said) : " Having 118 listened to this story, the man who has lost his wealth will become free from the sorrow due to it; the man (jijnirsuh) who wants to enjoy his disembodied self will attain bhakti or devotion (to the

Lord), tbe bhakta or devotee will attain moksha". This amounts to stating that the jijnüsuh spoken of in the Gitii, who is desirous of experiencing his self, will, in course of time, become a jnsini. It has been said :- “When thello attachment to the pleasures of life ceases, the self, which is different from the body and which is happy, will become manifest. Without being canght (in this state) viz, kaivalge, if yon want to realise that your essential nature consists in being sesha to Bhagavan and in being eternal, get hold of Bhagavan and then give up the pleasures of worldly objects." In this (Tamil verse) the enjoyment of Bhagavan is said to be eternal and the experience of the disembodied self, which is distin. guished fronı it, is indirectly stated to be not eternal. It is true that) the experience of the measureless self is described as imperish ahle or without changes like diminution or increase; - like the state ment of the fruit of the rite called chuiturmiisya being imperishable; it only means that it will last for a very long time (i. e.) many and many a kalpa (and not that it is eternal). This locality where the self enjoys itself is thus described :-- " The place'1called the amritam of yogis is the place to which those who want to enjoy their own self go." That this locality is not Paramapada is also evident from another) siloka in the very sanie context: "Those who12 are yogins and who, being ekāntins, are constantly meditat. ing on Brahman, reach that supreme abode which the eternal stiris are gazing at. (It is clear from this, that the ekantin who is desirous of attaining Bhagavan is here stated to go to a place other than that (to which the man who is desirous of enjoyiog his self would go) and that it is it place gazed at by the săiris, 

In such treatises as Sri Bhashya (and Gitäbhishya ) it ha: been stated that those who meditate on their self with Brahman as its inner self as in Panchirgni-vidya and the like pass (after death) along the archirudi route and attain Brahman.

Therefore to those that meditate on their self according to the Panchägni vidyā, there is an intermediate result or experience consisting in the enjoyment of the mere self. However, according to the principle explained in the madhu vidya, they will ultimately attain Brabuan. If, however, the neditation is on the self either as associated with prakriti or matter or as disembodied or dissociat ed from matter, whether the self is meditated on in its essential nature (svarīpu) or as if it were Brahman, -- in all these four cases, as when name (nūma) and the like are meditated on as if they were (Brahman), there is neither the passage along the archirīdi route por the attainment of Brahman. This is declared in the following :-- Bädarāyana is of 120A opinion that the Ati vühikas (escorts) lead those who do not weditate on pratikas (i.e.) parts or aspects (of Brahman). In either of the other alternatives, there is conflict (with the srutis) and also with the *principle of tat-kratu. In another context to prove that the being rpeditated on in that vidyā is (not the jiva (but) the Supreme Being or Brabinan, the Sūtrakāra gives this as his reason for saying 80 : "Since the person who meditates according to this vidyii is said to pass along the archirūdi route.” This is done in the sõitra “sioce 19 puention* is made of the route meditated on by those who have listened to the Upanishads” (i.c.) to those who ineditate on Brabnian. 

Therefore to those who do not attaiu Brahman, there should not have been the cancellation of all sins spoken of in the charama 

* NOTE:- If it is said that only those who mcditate on Brahman will attain Brahnian, it would conflict with ponchagni vidya, according to which he who meditates on his self with Brahman as its inner self will travel along the archiradi roure and reach Brahman). If. on the other hand, it is said that those who meditate on (not the cause i e.) Brahman (but) on the effect such as prakriti. nama iname) and the like, it would conflict with what is stated in Sad vidja Therefore Badarayana expresses his conclusion negatively thus : * The escort leads, by the archiradi route, those who do not meditate on parts or aspects of Brahman pratikus: From this it would follow that those who medi tate on Brahman alone would take the archiradi route and also those who meditate on the self but with Brahman as its inner self. Tat-kratu is the principle which states the truth “ As a man meditates, so will he be". So if he meditates on the self alone, he will become the self (and not attain Brahmao). 120A Brahmasutras: 4-3-14.

siloka. To those whose sins have been pardoned or cancelled, there is no limitation in regard to the enjoyment of Brahman, Thus since in this sloka, the annulment of all sins is declared, (we have to understand that) even that particular karma which resulted in the experience of the mere self and which stood as a bindrance to the fall and perfect enjoyment of Brahman is annulled or cancel led. From this it would follow that what is stated in the previous sloka nauely, " 'Thou wilt attain myself” is declared in this sloka also mäm cva eshyasi. "Thou wilt attain myself" means "the full and perfect enjoyment of Brahman'. In order that this perfect enjoyment may happen, the archirädi route has to be traversed and a particular region or locality has also to be reached. 

It is clear from the sästras which speak of such things as this route that, from beginningless time, the independent and omni. potent Lord has made it a rule that the full and perfect enjoyment (of Himself) should be granted in this order (namely, the archiridi route, the entrance into the region or locality and then the enjoy ment). 

Before starting on the archirädi route, when a man under stands the essential natore (svarīpa) of Brahman with the belp of the sustras and so also when he has a vision of Brahman with the help of yoga and when he reaches such worlds as those of Vibhava, the vision or realisation which he gets results from some specific good deeds and is dependent on the instruments of knowledge. Therefore this vision will be partial or limited and liable to interru ption. But the vision that results in the state of mukti is full and perfect, because there are no factors that limit or diminish the experience nor is it liable to any further interruption or break, As an Overflow (parivāha) of this enjoyment arises the perfect service or kuinkarya in which the s'eshi (the Lord) finds delight and this

idea is expressed in the s-loka: "Though' yon live for a hundred years, I will always be your servant. Therefore give me orders saying . " Do this in this beautiful place." Here all the successive stages of realisation (or fruit) which are stated (by Sri Ramanuja , in the (Saraṇāgati) Gadya in the sentence with the word pāramarthika are also implicitly suggested in accordance with the pramūnas. 

THE MEANING OF MĪ SUCHAH (DO NOT GRIEVE - DO 

NOT DESPAIR) 

Thereafter the words "Do not griove" reveal the certainty of what has been stated before ". 

There are some commentators) who hold that "Do not grieve" enjoins something to be avoided. (According to thein ), if, after at man has performed prapatti, be grieved or fell into despair, he would be violatiog the injunction and the Saviour who is the upüyor would become indifferent and leave him to look after himself. The man would thus become liable, in their opinion, to this disad vantage or risk. This view is opposed to their own commentary on the sins committed deliberately after prapatti and on the words " from all sins". It is also opposed to the texts in the s'rutis and the smritis which declare that the Saviour will never forsake the man who has songbt His protection. Therefore since all causes for grief or despair have disappeared in the case of the man who bas adopted this upāya, it repeats that there is absolutely no cause for despair and aims at confirrwag the nian's faith. 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS :-- 

Many causes of sorrow (in the case of Arjuna) like those con cerning the destruction of relatives have already been removed by appropriate and excellent teaching. Now the sorrow or despair caused by the thougbt that the dharma or rites enjoined (for mukti)

are too difficult to perform, that the hindrances to mukti are insuperable and that the end in view can be attained only after protracted delay - it is this sorrow that is now dispelled. 

(The Lord) intends to say: After I have taught you this upāya, which, without being too bard to adopt for the end desired by you, is also capable of annulling all hindrances that stand in the way and is not liable to cause any (undue) delay in the attainment of that aim -- after this has been taught to you, there is no room for despair due to such things is the difficulty of adopting an upāya. If you adopt this up iyu, your welfare is my burden or responsibility and I shall myself be interested in looking after it. If I do not protect you, it will be a reproach to me. You are, as it were, muy property or wealth (to look after) and there is no reason why you should grieve". 

The grief that is here put an end to is not the old sorrow carsed (in Arjana's mind) by the thonght of killing (bis) relatives. It is a different kind of grief that has to be consistent with the context. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows :- "The rich qualities!** that distingnish the nature of the gods lead to moksha, the qualities that make for the nature of the Asuras are the causes that lead to bondage". When the two were thus distio guished, Arjuna was grieved at the thought of what he should do if be belonged to the class of Asuras. Sri Krishna, who understood this, said to him :- "O Pandava! do not grieve. You are boro to attain the rich qualities of the gods". Similarly here, when (Arjuna) is extremely desirous of attaining the supreme end, he grieves at the thought tbat the upāya taught 80 far has to be adopted for a long time, and is subject to many hindrances, while being extremely difficult of performance even for those who are very careful. At the thought of that «paya and of bis own (want of) capacity for adopting it, he grieveà, saying to himself "Hoir can I succeed in adopting this upaya and secure the end in view?" To Arjuna who was in despair (at this thought), Sri Krishna shows

another upaya which can be dnly performed in a single instant, wbich is without any obstacles, and which is (also) easy of perfor mance. By doing so, He makes Arjuna care.free and certain in regard to the attainment of the desired end and then says, “ Do not griove". So the words should certainly be understood as intended to dispel the despair due to such things as the difficulty of adopting the (former) upaya. (It is only this grief that is here put an end to and no other). 

In this Bhagavad Giti, the Gitacharya, at first, imparts a knowledge of the difference between prakriti (inatter, the body) and the soul or self; then He describes karma yoga and jnana yoga which are indirect means leading to moksha; thereafter Fe teaches bhakti yoga with its angas, which has been enjoined as the direct means of attaining moksha and says:-- "Thus 124 has been taught to you the joint which is the most secret of all secrets. Consider all these and then do what you desire to do". Though He perceived the dissatisfaction that passed over Arjuna's face at that instant, Sri Krishna did not at once favour him with instruc tions concerning the easier upüya, for it has been said: "The Lord of 128the world tests the minds of those who are weak of heart". Instead of declaring the final conclusion by saying: " This is the direct ineans of attaining moksha and is supremely good to you. Act in accordance with this." - instead of saying so, he says:-"Do whatever you wish to do," as if He were indifferent (and not interested in Arjuna's spiritual welfare) like one who tells a traveller, " This **route leads to the land of the Vidarbhas and this other to the land of the Kosalas. (Take which aver you choose)". Sri Krishna makes others think that this is the cause of Arjuna's mental depresssion and enjoys the līlā of instructing him once again in the principal means of attaining moksha viz., bhakti yoga. He hegios by stating : " I will teach you again this greatest secret of all ", and in two silokus explains

to him, conclusively and with deep earnestness, what it is, so that he may remember that it is just what has already been taught. On seeing that Arjupa's depression has become twice as great as before, the Supreme Ruler, who is (now) the Charioteer, feels that Arjuna is now in a state of fitness to receive instruction in regard to the means of attaining moksha (viz. prapatti) which is the supreme secret and is, at the same time, extremely easy of adoption. Without the least delay, even without prefacing that upāya with any praise, the Lord immediately teaches him to perform säranā. gati towards Hinself. Thus acting as the Charioteer also to the chariot of Arjuna's mind, (i.e. to all his aspirations), the Lord dispels all bis griefs. That the grief which is here pnt an end to is therefore different from the oli grief concerning the destruction of his relatives etc.) thus becomes cle:tr after a careful consideration of the context (in which the words occur). 

In the first half of this sloku, since (the Lord) says to the man who is destitute of all other niyas, "Take refuge under me alone," the man who is incapable (of making any endeavour) surrenders the resposibility tof his protection) into the hands of One who has the ability. Further the independent and omnipotent Seshi, who is compassionate, accepts the responsibility. There fore (in the first half of the sloka), the prapanna becomes free from all responsibility iu regard to bis own protection. And since the Seshi, who is omnipotent and is ever truthful towards those who have sought His protection, has accepted the responsibility and is 90 gracious as to say .-"I will release you from all sins", there is absolutely no likelihood of any evils like hell ensuing in the future. Freedom from fear results from this sloka, as also free dont.om all doubt, because these are the glorious and true words of Sri** Ranganatha Himself, who is ever truthful. 

(**NOTE: Here the reference is to the words of Sri Ranganatha as recorded in Saranagati Gadya : “ Therefore be free from all uncertainty about the attainment of knowledge concerning myself, about having a vision of myself and also about the attainnient of myself).":554 CHAPTER 

Therefore, if one has been told about this special upāya and if vue adopts it, one will have no grief or despair, at all, in connection with that upuya. 

Here it may be asked :-- From the words “Do pot grieve", it is evident that grief ( at one's being without upāyas) wakes one competent for prapatti; how then could it be stated that fear is also one of the marks of competency for prapatti, as shown in the following sloka :-"I dreadaaz, O, best of gods, at the sight of this samsära which fills me with fear, Save me, O Lord of the lotus eyes. I know of no other upāya than Thee ", and in the Tamil verse:-“ Embrace this red-hot iron pillar, 0, sinner"; in dread at these words, I have come and sought Thy feet for protection.” To this question the answer is as follows:- Having realised that Lie end desired by him has not been so far artaided, the man 

reves; he is also afraid at the prospect, in future, of formidable obstacles to the end desired by him. Therefore ( he has both grief ind fear) In the case of the aspirant to mukti, when either of the twu viz., the annuluent of what is undesirable and the attain 

pent of what is desired is mentioned, the other also comes to the mind). In the same way when either of the two marks of competency for prapatti, viz., grief and fear, is nientioned, thu otiver is also taken for granted. In the wan who is absolutely without payas (and is therefore fit for perforining prapatti), these two, grief and fear, are excessive. Therefore by way of conclusion, this adhikari who is overwhelmed with excessive grief is tanght the upüya which is appropriute for bim, and is thereby madde free of all doubt, free from all responsibility (concerning is protection), free from all fear and thus delighted at heart. On this extreme feal', we have already stated as follows :- " The Lord bis cine.129 - the Lord who said: - “ Thon that art afraid of scimsuiru, conje and seek protection from me".

The prapanna who has done what lie ought to do (i.e) prapaitli, should continue) to perform the rites and duties (ordained for his vara and üsrama) (nitya and naimillika), which are among the kainkaryas done by the virtuous : such karma as is described in the following sloka - " Do ibat* karm which, when performed, does not yield any fruit and which, when omilted, will bring in evil.” This is evident from the passages which are found before and after this sloka and also in this very sloka, where it is said that tho omission will cause evil. Therefore since the prapamu) has no uncertainty concerning the attaioment of the viesired end, since he has nothing further to do for the sake of mokslia, sinch what he has yet to perform is only the keeping of (the Lord's) commands for their own sake, and since, if offences should be committed (there-after), they could easily be atoned for hy repentance and the like as pojoteil out in another chapter -- there is no reason why he should not feel delighted at heart. Thongh this delight is ningled with disgust (nirveda) in the intelli gent (prapaina) who is still connected with such unwholesomne things as the body, yet the two may exist without any inconsistency a: the disgust and the delight are due to different factors respectively. 

The words "Do not grieve" are, themselves, an indication of the cancellation of all causes of grief; even that portion of the karma which has already begun to operate (prirabdha) and which will cause grief will be cancelled and the man who is so impatient as not to be capable of existing even for a moment longer will attain moksha at that very instant. As stated in the Tamil verse : "The Lord is's one who, to those that seek His protection, grants Vaikunta at the time of their death”, we have to believe that all that unexpired part of the karma which has already begun to operate (prārabdhe) will be annulled and that moksha will be at the death of this body. Therefore if, in this bodily existence itself, it be felt by a man) that what remains of this life is an evil, it will also

556 CHAPTER 

certainly be cancelled by the will of the omnipotent Lord whose grace has been secured by prapatti. 

(In this congection it may be asked whether it is not a sin to desire to die iin niediately after performing prapatti). The answer is as follows:-) 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS: 

In some forms of expiation for sins (prayaschitta) and like. wise, in certain kinds of offering (made in the fire) like sarvasvāra karma, it is not considered a sin if the man gives up life (by casting the body down a precipice or in the fire), So also there is no impropriety in praying for instant death in the saramagati of tile prapanna who cannot bear to continue in samstra even for a moinent (ärta). On the other hand, the prapanna who desires to live a long life (dripta) commits an offence, if he violates the rule in the sastras which enjoins the protection of one's own life. 

In the same way as yogis cast off their bodies in virtue of certain yogas practised by them, there is nothing to prevent the man who, while performing frapatti, longs to die immediately. It cannot be said that such casting off of the body is not permitted to those who are in Kali yuga, like entrance into holy waters for giving up one's life there. In fact the artha prapanna who prays for immediate death is one who saves his self sooner than all others. 

Prapannas are spoken of as belonging to two classes ārtas and driptas on account of the difference in the intensity of the grief felt by them respectively, (It should not, therefore, be thought that the latter iiz., the dripta bas no grief. The dripta pra. panna is one who grieves at the thought of another janma and believes that he will some day or other attain moksha and has the patience to wait until the end of this existence. The word dripta is here used not io (the usual) sense of one who has arrogance or pride, which is a quality opposed to the virtues of the soul and leads one to treat good men with disesteem. The word Ārta-prapanna 

MEANING OF MĀ SUCHAH 

in nsed here to denote the inan who, in this life, looks upon even Brahua's position of lordship as an obstacle to the perfect enjoy. ment of Bhagavan, who feels that his present association with the body is unbearable as with a raging fire, and who, therefore, cannot endure existence even for a single mondent after the performance of prapatti. He is, therefore, like one who plays, " Be please 182 to make my body and my life-breath perish." Ho is put the arta referred to in the Gjiti (7.16) "Ārilo, jijnisuh, arthurthi, etc.," where urta means "ope who prays for the recovery of his lost wealth or lordship " 

There are some who are of opinion that, in Sui Rana's words:. " Whether 18the man is an ürta (who cinnot bear delay in the attainment of the desired end) or & dripto ( who has no such impatience), the man who seeks refnye should (always ) be protected", there is atividu or exaggeration in that even the dripta who is proul or arrogant is stated to be worthy of protection. Whatever that may be, there is no room for dispute in regard to this passage where moksha is provised to the man who grieves for the evils of samsvira but can bear to live till the end of this life and then attain moksha, for he is not one who is proud or arrogant, 

The use of the future tense in mokshayishyāmi (I will release you) is not inappropriate in the case of the ürta who prays for immediate release from the body, for the end desired is to come after the adoption of the upaya and the word is used at the time when the upaya is taught (i.e. before the adoption of the upiya), 

• These classifications into ürias and driptas arise on account of differences in the inteasily of the Lord's grace which are due to the difi'erences in the good deeds performed by them before. 

Such statements as are made in the slokas -- " The man's who has performed prupatti after learning the truth experiences, 

132. Tiruvoymozhi: 10-7-9 139. 

133. Ramayana : Yuddhakanda : 18-28. 

558 CHAPTER 

in this life, the consequences of his prārabdha karma alone (i.e.) that karma which has begun to yield its fruit in this life, and there after attains moksha" - such statements do not apply to the arta. (Sri Ramanuja) has described what the driptaprapanna shonld do after the performance of prapatti, in bis gadya, in the passages beginning with:-“ You will be free from all trace of suffering or hindrance caused by the body, the elements (carth, water, fire, etc.,) or the gods "and ending with "Be free from all uncertainty in regard to knowledge concerning me and the vision and the attain vient of myself". 

The freedom from grief that is stated here (in the charanu. vloku) has no limiting factors. Thrrefore the causes of all forms of grief are stated here to be annulled for the man who has a know ledge of this upaya and adopts it. By the teaching given here, mere knowledge (of the upuya) may exist without its adoption, but it would be of no use at all as stated in the sloka. "The song does not regulate (the actions of) the man though he way sing it very often. Creatures behave in accordance with their past impres. sions (vūsana) like the bird* • Kulinga', which, though it utters the words nii sähasan kuru, (Do not behave rashly), continues to behave rashly". So in this sloka, it is inuplied that annulment of grief would be the fruit of a combination of both knowledge and action. 

Therefore, here, all grief or despair that might arise in regard to the adoption of the upaya, whether before its adoption or after it, or in the middle of it - all this grief is here (said to be) annulled, 

If it be asked how, the answer is as follows; Despair may arise in many forms ;- (1) in regard to one's competency for the upüya, (2) in regard to (the potency of) the upriya itself, (3) in

regard to the things that the prapanna should do after prapatti, and so also (4) in regard to the end to be attained including the full and perfect service or kainkarya to be rendered. (1) Among them, this dharma called saranagati, wbich is to be adopted, is not confined to any particular family (jäti) caste or üsrama. Pro. vided there are the desire for attaining the end in view and faith in the upa ya which is the means for that attainment and such things As knowledge of one's being destitute (of other upiyas), there is no reason why any one should despair at the thought that he inay not be competent (to adopt the upriya). 

(2) The (siidhya) upiri ya (prapatti) is capable of being per formed or adopted in a single instant with all its accessories, it is easy of prrformance; it does not need to be repeated; it does not take long to bear fruit; its accessories are not dificult; it is capable of yirlding the desired fruit just at the time when it is desired; therefore to the man who is destitute (of other upayas ) and who is afraid of delay (in attaining the desired end), there is 00 reason for despair at all thinking that he may have to adopt other apriyas like bhakti, which liave to be practised for 2 long time with all accessories thereof, which are difficult of performince even to those who are very careful and whose acces. sories are also equally difficult to accomplish and which yield the riesired fruit only after a long time, 

The Saviour who is propitiated by this easier upriya and who is to grant the desired end is easily accessible to all, inspires confi dence, is supremely compassionate and is independent and omdi potent without subjection to any one else). Therefore there is no reason why one should despair at the thought of the Siddhopaya (the Gord). 

13) After the performance of this upaya, none of the good deeds that may be done by a man either by say of keeping the commands (of the Lord) or winning Ilis approval is an auxiliary or anga for prapatti. Therefore even if, owing to adverse circum. stances of place and time, !here are short.comings in their perfor. 

560 CHAPTER 

mance, there is no reason for grief or despair at the thought that these shortcomings might adversely affect the accessories (for they are not its accessories ). 

If, in dread of certain sios due to prārabdha karma which render a man absolutely unfit for all karma like a piece of burnt cloth, by causing a inan to offend the great devotees (of God) deliberately, if, in such cases, the man desires at the time of the first prapatti that his actions after prapatti should be free from all such offence or if he perforins a later prapatti for avoiding these offences - if he does these, there is no reason for grief.or sorrow at the thought that offences may happen to be committed in future. Even if, at the time of the first prapatti, one has not prayed for a later life free of all offence, in case offences are committed deliberately, the Saviour of those that have no (other) refuge who stated, "I will never forsake the man who comes to me in the gnise of a friend" will create repentance in his mind, and induce him to perform expiation or prüyaschitta which in this case) is a further prapatti. If the inan is too stubboru to feel repentant, (the Lord) will cause sufferings by way of punishment and thus prevent him from committing further offences. Thus before the time when the attainwent of the desired end is prayed for the expiation will be over, Therefore the prapanna need not feel grieved at the thought that great sufferings like those of hell would come to him as a result of deliberate offences committed by him which flash like lightning and disappear quickly. 

(4) Since the artaprapannu will have the desired end at the very time of performning prapatti, there is no reason why he should feel grieved at the thonght thar ti body which resembles hell would continue, (for the body has been thus described):- " If a man" is fond of his body constituted of flesh, blood, pus, foecal matter, urine, muscle, fat and bone -- then he should be fond also 

of hell".

As for the dripta prapanna : 

All rites or dharmas of renunciation such as karmayoga will never be in vain as stated in the sloka :-- "The beginning that has been made in this karma-yoga will never prove futile. There is no harm in its being left inconiplete; even a fraction of it saves a man from the great fear of samsära" " The foundation that is laid is, as it were, a foundation of stone" and especially with regard to the man who has performed saraṇāgati, it has been stated: "I will never forsake himn.” Further the dripta frapannu is certain of attaining what he desired, though it is delayed until the time specified by himn. So the dripta prapanna bas no reason to feel grieved at the thought that the good deed in the forio of prapatti might be counteracted by certain evil deeds which might be thought capable of doing so, as has been said in the sloka “ A yajna ""performed by one loses its effect by untruthfulness, tapas perishes by arrogance, age becomes diminished by contemn. ptuous talk of Brahmios and gifts of charity lose their virtue by their revelation.” since he has prayed for mokslia at the end of this life, he has no reason to feel grieved at the thought that, oning to certain prarabuha karma ( which has begun to yield its fruit), he might have to take another birth. 

Since he is a prapanna for no other object (than moksha). all his sins which might act as obstacles will be absolved; therefore he hus no reason to grieve that the supreme end desired by him would suffer delay owing to such lindrances as the enjoyment of big inere disembodied self. 

The Lord intends to say :- “You bave become the recipient of my grace which can cancel the causes of all forms of grief. So if, hereafter, you should entertain grief or despair, it would be as foolish as when you had no grief or despair before performing prapatti, while being subject to punishment by me. This grief or despair is not in keeping with the peculiar potency of this rüya,

A SUMMARY OF THE MEANING OF THE 

CHARAJA SLOKA:-- 

*This is the sum and substance of the meaning of the sloka : 

" Your knowledge is limited; your ability is insignificant; your life is short anıl you are also impatient of delay. Therefore do not go about secking other upriyas which you cannot (fully) under stand, which you cannot easily adopt and which can bear fruit only564 CHAPTER 

after much delay. Realise that I who am easy of access to all, who ain the Saviour of all the worlds, and who an endowed with all the attributes essential for x Saviour, am the only upaya and perform the surrender of the responsibility of protecting your self to me with its five singus. When you hilve adopted this upāya, you will have done what you ought to do, you will become my ward and be extremely dear to me. Supremely compassionate and gracious, independent and omnipotent, I will, myself, by my mere will and without any other aid, and for the fulfilment of iny own purposes, free you from the panifold, endless, and insuruountable groups of olsstacles without leaving any 'trace of them. I will enable you to have enjoyments similar to inine own, since you will enjoy myself and all that belongs to me. I will find delight in tuaking you render all forms of service in all places, at all times and in all circumstances — service which will be of the nature of the overflow of the full and perfect enjoyiuent (of myself). You have absolntely no cause for grief." 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

This path (prapatti) has been disclosed (to us) by icharyas who resorted to that unique dharma (Siddhopaya) which can grant all (desired objects) and which is ever accompanied by Sri and wo (by so doing) became free from (all) grief. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Giving up those dharmas which have to be performed with extreme care, we were convinced that the true refuge for us is the feet of that Gopala which are fragrant with tulasi and we resorted to them at once. By the gracious and fascinating words of that Supreine Person, we have become free from ignorance so that the karma which has been separated from us can never follow us.

On hearing the words of these (ächüryas) which are like steps in the staircase that leads to the mansion of mukti, great souls like Vaisampayana and Sounaka nod their heads (in approval and admiration).

AN ACHARYA. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA:-- 

The noble acharya, who longs to attain the pripeval and heavenly abode of Vishnu, fights up the imperishable lamp of spiritual tradition (sampradıya) in some deserving disciple who bas been tested in various and well-known ways and fonnd fit (to receive the light). (He lights up this lamp) with true affection (sneha) when the disciple is in a state of mind (dasū) free from noworthy qualitios* (gua) like & well-tested and weil-burnished vessel with oil (sucha) poured into it and with a wick (dasä) made of pure threads (guļa).

tradition of noble üchurzas. The (true) üchirga collects together the meanings of the three great secrets (mantras) whose delightfnl flavour cannot, like the milk of the lioness, be appreciated by strangers. He makes a brief summary of them and then meditates on them. (Ilow and to whom, after doing so, he should teach these truths is described in the following slokas :). "He who' guards this meaning from those who are unworthy and imparts it to those who are worthy he is fit to be honoured by me." " This (the Bhagavad Gitū) is not to be taught to those who have not performed tapas. It should never be taught to the man who has no devotion or blukti and who does not show eagerness to learn it. It should never be imparted to the man who hates me. He who teaches this greatest of secrets to my devotees will show para. bhakti or deep devotion to me and will attiin muc, There is no doubt of this." "This great sustra shoull not be taught to men who are not constantly repeating the Vedas. This siistra will impart wisdom to the man who is eager to learn it and bows devoutly to the guru for attaining wisiloin. This should aot be imparted to the man who is ever in the habit of telling lies; (it should not be imparted) to deceitful nen, to eanuchs, to men that are mentally perverse, to those who are so conceited as to think that they are learner) when they tre not tiny so, and to those who Gause affliction to others. I will tell yon of the man who deserves to be taught (this siistru). Listen. It should be taught to the man who has faith, who is virtuous, who never indulges in vilifying others, who can understand sound reasoning and who is capable of grasping what is taught. (It should be taught) to the man who per forns the rites and duties (ordained for bin) and wbo endures the inconveniences and discomforts arising from their performance, to the win who is intent on doing what is good to the world and who desires to live in solitude. (It should be taught) to the inan who delights in the injunctions of the sustras, who dreads vain argu. mentation and who has learnt much from ūchiiryas. It should be

taught to the man who is grateful for the help rendered to bim, who considers patience and compassion as desirable virtues and who looks upon all eternal souls as resembling bimself. Wise men declare that this s'āstra should not be taught to those who have not these virtues. When the stāstra is imparted to the unworthy, it will not bring good to the teacher for that very reason. Even if this earth is filled with gems and offered (to one), one should not, o king, impart this sästra to the man who has not subjected himself to discipline. This noble sõstra may certainly be taught to the man who bas subdued bis senses. You need not be, in the least, afraid, O Karala. You have been taught this sūstra treating of the Supreme Brahman. You bave been taught the Supreme Brahman that has no beginning, no middle and no end, that is free from sorrow and that is most holy." "If & fit & disciple cannot be found, the inan who is fit to teach this vidyā may (even) die with his vidya or learning. It should, on no account, even at the time of great adversity, be sown in a desert". "Ignorant' men who con. sider themselves learned and hypocrites who pretend to observe dharma while they are really doing adharma - these man under the disguise of the virtuous harass (good) men who practise dharma. He who has skill in performing well such actions as would lead to moksha but who, elsewhere, follows the ways of the world -- he is looked down upon is a guru of a low type. Many are the men who are foolish; the inan with a clear intelligence may occasionally be found somewhere and only one among many. He is a man with all virtuous mind who will never allow his intelligence to be clouded by men that are silly. Trust should never be placed in any wan; this is A matter for careful consideration, especially, in Kali yuga. Great signers confound the intellects of the weak-minded with perverse reasons spouted forth like a downpour of rain. One should guard dharma from the unfit and perform dharma. Naver teach any. thing to one who does not beg for it. Even when asked, secret meanings or the mysteries of religion and the true doctrine should

not be revealed (lightly). To bi who has sought one, with true devotion, who has constant faith in the sustras, who is pure and is prepared to learn in accordance with the rules -- to him one should teach everything. The man who teaches the s'īstras to the unworthy for winning the respect of others, for wealth, for being honoured by others and for gettiog rid of the suffering (caused by poverty ) - that man strays from the right path. (You) may sow the seed in a desert, give (your) daughter in marriage to a eunuch and give a garland of flowers to a monkey; but (you) should never impart (instruction) in the s'istra to one who is unworthy". "This great mantra should not be taught to an atheist, to one who is insincere, or who is not devout, to one who delights in harassing others and to a miser. This mantra is not fit to be taught to such as these. It should be taught by the achirya to the man who is sincere, to one who has devotion to his guru, to the man who has devotion to Vishnu and who is intent on doing good to all beings. These two things should be borne well in mind." "Thus have I uttered words wbich are like a garland to the Lord and words that would delight His servants, for the sake of the enjoyment of the Lord which is sweet as anı brosia". "Here have I 'tanght deep truths in the form of verses each of which begins with the last word of the previous verse (antüdi). Considering their great value, receive them without casting them among the unworthy". As stated in such treatises as the above, viz., Sötvata, Bhagavad Gitā, the discourse between Vasishti and Karala, Sandilya Smriti and Satyaki tantra, the ancient achärzas would teach only to those who had such qualities as goodness and faith and who would therefore be approved of by the Saviour. (They would teach these truths) only to those who were of tbe nature of the gods (Devas) as described in the following silokas :- "These Hare the qualities, O. Bharata, which enrich man with a nature silpilar to that of the gods :- fearlessness, a miod free from the taint of rajas and tamas, meditation on the essential nature of the

self, charitableness, subjugation of the senses, the performance of yajnas or sacrifice, the study of ones Veda, austerities like fastiog, being the same in thought, word and deed, refraining from doing evil to others, speaking that truth which will be wholesome to other beings, freedom from anger, giving up what is productive of evil to oneself, control of the mind, refraining from tale-beariog, compassion to all creatures, freedom from desires, accessibility to the good, shamefulness at the thought of doing what is wicked, Berenity of mind even when the objects of sense pleasure are very near, never yielding to the vicious, forbearance even when injured by others, mental courage in continning to do one's duties even in times of great adversity, the pority (of body and mind) that is Decessary for the performance of such rites as are enjoined in the suistra, freedoin from treachery and freedom from.conceit." So also, it has been said; "Creation 13 is of two kinds -- the god-like and tisuric. The god like are, by nature, always full of devotion to Vishon. The Isuric are the very opposite of this." Those men with a nature like that of the gods would be tested by (our) acharyas for ascertaining their real character as stated in the following slokas: "The disciple" shonld be tested in varions ways for a period of one year, or half of it, or (at least) three months and he should be tanght with compission and withont any thought of gain and the like", and "If a man has come by chance from a distint land with a mind full of the love of the Lord, he should be tanght what he desires withont any prolonged tests". (Having ascertained his fitness), the üchirya wonld reveal (spiritual truths) in such a manner that six ears could not hear them (i.e. that it could be heard only by the sishyu's two ears and the guru's two ears and no other) and only to a disciple who had no desires and was content with what he had in regard to other things and who was keenly desirous oply of learning the s'istrus. Acharyas of olden days would guard these secrets from asuric natures which are different and which have, as their possessions, such attributes as the

following:-- Performing 20A dharma for the sake of praise, delight in the enjoyment of seuse-pleasures which make one indifferent to the knowledge of what is good and what is evil, irrational arrogance, anger, harshness of speech and folly". They would keep the s'astra hidden like a wealthy man who would (guard) a cherished treasure and see to its proper use: 

THE NATURE OF THE TEACHING : 

They would teach their sishyas such truths as the following: 

(1) Tative. “There is a self or utrui which is eternal and different from the body and the senses. Besides these two vis., the entient berus and non-sentient things, there is a Supreme Self whu dwe'ls within all of them as their ruler and who is the s'eshi 

for whom they exist). Other than this Supreme Self there is no one, either oneself or otbers, that can protect the self". (2) Hitu : They will also teach the meins (hita) by which the end can be 

trained, in the following words to be ultered by the s'ishya "Hrom beginningless time, I have been in samsura subject to the cycle of birtis and deaths. In order that I may not have such 

sufferings is dwelling within the embryo, I pray that Thou shouldst Hrant me Thy holy feet and save me." (With these words) and with the uitorance of Dua ya, preceded by obeisance to the succession of gurus, taught graciously by the achirgus, the sishy, should be iilight to seek the feet of Narayana and Sri and surrender his self And whatever is his, as also the burdens or responsibilities connected with then, When be good uchraga has thus introduced the s ishigit to the Lord, the sishya should be made to feel assured that the Lord would never, thereafter, forsake him so that he way live the ret of bis life here in the spirit of good will to every one and tree from all offence and his later life may become the prelude tu moksha. Thus he would teach the s'ishiga what be should do after the surrender of responsibility (bharunyusa) in ag brief á ruanner as would suit the aptitude of the s'ishya.

572 CHAPTER 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

"The soul or self is different from prakriti or matter ; greater than the self is the Saviour who is the Ruler (over all); the supreme good of man consists in the surrender of the responsibility of the self to Him; the end (attained thereby) is existence solely for the fulfilment of Ilis purposes'. In these words our spiritual teachers whose sole wealth was their compassion gave us, of their own accord, as a heritage, the (spiritual) wealth divided into three classes (vix, tativa, hita, purushirtha), when we had surrendered ourselves to them. 

All these words of mine on the three secrets (mantras) found in the earlier and later chapters) are in accordance with the spiritual tradition of Vedānta Udayana, otherwise called, Madappalli ichun, (the preceptor in charge of the kitchen), (who propagated the truths of l'edanta like Udayana commenting on Tarkas cistra). Kidainbi Appullar made me learn these words like a parrot, just as be had learnt them from his own ächürya (his father). (Therefore ) these words are those that illumined his mind owing to the compassion of the Lord and that were gnarded by him without forgetfulness and taught to we without any error. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Those lamps (of spiritual wisdom) which lighted the threshold of a certain huiise (in Tirukkovali!), when, of old, the cow.hord (Sri Krishna) who vouchs:ifed His grace (even) to cattle, came of His own accord and squeezed Himself among those three ancient singers (the first three* ilvārs)-Those lamps lighted there (i,e. their songs) dispelled the darkness of the land and revealed the path indicated in the Upanisbuds which form the concluding part of the four Vedas.

TAMIL VERSE: 

Our great achiiryas, who were absolutely free from ignorance and error, lighted this undying lamp out of con passionate grace, ia the minds of worthy disciples who had grown rich in the true wealth of the performance of orduided rites in a manner which would accord with their knowledge. (They did so) because they desired that the whole world (of meo) should become free from ignorance and adorn their heads with the Lord's feet owing to their longing for Paramapada, 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

The acharya who obeys the successive commands of (the Lord who is) the first achūrya regulates (the minds and actions of) his s'ishyas by methods of instruction which *crcate in thenu noble qualities similar to those in himself and which are like irresistible waves of the celestial sea of his boundless compassion. By doing so, he saves not only the disciple but himself also under the guise of saving him. 

(*NOTE: Gunasamkramal inay mean also “which creale a path for the entrance of their noble qualities into their disciples")31. THE CHAPTER ON THE DUTIES OF A SISHYA. 

T WIL 

1 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

The sishya or disciple should be staunch in his devotion to the guru; he shonld be intent on doing such things as extending the renown (of his guru) (and rendering service to him); he should have the greatest regard for such things as his guru's propesty and his house, he should guard the spiritnal tradition in order to hand it on to another who is worthy; the sislıya who is grateful and is perfect in his performance (vf the ordained rites) is he not sure to attain the trensure (viz.) Bhagavan ? 

THE SERVICE RENDERED BY THE SISHYA TO THE 

GURU IS IN NO IVAY A RECOMPENSE: 

The sāstras say that since the acharya reveals the meanings (and mysteries) of religion like one who reveals to a poor man the existence of a great treasure within his house, the sishya should feel graieful to the úchuirya, who is the great bencfactor, and never do anything against his interests. The sastras declare that the sishya should behave in this way) merely in order that he may not be looked upon with contempt by (those who are in) the two vibhūtis (i, e) this world, the lili tibliti and ihe region of eternal glory (nitya vibhiti) and by the Lord who los tipae (twer) rimlilis. (They give this advice) in order that the (s'ishy) may not Teemble such men as Hiranya and Rivana who did evil to Prahlada and Vibbishana for giving the wholesome advice. It has been stated:- "The in-and who steals larning ( by listening to the sichārya without his periission and in hiding', the man who does evil to his gurit, and the man who speaks all of the Vedas and of the Lord wbo rules over all these men, the s'rutis declare, shonld be punished at once". So when the sishya is asked to behave properly to the guru, it is not to say that, by doing so, he will make due requital or recompense (for what the guru has done 

1. ?? 

31 

DUTIES OF THE SISHYA 

575 

to him), but that he would then avoid the evil consequences for himself (referred to above). 

It is said: "The sishya shunld surrender his body, his property and his life-breath to his guru", and likewise it is said, “The sishya* should give his guru is dakshina the whole of his wealth or one half of it or one fonrth of it. If he is unable to do $0, he should give whatever he can." These slokas state only some of the duties of the sishya like prostration (namaskars) and salutation (abhivadana). They do no not consider this gift as a requital or recompense to the uchiryu, who does not expect any such return and imparts instruction merely as a patter of duty; for it is said: “The guru' should teach out of compassion and without any desire (for profit)". 

When it is stated in the Vedantas that the sishya should behave towards the guru as towards Bhagavan (Himself) and should have as devoted an aflection to the gurie as to the Lord, when it it said, “Tue sishya should never ruisbehave cither with the mind or with the speech or with the borly and should behave towards him as if he is not different or separate from hituself" and further, “The s'ishrau should adore the vichiirya as he does Bhagavan "--when writers like Sandilya and Apastauiba say so, they do not prescure the offer of a fee or recompense. They give the advice merely in order that the s'ishig'a who has the säsira for his eyes Day 1)et become blind of vision with eyes wide open, and in order that he, poor from his birth onward, may not lose this (blisstul) expezivrice which resembles the (blissful) experience of Bhagavan. That all this is no fe or recompense (to the gurie) has been declarrd by Sandilya Bhagavan in the following sloku : “Even the gods cannot make a recompense for the gift of the knowledge of God. The s'ishya should (therefore) give whatever lies in his power to the richuryu who has given biin (this) instruc tion." When it is said " whatever lies in his power", it rueans

that it should be given as an outlet for his affection and regard. The s'ishya should, on Do account, consider himself as having thereby recompensed his guru. 

THE DUTIES OF THE SISHYA : 

The sishya, who is thus without any means of recompensing (his guru), should consider it his duty to behave as follows:-- He should not let the instructions imparted to him become useless like water kept in a skull, by actions and observances opposed to them; for it has been said : - “Water kept in a skull and milk preserved in a water-skin made of dog's leather becoine worthless owing to the impurity of the containers. So also does the s'üstra taught to one who misbehaves. The sishya should not make mere learning an end in itself, for it is said: “That süstra 'which, having been earnt from the üchürya, does not lead to non-attachment (to worldly things), to the performance of dharma or to serenity of mind that sästra, however beautiful in its diction and style, is as useless to the man as the cawing of a crow." He should not eat the vomit, as it were, by making the sästra which comes out of his mouth the means of his livelihood. He should not make the sastra the prostitute's adorament, the sandal paste (chandana) inade only for sale, the bag of parched rice emptied in a thorough. fare, or the garland of flowers in the monkey's hands, for it has been said in ridicule :- Learned to men who study their subjects carefully, again and again, owing to their greed for money make their learning useful to others like prostitutes adorning their persoas again and again to serve (the lusts of) others." 

Learning approached the Brahmio and said, "]" am your wealtb; guard me with care; do not give me away to those who bave no liking (for me). If you guard me in this manner I shall become very powerful". As desired in those words, learning should not be betrayed into the bands of those who already clasp hate and the like in their hands.

577 

The sishya should clearly realise that he cannot make any r'e. compense to the acharya who has enabled him, though born blind, to become fit for the assembly of the immortals that are free from ignorance and error. As tanght in the sloka: “ The man who worships Bhagavan alone (the ekiintin) shonle, while speaking of himself, call himself the follower of Vishon. He should never refer to himself by his village, or his family, for, to him, Bhagaran is every thing". Superior to this is the state (described by Viswa. nitra while addressing Dasaratha ): - " This is adeed befitting one wbo was born of a noble: race and who always calls himself Vasishta's disciple. No one else would call himself so, ( lest of kings”. The s'ishiya should realise that the Saviour* Hlinuself was born in such a family and adopted this form of referring to hinuself and should adopt it in his own life saying :--"You have "reformed me froin wickedness. What requital can I make to 

you?" 

THE IMPARTING OF INSTRUCTION SIIOULI) BE PRECEDED BY MEDITATION OF THE SUCCESSION 

OF GURUS: 

When the s'ishja hands over the great wealth of the truths contained in the gist of the three mysteries (mantras) thus acquired lig binn (from his cichuirga) to one who, as pointed ont in an earlier chapter, has been found fit for it, he should impart instruction first on the succession of ichiryas and reveal also his gratitude (to them) and the sacredness of those truths. As an example are quoted the words of the Brahmarishi Sri Parasara to Bhagavan Maitreya:-- " Brahma, born of the lotus, the grand father of all, first gave instruction to great sages like Daksbu at their request, In that same way was the instruction imparted by them to King Purukutsa on the banks of the Narbada. He banded it over to Sarasvata and by Sarasvata was it imparted to me". When the

man who imparts instruction in the mysteries of the science of the soul is without a tradition and teaches (merely) on the strength of his own reading of the books or of what he over-heard from (a hiding place) bebind a wall, he will, like one who wears stolen jewels. be ever in dread of those that see him. Moreover it inay even become sinful, for it has been said :- "The mantra' which is learnt by mere chance by one in hiding, under some pretext or from books -- that mantra will be of no avail; on the other hand, it may even cause evil". Even when & man has learnt from a guru and then teaches, if he sbould learn and teach against the regulations enjoined for it, he would create disgust in the minds of onlookers like one who wears jewels made from the inoney given to bim along with "Kala '* (These regulations) may be seen in the following slokas " Bow to the guru," ask for explanations, render service to him and then learn the essential nature of the self". 

It is said also, "Maitreya prostrated (pranipatya) before Parasara and made salutations to hiin (abhivadya)". As stated in the s-loka :-"He who impartsla instruction in violation of the regu lations and he who learns violating the regulations — of these two, one will die or will come to bate the other" as stated here, it may even have evil consequences. Even when the nian has learnt according to the regulations and then teaches, if he should not render dne praise to his guru, his sishya may suspect that the truths revealed by him may have no basis (or authority) like para Hitic plants growing (on the branches of trees) and treat them with Jisregard. This omission of giving due praise to one's guru before (ne's sishya is included a one among the thirty-two kinds of offences. It has been stated: “ T'he wise nad should reveal (the greatness of) his guru and guard the mantra with great care. 

(NOTE * Kala : When a man is dangerously ill and longs for recovery. he has the figure of a man (K’alapurasha) made with gingely seeds, decks it with jewels and gives it to a poor man along with money. To receive such a gift is looked upon as a disgusting thing.) 16. Padmasamhita : Charyapada: 23 - 49. 19. Mahabharata : Santi parva: 17. Bhagavad Gita: 4 - 24.

(By this on ission), the wealth of enjoying Bhaga. van with clarity of knowledge and the state of mind wbich consists in the thought of one being il s'esha, which is the cause of the soul or self becoming and continuing as an entity - these two will suffer decline. If, while revealing the greatness of his guru, a man should contradict the teaching imparted to him by the gurn in the sastras, he would be called a vleceiver and become also & sioner, for it is said: "Ile who "leaches astronomy, law, the sustra of expiatory rites and the science of medicine against the spirit of the respective sästras is called a Brahmaghitaku" or one who has committed the sin of killing a Brahipin ". 

Tf a man should fail to impart instruction to a worthy sishya at the appropriate time, he would be called a miser and incur also the sin of violating the Lord's command contained in the sloka : “One should cast off one's body after imparting one's knowledge of the self to a worthy s'ishya. A man should not die without iniparting to a worthy s'ishya that knowledge which is the cause of the world's being (or which is the cause of the world's knowledge)". Therefore when the king's torch-bearer is commanded by the king to go on i certain mission, he would hand over the torch in his hand to some one who is found fit for it and then start (on bis mission). When a inan imparts instruction in a similar manner to a pupil who is apt for it, he should first reveal (the greatness of) his guru and then teach the truths taught to him. Even when, owing to some (favourable) circumstances, he has received divine vision and divine anditions and learnt truths with their help, he should express the truth in the following words: - "I learnt this owing to the grace of my great ūchiirpa. I am not stating what I learnt by my own cleverness" This is what (Sanjaya), for exanıple, says : "By the graces of Vyasa did I hear, directly, this great Yogasastra, which Sri Krishna, who has wisdom and

other attributes taught in person". If he should say so, the truths that he teaches would be held in high esteem. He would (also) then be esteemed as & grateful sishya by sātvikas. As one who spoke the trath, he would be regarded by the Upanishads and by the Person revealed in the Upanishads as an authority having the same validity as they themselves are. His acharya too, would feel gratified to find that, in this grateful and diligent s'ishya, his labours have borne fruit. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

He who imparted instruction in the vidyās or meditations that lead directly and by themselves to moksha -- he is considered in the süstras on moksha as the greatest of ichāryas. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

The Vedas declare that a man attains moksha by having an acharya and the same is declared in the Swritis also. Tchairyas knew that, in this world and so also, in the world beyond, the feet of the acharya are the refuge (for the s'ishya). 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Even (the omniscient and omnipotent) Mayan cannot requite the acharya who dispelled all the darkness (in the mind) by lighting the bright lanıp of wisdom therein. (Therefore) for what was received before (from the acharya), it is indeed very little (that is done by the sishya) in reconting his praise with delight, in constant meditation of him, and in extending his growing renown. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The tip of the achirya's tongne shines hright being the throne on which is seated (the god) Hayagriva. So we do not consider any deity as being higher than the acharya. Even Narayana plays the part of the itchürya without ever giving up His supreme greatness, in order to save those who are sugk in the sea of samsära. 

32. THE CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

There may be found some one who, by the grace of his acharya, bas seen (the truths concerning) the Universe (as distinctly) as if they were a jubube berry (08016 6 5 mil) in the hand, whose illusions have been dispelled and who enjoys (the meanings contained in) such mysteries (mantras) as the moola. mantra. When a worthy sishya baving the necessary virtues has been found, be instructs him in the spiritual tradition and gleans, for his own observances, all that is good in the conduct and obser vances of great men and becomes worthy (himself) of the appre. ciation of the hosts of the eternal sūris. 

TOPICS TREATED OF SO FAR 

Here (in this treatise), we have set forth, just as we learot them ourselves and just as we believe them to be true in our heart of hearts, without giving room to any ignorance, doubt or misconce. ption, the following topics of knowledge in accordance with wbat is sanctioned by the s'rutis, the smritis, the stitras and the ancient tradition and in accordance also with right reason: (1) How the jivatma whose essential nature is such that he is fit to enjoy the bliss of Bhaçuvan just like the stiris - how he has lost this fitness from beginningless time, how later he acquires the spirit of detachment (vairāgja) in some measure, how he comes in contact with a worthy acharya from whom he begins to learn the truths and the means of attaining the ends desired by him; (2) how among the pramāṇas or valid sources of knowledge, the three secrets or mysteries (mantras), are of the greatest importance; (3) how, among the meanings revealed in these (mantras), such things as the relationship of soul and body that exists between the Supreme Ruler and those which are ruled over by Him are the central and most essential doctrines to be learnt (4) how the five subjects of knowledge (artha. panchaka) including that relacionship wbich have been summar.

Narayana).(7) how the man who has clearly learnt these subjects becomes eager for mukti and seeks the upūyas for mukti (8) the classification of those who are competent to adopt the different upayas, (9) the classification of upayas suitable for the competency of different individuals (10) how, ainong the upiigas, the man who wants to adopt prapalli as a direct and independent upüya shuld have certain characteristics or marks of competence (11) the classification of accessories enjoined as appropriate for this upūzes which has to le performed only once (12) the nature of this important duty called the surrender of the burden or responsibility (concerning the self) with its accessories, to be performed by the man (19) how the man that has performed this prapatti with its angas has done what he ought to do, in as much as he has surren. dered the responsibility to one who is the Universal Saviour (14) the signs or marks by which a man could realise that thiis state las been attained by bim (10) low, if he is not so impatient as to pray for inmediate release (hi death), he should, for the rest of his life, render service (to Bhagavan and His devotees) as befitting one whose essential nature (starīpa) is tbat of a s'esha (16) how the service to Bhagavani extends as fiir as service to His devotees (17) how this service should be rendered in accordance with the regu. lations prescribed in the custras, since what is against the liking of the Master, who is the Kuler, rynnot be called service (at all) (18) the ways in which or the means hy whicin the man who has entered on his career of service in accordance with the scistras could avoid offunces from being committed in future and expiate or atone for those committed in the past, (19) how the fit place for the residence of the man who is to render faultless service io times free froin danger or serious adversity is the place where there are temples sacred to the Lord and which are (therefore) resorted to

THE GOOD RESULTS THAT WILL FOLLOW FROM 

A STUDY OF THIS TREATISE: 

The s'ishya should, at first, approach the good üchürya in the proper manner and beg of him in these words : "I am your pupil and have sought you (for guidance). (Therefore) command

me as to what I should do". He should listen (to the acharya's discourse) with reverence and close attention and should also glean with care the advice which wonld supplement (what is taught by the achürzu) as stated in the following sloka :- “One should* observe the wise words of great men and their virtuous ways of life and glean from theru whatever is required for oneself, in the same way as some live on the grain gleaned in the fields." He sbould try to have a clear understanding of what is taught therein by repeated study. 

It has been said: "The hurmas followed by the good is too subtle, U monkey, to be easily understood" and "There is po end to arguments. The Vedas are diverse; the rishis frona whose words truth could be ascertained are many. The truth regarding sharma is hid (as it were) in a cave," and also, " Dharma' is more subtle than the sharp edge of a razor. Who is there competent to declare what it is ? " Thus where even sages have to tread with the greatest care, we have to follow what is stated in the following slokas :- "The way that is followed by great men is the way (to be followed by others)" and "Whatever is said, even in sport, by Brahmins seated in the chariot of the dharma siistras and arnied with the sword of the Vedas --(What. ever is said by them) is considered as supreme dhurina". There fore to walk along the path followed by the ancient uchiiryas who depended solely on the srutis an. tbe smritis and cleared the way so that it may be free from hindrances - to walk along this way is not improper for us. To those who walk along this path, there will be no such painful anxietips as those feit by great sages when they said :- "There is no rest house, no staff for support, no food (on the route) and no one to guide us. It is the path which leads to hell and is too dark to walk alongs. How will you

traverse it alone ?" and “The path leading to the bouse of Yama where there is no water for quenching the thirst, on staff for support, no sharle to sit under, no house or lodge to rest in and which produces prolonged suffering." To one who follows the track of great men, there would be no such painful paths. They need not be tossed about to and fro like cotton cleaned of its seeds, combed, and carded before being spun and go up and come down, like the bucket in a picotah, along the path of smoke (alliimmüdi route)* described in the Panchagni vidyu in the sixth chapter of Chindogja uparishad, 

It has been said :-- "O. Lord,' Thou pinyest, as with balls, with creatures bound by the strings of karma and going up and coming down". To the man who follows the ways of great men, the siate when he is thus a toy for the sport of Bhagavan will soon pass away. Ile will then go along a path wbich is superior to the paths followed by others to attain bigh ends (like sturger), because it will lead to an end or goal greater than all others and will never result in a return to samsüra. It has been said:- "I know' that the path which will be trodden by the man who has exclusive devotion to Bhagavan is for superior to others" and likewise, “He I the" jīva ) starts from the body by an excellent path, which is so cool as to remove the sofferings of sumisira." and further, "lo those "who have practised yoga, (all) sufferings will cease and they will then jourbey by the Deva yana route," This excellent path will terminate in the region (Paramapada) described in the following slokus -- " It is a 'splendid region on reaching which the self will become (itself), (i. e.) free from uvid vir and conse. quently from suffering," " The abodet of the Supreme Being, Vishn:1, shines far more than the sun or the fire. It is so dan

zlingly bright that even the gods and asuras cannot gaze at it," “Those great souls who have completed their practice of yoga and have become free from ignorance and illusion reach that region from which there is no return to this world of samsära." "When compared with the region where the Supreme Being abides, this svarga and other worlds are, my child, like bells". This path (Devayāna) will terminate in Paramapada which is declared in the srutis also as the ultimate terminus of the route leading away from samsāra. The self (that takes that path) will have, for its supporting staff, the grace of Bhagavan, and will have, for the victuals of its journey, the delight in the thought that it will (soon) attain the supreme end of life. As stated in the Brahma-sūtras "' He will stort" from there by the opening of the vein (rūdi) indi cated and lighted by the Tord who dwells within the heart" and take the archiradi route along which, in the respective regions of the gods, he would be greeted and welcomed with honours befitting emperors by the respective deities thereof with auspicious lamps and pitchers full of water (poorìakumbha) and attended by their followers. They will escort the self on its path and those deities to whoin the man made offerings in the world of karma before will (now) pay tribates to his self. The self then passes into regions which are beyond their range and attains a supreme perfection which would make it difficult for it to be distinguished from the eternal siiris when it enters their assembly. The self will then reach under the two feet of the Suprenie „Ruler and Ilis consort who are resting on a couch in Parumapada, the like of which has been described in the Mahibhürata and the Rimiyara in coonec tion with the avatars as their manner of being seated: * Then he saw Sri Krishna scatedlé on a thiude made of gold and adorned with gems and looking like a blue cloud resting on Mount Meru.

Ile was like a mountain lighted up by the sun and bad & crown on His head. Snch was His appearance that, in all the three worlds, there could be found no one to be set in comparison with bim?" and “Sumantra, the charioteer, saw Sri Rama seated like Knbera on & throne inade of gold and having a beautiful coverlet. His body was covered with the paste of saadal red like the blood of the boar, pure, fragrant and of superior quality. Sita was standing by him with a chümara in her hand, like the star Chitra near the moon, His splendour is like that of the sun. Sumantra, who knew the etiquette (suited to courts), bowed with respect to the invincible Sri Rania who ever gave what was asked of him." (Having rench ed the feet of the Supreme Being, the self will receive the privlege of rendering all kinds of service suited to all places, all times aod ill circumstances and be for ever blissful as prayed for in the verse :- “We sliould render, 4o constantly and without inter mission, service to the Lord - such service as will be most appro. priate to all times, to all places and to all occasions". 

Thus (both) in the state of endeavour (upāya) and in the state of attainment, the holy feet of Narayana, the Lord of Sri, are our support. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

The feet of Sri Ranganatha, ever true to tbeir devotees can never be given up; they were once awake to the danger from a mighty wheel (the forın taken by an usura) and hy touching it they tuade it break into pieces): on another occasion, they crawled on all fours and caused the two Maruda trees which grew close to each other to fall down; on the occasion of His searching (for butter) in the pots hanging from above, they stood indistinguish. able from the mortar to which they were bound (by Yasoda), (On a later day), they gladly consented to go on the mission assigned to them by the virtuous Dharmaputra; they came to Bripdavan

to bring about the destruction of the wicked asuras; while gently stroked by the hand of Lakshmi, they became red like the petals of the lotus; they were favourable to the devotion shown by the great sages who wanted freedom form.the bondage of births; they rested in a wonderful vimūnu (having a reserublance to pralava), which was an object of worship to kings of the race of Manu; they shone in the chariot of the righteous Arjupa during the great war; they were inflamed with wrath when they danced on the cruel hoods of the serpent, Kaliya, and made them break down; they rested in a region (Paramapada) that could not be (even) imagined by the six systemis of philosophical thought; they became the subjects of praise in the tongue of the Alvar (Nammalvar), who was the glory of the beautiful city of Kurngai; they had, for ornaments, the fragrant flowers of Tulisi; they showed their glory by graciously transforming the fallea piece of charcoal into a cbild (Parikshit); they chased the armies of the asuras to their destruction.

ing off illusions and errors, as also the nature of the self (as the s'esha of the Lord), the unique compassion of the Lord shown to those who are destitute of upāyas, and the carefree state arising from holding on to the Lord as a refuge as taught in the three mysteries (mantrus)? We have spoken (thus far) to those who can appreciate excellence. SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Our youth has been spent in the enjoyment resulting from repetitions of the words of that prince of Sannyasins (Sri Ram. nnja). Oor days have been lived in happiness by casting off the hell of depending on any others (than the Lord); the arrogance of thuse who are perverse las also been annihilated for the satistaction of good inen; and for the rest of onr life, we shall be earnestly and constantly looking up to the realisation of the vow of compassion taken by that divine couple for the fulfilment of wbose purposes alone we exist. 

TAMIL VERSE:-- 

Ithese thirty-two Tamil verses, which, when recited, are like nectar to the ears (that hear them), which explain clearly, the truths that lie deep within the four Vedas the like of which cannot be seen elsewhere and which becarne possible only owing to the compassion of those ichürgvis who delight, of their own accord, to innpart instruction to s'ishiyas, when they find in then integrity of character and freedom from faults like envy me these thirty-two) verses foru an ornainent to this treatise by virtue of these three qualities viz., their beantiful diction, their wealth of ileas and their fitness for being sung. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

There will be found some one (or other) who has faith in religion, who is keen of intellect and (at the same time) free from envy, whose mind has become pure by following the righteous tradition of good men, whose aim is to attain the highest goal, who

is not afraid of conventional judgments and who would look upon wealth and worldly success as if they were mere trash - He will certainly follow the virtuous path (which is described in this treatise) and which will never beconie obsolete. 

TAMIL VERSE:-- 

Those who have faith in the truths revealed in the Vedas, who have keepness of intellect, who would never think of speaking in depreciation of real nierit, whose minds have become pure by the training which they have received from their gurus, who have lofty aims, who, being firm of mind, would never swerve from the right path owing to the fear of perverted judgements and who would never care for what is worthless -- these men will enter the righteous path which will never become obsolete and which has been indicated by our pure-minded acharyas who had inore for bearance than even the Earth. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

"Our acharyas will say :-- "This is the right path" and will look upon (this treatise) as being delicious like Dectar; they can show how the pleasures of the senses are mean and are different from the righteous way (that is described in this treatise). Owing to their desire that the path indiculed here should prevail, they will overlook any mistakes of ours that may be found (in the book). We huve, by the grace of our «whiryas, accepted this as the proper way. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

I was so ignorant that I did not know even that eight and two make ten ;* Our Madhava who is eager to bestow on us Parama pada, which is most difficult of access, has taught me (through the acharyas) the mantra of eight syllables and the other two mantras (Dvaya and Charama sloka).

TAMIL VERSE: 

These states of mind in regard to one's essential pature, the upāyas and the end to be attained (which are explained in this treatise) and wbich are understood only with effort by even those who are in Paramapada are indeed possible of attainment even here in this world of samsāra. This treatise, though decried by perverse minds bent (only) on finding faults, will be found sweet by the Supreme Ruler wbose lotos-like feet overflow with honey. 

TAMIL VERSE:-- 

The Lord whose face resembles that of a wbite burse (Haya. ghiva) assumed the form of my acharya and, by that device, wrote these truths in my mind and I have (oply) transcribed them on these leaves. The part played by me is none other than this. Whether this treatise is accepted as worthy or rejected 88 unworthy, my clear prind, ( nien of critical minds, will feel neither elated nor Hepressed in the least.
