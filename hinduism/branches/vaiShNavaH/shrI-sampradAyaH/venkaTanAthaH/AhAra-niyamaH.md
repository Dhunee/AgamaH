Thanian:
The vEdhaantha dEsikar,  the one with the grace of
Ethiraajaa stood like a lion and triumphed over many
debating adversaries;  researched the vEdhaas and
saasthraas, with the view to guide us in choosing foods
that ennoble us and avoid foods that debase us, has given
us this prabhandam called aagaara niyamam.  I shall
wear His flower like thiruvadi as an ornament on my
head.

All chEthanaas must understand that there are two kinds
of foods, those that are ennobling (saathveega) and those
that are debasing (thaamasa).   These are described by
KaNNan in sri bagavath geethai, by Ethiraajaa in
srimadh geethaa bhaashyam, and by many rishees in
many saasthraas and smrithees.  By following these
principles, ajakaran attained mOksham.  Likewise, we
must understand and follow these rules.

said that milk from kapilai cow is acceptable for

For the benefit of people who live in this world
characterized by lack of wisdom, Lord kaNNan showed
many principles in saasthraas.  After consulting with
aachaaryaas these principles have been laid out in this
prabhandam.   Guard yourself against the agnostics who
believe only in this transient body and world.  Consume
only those saathvega foods that helps us amplify our
devotion to the thiruvadi of pEraruLaaLan.
