## The goal

Hindu self-cultivation gives one joy, satisfaction, and strength to follow and achieve the various goals of life(puruShArtha), including [dharma](../../social-cultivation/dharma/). This includes attainment of mystic "highs" as a matter of course. With spiritual practices and saMskAra-s, a hindu gets both intellectual and emotional appreciation for his place in the world-tree.

### Anti-self-pity
Contrary to some memetic epidemics which focus on grievance studies and victimhood, the hindu way focuses on positivity - always encouraging the urge to pull oneself up.

> A tamasic, indolent, self-pitying nature (Krsna chides the weeping Arjuna's newfound 'unmanliness/impurity' as being *anarya-juShTam*; unbefitting an Aryan, or even more, befitting a non-Aryan!) won't do!

## Genetics and circumstance
One's circumstance determines to a great extant the level of practice and conservativism suitable for oneself. Genetics is a great determinant of conservativism vs liberalism, for example.

## Hierarchy in practice
The wrong, but unfortunately popular hierarchy of spiritual practice: Adorers of the Absolute > Adorers of personal deities > Adorers of incarnations > Adorers of myriad ancestors, sages and deities > adorers of petty forces and spirits \[rAdhAkRShNan [T](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/640585969859694592)\].
