<p>Title: Tolerance, Exclusivity, Inclusivity, and Persecution in Indian Religion During the Early Mediaeval Period<br>
Author: ALEXIS SANDERSON</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>It is generally believed that already in the early mediaeval period from the fifth century of the Christian era onwards, if not earlier, there existed a single Hindu religion, embracing Vaidika orthopraxy in ac cordance with primary and secondary Vedic revelation (Śruti and Smr̥ti) together with the sectarian traditions of the worship of Viṣṇu, Śiva, Devī, and the Sun God (Sūrya), to mention only the foremost among the deities that attracted personal devotion, that is to say, those whose worship is attested not only in countless temples surviving from that period in the Indian subcontinent and much of South East Asia but also in numerous donative inscriptions and extensive bodies of prescriptive literature. It is also widely believed that this complex unity displays an exemplary degree of religious tolerance, not only between Vaidikas, Vaiṣṇavas, Śaivas, Śāktas, and Sauras, but also between these and the followers of the other two major Indian faiths of the age, namely Buddhism and Jainism.1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>For a survey of the major proponents of this doctrine of the essentially eirenic and tolerant nature  of Hinduism see VERARDI 2011, pp. 41–58. (For full bibliographic details see References at the end of this<br>
essay).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One who wishes to challenge the first of these beliefs might begin by pointing out that before the advent of Islam India lacked any term even loosely corresponding in its semantic range to that of the modern term Hinduism. Sanskrit sources differentiated Vaidika, Vaiṣṇava, Śaiva, Śākta, Saura, Buddhist, and Jaina traditions, but they had no name that denotes the first five of these as a collective entity over and against Buddhism and Jainism.2  +++(What about &ldquo;Astika&rdquo;?)+++</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>The term Hindu (Arabic and Persian hindū), first used by Muslims to refer to the inhabitants of Hind, that is to say, the lands east of the Indus river, who had not embraced Islam, does not appear in any non-Muslim Indian source known to me before the work of the Kashmirian brahmin court historian Śrīvara, learned in both Sanskrit and Persian, who uses it in the late fifteenth century in the Sanskritized form hindukaḥto refer in the Indo-Islamic manner to those in the population of Kashmir who  were not Muslims (variously called yavanāḥ, mlecchāḥ, turuṣkāḥ, and mausulāḥ in Kashmirian Sanskrit  sources). He does so in his Zaynataraṅgiṇī (Jainataraṅgiṇī), covering the last years of the reign of Sulṭān Zayn al-‘Ābidīn (1459–1470), and, in the second chapter, the short reign (1470–1472) of his son and  successor ḥaydar Šāh, and his Rājataraṅgiṇī, covering the reign of ḥasan Šāh (1472–1484) and the first two years of the reign of Muḥammad Šāh (1484–1486).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The passages in these works in which the term hindukaḥ is found are
<ul>
<li>Zaynataraṅgiṇī 2.122–123: oppression of certain Muslims (yavanāḥ) by Hindus (hindukāḥ) leading on the Sulṭān’s orders to retaliatory oppression of the brahmins (dvijapīḍanam);</li>
<li>Rājataraṅgiṇī 1.213ab: Sulṭān ḥasan Šāh’s mother Gul K◌̲h◌̲ātūn is lamented after her death as one who had been to the observances of the Hindus like the sun that causes the lotus to open its petals (hindukasamācāraśata-patra-ravi-prabhām);</li>
<li>1.270: some pro-Muslim (mausulavallabhāḥ) merchants who had<br>
observed Hindu customs from birth (ājanmahindukācārāḥ) slaughter a cow; - 2.503–507: after the death of the tolerant Sulṭān Zayn al-‘Ābidīn the kingdom became bereft of proper Hindu observance; every year more of the calendrical rites prescribed in the [Nīlamata]purāṇa lapsed; and some merchants, favouring the Muslims (mausulapriyāḥ), gave up the observances proper for them as Hindus (svoci tam· hindukācāram· tyaktvā), slaughtering cows and eating their flesh, ashamed of the ways of their ancestors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the distinction between Śrīvara’s two works, hitherto concealed by their publication  as successive parts of a single Rājataraṅgiṇī (Kaul 1966), I follow Slaje 2005. The second work begins with the third chapter of the consolidated edition (Rājataraṅgiṇī 1.213 as cited here = 3.213 of Kaul’s  edition). The evidence of Śrīvara’s learning in Persian, which after the advent of Muslim rule in Kashmir  in 1339 had replaced Sanskrit as the language of court culture, is his Kāvya Kathākautuka, a rendering in  Sanskrit of ‘Abd al-Raḥmān Jāmi’s celebrated Persian narrative poem Yusof o Zoleykā of 1483.</li>
<li>There may be an earlier use of the word by a non-Muslim Indian author. I merely report the earliest uses that I have encountered, these being a century earlier than the earliest occurrences previously noted, namely those in texts of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava tradition, beginning with the Caitanyabhāgavata of Vr̥ndāvanadāsa, c. 1545, cited by Halbfass (1988, p. 192) following O’Connell (1973). There, as in the usage of Śrīvara, the term always appears in contexts of conflict with, or in opposition to, Islam. I note also that the term does not occur in the Rājataraṅgiṇī of Śrīvara’s teacher Jonarāja, which covers the history of Kashmir from 1149 to 1459 (the year of his death). When Jonarāja refers to the ancestral  religion of his community he uses the language of the insider, terming it sadācāraḥ ‘orthopraxy’ (773) and brāhmakriyā (596) ‘rites prescribed by the Veda’, opposing it to the ‘sinful observances of the Muslims’, by which, he says, the kingdom of Kashmir had been defiled (kaśmīramaṇḍale mlecchadurācāreṇa dūṣite [591ab]).</li>
<li>One may ask whether when the term Hindu was introduced following Islamic usage it was used to refer to Hindus in the modern sense, that is to say, to Hindus as opposed to Buddhists and Jainas, or was used to cover the followers of all three non-Islamic religions. It is probable that it was used in the narrower sense, since several centuries earlier the great Khwarezmian scholar Abū Rayḥān Moḥam mad b. Ahmad Bīrūnī (Al-bīrūnī, Alberuni) (973–1050) clearly distinguishes Hindus and Buddhists in his<br>
Indological magnum opus Ketāb taḥqīq mā le’l-Hend men maqūla maqbūla fi’l-‘aql aw mardūla (entitled India in Sachau’s two-volume English translation [1910]); see, e.g., vol. 1 of that translation, p. 7.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the absence of a name does not entail the absence of a corresponding concept. There is evidence, as we shall see, that by the end of the first millennium of the Christian era the consensus had indeed come to conceptualize a complex entity corresponding to Hinduism as opposed to Buddhism and Jainism, excluding only certain forms of antinomian Śākta-Śaiva observance that could not be  reconciled with basic Vaidika values of ritual purity and the separation of castes.</p>
<p>Conservative authorities continued to rail against this soft-focus ‘Hinduism’,  with its blurring of the boundaries between the Vaidika and the non-Vaidika, well into the second millennium of the Christian era, the Vaidikas insisting that the prescriptions of the Vaiṣṇava (Pāñcarātrika) and Śaiva scriptures are invalid in their entirety, being based on scriptures that are not part of the Veda or rooted therein (vedamūla-),3 the Śaivas insisting on the absolute superiority of their own revelations and the ultimate inefficacity of those of the Vaidikas and the Vaiṣṇavas, and the Vaiṣṇavas insisting that they too were Vaidikas in spite of Vaidika rejection and in keeping with this insistence fervently condemning the Śaivas,4 in spite of the fact that the Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava systems of observance have much more in common with each than either has with the Vaidika.5</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>An outstanding case of this conservative stance is that of Aparāditya, a twelfth-century ruler of  North Konkan, who devoted much learned effort to resisting the drift into acceptance of the initiated  Śaivas in his long comment on Yājñavalkyasmr̥ti 1.7, the verse that lists all the valid means of knowing  one’s religious duties (dharmapramāṇāni) (vol. 1, pp. 9–20).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>The Vaiṣṇava stance has been expounded with great clarity by Yāmuna in his Āgamaprāmāṇya. According to Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition, his life span was ad 916/17–1038, a barely credible 121 or 122 years. Mesquita (1973) has proposed that he lived from 966/7 to 1038. The attempt of Yāmuna in South India to persuade the deeply sceptical Vaidikas that the Bhāgavatas are real brahmins reflects a wider struggle. For the objections raised by the Vaidikas against the Bhāgavatas’ claim as presented by Yāmuna are found in much the same form about a century earlier in Kashmir in Jayanta’s topical play Āgamaḍambara, where they appear on the lips of a disgruntled Vaidika officiant (r̥tvik), who complains bitterly  about the attempts of the Bhāgavatas to intrude themselves into the brahmin community by pretend
ing to be brahmins themselves (4.3, prose, 4.4, prose).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But the middle ground saw in Śaivas and Pāñcarātrika Vaiṣṇavas proper, that is to say,  in those who had taken initiation (dīkṣā) into these soteriologies and practised their special rites, only variants of observance applicable to specific communities added to the ancient bedrock of Vaidika religion without detriment to the latter; and this view came, as we shall also see, to be accepted not only by the orthoprax  but also by many, perhaps even most, of the initiated themselves. As for the un initiated, whose only rite of religious empowerment had been the upanayanam  that qualified a man for Vaidika observance and the recitation of the Veda, they  had themselves long since developed their own modes of Vaidika worship of the deities of the initiated and integrated them into their daily rites, privileging one  deity as an expression of personal devotion but generally including the others in a syncretistic approach that, through its daily repetition in countless households, must have done much to express and nourish this sense of the greater unity that came to be called Hinduism.</p>
<p>The thinking behind the concept of this as yet unnamed Hinduism is by its  nature more tolerant than the views that we shall see below of the strict adherents of its competing components. But it is strictly brahmanical: Buddhism and Jainism remain invalid in this thinking.</p>
<p>However, while certain states did at times adopt a hostile attitude towards<br>
these two non-Vaidika faiths, we may surmise that in general it was not politic for Indian and Southeast Asian governments during the early mediaeval period to adopt a policy that strongly disadvantaged their Buddhist and, in the case of the subcontinent, Jaina subjects. As we shall see, this supra-brahmanical perspective,  which I see as an answer to the socio-legal question of what forms of religion the state should tolerate or support and which are truly beyond the pale of the per missible, also finds its voice in the learned literature of our period.</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>On the intimate connection between the Pañcarātra and the Śaiva tradition of the Mantramārga see Sanderson 2009a, pp. 61–70.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stopping short of accepting that all forms of religion are within the law or, rather, that any form  of religion is above the law, since it excludes the most blatant forms of antinomian  observance, it nonetheless requires tolerance of these long-established traditions.</p>
<p>In this perspective it may be said that Indian and Southeast Asian states generally propagated tolerance in matters of religion. But it is not the case that any of the individual religions that came within the purview of this tolerance were  tolerant by nature. The long-entrenched contrary view, that the Indian religions  were essentially tolerant, cannot reasonably be maintained in the face of the carefully formulated views of the adherents of these Indian traditions and evidence of sporadic outbreaks of intolerance and persecution. If the religions that flourished during the early mediaeval period in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia  enjoyed in many regions and periods an enviable degree of peaceful co-existence,  this must be explained not through an argument from essence, which leads in evitably to the overlooking or dismissing of contrary evidence, but in terms of a  balance of influence in which no one religious tradition was in a position of such strength that it could rid society of its rivals, a balance of power sustained by the policy of governments. +++(5 anaṅgīkārē’py ayaṁ sāraḥ)+++</p>
<h2 id="vaidika-exclusivity">Vaidika Exclusivity</h2>
<p>Let us now begin by looking at the extremes that reject or contradict this unity.  Any claim that tolerance of religious diversity is at the heart of Hinduism must overlook the view of the Vaidikas, whose theoreticians flatly denied the validity of any religious practice that was undertaken on the authority of texts lying outside the Veda (vedabāhyāni), that is to say, outside the Vaidika scriptural corpus of Śruti and such secondary literature (Smr̥ti) as was accepted to derive from it. Thus in the ninth or tenth century Medhātithi 6 states in his erudite commentary on the Manusmr̥ti: 7</p>

<p>The texts that may not be drawn on, because they contradict the Veda and<br>

Firstly they are] these well-known works of religion-cum-irreligion rejected by Vaidikas and accepted [as scriptures] by the Sāṁkhyas, the followers of the Yoga school, the Pāñcarātrika Vaiṣṇavas, the Pāśupatas,11 the Buddhists, and the Jainas.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="11">
<li>By the time of Kumārila, an approximate contemporary of the Buddhist Dharmakīrti, who was active sometime between c. 550 and 650, the Śaiva Mantramārga was well enough established to attract trenchant criticism from the latter. Its earliest scriptural texts go back to the fifth to sixth centuries, inscriptions recording the initiation of kings following its procedures are attested from the seventh onwards, and epigraphical evidence of its monastic institutions goes back to the late sixth (Sander son 2013b, pp. 235–236). It is extremely improbable, therefore, that Kumārila was familiar only with  the Atimārga and not also with the Mantramārga. I am therefore inclined to think that he is using the  term Pāśupata here to cover the Pāśupatas and all subsequent Śaiva developments up to his time, understanding it as meaning ‘one who follows what has been taught by Paśupati’, where Paśupati is to be understood simply as a synonym of Śiva (see, e.g., Nāmaliṅgānuśāsana 1.1.130–134). The same  will apply to Medhātithi’s use of the term Pāśupata in my preceding citation. Both authors are perhaps using what they considered to be the properly Vaidika expression for the teachings of Śiva, following  Mahābhārata 12.337.59ab: sāṁkhyaṁ yogaṁ pañcarātraṁ vedāḥ pāśupataṁ tathā.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>These hide in the shadow cast by a screen of pious observance containing some elements of the Veda’s teaching; but their real purpose is to win<br>
social approval, wealth, veneration, and fame. They are contrary to the Veda  and incoherent. The greed and other [vices of their authors] are manifest.  They have been composed on the basis of arguments framed within the limits  of [the means of non-transcendental knowledge, namely] sense-perception,  inference, analogy, and presumption. They are perfumed with the fragrance of  a handful of teachings congruent with Śruti and Smr̥ti, [advocating such virtues as] non-violence, truthfulness, self-control, generosity, and compassion;  but [at the same time] they propagate teachings of a quite different nature, teachings that are little more than means of making a living, by demonstrating the occasional successes of a handful of spells and herbs able to counteract  the effects of poison, to subject people, to drive them out, to drive them mad, and so forth. And [secondly they are] the works even more remote [from the<br>
Veda] (bāhyatarāṇi) that prescribe [observances] that are contaminated by<br>
[culturally alien] practices proper to barbarians (mlecchācāramiśra-), such as eating from a skull-bowl (kabhojana-) and wandering naked (nagnacaraṇa-).12</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<ol start="12">
<li>Here I propose that Kumārila wrote mlecchācāra-miśra-kabhojana-nagnacaraṇādi rather the edition’s reading mlecchācāra-miśra-kabhojana-nagnācaraṇa, and, as my translation shows, I analyse this compound as mlecchācāramiśra-kabhojana-nagnacaraṇādi, taking ka- in the meaning ‘human head’, ‘skull’ (syn. kapālam) (see, e.g., Abhidhānaratnamālā 5.61). In this I am swayed by the testimony of a  parallel discussion in Medhātithi, Manubhāsya on 2.6: syāt tādr̥śī vedaśākhā yasyām ayaṁ narāsthip ātra-bhojana-nagnacaryādir upadiṣṭo bhavet, ‘There might well be a branch of the Veda [now defunct]  which is such that in it such [practices] as eating from a vessel made from a human skull and wandering naked might have been prescribed’. Jhā (1924) did not see the reference to the skull-bowl users here, dividing the compound as mlecchācāramiśraka-bhojana-ācaraṇa and translating it as follows: ‘absolutely repugnant practices fit for Mlecchas, such as the eating together of many persons, and the like’.  Similarly Kataoka 2011, pt 2, p. 351: ‘barbarian customs, i.e. the practice of eating together’. Evidently  this ‘eating together’ renders Kumārila’s miśrakabhojana-. I argue against this interpretation in detail  in my forthcoming Śaivism and Brahmanism. Those who ate from a bowl fashioned from a human skull  were the ascetics of the Lākula and Kāpālika traditions of the Atimārga and, in the Mantramārga and  Kulamārga, persons engaged in the propitiation of Bhairava and/or Cāmuṇḍā/Kālī through the practice of the Kāpālika observance. On the three Mārgas (Ati-, Mantra, and Kula-) see Sanderson 2014.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Kumārila’s and Medhātithi’s ‘wandering naked’ (nagnacaraṇam, nagnacaryā) probably refers to the  practice of wandering Jaina mendicant ascetics. See also Medhātithi on 4.30: ‘The pāṣaṇḍinaḥ are the red-robed, the naked wanderers, and others, who adopt the insignia [of religious observances] that are  outside [the Veda]’ (pāṣaṇḍino bāhyaliṅgino raktapaṭanagnacarakādayaḥ). The expression ‘red-robed’ (raktapaṭaḥ) is commonly used as a somewhat undignified term for Buddhists in non-Buddhist sources, as in Āgamaḍambara, prose before 1.17 (bho raktapaṭa) and 3.26 (raktapaṭocchiṣṭaṁ), and Śaṇkara,  Brahmasūtrabhāsya on 2.2.35, and the pairing of Buddhists and Jainas is standard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Concluding his argument he points out that greed and other such base urges<br>
(lobhādi) are a sufficient explanation of the source of all these traditions, and that they themselves make no claim to be Veda-based (vedamūlatvam). So, he says, it is these that are referred to by Manu when he speaks of followers of forbidden religious  practices (pāṣaṇḍinaḥ) and rules that they should not be honoured even with speech:13</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The householder] should not honour even with speech those who follow<br>
forbidden religious practices,14 those who practice professions forbidden to  their caste, those who practice religion for profit, deceivers, those who reason  [against the teachings of the Vedas], and pious hypocrites.</p>

<li>The term pāṣaṇḍin-, often misleadingly translated ‘heretic’, is defined as I have translated it here by Medhātithi’s gloss on pāṣaṇḍam, from which pāṣaṇḍin- is formed by the addition of the possessive suffix,<br>
in his commentary on Manusmr̥ti 1.118: pāṣaṇḍam pratiṣiddhavratacaryā ‘pāṣaṇḍam is to practice a forbidden religious observance’ and on 5.89: śāstra-parityāgena bāhya-darśanāśrayaṁ nara-śiraḥ-kapāla-raktāmbarādi-dhāraṇaṁ pāṣaṇḍam - ‘pāṣaṇḍam is to turn one’s back on the teachings [of the Veda] and  thereby to carry the skull of a human head, to wear red robes and the like, [practices] that are proper to religions outside [the Veda]’. The term ‘heretic’ is better reserved to denote professed followers of  a religion whose views or practices reject or are seen as rejecting the established norms of that same religion. From the Vaidika point of view those it terms pāṣaṇḍin- are apostates rather than heretics, Vaidika observance being seen as the default and all other faiths as arising through its rejection.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The context of this prohibition is the behaviour of householders towards uninvited guests (atithiḥ), the respectful feeding of whom is one of their cardinal duties. Commenting on this verse Medhātithi says that if a would-be recipient of food belonging to these prohibited categories arrives at the home, which in our  present context means any follower of the Pañcarātra or of any one of the Śaiva  systems, a Buddhist, or a Jaina,15 he is not to be greeted respectfully, nor to receive the customary enquiries concerning his birth and learning, nor to be offered a seat and the rest. He may be fed, but only as one feeds untouchables and the like.16</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol start="15">
<li>The South Indian Vaiṣṇava Yāmuna cites a text without attribution in his Āgamaprāmāṇya (p. 26, ll. 9–7) that rules on the authority of Smr̥ti that the term pāṣaṇḍam covers the whole range of non Vaidika systems: the Vaiṣṇava Pañcarātra, the Śaiva [Mantramārga], the Pāśupata, the Kāpālika, Buddhism, and Jainism.</li>

<p>Likewise a verse from an unidentified Smr̥ti text cited with approval in the<br>
digest-like commentary on the Yājñavalkyasmr̥ti attributed to Aparāditya, the  twelfth-century Śilāhāra ruler of North Konkan: 19</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol start="19">
<li>There were two Aparādityas among the Śilāhāra kings of North Konkan. The earliest known inscription of Aparāditya I is dated in ad 1127 (cii 6:20), and his reign ended in 1148 (cii 6:62). Aparāditya II  has dated inscriptions from 1184 to 1197 (cii 6:30–32, 63). The last known inscription of his predecessor  Mallikārjuna is dated in 1162 (cii 6:29) and the first known inscription of his successor Anantadeva II is  dated in 1198 (cii 6:33). Kane has argued (1930, p. 334) that the great commentary on the Yājñavalkyasmr̥ti is more probably to be assigned to the first of these two Aparādityas on the grounds that the  work is quoted in the Smr̥ticandrikā of Devaṇṇabhaṭṭa. This is because he dates that work c. 1200  (1930, p. 346) on the evidence that it cites Vijñāneśvara and is cited by Hemādri. This would not preclude Devaṇṇabhaṭṭa’s having known a work by Aparāditya II, but it would, he argues, leave uncomfortably little time for the work to have become well enough known to have been cited as an authority.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This is less compelling than it seems, since Hemādri tells us that he wrote while he was a minister of  Mahādeva, the Seüna king of Devagiri, who ruled from 1260 to 1271, as Kane himself agrees (1930,  p. 357). There is therefore no good reason to date Devaṇṇabhaṭṭa as early as 1200 on the grounds that  he is cited by Hemādri, and there is therefore no good reason to doubt that the Yājñavalkyasmr̥tiṭīkā was by Aparāditya II solely because it was cited by Devaṇṇabhaṭṭa.</li>
<li>However, that the author of that work was indeed Aparāditya I does find some support in a fact not noted by Kane, namely that the colophons of that work describe the author simply as the Śilāhāra king Śrīmad-Aparādityadeva, which  is as we find Aparāditya I modestly identified in his inscriptions (cii 6:20–22 [śrīmadaparādityadeva- or<br>
śrī-aparādityadeva-]). Aparāditya II assumed the much grander title of Mahārājādhirāja (cii 6:32).</li>
<li>A further point in favour of Aparāditya I is that the author of the commentary on the Yājñavalkyasmr̥ti is  uncompromising in his rejection of the non-Vaidika religion of the Pāñcarātrikas and Śaivas, whereas  Aparāditya II, as we can see from inscriptions, had one Vyomaśiva/Vyomaśambhu, an initiated Saiddhāntika Śaiva officiant, as his chief minister (Mahāpradhāna/Mahāmātya), as did his immediate predecessor on the throne, Mallikārjuna (r. c. ad 1155–1170). See cii 6:29, 30, and 32.</li>

<p>If he sees Kāpālikas, Pāśupatas, Śaivas [of the Mantramārga], or Kārukas,20 he should gaze at the sun [in order to purify himself]. If he has come into physical contact with them he should bathe.21</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<ol start="20">
<li>The Kārukas of this passage are a group closely related to the Lākulas and sometimes take their  place when the totality of Śaivas is intended, as here, through the listing of their four major types:  Pāñcārthika Pāśupatas, Lākulas/Kālamukhas, Kāpālikas, and [Mantramārgic] Śaivas. Cf.</li>

If he has seen one he should utter [the Mantra] oṁ namaḥ Śuciṣad and then glance at the sun . . .

<p>Nor was this vituperative rejection of all religious traditions other than the  Vaidika confined to theory. For Manu goes so far as to exhort kings to put it into  practice by expelling all followers of such religious systems from his kingdom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The ruler] should expel from his capital without delay any gamblers, news mongers, men of violence, men adhering to non-Vaidika religious observances (pāṣaṇḍasthān), men engaged in occupations not in keeping with their  caste, and publicans. For if these are present in the kingdom they are like  thieves in disguise for the king. They constantly oppress his virtuous subjects  with their deviant activities.24</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="24">
<li>Manusmr̥ti 9.225–6. In his commentary on this passage Bhāruci makes it clear that although Manu states only that they should be expelled from the capital (purāt), the implication is that they should be exiled from the whole kingdom: ‘He should expel them from the capital. It is implied that these should be expelled from the whole kingdom too (rāṣṭrād apy ete ’rthato nirvāsyāḥ), since the effect of their  banishment from the kingdom [and the capital] is the same.’</li>
</ol>
<p>For the Vaidikas, then, there certainly was no Hinduism as defined in our<br>
opening paragraph, since they looked with abhorrence on all systems, including the Vaiṣṇava Pañcarātra and the varieties of Śaivism, that deviated from their definition of orthopraxy; and, as we have seen, the Manusmr̥ti, far from tolerating these with indifference, urged the state to banish their adherents. Moreover, it enjoined the orthoprax to avoid dwelling in any place where they were numerous.25</p>

<li>Manusmr̥ti 4.61: ‘He should not live in any kingdom governed by Śūdras, in one full of people who neglect their religion, in one occupied by communities adhering to non-Vaidika religious observances (pāṣaṇḍi-gaṇākrānte), or in one beset by the lowest born.’ Medhātithi gives in clarification of the last the case of Balkh (bāhlīkāḥ) in ancient Bactria between the Hindu Kush and the Amu Darya (Oxus), which, he accurately reports, was beset by people of alien culture(s) (yathā bāhlīkā mlecchaiḥ).</li>

</ul>
<p>It may be doubted that the Manusmr̥ti’s rule of exile was often if ever implemented; but the idea that it should be put into effect survived centuries during  which the non-Vaidika systems flourished and Śaivism among them rose to become the dominant religion of the era.26</p>

<p>For this survival is gently satirized  in Kashmir around the turn of the ninth and tenth centuries in Jayanta’s play  Āgamaḍambara (‘Much Ado About Religion’). There two Vaidikas – an officiant  (r̥tvik) and an instructor (upādhyāyaḥ) – face the failure of the ultra-orthoprax camp to persuade the state to revert to a purely Vaidika utopia free of Śaivas, Pāñcarātrikas, Buddhists, and Jainas. The official protest of its champion, the Snātaka Saṁkarṣaṇa, fresh from his long training in the Veda, had met with initial success. The government of Kashmir had agreed to ban a particularly antinomian and subversive cult of the Kaula type known as the Black-Shawl Observance  (nīlāmbaravratam), a measure whose historicity is confirmed by another source.27</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol start="27">
<li>That the suppression of the followers of the Black-Shawl Observance was not the theatrical invention of Jayanta but a historical fact is attested by Jayanta himself in his philosophical masterpiece  Nyāyamañjarī. For he writes there (vol. 1, p. 649, l. 4): ‘King Śaṇkaravarman, knowing the nature of [true]  religion (dharmatattvajñaḥ), banned (nivārayām āsa) the Black-Shawl Observance, in which uninhibited couples would indulge in many [indecent] activities (-aniyatastripuṁsavihitabahuceṣṭam) wrapped in a single black shawl (asitaikapaṭanivīta- em : amitaikapaṭanivīta- Ed.), because he realized that it was  without precedent (apūrvam), having been invented (kalpitam) by some libertines.’ That this was a variety of Kaula Śākta-Śaivism is apparent from the account of it in the Āgamaḍambara, where it is clearly a cult involving unrestrained sexual indulgence and the drinking of intoxicating liquor, only meat among the Kaulas’ three M’s (madyam, māṁsaḥ, and maithunam; see Tantrāloka 29.97–100b, quoting the Yogasaṁcāra) failing to be mentioned here. It is confirmed by the account of the Śaiva scriptural canon quoted from the otherwise lost Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṁhitā by Takṣakavarta in his Nityādi-saṁgraha-paddhati, an account that was the locus classicus for the Kashmirians. For this includes a Nīlāmbara in its list of ‘eight Kaula[tantra]s’: nīlāmbaraṁ sutāraṁ ca sandhyā yogini-ḍāmaram | svāyam-bhuvaṁ siddha-mataṁ gaṇākhyaṁ khecarī-matam | aṣṭau kaulās tv amī khyātāh sadyaḥ-pratyaya-kārakāḥ (Nityādi-saṁgraha-paddhati f. 10r13–14). Some of these, including Nīlāmbara, also appear in a list of Śaiva  scriptures in the Kaula Kularatnoddyota f. 2r2: nīlāmbaraṁ ca tārākhyaṁgaṇākhyaṁ khecarīmatam.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This is not the only report of action against this cult. According to a story about its followers, the Nīlapaṭa-prabandha, contained in the Purātana-prabandha-saṁgraha (p. 19) compiled by the Jaina scholar Jinavijaya Muni, King Bhoja, the famous Paramāra emperor who ruled from Dhārā in Mālava  for most of the first half of the eleventh century (on his date see Sanderson 2014, p. 16, fn. 61), heard  about this cult from his daughter, who told him that she was going to join it. He then invited all of its  adherents, forty-nine couples in all, to assemble in his presence on the pretext that he wished to be come their devotee, executed all the men, and sent the women into exile. That they were Kaulas is  evident from a verse that they recite in answer to Bhoja’s asking them whether they are happy: ‘There  aren’t rivers flowing with wine; there aren’t mountains made of meat; and the whole world doesn’t  consist of women. How [then] can a Nīlapaṭa [“one of the Black Shawl (cult)”] be satisfied?’ (na nadyo  madyavāhinyo na ca māṁsamayā nagāḥ | na ca nārīmayaṁ viśvaṁ kathaṁ nīlapaṭaḥ sukhī). For this is  a variant of a verse about Kaulism cited by Rājānaka Jayaratha on Tantrāloka 15.169c–170b: na nadyo  madhuvāhinyo na palaṁ parvatopamam | strīmayaṁ na jagat sarvaṁ kutaḥ siddhiḥ kulāgame.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But this led to panic among the Śaivas in general, who felt that they too might  be driven out. The status quo is restored by the king by summoning Saṁkarṣaṇa,  finding him a wife, favouring him with the (white parasol and other) insignia  of distinction (mānaiḥ),28 a golden fillet for his head (paṭṭabandhena),29 and the honorific Śrī- (śrīśabdena),30 and putting him in charge of the Department for the Protection of Religion (dharma-rakṣādhikāre niyuktaḥ) with authority through out the kingdom.</p>

<p>In this office he goes forthwith to the hermitage of the ascetic<br>
Bhaṭṭāraka Dharmaśiva, apparently the official representative of all the Śaiva groups in Kashmir, to reassure him that the Śaivas will not be further targetted.</p>
<p>The officiant laments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What a disaster! The way things have turned out is not at all what we en visaged. We imagined that all the religions outside the Veda would be  suppressed and that in this state of affairs the result would be (vedabāhya sakalāgama-tiraskāreṇa) that the whole kingdom would become our fiefdom (sarvam asmad-bhogyam eva bhuvanaṁ bhaviṣyatīti cintitam). But the outcome is that the alien religions (bāhyāgamāḥ) are in precisely the same position as before (yathānyāsam eva). For [v. 4.1]:<br>
These Śaivas, Pāśupatas, Pāñcarātrikas, Sāṁkhyas, Buddhists, Jainas, and the rest, are all enjoying exactly the same status as before. Damn  the Snātaka [Saṁkarṣaṇa]’s useless erudition!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Upādhyāya responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My friend, [the Snātaka] has now become the servant of the king, has he not?  And the king is entirely devoted to Śiva (paramamāheśvaraḥ). So it is inevitable that [Saṁkarṣaṇa] should be directing all his thoughts to winning his favour. For [v. 4.2]:<br>
In the presence of kings their servants habitually do nothing but par rot their commands and being greedy to enhance their positions they  no more distinguish between what is good or bad than echoes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The officiant agrees but asks how they can survive as Vaidikas in a society that<br>
under-values them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is indeed as you hold, my friend: it is a rare man that in disregard of his  own interests will impartially restrict his thoughts to what is ordained by the Veda. But how are we to survive [here] when we can support ourselves only by  purely Vaidika services such as performing sacrifices for others [in my case]  and teaching the Veda [in yours]?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Upādhyāya says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My friend, we shall live out our future as we have our past, satisfied with nothing more than a mouthful of food and cloth to cover us. The real world, it seems, no longer pays more than lip-service to the orthoprax Vaidika position. The non-Vaidika elements have become too strong to be<br>
suppressed, and the Vaidika camp is too weak, and impoverished, to lobby successfully to diminish their power. The king, Śaṇkaravarman, is after all a devotee  of Śiva inclined to be indulgent towards all forms of established religion,31 and his queen, Sugandhā, we are told, favours the Pāñcarātrikas, as does, according to  report, one of the king’s functionaries.32</p>

<h2 id="the-śaivas-inclusivist-view-of-their-own-and-the-vaidikas-religion">The Śaivas’ Inclusivist View of Their Own and the Vaidikas’ Religion</h2>
<p>As for the Śaivas, they likewise seem to undermine the unity of Hinduism by insisting not merely on the validity of their own scriptures but also on their superiority to the Vaidika scriptures and indeed to the scriptures of all non-Śaiva systems. This was already so in the earliest known Śaiva initiatory system, that of the  Pāñcārthika Pāśupatas of the Atimārga, whose ascetic initiates were to see themselves as having severed all ties with the Vaidika religion, leaving behind their former obligations to the gods and ancestors to focus their devotion on Śiva/ Rudra alone;33 and it continued to be so in the Mantramārga, even though this  later form of the religion, in evidence from about 450–550 onwards, expanded  the community of the initiated beyond that of ascetics, important though they  continued to be, by opening up initiation to householders, allowing them, indeed requiring them, to remain in this status after they had received initiation.</p>
<p>It might appear, therefore, that Śaivism was as much distinct from, and  opposed to, the religion of the Vaidikas as the latter was to the former and as  both were to Buddhism and Jainism. However, while the Śaivas thought their  scriptures superior to the Vaidikas’ and the Vaidikas thought their own superior, the two traditions’ views of each other were not symmetrical, not at least  where the Śaivas of the Mantramārga were concerned, these alone having left  us adequate evidence of their views on this issue. For while most Vaidika theoreticians during this period condemned the Śaiva scriptures as false, the Śaivas  of the Mantramārga held unanimously that the Śruti and Smr̥ti of Brahmanism are universally and uniquely valid in their own sphere, that of prescribing the conduct and religious observance obligatory for persons in their identity as mar ried and unmarried members of the caste-classes (varṇāśramadharmaḥ), and that as such they are man’s sole means of valid knowledge both of all actions (karma)  that benefit and harm the soul’s destiny in the domain of recurrent incarnation (samṣāraḥ) and of the nature of the consequences of these actions, from the rewards of the heavens to the tortures of the hells.</p>
<p>Nor did they deny the reality of Brahmanism’s goal, that of liberation</p>
<ol start="33">
<li>See, e.g., Kauṇḍinya, Pañcārthabhāṣya on 2.9: ‘This brahmin’s qualification and obligation to make<br>
offerings to the gods and his ancestors applied [only] before [his initiation]. Therefore he should [now]<br>
withdraw devotion from these gods and ancestors and in place of both fix his heart on Maheśvara and<br>
worship him and no other. The word ca here [in pitr̥vac ca] expresses prohibition. It implies that the<br>
reason why he should no longer make offerings to the [other] gods and his ancestors is that they lack<br>
the agency that he used to attribute to them.’

(mokṣaḥ), offered to those who aspired to escape recurrent incarnation through<br>
knowledge, unmotivated obedience to ritual injunctions, or both. They denied<br>
only that it was ultimate, holding that true, definitive liberation lay beyond it and<br>
could be reached through Śaivism alone, by undergoing initiation in the pres
ence of the Maṇḍala of Śiva (śivamaṇḍaladīkṣā) and then following the Śaiva ritual<br>
and meditative disciplines, or, in the case of those prevented by incapacity or so
cial responsibilites from taking up those disciplines, notably their royal patrons,<br>
through initiation followed by fervent devotion manifest in support of the Śaiva<br>
religion and its institutions.
Nor was the validity of the Vaidika scriptures irrelevant to the Śaivas within<br>
their own world of Śaiva rites and belief. Indeed Sadyojyotis, who is much the<br>
earliest of the commentators on the Śaiva scriptures whose works have reached<br>
us – he flourished sometime between the second half of the seventh century and<br>
the beginning of the ninth, probably no later than the first half of the eighth34 –<br>
insisted that the defence of the validity of the Vaidika scriptures (Śruti and Smr̥ti)<br>
is essential to a belief in the validity of the scriptures of the Śaivas themselves.
He offered two cogent reasons. The first is that if the Vaidika scriptures were<br>
not the source of valid knowledge in their domain, as the Buddhists and Jains insist,<br>
then Śaivism’s central claim that it frees the initiate from the cosmic hierarchy of the<br>
levels of incarnation would be empty. Śaivas must believe that the Vaidika scripural<br>
corpus is valid because the initiation rituals prescribed in their scriptures and per
formed by Śiva himself through their officiants bring about the progressive freeing<br>
of the soul from a cosmos created and maintained for and by the enactment and con
sequences of meritorious and demeritorious actions, and these actions, as we have<br>
seen, are held by the Śaivas to be good and bad on the authority of the Veda alone.
The second reason – and it is this that is more weighty in an assessment of<br>
the lived relations between Śaivism and Vaisika orthopraxy – is that the Mantra
mārga’s scriptures themselves insist that the rules of the Vaidika socio-religious<br>
order are binding on Śaiva initiates. Śaivas were subject to that order at the time</li>
<li>See Sanderson 2007a.
171
33211 Honoris Causa 3P.indd 171 11/18/15 5:22 PM
Honoris Causa
of their initiation, and to the extent that they chose to continue to live within it<br>
after their initiation they were enjoined to continue to adhere to its rules.35
That the Śaiva scriptures do indeed require this conformity is well illustrated<br>
in the following passage, much cited by the commentators:
So he should not transgress (na laṅghayet) the practices of his caste-class and<br>
[Vaidika] discipline (varṇāśramācārān) even in thought (manasāpi). He should<br>
remain (tiṣṭhet) in the discipline (āśrame) in which he was when he was initi ated into the Śaiva religion (dīkṣitaḥ śivaśāsane) and [at the same time] main tain the ordinances of Śiva (śivadharmaṁ ca pālayet).36
There is another respect in which the Vaidikas’ view of Śaivism and the Śai
vas’ view of Vaidika religion were asymmetrical. For while the Vaidika tradition<br>
made no attempt to justify its validity in Śaiva terms, the Śaivas, in their eager
ness to establish themselves in what was by that time a fundamentally brahman
ical society, attempted to persuade the orthoprax that the Śaiva corpus was valid<br>
not only because it recognized the Vaidika ordinances as binding on all including<br>
the Śaivas themselves but also by attempting to undermine the Vaidikas’ attacks<br>
on the legitimacy of their religious practices by pointing to the abundant evidence<br>
of the promotion of the worship of Rudra or Śiva, by then considered one and the<br>
same, that is found both in Śruti texts and in the secondary Vaidika scriptures.
Thus in his commentary on the Mr̥gendratantra the tenth-century Kash mirian Saiddhāntika Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha cites the presence of such practices<br>
in the traditions of all four Vedas. The passage on which he is commenting is the<br>
narrative introduction to the Tantra.37 In the hermitage of Badarī, Bharadvāja</li>
<li>For this argument see Sadyojyotis, Nareśvaraparīkṣā, 3.74–76. I have emended yatnaṁ sarvaṁ karoti in 74b to yatnaṁ sarvaḥ karoti following Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha’s paraphrase in his commentary:<br>

and other sages install an image of Śiva and undertake asceticism before it. The<br>
god Indra comes to the hermitage and asks them why they are not following the<br>
religion of the Veda (codanādharmaḥ). They reply that the method of propiti ating Śiva with asceticism that they are following is indeed Vaidika and point<br>
out (v. 6) that the Veda contains Mantras whose deity is Rudra and procedures<br>
for causing him to come into one’s presence. In his commentary on this verse<br>
Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha elaborates, citing a six-month-long ascetic procedure for<br>
the summoning of Rudra into the propitiator’s presence taught in the now lost<br>
Rudrakalpa that was a supplement (Pariśiṣṭa) of the Śrautasūtra of the Kāṭhaka<br>
Yajurvedins, the use of the long Yajurvedic litany known as the Eleven Rudras<br>
(rudraikādaśinī saṁhitā), probably its recitation while one inundates the Liṅga<br>
(rudrābhiṣekaḥ), a practice still current among the Taittirīya Yajurvedins in the<br>
Śiva temples of South India, sacrificial procedures using Mantras and chants of<br>
the r̥gveda and Sāmaveda found in the r̥gvidhāna and Sāmavidhāna, and proce dures for the propitiation of Rudra found in the Atharvavedic corpus.
Similarly, in his commentary on Sadyojyotis’s Mokṣakārikā Bhaṭṭa<br>
Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha’s son Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha turns to the corpus of secondary<br>
Vaidika scriptures, arguing that these contain abundant historical evidence that<br>
Śaivism was accepted by venerable figures of remote antiquity whose standing as<br>
men learned in the Veda is beyond question. He cites the rule that Śaivas must<br>
remain in their castes and life-disciplines, not transgressing the ordinances of<br>
those institutions even in thought, and then addresses the Vaidikas as follows:38
So this [teaching of Śiva] is not a forbidden form of religion (na pāṣaṇḍatvam)<br>
even from your point of view [as Vaidikas]. This is because it does not conflict<br>
with the Vedas, and because there is [Vaidika] scriptural evidence that it was<br>
accepted by men learned in the Vedas. In the Purāṇas, the Mahābhārata,<br>
and the like we learn that Śveta, Upamanyu, and other great sages under
took religious practice within this [teaching of Śiva]. In the [Mahā]bhārata<br>
we learn that Nara, Nārāyaṇa [=Arjuna and Vāsudeva], and Aśvatthāman</li>

did the same, in the words ‘The god that you [Aśvatthāman] have worshipped<br>
in an anthropomorphic image in every age those two have worshipped in the<br>
Liṅga,’39 and also that it was by propitiating Śiva that the Lord Vāsudeva<br>
achieved his goal in Suvarṇākṣa, as is related in the verse ‘O Kr̥ṣṇa, you will<br>
be the man most dear to me in the world; and the whole world will turn to<br>
face you [in adoration]. Of this there is no doubt,’ [and Paraśurāma received<br>
the axe with which he slew Kārtavīrya.] 40 Moreover in the Smr̥tis we have<br>
references to such pious acts for the benefit of the public (pūrto dharmaḥ)<br>
as that of establishing a temple [of Śiva, as in] ‘He who makes a temple of<br>
Śiva, built with baked bricks’ 41 and ‘in pious acts for the benefit of the public<br>
one should know [that the reward is] liberation.’ 42 Then there is the evidence<br>
of our own eyes in the form of the Pr̥thukeśvara [of Pr̥thu], the Rāmeśvara<br>
[of Rāma], and [many] other [Śivas that have been installed in temples by<br>
exemplary Vaidikas in ancient times]. Furthermore, the Veda confirms the<br>
validity of the teaching of Śiva in such Upaniṣads as the Śvetāśvatara and in<br>
Mantra-texts such as the Atharvaśiras. So none of the [three] faults that would<br>
entail the invalidity [of the Śaiva scripture] from your point of view applies:<br>
there is no disagreement [concerning the omniscience of Śiva, the creator of<br>
our scriptures], there is no lack of proof [of their validity], and they have not<br>
been adopted by a small minority.43</li>

So Mantramārgic Śaivism, while claiming to transcend Brahmanism by offer
ing true liberation, was nonetheless closely tied to it. It was the Vaidika world<br>
rather than the Buddhist or the Jaina through which Śaivas rose to salvation; and<br>
on their path thereto they continued to be bound by its rules, adding their Śaiva<br>
obligations rather than substituting them for the Vaidika. They looked, more
over, to the Vaidika scriptural corpus to provide proof of the validity of their own<br>
scriptures. The evidence adduced as proof is not cogent, since none of it refers to<br>
the specific practices of initiatory Śaivism; it refers only to forms of propitiation<br>
that had long been part of Vaidika observance. Nonetheless, the attempt reveals<br>
the concern of the Saiddhāntikas to be considered valid by the adherents of the<br>
Vaidika tradition that they claimed to rise above.
The Properly Śaiva Attitude of Śaivas<br>
Towards Their Vaidika Rites
Now this extension from the purely Śaiva domain of the ascetic in the Atimārga<br>
into the Vaidika domain of the Śaiva householder added in the Mantramārga<br>
opened the door to a process of Śaiva-Vaidika hybridization, in which rites of<br>
both kinds were maintained and co-ordinated without a proper sense of their<br>
distinctness. The Śaivas’ theoreticians, aware that this development had the<br>
potential to produce a blurring of the boundary between the two domains<br>
that would undermine the faith of Śaivas in the independence and supremacy<br>
of Śaivism, ruled that while initiated Śaiva householders were thus subject to<br>
two bodies of injunction – both the Śaiva and the Vaidika – their attitude<br>
towards adherence to the latter was to differ fundamentally from that of the<br>
Vaidikas.
Two passages of early Saiddhāntika Śaiva scripture much cited by the com
mentators clarify this attitude. The first of these is in the Sarvajñānottara. In the<br>
context of its prescription that only persons in two of the four Vaidika disciplines,<br>
those of the unmarried scholar and the married householder, may be consecrated<br>
as Śaiva officiants, it tells us that the Śaiva should maintain his Vaidika obser
vances after initiation but without believing that they are fully real. He is to do<br>
them but without subjective commitment. He should not think that by accom
modating Vaidika rites beside the Śaiva he brings about a doubling of the benefit<br>

that he will derive or that if he were to omit them he would damage that benefit.<br>
He is to see himself as acting in this regard not for his own advantage but so as<br>
not to undermine through a pointless non-conformity the Vaidika order within<br>
which Śaivism is embedded.44
The second passage is in the Mataṅgapārameśvara. This clarifies the matter<br>
in the language of the Mīmāṁsā by saying that though the initiate should main tain his Vaidika duties, here called ‘the mundane observance’ (laukikācāraḥ), he<br>
must not conceive of them as ancillary elements (aṅgam) of his Śaiva observances,<br>
which is to say, as elements without which those observances would be incom
plete and therefore inefficacious.45
The Śākta-Śaiva Attitude Towards Vaidika<br>
Observance Among Initiates
The view seen in the Sarvajñānottara that the Śaiva should conform to Vaid
ika injunction only for the sake of others tended not to be emphasised in the<br>
later Saiddhāntika exegetical literature, which seems to be more eager to stress<br>
conformity with Vaidika injunctions than to justify this from a properly Śaiva<br>
standpoint. But the Śākta-Śaiva scholars of such traditions as the Krama and<br>
Trika, whose ritual practice was further distanced from Vaidika norms than<br>
the Saiddhāntikas’, preserved a strong emphasis on Śaivism’s transcendence,46
even arguing that the true reason for conformity with Vaidika observance was<br>
spiritual immaturity. Thus Abhinavagupta’s pupil Kṣemarāja (fl. c. 1000–1050)<br>
asserts that one should continue to perform the Vaidika ritual of venerating the<br>
Juncture of the day (brāhmī saṁ dhyā) before one venerates it in the Śaiva manner<br>
(śaivī saṁ dhyā) only so long as one’s mind is in thrall to one’s constructed social<br>
identity as a member of a caste. In support of this position he cites a passage<br>
from the Saiddhāntika Svāyambhuvasūtrasaṁ graha to the effect that the Vaidika</li>

<li>Mataṅgapārameśvara, Caryāpāda 2.2–7b.</li>

tolerance, exclusivity, inclusivity, and persecution . . .
ritual of the Juncture is optional but the Śaiva compulsory. But he leaves out that<br>
part of the passage in which we learn that the option applies only in the case of<br>
ascetics. His reason for doing so is evidently that he wishes the text to support<br>
the view that one should aspire to drop the Vaidika elements of one’s ritual pro
gramme even if one is not an ascetic, seeing persistence in these as symptoms of<br>
a contracted state of mind that all Śaivas, householders included, should strive<br>
to transcend.47
Nonetheless, it is unlikely that this Śākta-Śaiva view of the accommodation<br>
of Vaidika ritual had a negative impact on the integration of such Śaivas within<br>
Vaidika society. Kṣemarāja speaks here of an ideal adjustment within the largely<br>
private domain of the Śaiva householder’s daily ritual rather than a wholesale re
jection of conformity in the socio-religious domain. And this is in line with other<br>
elements of transcendence that set the Śaivas engaged in Bhairava and goddess<br>
worship apart from the Saiddhāntikas. Thus, for example, when a Saiddhāntika<br>
participated in a collective meal with other initiates he was not to sit in a line that<br>
contained persons of a caste other than his own. If he did so he was to do penance,<br>
its severity determined by the degree of the caste difference, being doubled if the<br>
contaminator was a Vaiśya and trebled if he was a Śūdra.48 But according to the<br>
Svacchanda, the principal scripture of the non-Saiddhāntika Dakṣiṇa system of</li>
<li>Kṣemarāja on Svacchanda 2.14c: ‘This veneration of the Juncture (sandhyāvandanam) is done with<br>
the Mantras of Śiva, but first it is done with the Mantras of [one’s] Veda. That is the duty of those in<br>
whom there lingers the deep-seated mentality of identification with the caste that was theirs [before<br>
they entered the casteless “caste” of Bhairava (bhairavajātiḥ) through initiation] (anivr̥ttaprāgjātivāsa naiḥ kāryam). The rest should do it with the Śaiva Mantras [alone], immediately after they have com pleted the ritual bath. As has been taught [by Śiva in Svāyambhuvasūtrasaṁgraha 7.9cd]: “He may or<br>
may not do the Vaidika [Sandhyā ritual]; but it is compulsory that he should do the Śaiva”.’ On the early<br>
Śākta-Śaiva attitude to caste, and other Vaidika dualities, such as that of the pure and the impure, see<br>
Sanderson 1985, pp. 198–205 and endnote 69; Sanderson 2009a, pp. 292–297; and Sanderson 2009b.</li>
<li>Trilocanaśiva, Prāyaścittasamuccaya p. 25: ‘He should always avoid when eating sitting in the same<br>
line (ekapanktiḥ) as persons of a different caste (bhinnajātibhiḥ). A brahmin who eats unknowingly with<br>
persons of a Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, or Śūdra caste and abandons his meal in the middle as soon as he realizes<br>
this, should declare this, and then [as his penance] repeat the Aghoramantra ten, twenty, or thirty times<br>
respectively. If he realizes [what he has done only] after the meal has been finished [he should repeat<br>
it] one, two, or three hundred times respectively.’

Bhairava worship, initiates may be arranged in separate rows on such occasions<br>
only according to their rank as initiates. They must never separate themselves in<br>
accordance with the distinctions between the castes in which they were at the time<br>
of their initiation (prāgjātiḥ). They must see themselves as having become equal<br>
members of a single ‘caste’ of Bhairava (bhairavīyā jātiḥ), and they must know that<br>
if they make any reference to the former caste of an initiate they will be guilty<br>
of a sin that will lead them to hell. In short, says the text, if one wishes to attain<br>
one’s goal, be it salvation or Siddhi, one must be free of all caste discrimination<br>
(avivekī).49 But there is no suggestion that this transcendence of caste distinctions<br>
should be applied on the socio-religious level in such matters as marriage. The<br>
fact that Abhinavagupta cites the Sarvajñānottara with approval for its view of the<br>
necessity of general conformity, and does so even in the context of an argument<br>
that the considerations of relative purity and impurity that dominate Vaidika<br>
behaviour are subjective (pramātr̥dharmaḥ), makes clear that no such subversive<br>
transcendence was envisaged.50
The same is the point of a Kaula verse cited by the Śākta-Śaiva Jayaratha in<br>
this context and also by the Smārta Aparāditya, though in that case with the con
trary purpose of demonstrating the insincerity of the Śaivas’ conformity:
He should be a Kaula in private (antaḥ kaulo), a Śaiva in outward appearance<br>
(bahiḥ śaivo), but a Vaidika in his mundane observances (lokācāre tu vaidikaḥ),<br>
keeping the essence [of his religion hidden behind these two outer layers], just<br>
as the coconut fruit [keeps its milk within its flesh, which in turn is enclosed<br>
by its hard outer shell].51</li>

tolerance, exclusivity, inclusivity, and persecution . . .
In the same spirit the Tārātantra, a text from the later East Indian Śākta tra
dition, tells us concerning the orgiastic gathering of Śākta initiates known as a<br>
‘circle of Bhairavī’:
Once the circle of Bhairavī has commenced (ārabdhe bhairavīcakre) all [the<br>
participants, whatever their] caste-classes are the best of brahmins (sarve var
ṇā dvijottamāḥ). But as soon as it has ended each returns to his or her separate<br>
station. If a person, being deluded, makes distinctions of caste (jātibhedaṁ . . .<br>
karoti) within the sacred circle, then without doubt he will fall into a terrible<br>
hell from which it will be hard to escape.52
A Śaiva-Vaidika Socio-Religious Hierachy<br>
under Royal Authority
The Śaivas, then, advocated a two-tiered Śaiva-Vaidika socio-religious system,<br>
with the Vaidika subordinate to the Śaiva. To achieve this new order they ex
erted themselves to secure the support of royal patrons, without which no such<br>
aspiration could be realised, and though the details of how they proceeded to this<br>
end in particular cases are mostly inaccessible to us now, epigraphical and other<br>
evidence reveals that they were successful in their endeavour in many parts of the<br>
subcontinent and Southeast Asia.
It is at least clear from their prescriptive literature that they expanded their<br>
ritual repertoire to support this endeavour, by introducing a form of initiation<br>
for rulers that not only promised the benefit of liberation at death and, in this<br>
life, the heightening of the initiand’s temporal power, but also departed radically<br>
from tradition by exonerating the beneficiary from all the time-consuming and<br>
arduous ritual duties that were the usual consequence of initiation. A king who<br>
was devoted to Śiva (paramamāheśvaraḥ) could receive the prestige of initiation</li>
<li>Tārātantra quoted in the Sarvollāsatantra, p. 80. I conjecture ārabdhe for ārambhe in the first<br>
verse.

without any of its inconveniences, being required thereafter only to maintain the<br>
support of the faith that is the duty of any lay (uninitiated) devotee (śivabhaktaḥ,<br>
upāsakaḥ).
The Saiddhāntikas also developed a Śaiva version of the royal consecration rit
ual (rājyābhiṣekaḥ) to be given to a king after he had received this Śaiva initiation.<br>
The Naimittikakriyānusaṁdhāna of Brahmaśambhu, completed in ad 938/9,53 the<br>
earliest surviving guide to the Saiddhāntika Śaiva rituals, states that the purpose<br>
of this ceremony is to qualify the king for his office as the guide and guardian<br>
of the system of the castes and disciplines.54 This is none other than the role as
signed to him by purely Vaidika authorities; 55 and accordingly the Mantra recited<br>
at the climax of this empowerment, as the water of consecration is poured, is not<br>
Mantramārgic but rather the long-established verse text of the (royal) consecra
tion Mantra prescribed for this purpose by Varāhamihira in the first half of the<br>
sixth century on the authority of the Older Garga.56 But since it is as an initiated<br>
Śaiva that the king is to assume this role, it is evident that the socio-religious or
der entrusted to his care is not just that envisaged by the Vaidika authorities but<br>
rather the expanded religion that comprised both the Vaidika and the Śaiva tra
ditions. For the Śaiva literature elsewhere requires him to ensure that the strata<br>
of this complex of injunction are maintained in the proper order of relative au
thority, with the Vaidika subordinate to the Śaiva, promising him that to do so</li>
<li>Naimittikakriyānusaṁdhāna f. 103r–v2: ‘On the tenth day of the bright fortnight of the first month<br>
of autumn in the 860th year of the king of the Śakas I, disciple of the abbot of Mattamayūra, have de
clared this procedure for initiation that adheres to the teaching of the Dviśata[kālottara] and should be<br>
given by a Guru to Gurus initiated in his own lineage to terminate his holding of his tenure of office.’</li>
<li>Naimittikakriyānusaṁdhāna f. 74v1 [4.118]: ‘I shall now teach in addition the consecration cere mony to empower an initiated king as the guide and guardian of the castes and disciplines (varṇānām<br>
āśramāṇāṁ ca gurubhāvāya bhūpateḥ | yo ’bhiṣekavidhiḥ so ’pi procyate dīkṣitātmanaḥ).’ See Sander son 2009a, p. 255, fn. 593.</li>

<li>See Br̥hatsaṁhitā 47, especially 47.55c–70 Varāhamihira himself says only that the Mantra was<br>
‘taught by the Muni’ (47.51d: mantro ’tra munigītaḥ). It is his commentator Bhaṭṭa Utpala who in a com ment on this statement identifies the Muni as the Older Garga: munigīto muninā vr̥ddhagargeṇoktaḥ.

will guarantee him a long reign and the prosperity of his kingdom, and implying<br>
thereby that failing to do so will have the opposite consequences.
We see all this clearly enunciated in a passage of the Mohacūrottara, one of<br>
a number of as yet unpublished scriptures of the Śaiva Mantramārga known as<br>
Pratiṣṭhātantras.57
These texts, as their name indicates, are concerned to regulate the practice<br>
specific to the class of Mantramārgic Śaiva officiants known as Sthāpakas, who<br>
specialized in the installation (pratiṣṭhā) of temples, their images, and monaster ies, and in the planning of settlements and royal palaces, and the layout of the<br>
towns around them. After prescribing the proper disposition of the habitations<br>
of the various castes around the palace of an emperor (mahārājādhirājaḥ) it says:
Tradition declares that the king is the protector of his subjects. Therefore it<br>
is right that he should protect the caste communities and ensure that they are<br>
instructed in their duties, each according to its station. The sources that con
vey these duties are Śruti, Smr̥ti, Purāṇa, and the [Śaiva] scriptures (āgamāḥ).<br>
If the king abides by these he enjoys a long reign. [The correct order of author
ity in which they should be applied is as follows.] The Vedas [comprising both<br>
Śruti and Smr̥ti] take precedence over the Purāṇas, and the [Śaiva] scrip tures take precedence over the teachings of the Vedas.58 There is the common<br>
[Vaidika authority of Śruti, Smr̥ti, and Purāṇa] (sāmānyam), and then there<br>
is the special (viśeṣam). The Śaiva [scriptures] (śaivam) are the latter. [So] the<br>
learned should not doubt their authority when they find that they conflict<br>
with [a Vaidika injunction]. The all-knowing [master] should adjudicate each<br>
case objectively [by this criterion]. Given the plurality of scriptural authori
ties, whenever there is a question as to which of two [conflicting] statements<br>
takes precedence, he should adopt that which has been taught by Śiva. He</li>
<li>On the canon of these texts see Sanderson 2014, pp. 26–27 and fn. 100.</li>
<li>The Vedas here must be understood to include Smr̥ti, that is to say, the Dharmaśāstras, if this<br>
statement is not to contradict the preceding assertion that the (non-Śaiva) sources of the knowledge<br>
of duty are not only Śruti (the Vedas in the narrow sense) and Purāṇa but also Smr̥ti.
181

should reconcile the two, whether self-sufficient or depending for the under
standing of their meaning on [examination in the light of] other sources of the<br>
same kind, related sources, and [, where they fail,] learned exegesis, by apply
ing such modes of reasoning as presumption (arthāpattiḥ). Understand this, O<br>
Indra, and thereby attain the ultimate bliss. When the king understands the<br>
duties of religion in this way his realm will always prosper.59
This model, in which the Vaidika ordinances are maintained under the aegis<br>
of Śaivism, might be suspected to have been more ideal than real were it to rest on<br>
this prescriptive evidence alone. However, it is in harmony with what is conveyed<br>
by the historical records of the period. They certainly do not support a position<br>
that the rise of Śaivism during these centuries led to a corresponding decline in<br>
the hold of the Vaidika order. On the contrary, they point to a renaissance in that<br>
sphere; and they show that Śaiva kings were active in promoting it.
A good part of the inscriptions that have come to light from this time con
sists of thousands of copperplate charters in which kings, including those who<br>
were Śaiva, have recorded their establishing Vaidika brahmins in their territories<br>
through grants of tax-exempt land, thus fulfilling one of the principal duties im
posed on them by Vaidika scripture, extending the penetration of Vaidika ober
vance, while facilitating the administration of their territories and promoting<br>
agricultural development.
Further, numerous kings, Śaivas prominent among them, have been com
mended during this period, particularly at its beginning, for having imposed the<br>
system of castes and disciplines (varṇāśramadharmaḥ) in their newly established<br>
kingdoms, this frequently being presented as a restoration after a period of de
cline.
Nor was this promotion of Brahmanism by Śaiva kings restricted to the socio
religious level. It extended on occasion to the commissioning of the horse sacrifice<br>
(Aśvamedha) and other solemn (Śrauta) Vaidika rituals. These were associated<br>
with the acquisition and celebration of sovereignty; but their performance was</li>
<li>Mohacūrottara ff. 21v6–22r2 (4.275–281).
182
33211 Honoris Causa 3P.indd 182 11/18/15 5:22 PM
tolerance, exclusivity, inclusivity, and persecution . . .
also a signal of a king’s desire to be seen as an exemplary supporter of the Veda,<br>
dedicated to the revival of Vaidika religion in its entirety.
So the epigraphic record indicates that there were numerous Śaiva kings<br>
throughout our period who fully accepted their role as the guardians of the<br>
Vaidika social order and thus conducted themselves in matters of religion in the<br>
manner envisaged by Brahmaśambhu and the Mohacūḍottara. Indeed, in many<br>
cases their panegyrists have portrayed them as zealous propagators of that order,<br>
praising them for their efforts to reverse the decline in the hold of the Vaidika<br>
order on society.60
The Loss of Transcendence
This double religion, combining the Vaidika religion and Śaivism under royal<br>
authority, was from the point of view of all Śaiva theoreticians a two-tiered hi
erarchy with Śaivism on top and the Vaidika religion below. The theoreticians’<br>
ahistorical and fundamentalist presentation depicts no overlap between the two<br>
levels, no encroachment of one upon the other, or rather it uses theory to outlaw<br>
any such encroachment.
Nonetheless, when we see that the Vaidika domain has been so comprehen
sively accommodated we are bound to look for evidence of a weakening of the<br>
orthoprax Vaidikas’ rejection of Śaivism and also of a commensurate adoption<br>
by Śaivas themselves of a view of their religion that surrendered the doctrine of<br>
its transcendence. We may well imagine Śaivas who had abandoned all sense of<br>
their religion as a path above the Vaidika, who saw themselves simply as Śaivas<br>
by birth, who claimed for their scriptures no more than that they apply to them<br>
as Śaivas, that there is nothing special about initiation, that it is merely a rite<br>
of passage into ritual activities peculiar to their group, and that these activities<br>
are much like the practices of other groups, Vaiṣṇava and orthoprax Vaidika, of<br>
similar social standing.</li>
<li>Space prevents me from setting forth here the epigraphical evidence of the engagement of Śaiva<br>
kings in these efforts to promote Brahmanism in their kingdoms. It has been presented in detail in my<br>
forthcoming Śaivism and Brahmanism.

Jayanta
We do indeed find evidence of both these developments. The earliest appears on the<br>
Vaidika side near the end of the ninth century in the Nyāyamañjarī of the Kashmirian<br>
philosopher Bhaṭṭa Jayanta, minister of king Śaṇkaravarman (r. c. ad 883–902) and<br>
author of the Āgamaḍambara, the humorous play about the religious tensions of the<br>
day that I have cited above. He states that he undertook the monumental Nyāya
mañjarī in order to protect the authority of the Vedas; and this commitment is ap
parent throughout.61 Yet he argues for the validity of the Śaiva scriptures: 62
But as for the scriptures that we see which are other than [those of the Vedic<br>
corpus], they too are of two kinds. Some, such as those taught by the Buddha,<br>
are completely at odds with the Veda. But others, such as those taught by Śiva,<br>
are certainly not, merely teaching optional modes of religious observance that<br>
differ [from those of that corpus]. I declare that of these the scriptures [of<br>
the latter kind, those] taught by Śiva and [Viṣṇu,] are undoubtedly (tāvat)
valid. This is (1) because we find in the cognitions that they produce none of<br>
the numerous defects that give rise [in other cases] to doubt or refutation,<br>
[and] (2) because we are unable to impute any of the motives such as greed and<br>
delusion that might otherwise explain their creation, since both Smr̥ti texts<br>
and inference establish that these too were authored by God (Īśvara). For we<br>
find in them no record of their having come into existence at a specific time<br>
[after the creation]; and we find in them, as in the Veda, numerous instances<br>
of ekadeśasaṁvādaḥ [, that is to say, of] ‘the verification of claims made in<br>
part [of the corpus’, claims which when they have been put to the test and</li>
<li>Nyāyamañjarī, vol. 1, p. 7, ll. 6–9: ‘As for the system of the Nyāya taught by Akṣapāda, it is the cen tral pillar [that holds up the edifice] of all the other branches of learning. This because it is the means of<br>
safeguarding the authority of the Vedas. For if the Vedas have their authority overturned by the false<br>
reasonings authored by false philosophers, the commitment of the pious would slacken. Why then<br>
would they devote themselves to the task of putting its injunctions into practice, a task that among<br>
other things requires great expense and exertion if it is to be accomplished successfully?’</li>
<li>Nyāyamañjarī-Āgamaprāmāṇya, ed. Kataoka, p. 152, l. 3 to p. 154, l. 8, corresponding to Nyāyamañ jarī, vol. 1, p. 635, l. 6 to p. 637, l. 2.

found effective evince confidence in the truth of its statements on matters that<br>
must be taken on trust]. So what scope remains for the postulation that they<br>
have some other source [such as human greed or ignorance]? Nor [, unlike the<br>
scriptures of the Buddhists and others,] do they stand in opposition to the<br>
Veda. For they do not abandon participation in the system of the four caste
classes and [four life-disciplines] established by [the ordinances of] the Veda.
The manner [in which we establish the validity] of the injunctions of<br>
Manu and the other [promulgators of secondary scripture] cannot<br>
apply to the Śaiva scriptural corpus. But that does not entail its in
validity. [For] throughout its texts we find clear understanding of the<br>
well-known teachings of all the Upaniṣads pertaining to the ultimate<br>
goal. Moreover, even the foremost of those who have mastered the<br>
Veda, such as Kr̥ṣṇadvaipāyana, support the view that the teachings<br>
of the Śaiva scriptures and [the like] are valid. And he has taught that<br>
this validity also applies to [the corpus of Vaiṣṇava texts called] the<br>
Pañcarātra. For they too contain nothing that requires us to dismiss<br>
them as devoid of authority.63
Moreover, they contain the declaration that Lord Viṣṇu is their author; and<br>
he is just God himself (Īśvara) [under another name].
Because one beginningless soul with infinite power, the wondrous<br>
(kasyacit) cause of the creation of the entire universe, undertakes the<br>
[three] distinct tasks of creating the world, holding it in existence, and<br>
withdrawing it [again at the end of each cycle], it has come to be per
ceived as [three distinct deities:] Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Rudra.
Furthermore, at various places within the Veda we have the texts ‘Rudra<br>
alone remained. There was no second’ (eka eva rudro ’va tasthe na dvitīyaḥ)</li>
<li>He refers to Kr̥ṣṇadvaipāyana, alias Vyāsa, as the author of the Mahābhārata, which does indeed<br>
assert this validity in the Mokṣadharma provided that one understands the term pāśupatam to refer in<br>
the meaning ‘that taught by Paśupati’ (following Aṣṭādhyāyī 4.3.101: tena proktam) to Śaivism in general<br>
rather than specifically to the Pāśupata system. He anachronistically includes under that heading the<br>
Saiddhāntika Śaiva scriptures, and accepts, as some did not, that the passage authorizes not just the<br>
study of these texts but also the enacting of their injunctions.

and ‘Viṣṇu strode out over [all] this’ (idaṁ viṣṇur vi cakrame); and means of<br>
union with these [deities], [that is to say] methods for their propitiation, are<br>
certainly enjoined in the Veda too. As for the methods taught in the Śaiva<br>
scriptures and the Pañcarātra, they are certainly different; but this does not<br>
amount to an [invalidating] contradiction of the Veda, because these [various]<br>
methods [Vaidika, Śaiva, and Pāñcarātrika] are alternatives from which one<br>
is free to choose. So these two [bodies of scripture, the Śaiva and the Pañ
carātra,] are not invalid, because they have been composed by a competent<br>
authority [namely God himself] and because they do not contradict the Veda.
Here, then, is a view that has accepted much of the Saiddhāntikas’ own ar
gument for the validity of their scriptures, namely (1) the evidence of compliance<br>
with Vaidika ordinances, a feature that Jayanta takes to differentiate them mark
edly from such teachings as those of the ‘Veda-rivalling’ Buddhists, which, as he<br>
claims shortly after the passage quoted here, actually forbid adherence to to these<br>
ordinances; 64 and (2) that of validation by the Vaidika scriptures themselves. In
deed it appears, if Cakradhara’s commentary on the Nyāyamañjarī expresses a<br>
widely held view, that in this aspect the Naiyāyika defense of the Śaiva scriptures<br>
had actually attempted to strengthen the case made by the Śaivas themselves<br>
by claiming that even the ceremony of Śaiva initiation (dīkṣā), the centrepiece of<br>
the Mantramārga’s bid to be considered superior to the religion of the Veda and<br>
for this very reason one of the principal grounds for its rejection by the theoreti
cians of Vaidika orthopraxy, has been validated by the unquestionable evidence<br>
of Vaidika scripture.65</li>
<li>Nyāyamañjarī-Āgamaprāmāṇya, p. 154, l. 31 to p. 155, l. 1: ‘For in the case of the teachings of the<br>
Buddha their being outside the Veda is fully manifest, since they stress that one should avoid behaving<br>
in keeping with the duties imposed by the caste in which one was born.’ Jayanta refers to the Buddhists<br>
and others as ‘Veda-rivalling’, p. 197 [156], l. 6: vedaspardhino bauddhādayo niṣeddhavyāḥ.</li>
<li>Cakradhara, Nyāyamañjarīgranthibhaṅga, p. 379, ll. 21–23: ‘Showing in the Dānadharma [of the<br>
Śāntiparvan of the Mahābhārata] that Upamanyu taught Kr̥ṣṇa the dīkṣā taught in those teachings he<br>
has made this validity of the Śaiva scriptures clear.’ He has in mind here Mahābhārata 13.15.4ab: ‘And<br>
on the eighth day I was duly initiated (dīkṣito ’haṁ yathāvidhi) by that learned brahmin.’ This is in fact a<br>
spurious argument, since Dīkṣā here is not Śaiva initiation but ‘[a period of] ascetic restraint’ (syn. vra

tolerance, exclusivity, inclusivity, and persecution . . .
A significant part of the Saiddhāntika defense of their system is lacking here,<br>
namely Sadyojyotis’s argument that the Śaiva scriptures presuppose the validity<br>
of the Veda to the extent that Śaivism collapses if that presupposition is not de
fended, which is to say that for the Śaivas the proof of the validity of scripture<br>
(āgamaprāmāṇyam) must of necessity encompass both the Śaiva and the Vaidika<br>
corpora. Evidently that is because the acceptance of this argument is incompat
ible with even the most tolerant Vaidika view, since it is inseparably connected<br>
with the doctrine that Śaivism is superior to the faith of the Veda, accepting the<br>
validity of the Veda in its sphere only because it needs to believe that its initiation<br>
is liberating the soul from real bonds.
It is in the same spirit, I propose, that Jayanta puts forward here the vague<br>
and inaccurate claim that the teachings of the Śaiva scriptures are consistent with<br>
those of the Vaidika Upaniṣads.
This in short is a view that accommodates the religion of the Śaivas but over
looks what makes that religion unique in their own estimation, choosing not to see<br>
the respects in which the teachings of the Śaivas differ from those of the Vaiṣṇava<br>
and Vaidika traditions in matters of metaphysics and soteriology, even though<br>
some of these positions bear strongly on their sense of identity and purpose. The<br>
price of recognition, then, is that the Śaivas must accept a watered-down version<br>
of themselves, one in which they are no longer the inheritors of a uniquely effica
cious vehicle of salvation, but subscribers to an ecumenism that argues that there<br>
is but one god with many forms and names teaching various paths that lead to<br>
the same goal. They are invited in other words to see themselves as just another<br>
equipolent component of the complex that would come to be called Hinduism.
We might be tempted to see this view of Śaivism as idiosyncratic. It certainly<br>
does not seem to to be found in the work of any other Vaidika authority of this<br>
tam), a common usage in that text; see, e.g., 2.16.13c: ‘emaciated because of his Dīkṣā’ (dīkṣākr̥śatanuḥ);<br>
5.118.7abc: ‘having reduced her body with various kinds of fasting, with Dīkṣās, and restraints’ (upavā saiś ca vividhair dīkṣābhir niyamais tathā | ātmano laghutāṁ kr̥tvā); and 13.130.50ab: ‘having observed<br>
the Dīkṣā for twelve years’ (cīrtvā dvādaśa varṣāṇi dīkṣām).

period.66 However, Jayanta himself blocks this line of thought by stating categor
ically that his position is that of the greater society (mahājanaḥ), which he defines<br>
as all who live in Āryadeśa within the boundaries of the system of the four caste
classes and four life-disciplines in accordance with the ordinances of the Veda; 67
it is the consensus of this community which for him constitutes the true arbiter<br>
of orthopraxy and therefore of scriptural validity; and this community, he says,<br>
currently accepts as valid not only the Vedas and the secondary Vaidika scrip
tures that follow in their wake, but also such other scriptural corpora as are not<br>
in opposition to the Vedas, namely the Śaiva and the Pañcarātra.68</li>
<li>It has been claimed by Svāmī Yogīndrānanda, the editor of the Nyāyabhūṣaṇa, that the validity of the<br>
Śaiva scriptures was also defended by its author Bhāsarvajña (fl. c. 900), Jayanta’s near-contemporary<br>
and fellow-Naiyāyika (Introduction, p. 19: śaivagranthānāṁ prāmāṇyaṁ pratanoti). But this is based on<br>
a misunderstanding of Nyāyabhūṣaṇa, p. 402, ll. 6–10. The form and terms of Bhāsarvajña’s argument<br>
in this passage are in fact largely lifted from the Buddhist Dharmakīrti’s auto-commentary on 1.246 of<br>
his Pramāṇavārttika. Bhāsarvajña, like Dharmakīrti admits that Śaiva Mantras, like any other Mantras,<br>
produce supernatural effects (siddhiḥ). But he neither states nor implies that the scriptures that teach<br>
them are valid.</li>
<li>The term Āryadeśa ‘the territory of the Āryas’ in this context does not denote a particular region<br>
of India. Rather it refers to all regions within which the system of the four caste-classes and disciplines<br>
has been established, as opposed to mlecchadeśaḥ, ‘the territory of the barbarians’, where it has not.<br>
Consider, for example, Abhinavagupta, Tantrasāra, p. 133: ‘as the regions of the Āryas are for the ad
herents of the religion and the regions of the barbarians are for those outside it’ (āryadeśā iva dhār
mikāṇāṁ mlecchadeśā iva adhārmikāṇām); and Nyāyamañjarī vol. 1, p. 595, ll. 11–12: ‘Or rather the [true]<br>
meaning of words is that established in Āryadeśa. Any other meaning, accepted by the barbarians, is<br>
certainly to be disregarded’ (athavā āryadeśaprasiddha eva śabdānām arthaḥ. itaras tu mlecchajana sammato ’nādaraṇīya eva). This distinction between Ārya and Mleccha is cultural rather than racial.<br>
The term mlecchabhāṣāḥ‘languages of the barbarians’ refers not only to foreign languages, such as<br>
those of India’s Śaka and Hūṇa invaders, but also to the Dravidian and other non-Indo-Aryan languages<br>
of the subcontinent. But the regions in which these languages were spoken were not mlecchadeśāḥ where the system of the four caste-classes and disciplines had been established, as was the case in the<br>
Dravidian-language regions during our period, at least in the nuclear regions of the various states that<br>
flourished there. Abhinavagupta, we may presume, did not consider the brahmins of the Tamil region<br>
who were his contemporaries to be Mlecchas bereft of religion.</li>
<li>Nyāyamañjarī-Āgamaprāmāṇya, p. 156, ll. 14–15: ‘By the greater society (mahājanaḥ) I mean this<br>
population established in Āryadeśa comprising all those within the four caste-classes and the four<br>
life-disciplines’; p. 197 (156), ll. 1–4: ‘Only when [a body of scripture] has the support of general ac
ceptance by the orthoprax consensus can one say without difficulty that it is the teaching of a trust
worthy source; and the orthoprax consensus recognizes as valid (1) the Vedas, (2) the Purāṇas and<br>

tolerance, exclusivity, inclusivity, and persecution . . .
I see no reason to doubt the accuracy of this report of the current state of belief<br>
in the Vaidika community. Jayanta offers no statistics, as he himself admits; 69 but<br>
this would have been a very weak argument indeed if the evidence adduced were<br>
manifestly contrary to what his audience could see for themselves. It is more reason
able to think that Jayanta is simply attempting to move Vaidika doctrine forward<br>
from its long-established theoretical position on the subject of the non-Vaidika<br>
traditions to take account of a change that had occurred in the lived relationship<br>
between the orthoprax and both Śaivism and Pāñcarātrika Vaiṣṇavism in the cen turies since the emergence and development of the Mantramārga.
As for what he means to include under the rubric of the valid Śaiva scriptures,<br>
it is clear, though not explicit, that he has in mind only the Saiddhāntika form of<br>
the Mantramārga. For elsewhere he strongly condemns those forms of religion<br>
whose practices violate Vaidika norms of purity and permitted conduct. Thus,<br>
after arguing for the validity of the Śaiva scriptures, to which he refers without<br>
differentiation simply as Śaiva,70 he turns to those forms of religion that he judges<br>
to be invalid. After dismissing Buddhism, he attacks the obscure Saṁsāramo
Dharmaśāstras that follow their lead, and (3) some scriptures [namely those of the Śaiva canon and<br>
the Pañcarātra] that are not in contradiction with the Vedas, but not those, such as that taught by the<br>
Buddha, which do contradict them.’</li>
<li>Debating the matter with an imaginary Buddhist, Jayanta has told him that Buddhism is invalid be
cause it is not accepted by the greater society (mahājanaḥ). The Buddhist then asks rhetorically, ‘What<br>
is this “greater society”; what is its form; where is it located; how big is its population; and what are<br>
its customs?’ and adds that in any case the Buddhists have their own “greater society” consisting of<br>
their own co-religionists. Jayanta then admits that he has no physical or quantitative data concerning<br>
this greater society. He cannot describe the physical appearance of its members or their total num
ber (ākāras tu tasya kīdr̥śaḥ pāṇipādaṁ kīdr̥śaṁ śirogrīvaṁ vā kīyatī tasya saṁkhyeti puruṣalakṣaṇāni<br>
gaṇayituṁ na jānīmaḥ). But he does know that its values are pervasive, to the extent that the Buddhists<br>
themselves are unable to escape them, since they too avoid untouchables, and those (the Śākta Śaivas)<br>
who indulge in orgiastic rites do so covertly, not fully believing in the rightness of their transgressive<br>
actions; see Nyāyamañjarī-Āgamaprāmāṇya, p. 156, l. 8 to p. 157, l. 10. For the Buddhist prohibition<br>
against the ordination of untouchables see Guṇaprabha’s commentary on Vinayasūtra-Pravrajyāvastu,<br>
p. 151: ‘One should not ordain as monks chariot-makers, tanners, Caṇḍālas, Pukkaśas, and the like’ (na<br>

suffering]’),71 and then goes on to say: 72
How can anyone bring himself even to mention the question of the validity<br>
of those systems whose rites are dominated by engagement in the forbidden?
which his commentator Cakradhara takes, no doubt correctly, to be an allusion<br>
to the Bhairava Śaivism of the Right Stream (dakṣiṇasrotaḥ), since to illustrate<br>
Jayanta’s point he quotes a verse that declares that the impurities of the body are<br>
considered pure in that system.73 Then, condemning the relativistic argument that<br>
no system should be judged by any standards other than its own, Jayanta states: 74
As for those others, who practice various impermissible forms of post
initiatory observance (dīkṣā) that [claim to] transcend inhibiting duality<br>
(nirvikalpa-) through such means as eating the impure and having sexual in
tercourse with forbidden partners, [they evidently lack the strength of their<br>
professed conviction, because] they do not do these things openly but act in<br>
secret, shying away from the majority that abides by the rules that govern<br>
the four caste-classes and life-disciplines. For if their faith in their scriptures<br>
is so free of doubt why do they put their teachings into practice like thieves<br>
[avoiding detection].
Here he attacks what can only be Śākta-Śaiva traditions of the Kaula type.<br>

crimination between the permitted and the forbidden, is a hallmark of the Śākta
leaning non-Saiddhāntika and Kaula literature.75 Moreover, the passage brings<br>
to mind others in the Kashmirian literature of this period which use the same<br>
idiom in describing the activities of the Kaulas, such as the satirist Kṣemendra’s<br>
description of women in the initiatory circle of a fictional Kaula Guru: 76
Once initiated by that libertine Guru [and Guru of libertines] (jāraguruṇā)<br>
those beauties would make love with all and sundry, faithfully adhering to the<br>

ety that will herald the descent of Kalkin, Viṣṇu’s tenth Avatāra: 77
[At that time] the Gurus teach that liberation is attained in a circle gathering<br>
with dyers of cloth, weavers, tanners, cremation-ground attendants (kāpā
lika-), and other such persons of the service-castes (-śilpibhiḥ), by drinking<br>
[wine] from a single vessel with them and holding an ecstatic orgy of non
dualistic/indiscriminate (nirvikalpa-) love-making.78

The Guru, by teaching forbidden [religious] practices to that [king], who was<br>
already wicked by nature, abolished in him all consciousness of the distinction<br>
between permitted and forbidden sexual partners, and he himself engaged<br>
in sexual intercourse without inhibition even with his own daughter. What<br>
greater evidence of the freedom from duality (gatavikalpatvam) 80 achieved by<br>
this Guru could I provide?
Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha II’s Śaivas without Pride of Transcendence
Having established that Jayanta’s view of Saiddhāntika Śaivism as a valid from of<br>
religion is unlikely to have been a minority view in the general Vaidika population<br>
outside Śaiva circles, we must wonder whether it is likely that this view could<br>
have been as general as he says it was in the absence of Śaivas who subscribed to<br>
it themselves.
There are indeed indications that an ideologically emasculated Śaivism of the<br>
kind outlined by Jayanta did exist and therefore that the great Kashmirian Naiyā
yika was indeed expressing the view of an already established segment of the Śai
vas themselves. Furthermore, we may suspect that this had become the majority<br>
view among them, and that the learned theories of the Śaiva theologians, which<br>
demonstrate how Śaivism is superior to the Vaidika religion, how its rituals and<br>
meditations work on an altogether higher level and its doctrines penetrate far be
yond the reach of its rival, were not so much articulations of established, common<br>
belief as fundamentalist attempts to revitalize and recover a tradition that was fast<br>
losing a sense of its original calling. Thus Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha, writing in the tenth<br>
century, when Saiddhāntika learning in Kashmir was at its height, tells us that one<br>
of his reasons for writing his commentary on the Saiddhāntika scripture Mataṅga
pārameśvara was to counteract attempts to draw the understanding of the text<br>
into the Vaidika domain, by going back to the foundational doctrines of Sadyo
jyotis and Br̥haspati and sweeping away what he saw as the inauthentic interpre tations of the Siddhānta that had developed since the time of these two founding</li>
<li>This expression gatavikalpatvam equals nirvikalpatvam, i.e., ‘being nirvikalpaḥ.’

fathers of Saiddhāntika exegesis.81 And he confirms that this loss of identity was<br>
well advanced when he targets for criticism the view of some at least of his Śaiva<br>
co-religionists that the execution of their regular rituals of worship was merely<br>
the fulfilment of a duty, with no higher purpose than conformity to scriptural<br>
injunction, which is to say, the view of Śaivas who had abandoned a properly Śaiva<br>
perspective and substituted that of the Mīmāṁsaka theorists of Vaidika ritual: 82
Now, for what purpose do we do [our obligatory Śaiva] rituals, time-fixed and<br>
[incidental]? Some say that our engagement in these is entirely without pur
pose, [that we do them simply] because they are enjoined [by our scriptures],<br>
just as the Mīmāṁsakas [hold with regard to their own obligatory rituals].<br>
That is not correct; because [the two cases, the Vaidika and Śaiva,] are differ
ent. For the [Mīmāṁsakas] hold that [their] scriptures are valid because they<br>
are not the product of any conscious being [but are an eternal self-existent<br>
body of injunctions that minds can perceive but have not created]. So they<br>
may well formulate such a view. But in our system [our scriptures are held<br>
to be valid] as the work of all-knowing [God]. So how can [we believe that]<br>
he could teach something that has no purpose? Or rather, if he does so then<br>
he must be comparable to an imbecile or madman and therefore, being non
omniscient, not worthy of our regard, with the undesired consequence that<br>
our scriptures would be invalid.83</li>

Aparāditya’s Śaivas by Birth
A comparable situation is revealed by Aparāditya, the Śilāhāra king of North<br>
Konkan, writing in the early twelfth century, through one of the Śaiva arguments<br>
for acceptability that he puts up to refute in in his commentary on Yājñavalkya
smr̥ti. The Śaiva is made to argue that since the adherents of the Vaidika religion<br>
hold that the injunctive force of the Veda is directed only to specific, restricted<br>
classes of persons, they can have no reason to deny that the Śaiva scriptures are<br>
valid for Śaivas as members of a similar community of birth, which suggests that<br>
its members, when asked why they engage in their special Śaiva rituals, would<br>
have responded like Georg Bühler’s Śaiva brahmin informants in Kashmir in 1875<br>
that they attached no special importance to them but did them because this was<br>
the long-established custom of their community.84 Aparāditya responds by at
tacking the very notion that it is possible to be a Śaiva by birth (jātyā), to be, as it<br>
were, a member of a caste of Śaivas.
He does so in the course of his commentary on 1.7, which details the means<br>
that enable men to know their religious duty (dharmamūlam) – namely Śruti,<br>
Smr̥ti, observable orthopraxy (sadācāraḥ), and, within the limits set by these,<br>
mental satisfaction, enabling one, for example, to decide that one is now ready<br>
to end a course of ascetic observance, and personal preference, in such matters<br>
as choosing the time at which to perform some pious action – taking this oppor
tunity to examine the objection that this list wrongly omits the Śaiva, Pāśupata,<br>
Pāñcarātrika, and other (unspecified) scriptural corpora.
The initial proposition is that these corpora have as good a claim as the Vaid
ika to be accepted, because they too are eternal revelation, and that therefore<br>
the highest good will be attained by enacting their injunctions. Aparāditya then<br>
counters by insisting that this cannot apply to orthoprax Vaidikas, because the<br>
Śaiva scriptures teach that the Vaidika rites are inefficacious when they say, as we<br>
have seen, that these rituals are enjoined on Śaivas not because of their efficacity<br>
but because by doing them in addition to their Śaiva rites Śaivas will ingratiate</li>
<li>See Bühler 1877, p. 24, and the discussion of the view that he reports in Sanderson 1995, pp. 37–38,<br>
and 2007b, pp. 110–112.

themselves with those who, in the Śaiva perspective, are not yet ready for the<br>
higher system.85
He next addresses a passage from the Devīpurāṇa that condemns to torture<br>
in hell those who despise either the teaching of Śiva or the Vedas, and a passage<br>
from the Yogayājñavalkya86 which includes ‘the teachings of Paśupati’ (pāśupa
tam) in a list of those that one is forbidden to challenge with logical argument.<br>
He argues that these passages merely prohibit condemnation and permit study<br>
and do not allow the inference that one is also permitted to put their injunctions<br>
into practice; 87 and he provides several reasons that block that inference, the most<br>
significant of which is perhaps that if a person were to take Śaiva initiation, as<br>
he would have to do if he intended to enact the Śaiva injunctions, he would be<br>
punished with hell, according to the Śaiva scriptures, if he had a Vaidika Śrāddha<br>
ceremony performed for him.88 The unstated point of this, I propose, is that he<br>
thereby provides a refutation of the Śaivas’ claim that their scriptures are accept
able because they require their initiates to adhere rigidly to Vaidika regulations<br>
and so are not contrary to the Veda (vedaviruddha-). For while it is true that they<br>
were enjoined to undergo all the Vaidika rites of qualification (samṣkārāḥ) prior to<br>
their initiation, namely up to upanayanam or marriage, following the procedures<br>
laid down in the Gr̥hyasūtra of their branch of the Veda, one major rite of passage<br>
remained, namely cremation (antyeṣtiḥ), and the various rites of offerings to the<br>
deceased thereafter. For these the Śaivas developed their own rituals and it was<br>
these that had to be followed in the case of the initiated.89</li>

one the Śaiva procedures alone are given. In the other we find both the Vaidika and the Śaiva, the<br>
two proceeding in tandem from phase to phase with the Vaidika element always preceding the Śaiva.<br>
This hybrid, which is not envisaged in the Śaiva Paddhatis of pan-Indian authority, is likely to have<br>
been introduced precisely out of anxiety that omitting the Vaidika procedures might have a negative<br>

It is at this point that he moves on to address the proposition that the Śaiva<br>
scriptures are valid as ordinances for the Śaivas as members of a distinct commu
nity entered at birth: 90
Can it not be conceded that just as the Vedas and [Smr̥tis] apply to only<br>
certain specific persons [defined by their birth] so the Śaiva and other [non
Vaidika] scriptures [are valid because they] are for Śaivas and others as per
sons who are members of specific communities[, Śaiva or other,] that they<br>
have entered through birth? No, it cannot. This is because in passages such<br>
as ‘No persons other than those for whom all the rites from conception to<br>
cremation with [the Veda’s] Mantras have been prescribed are qualified for<br>
this teaching’ Manu and other [promulgators of Smr̥ti texts] have given us<br>
evidence only of the qualification of brahmins[, Kṣatriyas,] and [Vaiśyas] for<br>
their teachings but not of the qualification of ‘Śaiva brahmins’ and the like for<br>
corpora of scriptures taught by Śiva and others. Then let it be conceded that<br>
Śūdras [at least] are qualified to enact the teachings of Śiva[, since they have<br>
no access to the Veda and its Mantras and so fall outside Manu’s definition<br>
of those who are qualified and obliged to enact his teachings]. But that too we<br>
will not concede, because no Smr̥ti or any other [Vaidika scriptural source]<br>
accepts this. Furthermore, there is in fact no such person as a Śaiva by birth<br>
(jātyā) to whom the Śaiva scriptures could apply. For the word śaivaḥ ‘Śaiva’<br>
[means simply] ‘one who studies or understands the scriptures taught by Śiva’.<br>
[This is established by the semantic conditions governing the formation of the<br>
word śaivaḥ from śivaḥ through śaivam according to the grammatical rules of<br>
consequence. See for an example of the hybrid form the Kashmirian manuscript Vaidikatāntrikasa
maṣṭividhinā (samaṣṭi em. : samiṣṭi Cod.) ekoddiṣṭaśrāddhavidhiḥ (ekoddiṣṭa em. : ekoddiṣṭe Cod.), ‘The<br>
ritual of the Ekoddiṣṭa Śrāddha following the procedure in which Vaidika and Tāntrika [Paddhatis] are<br>
combined.’ This is how the work is identified in its final colophon. At its beginning we read atha vaid
ikatāntrika ekoddiṣṭakaranavidhiḥ (ekoddiṣṭa em : ekoddiṣṭe Cod.), ‘Next the ritual for performing the<br>
Ekoddiṣṭa [Śrāddha] that is [both] Vaidika and Tāntrika.’</li>

derivation. Thus] by applying the suffix -a to [the name] śivaḥ ‘Śiva’ we form<br>
[the derivative noun] śaivam in the meaning ‘that which has been taught by<br>
Śiva’, that is to say, the corpus of Śaiva scriptures; and we then form the word<br>
śaivaḥ (‘a Śaiva’) from this in the meaning ‘one who understands or studies<br>
those scriptures’, the same suffix -a being added after the word śaivam in ac
cordance with the rule ‘[-a after N in the sense] “one who studies N, one who<br>
understands N” and then elided by the rule “substitution of zero [for -a in<br>
the meaning “one who studies N, one who understands N” when that suffix<br>
comes] after [a word that has already been formed by the addition of the affix<br>
-a in the meaning] “taught [by N].” Pāśupata and other [words of this kind,<br>
such as Bauddha, Kāpila, Kāṇāda, Vaiṣṇava, Jaina, etc.] are formed in the<br>
same way [to mean “one who studies or understands what has been taught by<br>
Paśupati,” and so on].” 91 So the Śaiva and analogous bodies of scripture func
tion without having naturally fixed social groups to ground them; and from<br>
this it follows that they are analogous to pictures [drawn] in the air. This being<br>
the case, they must certainly be rejected [as sources of valid knowledge] in [the<br>
domain of] religious practice.
The view whose prevalence is attested by this attack would have been equally<br>
unacceptable to the likes of Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha II and Abhinavagupta, though<br>
for the very different reason that it reveals a complete surrender of the properly<br>
Śaiva view that Śaivism is a universal revelation, reaching anyone whom Śiva<br>
deems ready to be liberated, regardless of such incidentals as region, caste, or<br>
lineage.92</li>
<li>The grammmatical rules that Aparāditya applies here are Pāṇini, Aṣṭādhyāyī 4.3.101, 4.2.59, and<br>
4.2.64.</li>
<li>Note in this context the commonly expressed Śaiva doctrine that division by birth into castes is<br>
an artificial construct that overlays and obscures the unity of humanity. For text and translation of text<br>
passages, both Saiddhāntika and non-Saiddhāntika, that express this conviction see Sanderson 2009a,<br>

Hinduism
It is entirely reasonable to claim in the light of this evidence that a complex corre
sponding roughly to what would come to be called Hinduism was already recog
nized, though not yet named, around the turn of the ninth and tenth centuries.<br>
At this juncture Jayanta assures us that the orthoprax majority had conceded<br>
that the Vaiṣṇavism of the Pañcarātra and the non-transgressive forms of Śaivism<br>
(therefore excluding those of the Bhairavatantras and Kulamārga) were valid and<br>
that communities that followed them were acceptable co-religionists; and we have<br>
seen evidence that Jayanta’s portrayal of these systems was not merely an out
sider’s projection: it corresponded to the way in which what was probably the<br>
great majority of Vaiṣṇava and Śaiva adherents had come to see themselves, by<br>
surrendering the doctrines that were intended to keep alive their sense of tran
scendence. This change of perspective, moreover, is one that is certainly more<br>
tolerant of diversity than the strictly Śaiva, which admitted only a hierarchy in<br>
which other vehicles of salvation, Vaidika and Vaiṣṇava, are subordinate to it.<br>
Here we have rather the view that the Vaidika, Vaiṣṇava, and Śaiva paths are<br>
options determined by inherited practice leading to a single Vaidika goal. It must<br>
be kept in mind, however, that this congeries of equipolent options was never the<br>
whole of Indian religious awareness in this period. Learned scholars among the<br>
Śaivas and Śākta-Śaivas strove by various strategies to keep alive in initiates the<br>
scripturally sanctioned belief that their Śaiva practices were not just a variant of a<br>
single accommodating religion but something which had the power to lead them<br>
to an ultimate goal that far transcended what either the Vaidika or the Vaiṣṇava<br>
system could reach, and Vaidika ideologues such as Aparāditya held out to the<br>
bitter end against this trend to accept what from their point of view was forbid
den religious practice following false scriptures.
Religion and the State: A Maximally Tolerant View<br>
of What Is Acceptable in Matters of Religion
In Jayanta’s play Āgamaḍambara we have seen the uncompromising Vaidika camp<br>
attempt and fail to impose its Manu-inspired vision of a society free of all but<br>
properly Vaidika religion. When the suppression of an extreme fringe cult leads<br>
to panic among the Śaivas, the king, a Śaiva himself, not necessarily an initiate<br>

but a publicly declared loyal devotee of Śiva (paramamāheśvaraḥ),93 who had at<br>
the beginning of his reign founded temples for the installation of Śivas whose<br>
names incorporated those of himself (Śaṇkaragaurīśvara) 94 and his chief queen<br>
(Sugandheśvara), intervenes and ensures that the status quo is maintained. The<br>
play ends with an orchestrated debate between the Vaidikas and the preceptors<br>
of the other faiths held in the Vaiṣṇava Raṇasvāmin temple in Srinagar on the<br>
subject of whether the Pañcarātra and the scriptures of the other non-Vaidika<br>
systems are or are not valid. In front of an audience of thousands, including the<br>
former Snātaka Saṁkarṣaṇa, now turned ultra-tolerant minister of religious<br>
affairs,95 the Naiyāyika Sāhaṭa, also called Dhairyarāśi, appointed as adjudictor<br>
by the order of the king himself (nr̥pādeśāt), hears the various disputants put their<br>
cases and then delivers his judgement. In this he rejects the narrow Vaidika view<br>
of validity and advocates one with the greatest latitude, stopping short only of ap
proving transgressive, licentious, and violent cults such as were certainly present<br>
in Kashmir and elsewhere at this time. This view goes even beyond that enun
ciated above to recognize that not only Vaiṣṇavism and Śaivism but also Bud dhism and Jainism are valid and must therefore be tolerated, holding that there<br>
is a single omniscient and nameless deity who in consideration of the differing<br>
intellectual dispositions of human beings has manifested himself variously as the<br>
propagators of all faiths: as Śiva, Paśupati, Kapila, Viṣṇu, Saṁkarṣaṇa, the Jina,</li>
<li>Āgamaḍambara, prose between 3.3 and 3.4; prose before 4.2. He is also described there to the<br>
same effect as puraharahr̥dayasya ‘one whose heart is given to the destoyer of the [three] celestial<br>
palaces’ (prose after 4.6).</li>
<li>Kalhaṇa, Rājataraṅgiṇī 5.156–158. The two Śivas were installed in his new capital Śaṇkarapura or<br>
Śaṇkarapattana (now Pattan/Paṭan in the Baramulla district of Kashmir), which he founded with his<br>
own name after coming to the throne. The two temples survive in ruins beside the road that runs from<br>
Srinagar to Baramulla, approximately equidistant from both.</li>
<li>Saṁkarṣaṇa, who in the first part of the play was the champion of the view that all non-Vaidika<br>
views are invalid, is described by the Vaidika officiant who earlier lamented Saṁkarṣaṇa’s failure to<br>
push this view through, when he catches sight of him in this gathering of the learned, as a champion of<br>
the view that all (established) religions are valid; see the prose after 4.4: ‘We have direct experience<br>
of the power of Saṁkarṣaṇa [in this matter]. For he [has become] an adherent of the doctrine of the<br>
authoritativeness of all the religions’ (dr̥ṣṭaḥ saṁkarṣaṇapratāpaḥ. sa hi sarvāgamaprāmāṇyavādī).

the Buddha, and Manu.96 The only criteria of validity from this point of view are<br>
expressed as follows: 97
This path of validation cannot be applied to any [tradition regardless of its<br>
character], but only to religious systems that meet the following criteria:<br>
(1)  they must have an unbroken tradition known to all; (2) the community<br>
of the orthoprax (āryalokaḥ) must not be loth to be acquainted with them or<br>
speak about them; (3) the practices that they advocate must not be beyond<br>
the pale of [what is acceptable to] society (janabāhyam); and (4) must not en
danger [its members] (sabhayam); (5) their character must not be manifestly<br>
new-fangled (na rūpaṁ yeṣāṁ sphurati navam abhyutthitam iva); (6) they must<br>
not have the appearance of the teachings of madmen (pramattagītatvam);<br>
(7) they must not be teachings of Kaulas (akaulikatvam); 98 and (8) their source<br>
must not be greed or any other [base motive] (lobhādi).
This position that all religious traditions (sarvāgama-) are entitled to be con
sidered valid, if they meet the above criteria, is presented in theistic terms. A<br>
nameless supreme being is declared to have taught these various religions by as
suming the form of their promulgators. However, it is clear that this dresses up in<br>
religious language what is in effect a juridical and political view of what the state<br>
should tolerate. The issue on this level is not truth or falsity but legality and the<br>
policy to be followed by the state in its role as guardian of the boundaries of the<br>
permissible, or rather, to use the monarchical language used by our authors, by<br>
the king in his role as the guardian and guide of the entire socio-religious order<br>
(sarvavarṇāśramaguruḥ) or, to use a phrase favoured by Jayanta, the king as the</li>
<li>Āgamaḍambara 4.57. These are in order the propagators of the Śaiva, Pāśupata, Sāṁkhya,<br>
Vaiṣṇava, Pāñcarātrika, Jaina, and Buddhist systems, and the core Smr̥ti of the Vaidika tradition.</li>
<li>Āgamaḍambara 4.100–101.</li>
<li>I have tentatively conjectured the reading akaulikatvam here in place of the manuscripts’ alauki
katvam because the latter nonsensically excludes from acceptance any tradition that is not mundane<br>
(laukika-). As we have seen, Śaṇkaravarman’s minister Jayanta was uncompromising in his condemna
tion of Kaula practice, but it is nonetheless surprising that this list should make so specific an exclusion.

authoritative judge (-acāryaḥ) of the boundaries (maryādā) of religious conduct<br>
(dharmaḥ) within that order.99
However, the king’s role was not merely to police these boundaries. It was also<br>
to promote the peaceful co-existence of the faiths through even-handed patron
age. During our period the publicly declared personal religious commitment of<br>
kings, in addition to their commitment to preserve the Vaidika socio-religious<br>
order, generally took the form of devotion to Śiva, Viṣṇu, the Sun-God (Sūrya,<br>
Āditya), or the Goddess (Bhagavatī), the deities of the new initiatory religions, or<br>
to the Buddha (Sugata, Tathāgata) of Buddhism or the Arhats of Jainism, these<br>
allegiances being commonly announced in their inscriptions by the inclusion<br>
amid their royal titles of epithets that mean ‘entirely (parama-, atyanta-, param)<br>
devoted’ to whichever of these deities or religious founders they favoured. Thus<br>
devout worshippers of Śiva/Maheśvara are identified as paramamāheśvaraḥ,<br>
atyantamāheśvaraḥ, or paramaśaivaḥ; of Viṣṇu as paramabhāgavataḥ, parama vaiṣṇavaḥ, or atyantabhagavadbhaktaḥ; of the Sun as paramādityabhaktaḥ or para masauraḥ; of the Goddess (Bhagavatī) as paraṁ bhagavatībhaktaḥ; of the Buddha<br>
as paramasaugataḥ or paramatāthāgataḥ; and of the Jaina Arhats as paramārhataḥ or paramajainaḥ.100
However, it was rarely the case that a king’s publicly declared allegiance to<br>
one or another of these traditions was accompanied by strict exclusivity of pa
tronage. For while a king might favour one religion over another, say Vaiṣṇavism<br>
over Śaivism, it was common, and no doubt politic, for him to extend support<br>
to religious traditions other than his own. Thus, the Kārkoṭakas of Kashmir,<br>
who following the Śaiva kings of the Hephthalite Hun dynasty that had ruled<br>
the country from early in the sixth century101 held power from the seventh to the</li>

ninth centuries, were consistently devotees of Viṣṇu, offering no support to the<br>
cult of Śiva, yet they also supported Buddhism and the cult of the Sun.102
Similarly, the Maitrakas of Valabhī were consistently Śaiva from the sixth to<br>
the eighth centuries, yet, as we know from their copper-plate grants, Xuanzang,<br>
and the Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa, they were also generous patrons of Buddhism; 103
and the Pālas of Bihar and Bengal, though Buddhists, continued to support<br>
Śaivism and Vaiṣṇavism,104 as did the Candras of Arakan; 105 the predominantly<br>
Śaiva Licchavi and ṭhākurī kings of Nepal were generous patrons of Bud dhism; 106 and simultaneous royal patronage of Śaivism and Buddhism was also a<br>
conspicuous feature of religion in mainland Southeast Asia, in the kingdoms of<br>
the Khmers, Chams, Sumatrans, Sundanese, and Javanese.107
In the south of India too we find examples of royal patronage of more than<br>
one religious tradition. The Pallava Mahendravarman I Guṇabhara was a Śaiva<br>
convert from Jainism if we may believe the Tamil Śaiva hagiography. As a Śaiva<br>
he established rock-cut cave temples of Śivas with his biruda names: Śatrum
alleśvara at Dal˙avānūr,108 Avanibhājanapallaveśvara at Śīyamaṅgalam,109 and Lal</li>
<li>See Sanderson 2009a, p. 73.</li>
<li>In the Alīnā copper-plate inscription of Śīlāditya VI Dhrūbhaṭa of ad 766 (cii 3:39) the account of<br>
the Maitraka lineage jumps from the Śaiva founder, Bhaṭārka, over the next four generations, which we<br>
know from other inscriptions to have included a Vaiṣṇava and a Saura, to Guhasena. He and his thirteen<br>
descendants down to Śīlāditya VI are identified as paramamāheśvaraḥ, with the exception of Śīlāditya<br>
IV and Śīlāditya VI, who are given no sectarian epithet. For the Maitrakas patronage of Buddhism (in<br>
its pre-Tantric forms) see Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa 53.538–549; and Xuanzang on the recent conversion of<br>
the king of Valabhī to Buddhism (Beal 1884, vol. 2. p. 267). Of the land-grant documents of the Maitrakas<br>
of Valabhī three quarters are records of grants to brahmins, but the remaining quarter report grants<br>
made by these kings to Buddhist institutions (Schmiedchen 2007, p. 360). On the Maitrakas support of<br>
Buddhism see Sanderson 2009a, pp. 72–73.

itāṇkurapallaveśvara Tiruchirāpal˙l˙i.110 Yet he also excavated a rock-cut temple of<br>
Viṣṇu with his name (Mahendraviṣṇu) in his town of Mahendrapura.111 We find<br>
the same phenomenon in the dynasty of the Eastern Gaṅgas of Kaliṅganagara in<br>
northern Andhra Pradesh, a line all of whose known rulers, from the first half of<br>
the sixth century through to the end of our period, were declared devout worship
pers of Śiva (paramamāheśvaraḥ). An inscription issued in year 79 of the Gaṅga<br>
era, which is to say, c. ad 578, records that Mahārāja Hastivarman Raṇabhīta of<br>
this line made a land-grant for the support of a temple of a Viṣṇu incorporating<br>
his name (Raṇabhītodaya) in spite of the declaration that the donor is a para mamāheśvaraḥ.112 The Hoysal˙a king Viṣṇuvardhana (r. 1110–1141) likewise, though<br>
strongly influenced by the Śrīvaiṣṇava movement, was also a generous patron of<br>
both Jainism and Śaivism.113
There were even kings whose inscriptions depart from the convention of de
claring allegiance to a single tradition by declaring them ‘entirely devoted’ to both<br>
Śiva and Viṣṇu. This is true of the Pallava Narasiṁhavarman II (r. c. 700–728),114
the Gaṅga Anantavarman Coḍagaṅga in his Korni plates of 1081/2,115 Vaidyadeva<br>
of Prāgjyotiṣa in his copper-plate grant probably of 1142,116 and Jayabhañja of the<br>
Bhañjas of Kolāḍa in the eleventh or twelfth century.117
We also have evidence from the Khmer realm that there were Vaiṣṇava dig nitaries within the predominantly Śaiva royal staff, that members of the same<br>
family could be of different religious allegiances, and that the state limited the<br>
freedom of individuals to change their religion only in the special case of persons</li>

from certain title-groups (varṇa) who had been selected for training as Śaiva offi ciants in the service of the king and were forbidden by a decree of Jayavarman V<br>
(r. c. 970–1000) to become Vaiṣṇavas.118
There are also numerous instances of royal marriages across religious bound
aries in the subcontinent. In the fourth century the Vākāṭakas Rudrasena I<br>
(r. c. 335–360) and Pr̥thivīsena I (r. c. 360–395) were Śaivas.119 But c. 388 their suc cessor Rudrasena II (r. c. 395–405) married Prabhāvatīguptā, the daughter of the<br>
Gupta emperor Candragupta II (r. 376–415), a princess who in accordance with<br>
the religious preference of her paternal family was a devotee of Viṣṇu (atyant abhagavadbhaktā). Though Rudrasena continued to support the faith of his pre
decessors, he declared himself a Vaiṣṇava, no doubt under her influence,120 and<br>
developed Rāmagiri (Ramtek) as a Vaiṣṇava state temple-complex.
We have other examples in Kalhaṇa’s Rājataraṅgiṇī. As we have seen above,<br>
at the end of the ninth century, after the demise of the Vaiṣṇava Kārkoṭaka dy nasty, Śaṇkaravarman (883–902) was a devout worshipper of Śiva and accordingly<br>
founded Śiva temples with his and his queen’s names. But his queen Sugandhā, a<br>
foreigner from the north, probably a Dard (5.157), was a supporter of the Vaiṣṇava<br>
Pāñcarātrikas,121 and while she occupied the throne from 904 to 906 after the<br>
death of her husband and the short reigns of her sons, the boy king Gopālavar
man (902–904) and his younger brother Saṁkaṭa (904), she established a Viṣṇu<br>
Gopālakeśava and a Gopālamaṭha with the former’s name (5.244). Moreover,<br>
Nandā, Gopālavarman’s child bride, no doubt chosen for him by his Vaiṣṇava<br>
mother, founded a Viṣṇu (Nandā)keśava and a Nandāmaṭha with hers (5.245).
After the end of the rule of this dynasty in 939 the brahmins bestowed the<br>
crown on Yaśaskaravarman (939–948), the son of Prabhākaradeva, the trea
surer of Gopālavarman, and the the secret lover of his Vaiṣṇava queen Sugandhā</li>

(5.469–477). This paramour may well have been the unnamed royal functionary<br>
rumoured122 to have been a supporter, like the queen, of the Vaiṣṇava Pāñcarātri kas. In any case his son Yaśaskaravarman was a Vaiṣṇava and one who exerted<br>
himself to encourage orthopraxy and suppress the Śākta-leaning Śaivism then<br>
strong in Kashmir (6.6–12, 108–112). He began the construction of a temple for<br>
a Viṣṇu Yaśaskarasvāmin, incorporating his own name, but died before it was<br>
finished (6.140).
His successor Parvagupta (949–950) was a Śaiva, as we may infer from the<br>
fact that he established a Śiva Parvagupteśvara (6.137) and at the end of his life<br>
chose to die in the precincts of the Śaiva temple of the Sureśvarīkṣetra (6.147). His<br>
religious conviction would not then have predisposed him to complete the Viṣṇu<br>
temple of his anti-Śaiva Vaiṣṇava predecessor, but he was tricked into doing so<br>
by one of Yaśaskaravarman’s widows, no doubt another Vaiṣṇava, who promised<br>
him her favours if he did so and then when he had completed the work, commit
ted pious suicide by offering herself into a sacrificial fire (6.140–144).
Parvagupta was succeeded by Kṣemagupta (950–958), whose Śaiva persuasion<br>
can be seen from the report that he founded a temple for a Śiva Ardhanārīśvara<br>
under the name Kṣemagaurīśvara (6.172–173). But he married Diddā, the ruthless<br>
and dissolute daughter of Siṁharāja, the Śāhi chief of Lohara, a mountainous dis trict adjoining Kashmir on the south-west (6.176). Again a matrimonial alliance<br>
favoured Viṣṇu. It was probably through her influence – the king was so besotted<br>
with her that he was mockingly known as Diddākṣema (6.177) – that when he<br>
fell fatally ill he chose to go to die in the Vaiṣṇava holy site Varāhakṣetra (6.186).<br>
During her long dominance of nearly fifty years until 1008 she enshrined a Viṣṇu<br>
Abhimanyusvāmin with the name of her deceased son Abhimanyu (6.299), two<br>
Viṣṇus Diddāsvāmin with her own name (6.300, 302), and a Viṣṇu Siṁhasvāmin<br>
in Lohara (8.1822) with the name of her father (6.304); and her illustrious ma
ternal grandfather Bhīma, the Śāhi king of Udabhāṇḍa (Hund) on the Indus,<br>
enshrined and richly endowed a Viṣṇu Bhīmasvāmin with his name in Kashmir<br>
proper, at Bumzu near Bavan (6.178).</li>

Nor does it seem that Indian courts were less tolerant than the Khmer when<br>
it came to the religion of their members. It seems not to have been the case, for<br>
example, that a Śaiva could not aspire to ministerial office under a Vaiṣṇava king.<br>
We have a striking example of this at the beginning of our period at Udayagiri<br>
near the ancient city of Vidiśā in central India, where an inscription records that<br>
Vīrasena, a minister of the Vaiṣṇava (paramabhāgavataḥ) Gupta emperor Can dragupta II (r. c. 375–415), had a cave excavated for Śiva when he had come there<br>
with that monarch while the latter was engaged in a military campaign.123
The state’s support for religions other than that professed by the monarch in<br>
the inscriptions issued by his chancellery is also clear from evidence of his par
ticipation in their major festivals. Xuanzang’s Da Tang Xiyuji, the account of his<br>
journey to and sojourn in India from 629 (var. 627) to 645 (var. 644), completed in<br>
646 on his return to China, tells us that in the vicinity of the city of Kanyakubja<br>
(Kanauj) were a Buddhist monastery, a temple of the Sun-God, and a temple of<br>
Śiva, all three of similar scale and grandeur; 124 and Huili and Yanzong’s biogra
phy of this learned Chinese pilgrim (Da ci en si san cang fa shi zhuan), completed<br>
in 688, reports that in Kanyakubja during the Buddhist quinquennial festival<br>
of the general distribution of alms (pañcavarṣapariṣat), the Puṣyabhūti emperor<br>
Harṣa, whose Śaiva allegiance is reported by his biographer Bāṇa,125 offered wor ship to the Buddha on the first day, to the Sun-God on the second, and to Ma
heśvara (Śiva) on the third.126 This multi-faith environment, with several equally<br>
balanced religious traditions flourishing side by side, is, I propose, the probable<br>
cause of the great inconstancy of the declared religious allegiance of the kings<br>
of this once great city, seen first among the Puṣyabhūtis and then among the<br>
Gurjara-Pratīhāras. Among the Puṣyabhūtis the emperor Harṣa, as we have seen,</li>
<li>cii 3:6, l. 5: ‘[Vīrasena, Minister of Peace and War of Candragupta] had this cave constructed out of<br>
devotion for the god Śambhu when he had come to this place together with the king himself, who was<br>
seeking to conquer the entire world (kr̥tsnapr̥thvījayārtthena rājñaiveha sahāgataḥ).’</li>

was a Śaiva (paramamāheśvaraḥ); but his father was a Buddhist (paramasaugataḥ),<br>
and three preceding ascendants were Sauras (paramādityabhaktaḥ); 127 and among<br>
the Gurjara-Pratīhāras we have successively the Vaiṣṇava Devaśakti, the Śaiva<br>
Vatsarāja, the Śākta Nāgabhaṭa (r. c. 816–834), the Saura Rāmabhadra, the Śākta<br>
Bhoja (r. c. 840–890), the Saura Vināyakapāla, and the Śaiva Mahendrapāla.128
We may also point to socio-legal provisions at the eastern edge of the Indic<br>
world, in East Java during the Majapahit period (1293–c. 1500). We know that<br>
the state appointed clerical administrators of religion (dharmādhyakṣa) for both<br>
the Śaiva (dharmādhyakṣa riṇ kaśaiwan) and Buddhist faiths (dharmādhyakṣa riṇ kasogatan), providing official residences for them close to the royal compound,<br>
and that there was a board of subordinate religious officials known as the Asses
sors of Religion (dharmopapatti, dharmādhikaraṇa), who included persons adher ing to the non-Saiddhāntika Bhairava cult (bhairawapakṣa) and the Saura cult of<br>
the Sun (sorapakṣa).129
Persecution
The emergence of the orthoprax consensus reported by Jayanta and confirmed<br>
by other evidence, in which Vaidikas, Vaiṣṇavas, and Śaivas were seen by oth ers and themselves as equipolent aspects of a single loosely defined faith, the ju
ridical view that all religions other than those considered criminal or subversive<br>
should be accepted by the state, and the evidence of royal patronage extended<br>
to religious traditions other than those to which monarchs claimed to be espe
cially devoted suggest that there was indeed a high degree of official tolerance of<br>
religious diversity to be found in the various states of early mediaeval India. But<br>
the evidence presented above also shows that this tolerance was not innate to<br>
the individual traditions that had been absorbed, however incompletely, into this<br>
consensus. The Vaidikas, as we have seen, had a strictly exclusivist view that, if it<br>
could have found the support of willing monarchs, would have driven all compet</li>

itors for royal patronage from the field; and we have seen that Śaiva ideologues<br>
for their part, while claiming to support the Vaidika tradition within an inclu
sive Śaiva-Vaidika socio-religious order, nonetheless show in their scriptures and<br>
learned commentaries an uncompromising faith in the otherness and superiority<br>
of Śaivism and the marked inferiority of the Vaidika system, which they saw as<br>
merely ‘mundane religion’ (laukiko dharmaḥ).130 The Buddhists and Jainas likewise<br>
stood in clear opposition to the ‘Hindu’ traditions, even though Buddhist kings at<br>
least have professed in their inscriptions their commitment to the preservation of<br>
the Vaidika socio-religious order; 131 and the Śaivas, Vaiṣṇavas, and Vaidikas have<br>
been unanimous in their condemnation of these two heterodox faiths. In this at<br>
least they could agree.
Consequently, it was always a possibility that the peaceful co-existence of<br>
these competing traditions might be upset, if a royal patron or charismatic re
ligious figure found himself eager and able, for whatever reason – political, eco
nomic, or perhaps even simple religious conviction – not merely to favour one<br>
tradition at the expense of others, but even to persecute whatever tradition he was<br>
inclined to suppress, or at least punish anyone who dared to raise a voice against<br>
the dominant religious consensus of the region and period. Consider the strident<br>
tone of the following declaration in an inscription of ad 1036 recording a grant of<br>
land made by Jayasiṁha II, the Cālukya ruler of Kalyāṇa, for the support of the<br>
temple of Śiva Pañcaliṅgeśvara, to Lakulīśvara, evidently in his capacity as the<br>
Lākula incumbent of this sacred site: 132
I, a fire of destruction to disputants [of other faiths], shall place my foot in<br>
the presence of the king’s council on the head of any who claims that either<br>
of these is false: the God Śiva, whose feet merit the worship of all men, and</li>

the mundane religion, devoted [only] to the religion of Śiva’ (virakto laukike dharme śivadharmānurañ
jitaḥ).</li>

the religion proclaimed in the three [Vedas], in which the system of the caste
classes and disciplines has been established in its proper hierarchy.
Consider also the following passage from an authoritative South Indian Said
dhāntika Śaiva treatise of the twelfth century, which tells the Śaivas that they<br>
may kill without sin anyone who attacks their faith: 133
Even if he kills those who revile Śiva, the Mantras of Śiva, and his Gurus, he<br>
does not thereby infringe the rules of his post-initiatory discipline. There is no<br>
fault in killing those who attack [our] deities, sacred fire, and teachers.
Nor do our historical sources lack accounts of persecutions, pogroms, or sim
ple vandalism directed against the religious other. Some may be fictions or at least<br>
exaggerated. But some are well attested and by their mere existence they proclaim<br>
that the Indians of our period were not adherents of the view that the religions<br>
around them were eirenic by nature.
Buddhist sources, from the Kashmirian Vibhāṣā of the second century to the<br>
East Indian Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa of the eighth, identify as the first major perse
cutor of their religion Puṣyamitra Śuṅga of the second century bc, the brahmin<br>
general who was believed to have re-established the pre-eminence of Brahmanism<br>
after bringing the pro-Buddhist Maurya dynasty to an end. According to these<br>
works he burned the Buddhist Sūtras, demolished Stūpas and monasteries, and<br>
killed many Buddhist monks, from Magadha to Jālandhara.134
Xuanzang, the seventh-century Chinese Buddhist scholar monk, who spent<br>
about fifteen years in Central Asia and India, reports that the Hephthalite Hun<br>
Mihirakula, who ruled in Kashmir early in the sixth century, destroyed many<br>
Buddhist foundations in Gandhāra, having resolved to extinguish Buddhism.135
He was evidently Śaiva in allegiance, since on his coins he had the bull and tri</li>

dent and the legend jayatu vr̥ṣa jayatu vr̥ṣadhvaja ‘Victory to the Bull! Victory to<br>
[Śiva,] who has the Bull as his emblem!’,136 and, according to Kalhaṇa, established<br>
a Liṅga of Śiva incorporating his name (Mihireśvara) in the capital.137 It should<br>
be noted, however, that Kalhaṇa says nothing of persecution of the Buddhists<br>
in particular but notes only that before the close of his life he had been a pitiless<br>
monster responsible for countless deaths.138
Xuanzang also reports the persecution of the Buddhists by the East Indian<br>
ruler Śaśāṇka (c. 603–619/20). He tells us that this king attacked the religion<br>
of Buddha, dispersed the Saṅgha, cut down the Bodhi tree, damaged the rock<br>
nearby that bore the Buddha’s footprints, and ordered that a Buddha image<br>
there should be replaced by an image of Śiva.139 He too was a devout worshipper<br>
of this deity (paramamāheśvaraḥ),140 and his gold coins show Śiva reclining on<br>
his bull.141

to the Buddhist Tantric Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa, probably not long after Gopāla’s</li>
<li>Stein 1979 on 1.289. To laud the bull (vr̥ṣaḥ) would be surprising if the intended meaning were the<br>
bull that is Śiva’s mount, but not if the word is intended in its figurative meaning, namely dharmaḥ or<br>
sukr̥tam ‘the virtuous actions [prescribed by the Veda].’ For this meaning of vr̥ṣaḥ see, for example,<br>
Amarasiṁha, Nāmaliṅgānuśāsana 1.4.25b (sukr̥taṁ vr̥ṣaḥ), 3.3.220 (sukr̥te vr̥ṣabhe vr̥ṣaḥ); Halāyudha,<br>

vr̥ṣaikaniṣṭhaḥ (‘devoted solely to pious observance’; in Śiva’s case ‘riding only on the Bull’) and he<br>
too was jitasmaraḥ (‘one who had defeated sensual urges’; in Śiva’s case ‘the defeater of the Love god<br>
Kāmadeva’). This is also the meaning of vr̥ṣaḥ in the title Vr̥ṣasārasaṁgraha, one of the works of the<br>

Sāmanta-Mahārāja Soma/Somadatta, the feudatory of Śaśāṇka recorded in an<br>
inscription of c. 620,143 destroyed Buddha images; had the Buddhist scriptures<br>
burned; obliterated Buddhist monasteries, assembly grounds, and Stūpas; and<br>
blocked their endowments.144
In the twelfth or thirteenth century an inscription from the royal town of<br>
Vodāmayūtā in Haryana praises a Saiddhāntika Śaiva ascetic from Aṇahi lapāṭaka called Varmaśiva who had been appointed head of the Śaiva Maṭha in<br>
Vodāmayūtā by the minister of the great-grandfather of the present ruler, relat
ing that when he had gone to the Deccan as a boy he had seen an image installed<br>
by the Buddhists and in his fury had by some mysterious means succeeded in<br>
carrying it off to a great distance.145
The Pallava Mahendravarman I (c. 610–630), originally a Jaina, is thought<br>
to have persecuted the Śaivas until he was converted to Śaivism by the Tamil<br>
poet-saint Appar.146 Appar declares himself a convert from Jainism and his po
etry, like that of his near contemporary Campantar, is full of vituperation both<br>
against his former co-religionists and the Buddhists.147 After his conversion from<br>
Jainism to Śaivism the Pāṇḍya king of Madurai is said to have had 8,000 Jainas<br>
impaled in revenge for an attempt to kill his Śaiva Guru Campantar.148 Whatever<br>
the degree of accuracy of this grotesque claim it is significant that this massacre is<br>
depicted in relief around the enclosure of the tank of the temple of Mīnākṣisund areśvara in Madurai and celebrated to this day in its festivals.149</li>

An inscription of c. 1200 at Ablūr, a Jaina stronghold in the Dharwar district<br>
of Karnataka,150 reports a conflict between Jainas and Śaivas towards the end of<br>
the twelfth century that culminated in the destruction of a Jaina temple and its<br>
image of the Jina and the construction in its place of the temple of Śiva Vīraso
manātha (/Someśvara) by the Śaiva zealot Ekāntada-Rāmayya; and inscriptions<br>
at Shravana Belgola and other places in Karṇāṭaka record that in 1368 the Jainas<br>
appealed successfully to the king of Vijayanagar for protection from persecution<br>
at the hands of Vaiṣṇavas.151
There is also an inscription of ad 1184 from Talikoti in the Mudehihal Taluk<br>
of Bijapur District on a pillar near the gateway of the fort, which records that the<br>
Gaṇas of the temple of Vīra-Bayseśvara established the glory of the god Śiva with<br>
supreme valour by destroying the Buddhist and Jaina religions, vanquishing the<br>
adherents of the rival faiths at many places near and far, demolishing Jaina tem
ples, and installing Liṅgas of Śiva.152 Nor was this kind of sectarian hatred limited<br>
to the south. In 1174, Ajayadeva, the Śaiva king of Gujarat who founded Ajmer, is<br>
said to have begun his reign with a severe persecution of the Jainas.153
There is also evidence of hostility between Śaivas and Vaiṣṇavas. An inscrip tion of 1160 at Tirukkaḍaiyūr rules that devotees of Śiva (Māheśvaras) associated<br>
with the temple there would forfeit their property to the temple if they mixed<br>
freely with Vaiṣṇavas.154 The South Indian Vaiṣṇava Yāmuna (c. 966/7 to 1038)<br>
is uncompromising in his view that the Śaiva faith is outside the pale of valid<br>
religion155 and that, against appearances, orthoprax Vaidika criticism of inner<br>
non-Vaidika practice applies only to Śaivism and not also to the Vaiṣṇava Pañ</li>

carātra; 156 and this view was not moderated by the later Vaiṣṇavas of southern<br>
India, who held firmly to the position that the Mantramārgic Śaivas and the<br>
Pāśupatas were infidels (avaidikāḥ, pāṣaṇḍinaḥ) the very sight of whom pol lutes.157 Then there is the Śrīvaiṣṇava hagiographical tradition of works such as<br>
the Divyasūricarita of Garuḍavāhana and the Yatirājavaibhava of Vaṭuka Nampi,<br>
according to which their teacher Rāmānuja had to flee because of persecution by<br>
the fanatically Śaiva Col˙a emperor, finding refuge in Karṇāṭaka, where he con verted the Jaina Hoysal˙a king Biṭṭideva to Vaiṣṇavism,158 and the tradition of the<br>
Divyasūricarita that the same king, or Kulottuṅga II (r. 1133–1150), according to<br>
his court poet Oṭṭakūttan, had an image of Viṣṇu removed from the front of the<br>
shrine of Śiva Naṭarāja in Cidambaram and thrown into the sea.159 Whatever the<br>
truth of this claim, it was strongly believed.160
Only accounts of religious persecution or killing of non-Buddhists by Bud
dhists are lacking in the Indian sources known to me.161 Their aggression, as far as<br>
I can tell at present, was limited in India to the provision of Mantras to be used<br>
to kill the enemies of Buddhism; 162 to narratives of the forcible humiliation of</li>
<li>Āgamaprāmāṇya, pp. 156–158.</li>

<li>Sastri 1984: pp. 300 and 644–645.
160.Finally, in 1539 Acyutarāya of Vijayanagara, a Vaiṣṇava like all the post-Saṅgama kings of this dy nasty, responded to this belief by founding the present shrine of Viṣṇu Govindarāja within the precincts<br>
of the temple, right beside the Citsabhā, the Śaivas’ holy of holies, ordaining that it should be wor
shipped according to the ritual of the Vaikhānasas (Younger 1995, pp. 111–112).</li>
<li>This is not the case in Tibet. In his Blue Annals (tr. Roerich 1995, p. 53) Gzhon nu dpal relates that<br>
the Buddhist monk Lha lung dpal gyi rdo rje assassinated Glang dar ma, the last king of the Yarlung<br>
dynasty, c. ad 842, to put an end to his persecution of Buddhism. For a colourful and no doubt fictional
ized account of the assassination, see Bsod nams rgyal tshan’s Rgyal rabs gsal ba’i me long (fourteenth<br>
century), tr. by Sørensen (1994), pp. 431–435. I merely cite the tradition. For there are grounds for<br>
doubting both Glang dar ma’s hostility to Buddhism and his assassination; see Yamaguchi 1996.</li>
